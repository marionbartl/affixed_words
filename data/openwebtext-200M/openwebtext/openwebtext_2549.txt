Ongoing global warming could persist far into the future , because natural processes require decades to hundreds of thousands of years to remove carbon dioxide from fossil - fuel burning from the atmosphere1, 2,3 .
Future warming may have large global impacts including ocean oxygen depletion and associated adverse effects on marine life , such as more frequent mortality events 4,5,6,7,8 , but long , comprehensive simulations of these impacts are currently not available .
Here we project global change over the next 100,000 years using a low - resolution Earth system model9 , and find severe , long - term ocean oxygen depletion , as well as a great expansion of ocean oxygen - minimum zones for scenarios with high emissions or high climate sensitivity .
We find that climate feedbacks within the Earth system amplify the strength and duration of global warming , ocean heating and oxygen depletion .
Decreased oxygen solubility from surface - layer warming accounts for most of the enhanced oxygen depletion in the upper 500 m of the ocean .
Possible weakening of ocean overturning and convection lead to further oxygen depletion , also in the deep ocean .
We conclude that substantial reductions in fossil - fuel use over the next few generations are needed if extensive ocean oxygen depletion for thousands of years is to be avoided .
Latvia continues its clamp down on BitTorrent trackers , as two more sites have been pulled offline by the local police .
Whether the attempts will prove effective is doubtful .
File.lv , Latvia 's largest BitTorrent tracker was taken down last summer but has since returned , despite an ongoing lawsuit .
A few months ago we reported that File.lv , Latvia ’s largest BitTorrent community went dark after a joint effort by the Latvian Economic Police and the IFPI - affiliated Latvian Music Producers Association , otherwise known as LAmpA .
While the site has since returned , local authorities continue their efforts to shut down further BitTorrent trackers .
Outlaw.lv , one of the largest trackers in Latvia is currently offline following pressure from the Economic Police , while rumors say that one of the top uploaders was detained for a few hours .
“ Economic Police has shut down our project .
Outlaw LV will be back in a new way and with a new mission , ” reads a message on the front page .
It is clear though that the authorities aim to take more sites offline .
Danger.lv is another tracker that has received a letter from the police , and they decided to pull the plug voluntarily , for the time being .
Similar to last summer , several other BitTorrent trackers became extra cautious after the renewed attention from the authorities .
Bithack.lv was one of the trackers that took action .
The site did n’t close however , but now serves recipes instead of torrent files .
TorrentFreak spoke with one admin of a local BitTorrent tracker , who informed us that they have also been receiving letters from anti-piracy organizations .
“ A handful of popular trackers are taking severe countermeasures to avoid any possibility of takedown and continue to serve the community for now , hoping that no takedowns will follow , ” he said .
As with many of the takedown attempts in other parts of the world , lobbyists from the entertainment industry are the ones tipping off the police , and assisting in ‘ evidence gathering ’ and even raids .
In Latvia it ’s LAmpA , but the BPI and IFPI have also been assisting the authorities , most notably with the raid on the popular music tracker OiNK .
Needless to say , these anti-piracy outfits are not the most objective partner when it comes to solving these type of digital ‘ offenses ’ , and it ’s worrisome to see how they appear to be increasingly intertwined with local authorities .
The Department of Defense ( DoD ) has launched Forge.mil , a software project management site that will host the military 's public open source software projects .
Inspired by SourceForge , the new site was created to accelerate development by facilitating broader collaboration between government agencies .
The DoD is a major proponent of the open development model and uses open source software extensively in the field .
With the aim of fostering broader military adoption of open source software , the DoD defined an Open Technology Development roadmap in 2006 in collaboration with the Open Source Software Institute .
In that report , the DoD discussed a wide range of issues that make open source software desirable for government adoption , including reduced risk of vendor lock - in , increased flexibility , greater interoperability , and reduced IT costs .
Another big step was taken last year when the annual defense budget reauthorization bill encouraged adoption of open source software solutions in several areas , including technology for veterans health services and unmanned aerial vehicles .
It marked the first time in history that the National Defense Authorization Act has explicitly articulated a preference for open source software .
The launch of an official open source project hosting site is another very logical step forward for the DoD and it demonstrates the department 's commitment to enabling collaborative open development .
The source code published on the site is visible to everyone , but only government developers can actually post code on it and commit changes .
Defense Information Systems Agency CTO
David Mihelcic announced the new site last week at a meeting of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association .
Development on the site began in October and the process of bringing it online began last month .
The site is currently down due to an unanticipated traffic overload that has followed the launch announcement .
The open source software community is clearly a lot more interested in the Web site than the DoD initially expected .
" It is really is SourceForge . net upgraded to meet DOD security requirements , " Mihelcic told Federal Computer Week .
" The open - source development model works for everybody . "
He also described several of the projects that were hosted on the site at launch .
One of them , for example , is a modified version of Bastille - - a powerful open source hardening tool that is used to automate the process of securing Linux - based computers .
Mihelcic expects to see 20 more projects added to the site within the next six months .
The Forge.mil launch is a nice step in the right direction , but there are obviously still kinks in the system that need to be worked out .
Scalability is clearly an issue , as evidenced by the site 's downtime following the post - launch traffic burst .
The Obama administration has shown some interest in expanding open source adoption within the government , so it 's possible that we could see other sites like Forge.mil emerge in the future .
( Newser ) – Chief Justice John Roberts ' first attempt at administering the presidential oath of office did n't go as swimmingly as the chief justice might have liked , reports the Wall Street Journal .
Roberts left out " faithfully " where the Founding Fathers wrote it — “ that I will faithfully execute the office of president to the United States ” — and instead stuck it at the end .

The confusion caused a little stutter - step in the administration of the 35 - word oath .
Obama did n't help matters by stepping over Roberts ' lines , notes Dahlia Lithwick in Slate .

Planum Boreum , Mar ’s north polar cap contains water ice “ of a very high degree of purity , ” according to an international study .
Using radar data from the SHARAD ( SHAllow RADar ) instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) , French researchers say the data point to 95 percent purity in the polar ice cap .
The north polar cap is a dome of layered , icy materials , similar to the large ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica , consisting of layered deposits , with mostly ice and a small amount of dust .
Combined , the north and south polar ice caps are believed to hold the equivalent of two to three million cubic kilometers ( 0.47 -0.72 million cu. miles ) of ice , making it roughly 100 times more than the total volume of North America ’s Great Lakes , which is 22,684 cu. kms ( 5,439 miles ) .
The study was done by researchers at France ’s National Institute of Sciences of the Universe ( Insu ) , using the Italian built SHARAD radar sounder on the US built MRO .
SHARAD looks for liquid or frozen water in the first few hundreds of feet ( up to 1 kilometer ) of Mars ’ crust by using subsurface sounding .
It can detect liquid water and profile ice .
Mars southern polar cap was once thought to be carbon dioxide ice , but ESA ’s Mars Express confirmed that it is composed of a mixture of water and carbon dioxide .
The study on Mars north polar cap appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , published by the American Geophysical Union .

( CNN ) --
Under fire from tens of thousands of users , the social networking site Facebook said early Wednesday it is reverting to its old policy on user information -- for now .
Backlash against Facebook began after a consumer advocate site flagged Facebook 's policy change .
The site posted a brief message on users ' home pages that said it was returning to its previous " Terms of Use " policy " while we resolve the issues that people have raised . "
The " Terms of Use " is the legalese tacked on to the bottom of most Web sites that details what the site 's owners can do with the information that users provide .
Facebook , the Web 's most popular social networking site , has been caught in a content - rights battle after revealing earlier this month that it was granting itself permanent rights to users ' photos , wall posts and other information even after a user closed an account .
The popular site allows users to create personal profiles where they can then connect with one another , upload photos and share links .
The site boasts more than 150 million active users .
Member backlash against Facebook began over the weekend after a consumer advocate Web site , The Consumerist , flagged a change made to Facebook 's policy earlier in the month .
The company deleted a sentence from the old Terms of Use .
That sentence said Facebook could not claim any rights to original content that a user uploaded once the user closed his or her account .
Do n't Miss Facebook faces furor over content rights
It replaced it with : " You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time .
... ( H ) owever , you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content . "
In response , Chris Walters wrote in the Consumerist post , " Make sure you never upload anything you do n't feel comfortable giving away forever , because it 's Facebook 's now . "
Thousands of indignant members either canceled their accounts or created online petitions .
Among them were more than 64,000 who joined a group called " The People Against the new Terms of Service . "
iReport.com : Too much information posted online ?
On Monday , Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg tried to quell the controversy by saying the company 's philosophy is that " people own their information and control who they share it with . "
But members were not appeased because the site did not fix its Terms of Use .
The company , in its post Wednesday , said it was returning to its previous Terms of Use because of the " feedback " it had received .
" As Mark expressed in his blog post on Monday , it was never our intention to confuse people or make them uneasy about sharing on Facebook , " company spokesman Barry Schnitt said in a blog post .
" I also want to be very clear that Facebook does not , nor have we ever , claimed ownership over people 's content .
Your content belongs to you . "
iReport.com : Your thoughts on Facebook 's about - face
Schnitt said the company is in the process of rewording its Terms of Use in " simple language that defines Facebook 's rights much more specifically . "
" Well that worked pretty fast , " wrote member Al Reford of Vancouver , British Columbia .
" Numbers count when giving feedback : ) "
And Shahrzad Grami of St. Paul , Minnesota , added : " YAYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!!
nice job guys !

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan put its forces on high alert after someone pretending to be India ’s foreign minister made a phone call to President Asif Ali Zardari threatening war after the Mumbai attacks began , Dawn newspaper said on Saturday .
Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari speaks at U.N. headquarters in New York in this September 26 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Eric
Thayer
“ It ’s true , ” a diplomat with knowledge of the exchanges told Reuters when asked whether the report was correct .
Dawn said the Nov. 28 caller threatened military action unless Pakistan acted immediately against the perpetrators of the slaughter in Mumbai , launched two days earlier .
For the next 24 hours nuclear - armed Pakistan ’s air force was put on “ highest alert ” as the military watched anxiously for any sign of Indian aggression , the report said .
Tensions have been running high since India blamed Islamist militants based in Pakistan for the three - day rampage in its financial capital , which killed 171 people .
“ War may not have been imminent , but it was not possible to take any chances , ” Dawn quoted a Pakistani official as saying .
WAR BY ACCIDENT ?
The episode triggered intense international diplomacy , with some world leaders fearing India and Pakistan could slip into an accidental war , the newspaper said .
Dawn said the caller , posing as Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee , also tried to telephone U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , but due to specific checks by U.S. officials the call was not put through .
According to Dawn , Rice called Mukherjee in the middle of the night to ask why he had adopted such a threatening tone , but he assured her that he had not spoken to Zardari .
Pakistan ’s senior envoy to Britain confirmed that Pakistan had feared an attack .
“ I got a call from some friend here in the government and he said the situation is pretty serious , Indians are threatening to go to war , ” High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan told the BBC in comments broadcast on World Service radio .
“ I again talked to the president and the president also confirmed that he had received a call , a threatening call , from India , ” he added .
Pakistan and India , which both became nuclear - armed states in 1998 , went to the brink of war in 2002 following a militant attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001 .
Mukherjee said his discussions with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , who was in New Delhi that day , had been cordial .
There were frantic phone calls between Washington , Islamabad and New Delhi to cool the temperature and by the evening of Nov. 29 , calm had been restored .
Dawn said Zardari ’s staff had bypassed usual verification checks for a call for the president , but the government said Zardari received the call after it was properly verified that it originated from India ’s Ministry of External Affairs .
“ It is not possible for any call to come through to the president without multiple caller identity verifications , ” Information Minister Sherry Rehman said in a statement .
“ In fact the identity of this particular call , as evident from the CLI ( caller ’s line identification ) device , showed that the call was placed from a verified official Phone Number of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs ” .
The newspaper said Indian officials had denied to U.S. counterparts that the call came from its ministry and said the number could have been manipulated .
HOURS OF UNCERTAINTY
It was during the hours of uncertainty that Pakistan rescinded its offer to send its Inter - Services Intelligence agency chief to India to help investigate the Mumbai attacks .
Senior Pakistani security officers referred to the aggressive tone taken by the Indian foreign minister in a briefing to journalists on Nov. 29 .
They warned , in a clear message to the United States , that if Pakistan felt threatened it would move troops from the Afghan border , where they are fighting Taliban and al Qaeda , to the Indian border and abandon the war on terrorism .
Indian and U.S. officials suspect the Lashkar - e - Taiba group was behind the Mumbai attack .
The jihadi organisation , which fights Indian rule in Kashmir , has had ties with Pakistani intelligence in the past and members have forged links with al Qaeda , according to security analysts .

While TomTom has had a functional turn - by - turn GPS application working in the lab since June last year , the " complicated issues " preventing a launch that Apple mentioned a couple of weeks later obviously have n't been sorted out - but that has n't stopped the xGPS team from bringing turn - by - turn to the iPhone and iPod touch in the form of a jailbreak app .
The app has been around for a while , but the upcoming 1.2 update is the first to add a voice engine in order to bring the oft asked for turn - by - turn functionality .
You can even use external GPS units to add the capability to a first - gen iPhone or iPod touch .
If you 're driving in areas with flaky or no data coverage , you can download and cache an area of the map before you head off .
Presumably this works over Wi-Fi for those of you with prohibitively expensive data charges or tiny data allowances .
Interested parties ( that 's probably all of you ) will be able to find xGPS 1.2 at the MMi Cydia repo later this month , possibly as early as February 20 .
If you need to jailbreak your phone first , check out PwnageTool or QuickPwn - safely ignoring the caveat regarding the 3G unlock , as Dev-Team changed their minds on that one with the release of yellowsn0w , the 3G unlock software .
One thing is for sure - Apple needs to take a good , hard look at whatever stopped " legit " developers bringing desirable , valuable functionality to the App Store table before hackers brought it to Cydia ... for free .

LAUSANNE , Switzerland , Feb. 3 ( UPI ) -- Marijuana use appears to have decreased among most European and North American adolescents from 2002 to 2006 , researchers in Switzerland said .
Emmanuel Kuntsche of the Swiss Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Drug Problems in Lausanne , Switzerland , and colleagues analyzed data from 93,297 15 - year - old students who participated in the Health Behavior in School - Aged Children study .

Study participants from 31 countries -- mostly in Europe and North America -- were surveyed in 2002 and again in 2006 about marijuana use and the number of evenings per week they usually spend out with their friends , among other topics .
The study , published in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , found marijuana use decreased in most countries , with the most significant declines in England , Portugal , Switzerland , Slovenia and Canada .
Increases were observed in Estonia , Lithuania , and Malta and among girls in Russian .
In addition , the number of evenings out with friends also declined in most countries , although there was a wide range in averages , from about one evening per week for Portuguese girls to more than three evenings per week among boys and girls in the Ukraine , Russia , Scotland , Estonia and Spain .
" The more frequently adolescents reported going out with their friends in the evenings , the more likely they were to report using cannabis , or marijuana , " the study authors said in a statement .

She 's being hailed as the " face of the economic crisis , " and now Henrietta Hughes has become something of a media star after reaching out to President Obama in an emotional plea for help .
President Obama talks to Henrietta Hughes at a town hall rally in Fort Myers , Florida , on Tuesday .
Her message :
My son and I are homeless , and we need immediate help .
" I have an urgent need , unemployment and homelessness , a very small vehicle for my family and I to live in , " Hughes told Obama Tuesday at a town hall rally in Fort Myers , Florida , as he pushed for passage of his stimulus plan in the Senate .
" The housing authority has two years waiting lists , and we need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to .
We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom .
Please help . "
Hughes said she had been homeless after her son lost his job and , subsequently , their home .
Although her son has been looking for work , Hughes says , so far , no luck .
The Fort Myers - Cape Coral area -- in heavily Republican Lee County , which went for GOP presidential nominee John McCain in the 2008 election -- has seen record housing foreclosure rates .
Watch CNN's Ed Hornick discuss the story »
According to the White House , the area had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation last year , with 12 percent of housing units receiving a foreclosure - related notice .
Median housing prices in the Fort Myers metropolitan area have plummeted from $ 322,000 in December 2005 to less than $ 107,000 in December 2008 , the Obama administration notes .
And nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost in Fort Myers in the past year .
The president offered Hughes a kiss on the cheek and a promise : " We 're going to do everything we can to help you , but there are a lot of people like you . "
Watch more of Hughes ' emotional plea to Obama »
Some questioned the circumstances of Hughes ' appearance at the event .
Blogger Michelle Malkin , in a story on the conservative Web site TownHall.com on Wednesday , said that if Hughes " had more time , she probably would have remembered to ask Obama to fill up her gas tank , too . "
" The soul - fixer dutifully asked her name , gave her a hug and ordered his staff to meet with her .
Supporters cried , ' Amen ! ' and ' Yes ! ' " she added .
One reader questioned Hughes ' motives and asked how the homeless woman got to the rally at all .
" How does a 61 - year - old homeless woman who 's living in a pickup truck with her son JUST HAPPEN to get a ticket so she can VERY PUBLICALLY ask Prez.
Obama for a HOUSE ?
Anyone ?
Who pushes her up on stage ?
She 's right at the front of the crowd .
Did she just happen to get a seat there ? " asked reader Erik E .
In Fort Myers , a city of about 60,000 , people began lining up for tickets to the Obama event over the weekend .
Many camped out overnight , with tents and sleeping bags springing up near the front door , and all tickets were given away in less than an hour .
White House spokesman Joshua Earnest said Wednesday that after she spoke , the administration connected Hughes -- who did not vote in the 2008 election because she did n't have a home -- with local housing officials , who happened to be in the crowd .
On Wednesday , the head of the local housing authority , Marcus Goodson , said he met with Hughes .
He said he 's working on finding her a housing unit with a shorter waiting time and that he 's emailed a White House staff member with the update .
But it was n't just officials reaching out .
Chene Thompson -- the wife of state Rep. Nicholas Thompson , R - Fort Myers -- offered Hughes and her son a house in nearby La Belle rent - free , according to a spokeswoman , and she is interested in taking it .
" Basically , I offered Ms. Hughes and her son the opportunity to stay in my home rent - free for as long as they need to , " Thompson told WBBH - TV in Fort Myers .
" I 'm not a millionaire , I 'm not rich , but this is what I can do for someone if they need it . "
Hughes will check out the house in the coming days , according to Thompson 's office .
In the meantime , she has set up shop in the district office where she gave media interviews .
And help for the woman whose story touched the president keeps pouring in .
A Web site , HenriettaHughes.com , was set up featuring video clips of the homeless woman at the rally and information about her plight .
The site hails her as " the face of the economic crisis . "
The owner of the site said Hughes has " brought to [ light ] the homeless [ an ] unemployment problem we have in the United States . "
" As a local southwest Florida resident , I have seen countless stories like Henrietta's .
I wanted to take this opportunity to promote awareness of our plight on a national level .
If you as equally concerned as I am , please bookmark this site and sign up for updates , " the owner wrote on the site .

And Fort Myers Mayor Jim Humphrey , a Republican , said Wednesday that his " community has responded " to Hughes ' story .
" I even received a phone call from a lady in Ocala wanting to offer her $ 50 a month , so what we 're seeing is , this should be a nonpartisan issue , " he said .
Watch Humphrey discuss Hughes ' story »
Linda Bergthold , a health policy expert , wrote on the liberal blog HuffingtonPost.com that it was a touching moment that highlighted a community coming together .
" It would have been interesting had Obama turned to the crowd and asked anyone who had a solution for Henrietta to step forward afterwards .
But he did n't have to .
People came forward anyway , " she wrote Wednesday .
" The dilemma Ms. Hughes described is not limited to her .
...
Her request was a compelling one and it only highlights issues of homelessness that will surely get worse as the economic downturn deepens . "

When male police officers need to de-stress , they might trade war stories — but likely not with their female colleagues .
But the guys do n’t necessarily have it easy .
They are often discouraged from showing emotion when dealing with stress and are expected to uphold the overtly masculine idea of what it means to be a police officer .
Research by a Kansas State University professor has found that the different ways in which men and women in the police force deal with stress may actually cause them more stress .
Don Kurtz , an assistant professor of social work at K - State , studied the gender differences in stress and burnout among police officers .
The work was published in the journal Feminist Criminology in 2008 , http://tinyurl.com/c2p2et
He said it is the first of his research that has examined gender .
While completing his doctorate at K - State , Kurtz said he was taking classes on gender and society and was researching police stress .
He noticed that there was no research studying the intersection of these two areas .
“ I had come from working in social work , where they were very accepting of men in the women - dominated field , ” Kurtz said .
“ In policing , they tend to be suspicious of the abilities of women in the field . ”
For the research published in Feminist Criminology , Kurtz looked at data from a survey of officers in the Baltimore Police Department .
As a follow up to this part of the research , Kurtz also interviewed officers from three police departments .
He found that male and female police officers have different sources of stress and different ways of dealing with it .
“ Telling war stories is almost exclusively a male endeavor , ” Kurtz said .
“ It ’s quite often in a group social setting , and officers talk about stressful events that happened .
What ’s interesting is that they remove the fear and emotion that go along with it and replace it with these superhuman qualities . ”
“ I found that women felt excluded from war stories .
If they started exaggerating the stories in the way that men did , they could be questioned .
So it becomes a male - only way of managing stress . ”
In the journal article , Kurtz suggests that in some ways women have a better chance to deal with violent cases because it ’s more acceptable for women to be upset or vulnerable .
“ For male officers to show emotion , it was career suicide , ” he said .
Some of the cases that men find the most stressful , Kurtz said , were likely to be given to women .
“ One thing I found interesting was that when officers discuss the most stressful things , it ’s usually death of a child or the physical or sexual abuse of a child , ” he said .
“ Women are more likely to handle these jobs because large police departments often assign women to these investigative units .
However , it ’s often seen as lower police work .
In large departments where there area lot of juvenile delinquents and child abuse cases , there ’s an idea that women are better at managing kids . ”
One of the biggest differences Kurtz found was the role that family played in police officers ’ stress .
Whereas a family life can help male officers deal better with stress from the job , women may not have the same support in their own families .
“ Women settle into the role of caretaker and come home to a second shift , ” Kurtz said .
The strange hours of police work can be seen as more acceptable for men than women , he said .
“ Although family conflicts can be distressful for men , the fact that a male officer is seen as the breadwinner makes it more OK for him to miss a birthday party , for example , so he can go to work . ”
Kurtz also looked at how race changes the stress differences between men and women .
“ We should expect a difference , ” he said .
“ In American society , race complicates everything . ”
For instance , white female officers are more likely to be sexualized , whereas black female officers are often seen as laborers .
And , while black male officers report lower levels of stress than white men , they also report a higher rate of burnout .
Kurtz said he hopes his research will help police departments better understand how gender affects stress and that it will spur further academic study in this area .
Right now I ’m watching the second episode , where it begins with lie detectors and how they ’re little better than holding a West African Egg .
In West Africa anyone suspected of a crime was made to hand a bird ’s egg to another person .
Anyone who broke the egg would be considered guilty , based on their nervousness .
In ancient China suspects were told to hold a handful of rice in their mouths during a prosecutor ’s argument .
The suspect was considered guilty if , by the end of that argument , the rice stayed dry — because salivation was believed to cease in times of anxiety .
And all bogus as a lie detector .
Welcome to the Sixty - Fourth Edition of Encephalon , a neuroscience and psychology blog carnival .
I ’d be lying if I told you I did n’t procrastinate just a bit on writing this post …
I was hoping that a “ Darwinian Presidential Valentine Encephalon for Paraskavedekatriaphobics ” theme might emerge from the large number of submissions , but it did not .
So without further ado , let us tally no longer , onward and upward ..... hey , stop procrastinating !
Doctor Spurt at Effortless Incitement advises us to be concrete in order to achieve a distant goal in Construal Level and Procrastination .
Construal - level theory holds that “ events that are distant in time tend to be represented more abstractly than are events that are close in time . ”
To test how this idea might relate to procrastination , McCrea et al. ( 2008 ) distributed questionnaires to be returned at a later date .
Those with questions that were framed in more abstract terms ( e.g. , “ what characteristics are implied by opening a bank account ? ” ) were returned at a more laggardly rate than those with more concrete requirements ( “ how do you go about opening a bank account ? ” ) .
Would I lie to you about lie detection ?

Cat reviews the new TV show , , and likes what she sees so far :
Speaking of lying and reviews , individuals with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are notoriously incapable of detecting deceit from another person ’s facial expression , body language , or tone of voice .
They are also unlikely to deceive other people , although some with ASD ( autistic savants ) show remarkable abilities in other realms .
Arj from ** Science On Tap ** reviews Daniel Tammet ’s new book
Autistic savant Daniel Tammet 's first book , " Born On A Blue Day " was an international best - seller as an engaging autobiographical overview of his fascinating life and talents .
His new book , " Embracing The Wide Sky " is a more scientific look at the way his mind works , and provocatively covers a range of cognitive issues .
Tammet 's perspective is utterly unique , as an articulate , thoughtful savant who can introspectively analyze his own mind workings .
Synesthesia , a " neurologically based phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic , involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway , " is not uncommon in people with ASD .
Tammet discusses his own synesthesic percepts , which include numbers that have color and texture , or shape .
Mo from Neurophilosophy discusses a new study establishing that synesthesia has a genetic component .
Prior research assumed that the condition might be X - linked ( because it affects more females than males ) and transmitted by a single gene .
But the truth is more complex , as usual :
Researchers from the University of Oxford have now conducted the first genome - wide search for genes linked to the condition .
In the American Journal of Human Genetics , they report the identification of a number of genes that are likely to be involved in auditory - visual synaesthesia , in which sounds are perceived as colours .
The study reveals also that synaesthesia is not X - linked , and that the genetics of this form of synaesthesia - and probably that of other forms - is far more complex than previously thought .
Jane Mackay painted “ Tchaikovsky ’s First Piano Concerto ” to create a synesthetic composition that bridges the gap between sight and sound .
Interestingly , one of the chromosomal regions identified in the Oxford study contains a gene associated with autism .
Sandeep Gautam from
The Mouse Trap has written about the existence of a continuum between autism and schizophenia in the past .
A " dueling parental genes " version of this hypothesis was featured in a Nature essay last year and received coverage in the New York Times .
Sandy ’s current submission covers Psychosis and Salience dysregulation .
According to this view , the neurotransmitter dopamine is involved in assigning salience and motivational significance to internal and external events .
Excessive dopamine release in schizophrenia can result in an aberrant emphasis on internal representations ( thoughts , perceptions , memories ) relative to external sensory stimuli in the environment .
Jim van
Os goes even further , arguing for the end of “ schizophrenia ” as a diagnostic entity and the beginning of “ salience dysregulation syndrome . ”
Most would agree that that the DSM - IV label “ schizophrenia ” can refer to quite different disorders .
However , this new scheme suffers from its own categorical limitations ( in my opinion ) because salience dysregulation syndrome ( van Os , 2009 ) can manifest ...
with affective expression ( high in mania / depression dimension ) ; with developmental expression ( high in developmental cognitive deficit / negative symptoms ) ; and not otherwise specified .

If cocaine was rewarding WITHOUT increasing DA levels in the brain , the dopamine theory of addiction was wrong , and a bunch of scientists were going to have to stop going to things like " dopamine dinners " and " the international conference on dopamine " .

potentially
[ Arai et al. , 2009 ] measured a trait known as long - term potentiation ( LTP ) , wherein a synapse fires in a longer and stronger fashion .
This type of potentiation is thought to be a basic mechanism that neural networks use in learning and memory formation .
In their paper , the team found that certain synapses in the hippocampus were potentiated when animals were exposed to an “ enriched ” environment ( normally mice are caged in empty bins lined with woodchips , but an enriched environment is one filled with tunnels , hidden passages , toys , ropes to climb & other stuff to discover and learn about ) .
The team shows that , in response to an enriched environment , the mice acquire the LTP trait .
The next thing the team found was that the offspring of female ( but not male ) mice that had acquired the LTP trait - did also show the LTP trait - even when they , themselves , did not experience the enriched environment .
Thus , the so - called acquired trait ( LTP ) was inherited by the offspring .
Hmmmm - sounds a bit Lamarckian to me , or , as the authors of this research article suggest , “ Lamarckian - like ” .
Is this a case that violates core tenets of the modern synthesis ?
Does it besmirch Darwin on his 200th birthday ?
‘ the development of a person is like a cloth that appears to us to be grey but it ’s composed of infinitely tiny black threads - biology - infinitely tiny white threads - experience - but you do n’t see any black and white threads , all you see is the grey cloth . ’
A person is that cloth and it ’s combined of both and to ask which is more important is like asking about a Christmas blizzard - which is more important the temperature or the humidity ?
The answer is they are both important . ”

2 ) Acupuncture lacks a plausible mechanism 3 ) Claims for efficacy are often based upon a bait - and - switch deception 4 ) Clinical trials show that acupuncture does not work
... depending on whether certain “ thresholds ” for the various dimensional components are exceeded .
But dopamine can be fun too !
Yay !
But not for the mouse that could n't get high .
Boo .
At Neurotopia , Scicurious comments on the latest paper about the dopamine transporter knockout mouse ( DAT - KO ) and the rewarding and reinforcing effects of cocaine .
DAT recycles dopamine ( DA ) from the synapse back into the neuron , so the DAT - KO mice have an excess of DA hanging around their synapses .
However , earlier studies found that DAT - KO miceself - administer cocaine … gasp !
The current crop of DAT - KO mice was different , although it ’s not clear why .
Could it be that different stem cells were used to create each mouse line ??
I ’m going to the next “ dopamine dinner ” to find out .

Hacks asks ,
Do antidepressant work just because they make you hungry ?
What heshould have asked is " Do antipsychotics work just because they make you hungry ? " , because the drugs in question include olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) and clozapine ( Clozaril ) , which are atypical antipsychotics .
These are well - known for causing significant weight gain , and one mechanism for this might involve increases in ghrelin , a hormone that stimulates appetite .
Many of the atypicals are already in use for treating bipolar disorder , but they are not at all typical ( yet ) for unipolar depression .
In November 2007 , the FDA approved aripiprazole ( Abilify ) as an add - on medication for unremitting depression ( meaning , the patients were already taking an antidepressant drug but were still depressed ) .
Moving into the topic of conventional antidepressant drugs , one proposed mechanism of action is through neurogenesis , or the growth of new neurons , in the hippocampal region of the medial temporal lobe ( specifically , the dentate gyrus field ) .
Andy from BrainsLab.net discusses the enhancement of neurogenesis in adulthood resulting from exposure to an enriched environment .
Another route to increased neurogenesis involves conditioned responses in hippocampal - dependent learning tasks .
Since the hippocampus is a critical for learning and memory , do these new neurons contribute to an improvement in these tasks ?
That does seem to be the case .
But is altered neuroplasticity a cause or an effect of major depression ?
Although neurogenesis has been seen as the “ next new thing ” to explain the efficacy of antidepressant drugs , this view is not controversy .
Another proposed contributor to the etiology of mood disorders ( especially bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder ) is dysregulation of circadian rhythms .
For an overview , Lithium , Circadian Clocks and Bipolar Disorder ( and anything else on the subject by Coturnix of A Blog Around The Clock fame ) is a good place to start .
One current submission from Amiya Sarkar ( of Physiology Physics Woven Fine ) reviews the Molecular Basis of Genetic Switch In The Circadian Clock Continuing with the general theme of mental health , Sandra Kiume presents Suicide Hashtag Livetweeting .

In addition , Robert Sylwester from SharpBrains provides a helpful lay overview of this study in A Love affair Across Generations : A Lamarckian Reincarnation ?
He takes up the environmental enrichment angle , notes the contributions of pioneering researchers ( i.e. , Dr. Marian C. Diamond and Dr. William T. Greenough ) , and concludes with the importance of this work for educators .
These results provide our second example of neuroplasticity resulting from environmental enrichment ( e.g. , “ exposure to novel objects , elevated social interactions and voluntary exercise ” ) in rodents .
What about neuroplasticity in humans ?
What constitutes effective " environmental enrichment " ?
The " brain training " industry is big business now .
Rats are n't susceptible to overbearing marketing tactics or the placebo effect , so how do you separate the help from the hype ?
Two recent papers are of interest here .
The first did a meta - analysis of studies examining the effects of brain training programs in healthy elderly participants ( Papp et al. , 2009 ) .
The authors concluded that the cognitive interventions were n't very effective .
The second paperreported modest benefits in auditory memory / attention from engaging in a particular computerized training program ( Smith et al. , 2009 ) .
In Brain Training : It Works , and It Does n't Work , Alvaro Fernandez discusses the IMPACT study and suggests we move beyond simplistic notions that such training programs are either magic bullets or completely bogus .

The inevitable nature / nurture question arises during the course of the interview .
Is who we are determined more by experience or biology ?
“ Why does this question persist ? ” is my own reply to the query .
I think it is a false dichotomy , as do most reasonable contemporary scientists .
As Kagan explains : Doc uses this viewpoint as a segue to his discuss own experience as a pediatric neurologist .
Although I am much more of a reductionist , he does provide an interesting perspective on the acceptance of ambiguity in clinical practice .

Advances in the History of Psychology returns to our carnival after a long absence .
Jeremy Burman has submitted a quartet of posts to prevent Encephalon readers from slipping into an ahistoric stupor .

L’Express has dubbed ‘ la guerre des psys ’…
The French media widely discussed a controversial 2004 report by INSERM , Psychothérapie , trois approches évalués , which found psychoanalysis ineffective in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression , and vaunted the benefits of cognitive behaviour therapy .
An exciting new resource is now available online !

Another historical post is provided by Providentia .
In Shooting Dr. Tourette , we learn that the prominent French neurologist ( the eponym of Tourette 's syndrome ) was shot in the back of the neck by a former patient :
Rose maintained that Tourette and the other Salpetriere doctors had hypnotized her against her will and her defense attorney even argued that the hypnosis had somehow caused the shooting .
Following a sensational trial , the judge eventually ruled that hypnosis had nothing to do with Rose Kamper 's actions and she was declared insane .
Although Dr. Tourette recovered physically from the shooting , the emotional impact would linger .
Rose Kamper 's testimony and the heavy newspaper coverage of the trial damaged his professional reputation .
Despite his fame as a physician and numerous honours , Gilles de la Tourette 's condition began deteriorating with fluctuating episodes of depression , mania and mental confusion .

Via : Latin American Herald Tribune :
General Motors plans to invest $ 1 billion in Brazil to avoid the kind of problems the U.S. automaker is facing in its home market , said the beleaguered car maker .
According to the president of GM Brazil - Mercosur , Jaime Ardila , the funding will come from the package of financial aid that the manufacturer will receive from the U.S. government and will be used to “ complete the renovation of the line of products up to 2012 . ”
“ It would n’t be logical to withdraw the investment from where we ’re growing , and our goal is to protect investments in emerging markets , ” he said in a statement published by the business daily Gazeta Mercantil .
Meanwhile , he cut the company ’s revenue forecast for this year by 14 % to $ 9.5 billion from $ 11 billion , as the economic crisis began to cause rapid slowdowns in sales .
GM already announced three programs of paid leave , and Ardila added that GM Brazil “ is going to wait and see how the market behaves in order to know what decision to take ” with regard to possible layoffs .
For Ardila , the injection in Brazil ’s automobile sector of 8 billion reais ( $ 3.51 billion ) recently announced by the federal and state governments of Sao Paulo “ has already begun to revive sales , ” which fell by 12 % in October .
The executive said that the company will operate a “ conservative ” scenario in 2009 with an estimated production of 2.6 million units , and another more “ optimistic ” that contemplates sales of 2.9 million .
This year sales will reach 2.85 million vehicles , which represents a growth of 15 % over last year .

Advertisement A woman who had two children by her own father has spoken of her ordeal .
The woman , known only as Miss D , fell pregnant with a girl after being raped by her father when she was 16 .
She also gave birth to a boy seven years later .
Her father threatened to shoot her if she told anyone the children were his .
Miss D's father is due to be sentenced in court on Tuesday after being convicted last month of abusing Miss D and her two sisters .
The 72 - year - old , who cannot be named , abused his three daughters in Dundee and Fife between 1976 and 1993 .
During a week - long trial at the High Court in Edinburgh in December , the jury heard how the man began the systematic rape of Miss D , his oldest daughter , in 1979 when she was aged 12 .
He had a shotgun and he put me onto the ground and he told me that if I told my mum he would shoot me and say it was an accident
Miss D
He also raped a younger daughter when she was aged between eight and 16 , and was further convicted of using lewd and libidinous behaviour towards a third daughter on repeated occasions between 1979 and 1982 .
He was brought to justice after his now - adult victims contacted the police , and he was convicted after the week - long trial .
In an interview with BBC Scotland , Miss D - who is now aged in her early 40s and lives in Aberdeenshire - described how her father only stopped abusing her in the early 1990s .
She said : " I was 12 years old and my mother had gone into an ambulance to go and have my baby brother .
" My dad came into the bedroom and he asked me to come into his bed .
It was in the early hours of the morning and I thought it was so strange .
" Then he popped me onto the bed and he raped me .
He told me that I was to say nothing to my mum . "
Later on the same morning , after her siblings had gone to school , Miss D was again raped by her father .
DNA tests
She recalled : " Two months later he took me shooting - he had a shotgun and he put me onto the ground and he told me that if I told my mum he would shoot me and say it was an accident . "
Miss D fell pregnant with her daughter at 16 but had a boyfriend who she assumed was the father .
It was not until the recent court case that DNA tests revealed it was actually her own father who was responsible .
She gave birth to her son when she was 23 but this time knew it was her father 's child because she was not in a relationship .
" He said that it was n't his and I was whoring about .
I said ' I have n't got a boyfriend so it has got to be yours ' , " Miss D said .
" He said to me that if I let anybody know , my daughter would be taken from me , my son would be taken from me as well .
" Also my brother and my sisters would be taken from the family because they would go to jail and the family would be broken up and I would get the blame of breaking up a family . "
Miss D only found out two years ago that her younger sisters had also been abused by their father .
She claimed their mother knew about the abuse in 1984 , but did not do anything about it .
I am just hoping that I can go on with the rest of my life and be happy
Miss D
The abuse only stopped in the early 1990s when Miss D was in a steady relationship .
It was two years ago , in the heat of a family argument , that she told her 16 - year - old son who his father was .
She said : " He could n't believe it and he just had a cry .
I left him sobbing - I should have given him a cuddle but I was shocked I had said this and I just went to the police station and reported it . "
Describing her feelings towards her mother , Miss D added : " She should have come and spoken to us when he was found guilty .
" I was hoping for her to come over and say to me and my sisters ' I am so sorry this has happened ' and maybe just have put an arm around us and given us a cuddle , but no .
" She never did that .
She was just interested in him .
She stands by him to this day . "
Miss D said it was her children that had given her the remarkable resilience and strength she had needed to get through her ordeal .
She added : " My children have given me the strength .
I can speak to people now about it when I could n't speak before about it .
" I am just hoping that I can go on with the rest of my life and be happy - that I can get some grandchildren and be happy , just like any other mature woman . "
Miss D urged any child who is being abused to go and speak to a teacher or another adult .
She said : " Speak to somebody that you trust and tell them - do not sit in silence , because I did for years . "

Many conservatives are up in arms regarding the charge that President - elect Barack Obama may not have been born in the United States and is , therefore , not qualified under the U.S. Constitution to be President of the United States .
Article .
II .
Section .
1 . of the U.S. Constitution states , " No Person except a natural born Citizen , or a Citizen of the United States , at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the Office of President . . . . "
Some accuse Mr. Obama of not being born in the State of Hawaii as claimed , but in Kenya , Africa .
Several people have filed various lawsuits challenging Mr. Obama 's U.S. citizenship .
Historically , " natural born Citizen " has always been understood to mean someone born in the United States of America .
If Barack Obama was not born in the United States , he is absolutely unqualified to be President .
Hawaii 's secretary of state says Obama was indeed born in that state .
However , to date , Obama 's actual birth certificate has not been publicly released , which only serves to add fuel to the accusations that he was not born in Hawaii .
Many conservatives seem to be obsessed with this controversy , calling it a " constitutional crisis . "
The fact is , however , we have been in a " constitutional crisis " for years !
The problem is , most conservatives only get worked up over a potential abridgement of constitutional government when it serves their partisan political purposes .
In other words , when a Democrat appears guilty of constitutional conflict , conservatives " go ballistic , " but when Republicans are equally culpable of constitutional conflict , they yawn with utter indifference .
For example , the one man who has the notoriety and political clout to actually bring about some meaningful investigation and resolution to the Obama citizenship brouhaha is none other than Senator John McCain .
After all , he was Obama 's principal opponent in the race for the White House .
Plus , as the standard - bearer for the only other major political party , he has the attention of the national media , as well as the national legislative and judicial branches of government .
So , why is John McCain not at all interested in the Obama citizenship issue ?
Perhaps one reason that John McCain is so uninterested in where Barack Obama was born is because he , John McCain , was not born in the United States .
He was born in the country of Panama .
So , let me ask readers a question :
Does anyone believe if John McCain had been elected President instead of Barack Obama that any notable conservative would have been distressed about a " constitutional crisis " ?
Get real !
Yes , I know McCain was born to a naval officer serving in Panama at the time .
That fact changes nothing .
John McCain was still born in a foreign country , and under a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution , is not qualified to be President of the United States .
Even our current State Department policy ( 7 FAM 1100 ) reads : " Despite widespread popular belief , U.S. military installations abroad and U.S. diplomatic or consular facilities are not part of the United States within the meaning of the 14th Amendment .
A child born on the premises of such a facility is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and does not acquire U.S. citizenship by reason of birth . "
Does anyone not remember the controversy surrounding the potential Presidential campaign of California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
Born in Austria , Schwarzenegger is a naturalized citizen of the United States and is now Governor of California .
However , since Schwarzenegger is a naturalized citizen , but not a natural born citizen , he is considered unqualified to run for President .
But , again , most conservatives care little about the Constitution 's requirement that a President be a " natural born Citizen . "
Like liberals , most conservatives are afflicted with a very debilitating disease that I call Selective Constitutionalism .
They only want to apply constitutional government when it helps Republicans or hurts Democrats .
Most of them really could not care less about adherence to the Constitution .
If they did , they would have been up in arms for the last eight years as President George W. Bush repeatedly ignored -- and even trampled -- the U.S. Constitution .
Where were these " constitutional " conservatives when George W. Bush was assuming dictatorial - style powers and contravening Fourth Amendment prohibitions against warrantless searches and seizures ?
Where were they when Bush was ordering our emails , letters , and phone calls to be intercepted by federal police agencies without court oversight ?
Where were they when Bush was obliterating the Fifth and Eighth Amendments ?
Where were they when Bush overturned Posse Comitatus by Executive Order ?
Where were they when Bush dismantled the constitutional right of Habeas Corpus ?
Where were they when Bush lied to the American people about the invasion of Iraq and took the United States to war without a Declaration of War from Congress ?
Where were conservatives when Bush turned nine U.S. military installations over to the United Arab Emirates ?
Where were they when Bush ordered his Department of Transportation to open up America 's airlines to foreign ownership ?
Where were they when President Bush nullified ( using " signing statements " ) over 1,100 statutes he did not like ?
Where were they as President Bush and his fellow Republicans reauthorized one of the most egregiously unconstitutional pieces of legislation in modern memory : the USA Patriot Act ?
Where were they when Bush signed the blatantly unconstitutional McCain / Feingold Act ?
I could go on and on .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Republican Party has been just as culpable in violating constitutional government as the Democrat Party has -- maybe more so !
If the Republican and Democrat parties had any allegiance to the U.S. Constitution , neither John McCain nor Barack Obama would have been chosen as their respective Presidential nominees .
While we are on the subject , if anyone cared about constitutional government , Hillary Clinton ( or any other U.S. Senator or House Member ) would obviously be determined as ineligible to be given any appointment in the Obama administration under Article .
I. Section .
6 . of the U.S. Constitution .
Why ?
Because the Constitution prohibits House or Senate members taking Presidential posts if the salary of the job they would take was raised while they were in Congress .
However , several past Presidents have skirted this constitutional prohibition ( including Presidents Taft , Nixon , and Carter ) by lowering the salary of the job back to what it was so the nominee could accept the job without receiving the pay increase that was approved while the appointee was in Congress .
In fact , this sleight of hand actually has a political name .
It is called " the Saxbe fix , " after Nixon 's appointment of Senator William Saxbe to be attorney general .
Do we have a " constitutional crisis " ?
You bet we do ; but it is not limited to Barack Obama or the Democrat Party .
The real constitutional crisis is the manner in which the American people have , for years , allowed civil magistrates from both major parties to routinely violate their oaths to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States .
God help us !

President - elect Barack Obama has asked V. Gene Robinson , the openly gay Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire , to deliver the invocation at an inaugural event on Sunday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial .
Gay rights advocates saw the move as a way to compensate for Mr. Obama ’s decision to give the Rev. Rick Warren , a prominent megachurch pastor from California who opposes same - sex marriage , the high - profile role of delivering the invocation at the inauguration next week .
Bishop Robinson advised Mr. Obama on gay rights issues during the campaign .
He is the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church , and his consecration in 2003 set off a growing rift in that church ’s parent body , the Anglican Communion .
Since then , Bishop Robinson has become an internationally known spokesman for gay rights  a hero to some and an object of scorn to others .
In a telephone interview on Monday , Bishop Robinson said that he believed his inclusion in inaugural events had been under consideration before the controversy erupted over Mr. Warren but that Mr. Obama and his team were also seeking to heal the pain that Mr. Warren ’s selection had caused among lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender advocates .
Public displays of affection and sex are still largely taboo in India A court in India has dismissed criminal proceedings against a married couple charged with obscenity for allegedly kissing in public in the capital .
The Delhi high court judge wondered how an " expression of love by a young married couple " could attract an obscenity charge .
Police arrested the couple - a 28 - year - old man and a 23 - year - old woman - for kissing near a station last September .
Public displays of affection are still largely taboo in India .
The police in Delhi had begun criminal proceedings against the couple for " sitting in an objectionable position near a metro ( railway station ) pillar and kissing due to which passersby were feeling bad " .
The maximum punishment for committing an " obscene act " is three months in prison .
Judge S Muralidhar quashed the criminal proceedings .
He said that even if police reports were accurate " it is inconceivable how ... an expression of love by a young married couple would attract an offence of obscenity and trigger the coercive process of law " .
The judge expressed surprise that the couple had been picked up and charged by police despite officers being told that they were married .
Controversies Reports say the couple denied in their petition to the court they were kissing .
They said they were taking self portraits on their mobile phones .
Richard Gere sparked protests in India after he kissed Shilpa Shetty
The lawyer who contested the case for the couple told a Delhi newspaper : " Obscenity charges are attracted when an act is so obscene that it encourages depravity or annoys the public .
" In this case both these contents are missing , because the charge sheet is silent on any passersby as originally claimed . "
Kissing in public in India has triggered controversies in the past .
In 2007 , Hollywood actor Richard Gere sparked protests in India after kissing Celebrity Big Brother winner and Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty at an Aids awareness rally in Delhi .
The protesters said Gere had insulted Indian culture by kissing the hand and face of the actress .
In 2005 , a court in Rajasthan imposed a fine of $ 22 on an Israeli couple for kissing after getting married in a traditional Hindu ceremony in Pushkar .
Priests were offended when the couple kissed and hugged during the chanting of religious verses .
In 2004 , Bollywood film star Kareena Kapoor began legal proceedings against a tabloid newspaper that published photos of her kissing her co-star .
She and Shahid Kapoor said the photos were doctored and were not of them .

BEIJING — Oakley Qiao had every reason to feel confident when he began his job hunt last September .
He was a student at one of China ’s top graduate business schools .
He already had a few years of work experience .
Students applying for jobs at the same time the previous year had gotten two or three offers by the winter , sometimes for a starting salary 20 times the average Chinese annual income .
But on Tuesday , Mr. Qiao walked away empty - handed from the campus of Peking University to take a train northeast to his frigid hometown .
Most of his 100 classmates are in the same straits on the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday , which begins Monday , even though the school had invited recruiters to the campus every week since the fall .
Mr. Qiao said he had handed out résumés to more than 50 companies .
“ Everyone ’s anxious , ” he said as he sat in a campus cafe the day before leaving .
“ The companies who come to the job fairs , they just come to give presentations , not to offer jobs . ”
Lotteries , now run by most of our 50 states , are disguised forms of taxation that fall most heavily on those least able to pay .
In today ’s economic crisis , state leaders face rising resistance to taxation from everyone .
Therefore , many of them plan to expand lotteries even more , hoping that no one realizes they represent a kind of masked tax .
In the elegant words of conservative South Carolina State Senator Robert Ford , reported by the Associated Press , “ Gambling ai n’t no blight on society . ”
To fight them , we need first to expose state lotteries as disguised and very unfair taxation .
Consider the rising importance of state lottery revenues also documented in that Associated Press story :
Both Republicans and Democrats have been moving steadily toward ever more lottery sales ; there is no reason to doubt that they will continue .
Where do lottery revenues come from ?
A famous recent study by Cornell University researchers reached these conclusions :
. . . lotteries are extremely popular , particularly among low income citizens .
. . .
[ I ] ndividuals with lower incomes substitute lottery play for other entertainment .
. . .
[ L ] ow income consumers may view lotteries as a convenient and otherwise rare opportunity for radically improving their standard of living .
. . .
[ T ]he desperate may turn to lotteries in an effort to escape hardship .
We . . . find a strong and positive relationship between sales and poverty rates .
. . .
In another study , Duke University researchers in 1999 found that the more education one has the less one spends on lottery tickets : dropouts averaged $ 700 annually compared to college graduate ’s $ 178 ; and that those from households with annual incomes below $ 25,000 spent an average of nearly $ 600 per year on lottery tickets , while those from households earning over $ 100,000 averaged $ 289 ; blacks spent an average of $ 998 , while whites spent $ 210 .
Put simply , lotteries take the most from those who can least afford them .
Thus , still another study of state lotteries concluded : “ We find that the implicit tax is regressive in virtually all cases . ”
Instead of taxing those most able to pay , state leaders use lotteries to disguise a regressive tax that targets the middle and even more the poor .
Just as the richest were getting much richer from 2001 to 2006 , the middle and poor were getting ever more heavily taxed by means of lotteries .
How do states use their lottery revenues ?
Some 50 - 70 percent go to the winners ; 20 - 40 per cent go to pay for states ’ public services ( often education ) and the rest ( 10 - 20 per cent ) go for “ expenses ” of running lotteries .
In 2006 , over half of California ’s lottery receipts used for these “ expenses ” were paid as commissions to retailers for selling lottery tickets .
Sales per retail outlet in 2006 averaged $ 188,000 in California ( and $ 405,000 in New York ) .
For many retailers across the country , profits from the fully automated selling of lottery tickets significantly boost their bottom lines .
Lotteries actually redistribute wealth from the poorer to the richer .
The vast majority of middle - income and poor people buy tickets and win nothing or nearly nothing , while a tiny number of winners become wealthy .
Lotteries raise ever more money for states from their middle - income and poor citizens rather than those most able to pay , thereby allowing the rich to escape rising taxes .
Retail merchants get state welfare in profitable commissions on lottery sales .
Politicians boast that they “ did not raise taxes ” — having raised money instead by lottery ticket sales .
The effects of lotteries in today ’s economic crisis are even more perverse .
Lotteries take huge sums from masses of people who would otherwise likely have spent that money on goods and services whose production gave people jobs .
The lotteries then distribute over half that money to a few , suddenly enriched , individuals who likely will not spend as much ( and thus generate fewer jobs ) .
This is the exact opposite of the kind of economic stimulus a depressed economy needs .
Yet many states are now planning increases in lottery sales to raise money “ in these bad times . ”
Lotteries are also powerful ideological and political weapons .
They reinforce notions that individual acts — buying lottery tickets — are appropriate responses to society ’s economic problems .
Lotteries help to distract people from collective action to solve the economic crisis by changing society .
Lotteries ’ massive advertising shows an audacity of hype : shifting people from hope for the social fruits of collective action to hope for the personal fruits of individual gambling .
Finally , compare lotteries ( disguised taxes ) with taxes not wearing masks .
Taxes raise money that mostly goes to fund states ’ provision of public services .
Lottery revenues make a few winners wealthy at the expense of the mass of taxpayers ; only small portions of lottery revenues fund states ’ services .
We can socially target taxes to tap those most able to pay ; we cannot do that with lotteries .
Taxes can enable the states to provide public education , child and elderly care , public transportation and so on without using state employees to push us to gamble more , which is what lotteries do .
The issue here is not gambling per se ; the point is not to engage the religious , moral , or mental health debates over gambling .
Rather , what matters is the cynical use of state lotteries to disguise unfair tax burdens even as they worsen the economic crisis .
As an alternative to lottery expansions , states could together pass a property tax levied on property in the form of stocks and bonds .
( See my earlier MRZine piece on property taxes : “ Evading Taxes , Legally . ” )
Let ’s recall that many states already tax property in the form of land , homes , commercial and industrial buildings , automobiles , and business inventories .
There is no justification for excluding stocks and bonds from the property tax ; stocks and bonds are the form in which the richest among us hold most of their property .
A property tax on stocks and bonds could raise far more than lotteries do , it would tax those most able to pay , and it would end the injustice of allowing owners of stocks and bonds to avoid the taxes now levied on the other sorts of property most Americans own ( cars , homes , etc. ) .

DISSIDENT THREAT : PLANS
BY the Irish Republican Army for a seizure of power by coup d’etat in 1934 have been revealed in documents released for the first time by the Department of Justice .
More than 1,000 files from the period 1934 - 39 with a strong focus on IRA , Blueshirt and communist activities have been transferred to the National Archives .
The files were apparently considered too sensitive for public viewing until now .
In a document issued on August 31st , 1934 , and entitled Training and Preparation within a YearIRA Chief of Staff Maurice “ Moss ” Twomey ( 1897 - 1978 ) informs local commanders that the organisation is to “ be trained , equipped and fit to take the field ” in that time .
Meanwhile , the army council and general headquarters staff of the IRA would be responsible for “ the drawing - up of plans for the seizure and consolidation of power ” .
As part of this “ great project ” , agreed at an IRA convention earlier in the month , Twomey states that “ the complete elimination of a number of unsuitable volunteers ” might be required .
There must be “ very drastic re-organisation ” at officer level : “ We must have officers with military mind and military outlook , who will think in terms of military action . . . in terms of revolution . ”
Each recruit would be subject to a probationary period of at least three months including education in the “ history of the physical force movement . . . pointing out the ideals which animate it and how its policy and methods differ from the so - called constitutional Nationalist agitations ” .
An accompanying commentary on Twomey ’s message from a senior officer in the Garda Síochána states that it is “ mere bluff and is directed at putting something spectacular before the rank and file for the purpose of keeping them together ” .
The Garda estimate of IRA strength is given as “ about 8,041 ” for the 26 - county area , with “ a limited supply of rifles , revolvers and ammunition ” at local level .
In addition , the split by left - wing elements to form the Republican Congress party and the establishment of a reserve force by the Fianna Fáil government , “ had the effect of disintegrating the organisation to a very considerable extent ” .
A further Garda commentary submitted to the government concedes that “ the document , on its face value , is rather an alarming one ” in that it purports to convey “ that at the end of 12 months the IRA should be in a position to attempt to effect a coup d’etat ” .
Explaining the background as he sees it , the senior Garda officer continues : “ Individual members of the IRA . . . were beginning to realise that the establishment of a Republic could only be accomplished behind the lawfully and freely elected Government of the country .
“ This general instruction is . . . an attempt to put some spectacular objective before the rank and file . . . in a desperate endeavour to stem the disorganisation and disintegration that threatened its very existence . ”
The real threat lay in the development of a left - wing party such as the Republican Congress : “ It is thought that the orthodox IRA will never be a serious menace to the Government as at present constituted .
“ The Republican Congress Group , under Peadar O’Donnell , which endeavours to get control of the Labour Organisations in the country for the purpose of creating general social disorder and internal chaos will be a much greater menace .
The more this organisation ’s efforts are thwarted by the existence of the orthodox IRA the better .
If the latter ceased to exist there would be much more recruitment to the Congress ranks with the inevitable social consequences . ”
A woman who sent and received more than 20 texts before she hit and killed another motorist has been jailed for 21 months .
Phone records show that Philippa Curtis , 21 , of Icklingham , near Bury St Edmunds , in Suffolk , sent and received the messages before she hit the back of a stationary car at 70 mph , killing its driver .
She was found guilty of causing the death by dangerous driving of Victoria McBryde , 24 , of Horton , Northamptonshire , following a trial at Oxford Crown Court in December .
Curtis had been on her way to stay with her boyfriend in Oxford on 20 November 2007 , when her car collided with Ms McBryde 's car on the A40 , near Wheatley , sending it flying into a concrete verge .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ms McBryde , who had stopped and was waiting for help to deal with a puncture , died from brain injuries .
Curtis , who was not wearing any shoes at the time of the crash , escaped with an arm injury after her car spun into oncoming traffic , collided with a white van and crashed into the back of a lorry .
The court heard that Curtis made the two - hour journey to Oxford on a dark evening when the roads were wet and after a day 's work at a restaurant in Suffolk .
As she approached Oxford , she phoned her boyfriend , but could not get through .
She then called a taxi firm so she could arrange an onward journey from a park - and - ride .
But shortly after making the call she collided with Ms McBryde 's car .
In court she admitted sending text messages while driving but denied using her mobile phone at the time of the collision .
Giving evidence , she said she had felt there were times when using a phone while driving was acceptable and said she could send and receive messages without taking her eyes off the road .
Curtis said she felt " awful " for causing the death of another young woman .
" I can't really describe in words how bad I actually feel , " she told the court .
" I just feel awful that I was involved and I can't really imagine how the family must feel . "
Curtis was also disqualified from driving for three years .
Speaking after the hearing , Ms McBryde 's mother , Jennifer Ford , said : " Tori was horribly killed by Philippa Curtis because she chose to use her phone while driving in the pitch black .
Tori was my shining star and both totally beautiful and my best friend .
I 've been left with a black hole in my heart which will never be filled .
My sentence is a lifelong one until I meet her again . "
Road safety experts described Curtis 's jail sentence as " light " in view of the persistent texting and calls she made on her mobile phone leading up to the fatality .
Jo Stagg , for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents , said : " This is a tragic case and goes to show that some people treat their calls and texts as more important than the lives of those around them on the road . "
In 2007 , 25 deaths were caused by people talking on their mobile phones while driving .
" Sentencing guidelines were recently strengthened to encourage the courts to be stricter on this type of deliberate and persistent dangerous driving , but in our view this sentence is light , " added Ms Stagg .
“ A World of Trouble ” covers 10 American presidencies , from Dwight D. Eisenhower ’s to George W. Bush ’s .
An experienced foreign correspondent who has reported from across the Middle East for The New York Times and The Washington Post , Tyler draws on decades ’ worth of notebooks , numerous interviews and declassified documents .
The Israeli-­Palestinian conflict runs like a thread through the narrative , but Tyler also ranges much wider , to Suez , the Iranian revolution , the Iran - Iraq conflict and both Iraq wars .
He writes vividly , allowing the reader access to White House meetings , huddles in the corridors of power , seats at international summits .

There are finely drawn pen portraits of the key players .
Few of the presidents impress : Jimmy Carter dithers , Ronald Reagan and his advisers are clueless , Bill Clinton is distracted by the Lewinsky scandal .
The local leaders seem more serious : Menachem Begin , who equated Arafat with Hitler ; Yitzhak Rabin , who made peace with Arafat ; and Benjamin Netanyahu , who — along with Hamas suicide bombers — helped destroy any chance of a peace agreement .
Here too are crucial Arab figures : the party - loving Prince Bandar , confidant of numerous presidents ; the brave but doomed Anwar Sadat ; King Hussein of Jordan ; and Saddam Hussein , the onetime ally against whom America eventually went to war .
It may not be a surprise to learn that the White House — like every government in history — is always riven by factions , duplicitous advisers pushing their own agendas and secret cabals plotting in the washrooms .
But it still makes for delicious reading to discover , for instance , the ­power of Mathilde Krim , a fiercely pro-Israel Swiss Calvinist who was a former member of Begin ’s right - wing underground , the Irgun .
Krim , along with her husband , Arthur , had the ear of Lyndon B. Johnson , apparently more so than did Dean Rusk , his secretary of state , and Robert McNamara , his defense secretary .
On Memorial Day in 1967 , while Israel and Arab countries were preparing for imminent war , President Johnson was “ cavorting ” at his Texas ranch with the Krims and other friends .
Tyler is especially good on America ’s relationship with Iran .
He dissects President Carter ’s tortured pusillanimity as he tried to reconcile his Christian beliefs with the need to prop up an American ally , the shah , whose regime was kept in place by secret - police torturers .
Not surprisingly , the mix soon turned rancid , especially when the United States backed Iraq in its war against Iran .
In March 1988 , Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against the Kurdish town of Halabja .
Tyler , along with other foreign correspondents , was flown there by the Iranians on a risky mission inside Iraqi airspace .
As many as 5,000 civilians perished .
Tyler remains haunted by what he saw that day : “ the bodies of a dozen or so small girls who had been playing the day of the attack .
They lay like dolls splayed randomly on the gravel bed , eyes open in some cases , staring skyward .
The faces seemed to beckon , as if impatient for the living to gather them in . ”
At the time , Hussein was an American ally .
The Defense Intelligence Agency sent two officers to Baghdad with comprehensive plans for an air war , showing Iranian air defenses and fortifications .
The agency knew Iraq was using chemical weapons , but still the intelligence flowed .
When Congress protested the Halabja gassing , Republican leaders , including Dick Cheney , blocked the calls for sanctions against Hussein .
Despite its 600 - odd pages , “ A World of Trouble ” feels unbalanced in places .
The chapter on George W. Bush ’s presidency , which covers the rising threat of Al Qaeda , 9/11 , and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , is compressed into 30 pages , while the American entanglement in Lebanon gets almost double that number .
When the subject is not the Middle East , Tyler is less confident and makes several errors .
He writes that during the Yugoslav wars , President George H. W. Bush was unwilling to commit American troops to Bosnia partly because he feared humiliating “ Gorbachev ” in “ the heart of what the Soviets saw as their sphere of influence . ”
In fact , when the Bosnian war started , ­Boris Yeltsin was the president of Russia and the Soviet Union no longer existed .
Tyler also writes that “ a quarter - million ” were slaughtered in Rwanda ; the usually accepted figure is 800,000 .

Advertisement Artist and children 's presenter Tony Hart has died , aged 83 .
Hart , who lived in Surrey , had suffered from health problems for a number of years , including two strokes .
His family said he died peacefully .
The affable presenter inspired children to paint and draw on shows like Vision On , Take Hart and Hartbeat for nearly 50 years before he retired in 2001 .
Fellow artist Rolf Harris led tributes , calling Hart " a very gentle and talented guy " .
" He enthused and inspired a whole generation of kids into creating their own works of art , simple or complex . "
Obituary : Tony Hart In Pictures : Tony Hart Hart 's agent , Roc Renals , said the presenter had died in the early hours of Sunday morning .
He said : " I was for many years his best friend , agent , manager and publicist .
He suffered two strokes many years ago and his health declined since then . "
" Thousands and thousands of young people who are now grown up will thank him for inspiring them to take up art , " he added .
Wilf Lunn ,
Hart 's friend who worked with him on Vision
On for nine years , said he was a television pioneer .
" His legacy was the fact he really started all these children 's programmes , Art Attack and all that , and he was the guy , right at the beginning .
" And he was the guy who had all these little tricks that teachers used to use because they make things look easy , and we got people into doing it .
And he was such a nice man . "
Morph HAVE YOUR SAY
A lovely , gentle , skilful presenter , who allowed the art to be the centre of attention vauqueliniere
The artist served as an officer in the 1st Gurkha Rifles in World War II , before joining a course at Maidstone College of Art. Gurkha Welfare Trust director Colonel William Shuttlewood said Hart regularly donated pictures which were auctioned and raised " substantial " amounts of money .
He said : " I am sorry he has gone .
He was a lovely chap and was very keen to make sure we were supported properly . "
It was a chance meeting in 1952 with a BBC TV producer and a demonstration of his quick art skills on a paper napkin that secured his on - screen career .
Hart became resident artist on the Saturday Special programme that year .
Subsequent TV shows included Playbox , Titch and Quackers , Vision On , Take Hart , Hartbeat and Smart Hart .
From 1977 he appeared with animated clay character Morph , who lived in a pencil box .
Morph was later joined by his cream - coloured colleague Chas .
Hartbeat often attracted 5.4 million viewers and Hart 's mailbag varied between 6,000 and 8,000 per week .
Richard Deverell , BBC Children 's Controller , said : " Tony was a warm man who had an unique ability to communicate with and inspire children .
" He was an inspirational man and a terrific broadcaster . "
Hart received two Bafta awards , won a lifetime achievement award in 1998 , and also created the original design for the Blue Peter badge .
In an interview last year he said not being able to draw after suffering two strokes was the " greatest cross I have to bear " .
However , he added : " My aged heart is warmed by the lovely letters and e-mails I receive , especially when they tell me that my work on television inspired the writers to become artists , sometimes very successful ones . "

Die EU will nicht verhindern , dass die Mitglieder sich gegen die Finanzkrise stemmen .
Aber eine hohe Neuverschuldung kann sie auch nicht tolerieren .
Deswegen leitete sie heute Defizitverfahren gegen sechs Staaten ein .
Sanktionen müssen die aber nicht fürchten .
Von Christopher Plass , HR - Hörfunkstudio Brüssel
In Zeiten der Krise will die Brüsseler EU - Kommission nicht als strenger Zuchtmeister auftreten .
Jetzt , wo alle Mitgliedsländer die öffentliche Verschuldung hochtreiben , um die Folgen der Krise abzufedern , will Brüssel nicht stur auf der Neuverschuldungs - Grenze von drei Prozent beharren .
Der Stabilitätspakt , mit dessen Hilfe die Verschuldung eingegrenzt werden soll , müsse flexibel angewendet werden , so auch das Brüsseler Credo .
Aber die gemeinsamen Regeln sollen auch nicht außer Acht gelassen werden .
Deswegen hat die EU - Kommission insgesamt sechs Defizit - Verfahren eingeleitet - gegen die Euro - Länder Frankreich , Spanien , Irland und Griechenland sowie gegen Malta und Lettland .
Die Staatenr sollen dies als Warnung verstehen - vorerst müssen sie keine unmittelbaren Konsequenzen fürchten .
Aber die Neuverschuldung dieser Länder liegt nach Ansicht der Kommission weit über dem Erlaubten .
Irland hatte noch 2007 einen leichten Überschuß .
Das Defizit lag 2008 geschätzt schon bei 6,8 Prozent , 2009 wird die Neuverschuldung wohl bei über neun Prozent liegen .
Spanien dürfte 2009 bei knapp sechs Prozent landen .
Die französische Regierung hat für 2009 ein erwartetes Haushalts - Defizit von 4,4 Prozent nach Brüssel gemeldet .
Die EU - Kommission , so Währungskommissar Joaquin Almunia , gehe davon aus , dass die Verschuldung noch höher ausfallen werde .
Die Vorhersagen der französischen Regierung seien optimistischer als die Prognosen der Kommission .
" Angesichts dieser Vorhersagen gibt es für Länder wie Frankreich oder auch Spanien gute Gründe , 2010 mit der Konsolidierung der Finanzen zu beginnen " , betonte der Kommissar .
Theoretisch hat die EU - Kommission die Möglichkeit , solche Defizitverfahren voranzutreiben , vorausgesetzt , die EU - Finanzminister machen mit .
Am Ende könnten - ganz theoretisch - Strafzahlungen stehen .
Doch bislang beschränkt sich Brüssel auf Mahnungen .
Das Verhältnis zur französischen Regierung ist ohnehin angespannt : Frankreich hatte ein üppiges Hilfsprogramm für die heimische Auto - Industrie vorgelegt , das von der EU - Kommission kritisch beäugt wird , weil einige es für protektionistisch und Vertrags - widrig halten .
Mehr Worte als Taten : Währungskommissar Almunia
Auch Deutschlands Neuverschuldung hat die EU - Kommission im Visier .
Noch aber gab es keine Verwarnung aus Brüssel , weil das Haushaltsdefizit 2009 noch bei drei Prozent liegen werde .
2010 aber könnte es auf vier Prozent hochschnellen : Dann wäre auch für den Bundesfinanzminister eine Warnung fällig .
Almunia hatte für die deutsche Haushaltspolitik aber auch freundliche Worte .
Das politische Vorhaben , der Verschuldung intern durch die verabredete Schuldenbremse Grenzen zu setzen und sie zurückzufahren , wird ausdrücklich begrüßt : " Dieser interne Stabilitätspakt in Deutschland liegt völlig auf einer Linie mit unseren Vorstellungen davon , wie nationale Maßnahmen unsere Anti-Verschuldungs - Maßnahmen ergänzen sollen . "
Eine zu hohe Neuverschuldung , so die Sorge der Brüsseler Währungshüter , könnte die Haushalte langfristig negativ belasten .
Je weiter die Verschuldungswerte der einzelnen Euro - Länder auseinander klaffen , so befürchten Experten , desto größer die Gefahren für den Zusammenhalt der Euro - Zone .
BARCELONA , Spain ( CNN ) --
Nearly a fourth of the world 's mammals are threatened with extinction , a leading international conservation group said Monday as it unveiled its latest global study of the problem .
Climate change is affecting sea ice - dependent species such as polar bears .
At least 1,141 of the 5,487 mammals on Earth , or 21 percent , are endangered species , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) said at the start of its World Conservation Congress in Barcelona .
The problem appears to be getting worse since the IUCN 's last comprehensive survey of mammals 12 years ago , the IUCN 's Jan Schipper told CNN .
But he added that more study will be needed in the coming months .
The IUCN , in updating its trademark Red List of Threatened Species , emphasized that conservation efforts could help turn the tide .
" Hundreds of species could be lost as a result of our own actions , a frightening sign of what is happening to the ecosystems where they live , " Julia Marton - Lefevre , IUCN 's Director General , said in prepared statement .
" We must now set clear targets to reverse this trend . "
The IUCN study also showed that 5 percent of the mammals currently listed as facing possible extinction are showing signs of recovery in the wild .
And just 76 mammals have become extinct in the last 500 years , the IUCN said .
But the study said 188 mammals are critically endangered , including the Iberian Lynx , which has at most 143 adults remaining .
They are on a steady decline mainly because there 's a shortage of their primary prey , the European Rabbit .
Another 29 species were listed as critically endangered and possibly extinct , such as Cuba 's Little Earth Hutia , which has not been seen in 40 years , the IUCN said .
The Swiss - based IUCN , founded 60 years ago , has a membership of more than 80 nations and 800 non-governmental agencies like environmental groups , and also counts on 11,000 volunteer scientists around the globe .
The latest study citing the danger to mammals involved 1800 scientists in 130 nations .
It showed that China 's " Pere David 's Deer , " already listed as extinct in the wild , is showing signs of recovery in captivity and that relaunching it in the wild may soon be attempted .
Schipper said that although the study put 21 percent of the world 's mammals on the endangered list , it might be as high as 36 percent , pending further study , particularly for 836 mammals for which scientists still have little incomplete information .
The new study is far more comprehensive than the last major study in 1996 , and includes 700 more mammals , IUCN officials told CNN .
Enhanced study methods and tracking of mammals and other species -- marine species , plants and insects -- has increased dramatically since 1996 , which makes it hard to compare the current results with those of 12 years ago , Schipper said .
In just one example , Schipper said , the lemur , a primate in Madagascar , was thought to have been just one species there in 1996 , but further study has shown three different species of lemurs , separated by rivers or valleys .
The IUCN said the loss or degradation of natural habitats is affecting 40 percent of the world 's mammals , particularly in Latin America , much of Africa and in southeast Asia .
Overharvesting is wiping out larger mammals in many locations .
Overall , the IUCN Red List now includes 44,838 species of all categories -- mammals and other species -- of which 38 percent are threatened with extinction .
Nearly a third of amphibians alone face extinction or have already become extinct , the IUCN said .
Barcelona 's zoo has a number of mammals on the endangered list , including the Chimpanzee , Red Panda , Variegated spider monkey , Sumatran Tiger and African hunting dog , zoo and IUCN officials told CNN .
The zoo -- not far from the IUCN congress that has brought thousands of government officials , environmentalists and scientists to the city for the conference which is held every four years -- has made conservation of endangered species a key part of its work , zoo officials told CNN .

Ledger , 28 when he died , was not just an actor to Gilliam , he was the finest actor of his generation .
They had worked together on The Brothers Grimm , where he had also been impressed by Ledger 's sweetness of character and his skill at chess .
" It just is n't possible that he 's dead , " he says .
" There 's nothing he can't do , it just flows out of him with ease and grace .
He lifted everybody .
He was n't like Marlon Brando or James Dean or any of the more neurotic actors , his was all positive energy .
I knew he was tired but that Saturday he had been doing all his own stunts , he was leaping off wagons , indestructible .
On no level did his death make sense . "
This post contains brief descriptions of some mathematics that one would need to know in order to have a realistic chance of contributing to the collaborative research project I shall suggest in the next post .
If you are familiar with the Hales - Jewett theorem , Szemerédi ’s regularity lemma , the triangle - removal lemma , and the proof from the triangle - removal lemma that a dense subset of contains a corner , then you do not need to read it .
The Hales - Jewett theorem .
The Hales - Jewett theorem is one of the best - known results in Ramsey theory .
To state it , we need a couple of definitions .
Let us write for the set .
We shall be looking at colourings of the set which consists of all sequences , where each is an integer between and .
As with most Ramsey theorems , the idea is now to find a substructure with all elements of the same colour .
In this case , the substructure is an object known as a combinatorial line .
An example will quickly demonstrate what a combinatorial line is .
Let and let .
Then the following three points form a combinatorial line :
To see more clearly what is going on here , let us use the notation .
The three earlier points are obtained by substituting , then , and then .
In general , you form a combinatorial line by fixing some of the coordinates and letting the others be equal and vary from to .
The Hales - Jewett theorem asserts that for every and every there exists such that if the elements of are coloured with colours , then there is a combinatorial line with all its points of the same colour .
The Furstenberg - Katznelson theorem .
The proof of the Hales - Jewett theorem need not concern us here .
What we shall be interested in is the density version of the statement , which is the following .
For every and every there exists such that every subset of of size at least contains a combinatorial line .
This is a famous theorem of Furstenberg and Katznelson , who proved it using ergodic theory .
As yet , the only known proofs of this theorem either use ergodic theory or are heavily inspired by it , so it would be very nice to have a purely combinatorial proof .
The Hales - Jewett theorem implies van der Waerden ’s theorem , and the Furstenberg - Katznelson theorem implies Szemerédi ’s theorem , so a new proof of any kind is not likely to be easy to come by .
However , Szemerédi ’s theorem for progressions of length 3 ( due to Roth ) is quite a bit easier than the general case , so there ought to be a better chance of finding a combinatorial proof of the Furstenberg - Katznelson theorem at least in the case .
The project I ’m proposing is to develop an approach to this case of the problem : the approach will be explained in the next post .
( If you have an idea about how to find a proof of this case , you should save it up for comments on that post .
I ’m not expecting many comments on this post , but if you do have them then they should concern the results I briefly describe here , or my presentation of them . )
Szemerédi ’s regularity lemma .
The second piece of background information needed is Szemerédi ’s regularity lemma .
This is a fundamental result in graph theory and will play an important role for us .
I will give the statement only , even though the project may depend on thinking about , and trying to modify , its proof .
Anybody who does not know the proof already is referred to section 7 of this paper , and also to section 1 and the beginnings of sections 2 and 3 ( but you can ignore everything about hypergraphs ) .
In order to state the lemma we shall need some preliminary definitions .
Let be a bipartite graph with vertex sets and .
Let be a subset of and let be a subset of .
The density of the pair is defined to be the number of such that is an edge of , divided by .
The pair is defined to be –regular if whenever and are subsets of and with and .
What is useful about - regular pairs is that the induced subgraph of corresponding to such a pair behaves rather like a typical random bipartite graph of the same density ( at least when is small ) .
The statement of the lemma , in the version we shall use , is this .
For every there exists such that for every graph with vertex set there is a partition with and with the sets differing in size by at most 1 , such that all but at most of the pairs are - regular .
As most people think about this lemma : every graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of pieces , almost all of which behave like random bipartite graphs .
The triangle - removal lemma .
Now let me sketch how Szemerédi ’s regularity lemma is used to prove a result that is slightly misleadingly called the triangle - removal lemma .
This states that for every there exists such that if is any graph with vertices and at most triangles , then it is possible to remove at most edges from and end up with no triangles .
To prove it , one first applies the regularity lemma to .
Let be a fairly small number ( that depends in a reasonably simple way on ) and let the partition of the vertex set given by the regularity lemma be .
Then remove all edges from all pairs that either fail to be - regular or fail to have density at least .
If has been chosen appropriately , the number of edges removed is at most Suppose now that the graph with these edges removed had a triangle .
Suppose that , and .
Then the pairs , and would not have had their edges removed , so they would have had to be both - regular and of density at least .
If is sufficiently small , it is not hard to deduce from these two properties that the number of ( labelled ) triangles with one vertex in , one in and one in is not much smaller than .
Since each cell of the partition contains a constant fraction of all the vertices , this gives us a lot of triangles , contradicting the assumption that there were fewer than triangles , at least if is chosen small enough .
Finding corners in dense sets .
Now let us use the triangle - removal lemma to prove that a dense subset of contains a triple of the form with .
Such a configuration is sometimes called a corner .
Suppose then that is a set of size .
Form a tripartite graph with vertex sets and , and the following edges .
If and , then is an edge if and only if .
If and , then is an edge if and only if .
Finally , if and , then is an edge if and only if .
Suppose now that is a triangle in this graph .
Then the points , , and all belong to .
Setting we can write the second and third points as and .
Therefore , we have a configuration of the desired kind — except if .
If , which happens if , then all we get is a single point repeated three times .
Let us call the resulting triangle in the graph degenerate .
At any rate , if contains no configurations of the desired kind , then the above argument shows that contains no non-degenerate triangles .
Since the number of degenerate triangles is , this proves that contains triangles , which is far fewer than triangles .
( Recall that the number of vertices of is . )
The triangle - removal lemma therefore implies , at least when is sufficiently large , that it is possible to remove at most edges from in such a way that no triangles remain .
However , this is a contradiction , as it is easy to check that no two degenerate triangles share an edge , and we know that there are of them .
The above very beautiful argument is due to Solymosi , who was generalizing a similarly beautiful argument of Ruzsa and Szemerédi .
This result about corners was first proved ( I think — but am ready to be corrected if necessary ) by Szemerédi , using a different argument .
[ Actually it was Ajtai and Szemerédi : many thanks to Matthias Schacht for telling me this — which I now remember once having known . ]
Sparse regularity lemmas .
This section assumes familiarity with the proof of Szemerédi ’s regularity lemma .
A drawback of Szemerédi ’s regularity lemma is that the bound on the size of the partition in terms of the parameter is very weak .
This means that in practice the lemma is useful only for statements about dense graphs .
However , there do exist adaptations that work for sparse graphs ( some of which are described in the first couple of sections of this paper ) .
Roughly , the idea is that one can prove a regularity lemma for a sparse graph if it is a dense subgraph of a sufficiently random - like graph .
And very roughly , the reason for that is that if has density and has highly quasirandom behaviour , then the upper bound for the density of subgraphs of is not but , which means that the mean - square density of a partition cannot be more than , so the iteration in the proof of the regularity lemma can after all be guaranteed to finish after a constant number of steps ( since , if is dense in , the initial mean - square density is within a constant of ) .
An important difference between the sparse case and the dense case is that if you have a triple of bipartite graphs that are sparse and regular , it is no longer trivial that the resulting tripartite graph contains many triangles .
However , there are various ways that this can be done .
What will happen next .
I do n’t yet have a better place to do things than this blog , so here ’s what I plan to do .
Within the next day or two I will publish a ( now written ) post that explains a possible approach to the density Hales - Jewett theorem when .
The project is to decide whether this approach works or ( more likely ) can be convincingly shown not to work .
Or at least that is the initial project — it is possible that there could be spin - offs .
As well as the main post that describes the approach , I shall also publish an explanation ( also already written ) of why I think this project might be a suitable one , as well as a dozen or so subposts , some of which will be empty .
The idea of these subposts is to compensate to some extent for the excessive linearity of blog comments by separating out discussion of different aspects of the project .
However , I do n’t want to dictate too much the form that the discussion should take , so I will also leave several of the subposts empty , and fill them if it becomes clear from the existing discussions that a new thread would be appropriate .
( If this happens , I will fill the empty post with an attempted summary of the comments that have led to the new thread . )
It ’s a bit rough and ready , and wo n’t work if there are too many comments to deal with , but I ’m hoping that the problem is at a level where the number will be manageable .
The point of publishing empty posts is that then they will all appear consecutively on the blog .
Added later : I have slightly changed my mind about one detail .
As planned , I shall publish a large number of extra posts for the purposes of trying to organize the threads of the discussion .
However , I will not try to guess in advance what any of these threads might be , so initially all these extra posts will be empty .
Only when clearly defined subdiscussions emerge will I suggest that they continue on separate threads .
This is because I want the whole process to be as democratic as possible : ideally it wo n’t always be me who decides that a subdiscussion is sufficiently “ clearly defined ” to deserve its own place .

A red LED chip , which can be used in the manufacture of lamps ( Image : Lehtikuva OY / Rex )
Incandescent tungsten - filament light bulbs face a global switch - off as governments push for energy efficient fluorescent lamps to become the standard .
But the light could soon go out on those lamps too , now that UK materials scientists have discovered a cheaper way to produce LED bulbs , which are three times as efficient as fluorescent lamps .
Although the ultimate dominance of LED lights has long been predicted , the expense of the super - efficient technology has made the timescale uncertain .
The researchers now say LED bulbs based on their new process could be commercially available within five years .
Gallium nitride ( GaN ) LEDs have many advantages over compact fluorescent lamps ( CFLs ) and incandescent bulbs .
They switch on instantly , with no gradual warm - up , and can burn for an average of 100,000 hours before they need replacing – 10 times as long as fluorescent lamps and some 130 times as long as an incandescent bulb .
CFLs also contain small levels of mercury , which makes environmentally - friendly disposal of spent bulbs difficult .

Cracking up
The cost of production has kept the LEDs far from homes and offices , however .
Gallium nitride cannot be grown on silicon like other solid - state electronic components because it shrinks at twice the rate of silicon as it cools .
Crystals of GaN must be grown at 1000 °C , so by the time a new LED made on silicon has cooled , it has already cracked , rendering the devices unusable .
One solution is to grow the LEDs on sapphire , which shrinks and cools at much the same rate as GaN .
But the expense is too great to be commercially competitive .
Now Colin Humphreys ‘s team at the University of Cambridge has discovered a simple solution to the shrinkage problem .
They included layers of aluminium gallium nitride in their LED design .
These layers shrink at a much slower rate during cooling and help to counteract the fast - shrinkage of pure gallium nitride .
These LEDs can be grown on silicon as so many other electronics components are .
“ They still work well as LEDs even with those extra layers inside , ” says Humphreys .
Early switch - over
A 15 - centimetre silicon wafer costs just $ 15 and can accommodate 150,000 LEDs making the cost per unit tiny .
That levels the playing field with CFLs , which many people only ever saw as a stopgap solution to the lighting problem .
Humphreys reckons that the UK government encouraged consumers to drop tungsten bulbs too soon .
“ We should have stayed with tungsten for another five years and then switched to LEDs , ” he says .
Humphreys ’s team was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .
The UK government ’s Technology Strategy Board will now provide the funding to turn the new technology into a commercial process .

The BBC has refused to broadcast a humanitarian appeal for Gaza , saying it does n't want to risk compromising public confidence in its impartiality .
The Disasters Emergency Committee , on the other hand , says the appeal is ' a response to humanitarian principles ' .

A story in the Sunday Times of London sent Google 's public relations machine into an advanced search for answers .
The Times reporters wrote about a new Harvard study that examines the energy impact of Web searches .
The story 's lead paragraph : " Performing two Google searches from a desktop computer can generate about the same amount of carbon dioxide as boiling a kettle for a cup of tea , according to new research . "
One problem : the study 's author , Harvard University physicist Alex Wissner - Gross , says he never mentions Google in the study .
" For some reason , in their story on the study , the Times had an ax to grind with Google , " Wissner - Gross told TechNewsWorld .
" Our work has nothing to do with Google .
Our focus was exclusively on the Web overall , and we found that it takes on average about 20 milligrams of CO2 per second to visit a Web site . "
And the example involving tea kettles ?
" They did that .
I have no idea where they got those statistics , " Wissner - Gross said .
Was Google Burned by Energy Story ?
The Times story is giving Google a chance to talk about the company 's green initiatives and its efforts to pursue cleaner energy technologies on several fronts , Google spokesperson Jamie Yood said .
" This comes from the top , from ( cofounders ) Larry ( Page ) and Sergey ( Brin ) , who are really dedicated to this .
There 's an acknowledgment that Google is using energy and on the business front it makes sense to get this energy cost as low as possible , " Yood told TechNewsWorld .
" And on the environmental front , they are passionate about climate change and are really involved .
They recognize that if we 're going to use energy , let 's try to figure out how to do this as minimally as possible . "
That includes the use of biodiesel shuttles and electric cars to and from its Mountain View , Calif. , campus , offering bikes for employees to ride from building to building on that campus , and using recyclable materials throughout those buildings .
And when it comes to its server farms , " we do believe we have the most energy efficient data centers . "
Google takes exception on its Official Google blog to the statistics quoted in the Times story regarding the energy used to Web search vs. boiling a kettle of water .
A speedy search uses less energy , the company claims ; about the same amount of energy as the human body uses in about 10 seconds .
Google has asked to see a copy of the study , and Wissner - Gross says he is more than happy to send them one .
One of the Times article 's authors had interviewed a Google engineer " whose job is to look at data centers to make sure they 're more energy efficient , and he did n't really use any of his material , " Yood said .
Google 's Side of Things
Greenpeace does n't really focus on the energy efficiencies used by Google or Web companies in general , said spokesperson Daniel Kessler .
It is more focused on electronics products , the toxic materials used and company recycling initiatives .
However , Google gets high marks for its green efforts in Washington D.C. , Kessler said .
" I commend Google for its lobbying and the legislative work they 're doing when it comes to clean energy , " Kessler told TechNewsWorld .
" In the whole tech sector , they 're really on the forefront on taking action regarding the climate . "
Google 's data centers burn through a lot of energy in the course of providing answers to search queries around the world , and the cheapest form of that energy right now is coal , said Roger Kay , principal at Endpoint Technologies Associates , who keeps a close eye on the environmental policies at IT companies .
" It 's taking that electricity bill they 've got and kind of making it a proportion of the total expenditure of the generation of electricity , and then allocating that as a cost to Google and saying that 's their responsibility , their piece of it , " Kay told TechNewsWorld .
" It 's just modeling , a modeling exercise that may not necessarily be a reflection of reality . "
The location of the information needed in a Web search may also play a part , Kay said .
" If you 're looking for the latest on Brad Pitt , then that 's likely to be stored in multiple servers towards the edge of the network , where it will be an easy search .
Google through its traffic management knows a lot of people are interested in that .
But if you want to read Cicero 's works , which have n't been read for a while , you may have to go deep into the network . "
The Researcher 's Take
Wissner - Gross , who manages the Web site CO2stats.com to help educate people about energy efficiencies on the Internet , has been inundated with press requests since the Times story was published .
The Times quoted him correctly in the story as saying , " A Google search has a definite environmental impact " and " Google operates huge data centers around the world that consume a great deal of power , " he confirmed .
" I do n't think anybody would disagree with those statements , " Wissner - Gross said .
" Everything online has a definite environmental impact .
I think everybody can agree on that , including Google . "
There 's a difference between regular servers and those used in advanced data centers , Wissner - Gross said , and he acknowledges that Google would have a financial interest in maintaining an energy - efficient infrastructure .
" Energy consumption may be a higher fraction of infrastructure costs for large companies like Google than the hardware itself . "
In between answering reporters ' e-mails and appearing on CNBC , Wissner - Gross has had a lot of time to think about why the Sunday Times focused on Google in its story .
" The short answer is , it 's a really easy way to sell papers .
Google is a very successful company and it's a very easy way to get readership by making grandiose claims about them . "
24 Hours To Die Raj asked Buddha ,  Reverend Sir , how come my mind wanders around to forbidden places and yours does not ? 
 Sir , how come I do back - biting and you do n't ? 
 Sir , how come I do n't have compassion for others , while you have ?
All the questions that Raj asked were of similar nature .
Buddha replied ,  Raj , your questions are good , but it seems to me that in 24 hours from now you will die . 
Raj got up and started getting ready to go .
Buddha asked ,  Raj , what happened ?
You came with such vitality now you are totally dismayed .
Raj said ,  Sir , my mother told me that your words are true and are to be held in high esteem .
So please let me go so that I may meet my family members , friends and others before I die .
Buddha said ,  But there are still 24 hours .
Sit , we will talk more .
Raj said ,  Reverend Sir , please let me go .
I must meet my people before I die .
So Raj left and went home .
Met his mother and started crying .
The word spread .
His friends came ; other family members came ; neighbors came .
Everyone was crying with Raj .
Time flew .
Raj was busy either crying or counting the hours .
When only 3 hours were left , he pulled up a cot and lay down .
Although the Death had not yet arrived , poor Raj was kind of dead .
When only an hour was left , Buddha walked in .
Buddha said to Raj ,  Raj , why are you lying down on the cot with your closed eyes .
Death is still an hour away .
And an hour is 60 minutes long .
That 's a lot of time .
Get up , let us talk . 
Raj :  Sir , what is it now that you want to talk ?
Just let me die peacefully .
Buddha :  Raj , there is still time and our talk will get over before the ' ordained ' time .
Raj :  Okay , Sir . . . say what you have to say . 
Buddha :  In the past 24 hours , did you curse anyone ? 
Raj :  How could I curse anyone ?
I was all the time thinking about death . 
Buddha :  In the past 24 hours , did you think or wish ill for anyone ? 
Raj :  How could I do that ?
I was all the time thinking about death . 
Buddha :  In the past 24 hours , did you steal ? 
Raj :  Sir , how can you even ask that ?
I was all the time thinking about death .
Finally the Buddha said ,  Raj , I do n't know who has to die and who has to live .
But understanding the ultimate truth  i.e. death  can be very enlightening .
All the questions you posed to me have been answered by yourself because of the awareness of death that you experienced during the past 24 hours .
The difference between me and you is that you were aware of death for the past 24 hours , I have been aware for the past 24 years . 
House members seek KBR contract review Associated Press
Published : Friday February 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Members of Congress are asking the Pentagon to review a $ 35 million contract awarded to a company under criminal investigation in the electrocution deaths of U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
The Associated Press reported that Houston - based KBR Inc. was given the contract involving electrical work months after a senior Pentagon official rejected the company 's explanation of mistakes in Iraq and questioned whether confidence remained in KBR 's electrical work .
The letter from New Hampshire Rep. Carol Shea -Porter is signed by 18 others Congress members .
Company spokeswoman Heather Browne said Friday that KBR has not done shoddy electrical work as the letter contends .
The company denies any wrongdoing .
At least 18 troops and contractors have died in electrical - related incidents in Iraq .
Full press release by Congresswoman Shea - Porter follows :
####
Washington D.C. Today , Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter announced that she sent a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates asking why defense contractor KBR , Inc. was recently awarded a new $ 35.4 million contract involving electrical work in Iraq .
KBR is currently under investigation by the Department of Defense Inspector General for the deaths of 18 Americans , who were electrocuted in buildings that KBR held a contract to maintain .
Military criminal investigators have reopened five cases , and the Army Criminal Investigative Service has classified one of them as " negligent homicide . "
 I am very concerned that KBR was awarded a new contract , and I urge Secretary Gates to conduct a thorough review of this contract award ,  stated Congresswoman Shea -Porter .
 Americans deserve to know why KBR has been awarded this multi-million dollar contract , given their long record of deficient electrical work in Iraq . 
Last year , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted an in - depth investigation into the problem of electrocutions in U.S. facilities in Iraq .
They found that KBR was alerted to the deficiencies , but failed to take corrective action .
In 2008 , the Defense Contract Management Agency ( DCMA ) issued a  Level III Corrective Action Request to KBR , indicating that the contractor was in serious non-compliance . 
Shea -Porter was joined on her letter by 18 of her colleagues , including Rep. Henry Waxman , who oversaw the investigation into this matter when he was Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
You can view a copy of the letter below .
The Honorable Robert M. Gates
Secretary of Defense
The Pentagon
Washington , D.C. 20301-1000
Dear Mr. Secretary :
We are writing to express our concern about recent reports that the Department of Defense has awarded KBR a $ 35.4 million contract that includes major electrical projects and request that you review the contract award and report to us explaining why the contract award was made to KBR , given its long record of deficient electrical work in Iraq .
As you are aware , KBR has held a contract for building maintenance for U.S. military facilities in Iraq since 2003 .
During this time , there have been numerous investigations into the dangers KBRs faulty electrical work is creating for our military personnel .
The Department of Defense Inspector General is currently investigating the electrocution deaths of 18 Americans ( 16 soldiers and 2 contractors ) in KBR - maintained facilities .
KBR is under criminal investigation for the electrocution deaths of several U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted an in - depth investigation into the problem of electrocutions in U.S. facilities in Iraq and the death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , 24 , a decorated Green Beret electrocuted in his shower on January 2 , 2008 .
The Committees investigation showed that KBR was alerted to the deficiencies in this and other cases , but failed to take corrective action .
In 2008 , the Defense Contract Management Agency ( DCMA ) issued a  Level III Corrective Action Request to KBR , indicating that the contractor was in serious non-compliance .
This action request , the final warning before a contract is terminated , points to KBRs continuing failure to ensure electrical safety for our troops .
With this history , it is not surprising that Capt .
David J. Graff , commander of the DCMAs International Division , was quoted in an Associated Press article , stating that many within DOD have lost or are losing all remaining confidence in KBRs ability to successfully and repeatedly perform the required electrical support services mission in Iraq . 
Despite these serious , ongoing concerns , the Department of Defense has awarded KBR a new contract that includes the type of work that KBR failed to perform adequately for years .
Threats to the safety and lives of soldiers or others because of known hazards and negligent performance of work are not acceptable .
We would therefore appreciate a thorough review of the recent contract award to KBR .
At the very least , when our soldiers put their lives on the line for us in a war zone , we not only owe them the assurance that they will not be electrocuted in the shower on their return from a mission , but also that those who provide them with services put our soldiers ' safety ahead of their profits .
Thank you for your consideration , and we look forward to your response .

Nashville legend Merle Haggard has sued environmental awareness group the Green Train for illegally using his name and forging his signature in an effort to collect donations .
The group claims to have been founded by Haggard himself along with Bob Wolf .
[ social_buttons ]
Haggard says that Bob Wolf asked him for support on a non-profit project in 2007 and Haggard obliged with a $ 20,000 donation .
However , the organization never attained nor attempted to gain non-profit status , said the director of Tennessee ’s Divicision of Charitable Solicitiations and Gaming .
A quick look at the Green Train website through Internet Archive ’s Way Back Machine , it ’s clear that The Green Train has some explaining to do :
It ’s “ Last Call ” and we ca n’t afford to let down the future , Here ’s the pledge from our founders Hag and Wolf .
We pledge to provide you with real , researched information gathered from the world ’s leading organizations and spokespeople on the environment .
This website will provide links to those organizations to give us all the best answers to many of our questions and concerns .
It will help teach us new practices .
We pledge to maintain the same standards this project asks each and every other human being to do .
Be as kind to the environment as is possible .
Why ?
For us , Millions of young eyes are watching us as examples from around the globe .
Do you want to be the one to tell them , we let you down !
Educate and promote awareness and have a message that carries on , Having fun doing it , that just adds to the excitement and makes you want to do it forever !!
Join us on “ The Green Train Europa 2009 ” and “ The Green Train Global 2010 ” !!
The everlasting message of GREEN !
Haggard is suing the group for “ exaggerating ” his involvement in the organization , but it is unclear what his actual role has been .
Many sources reported that Haggard was indeed making a green tour through 28 states this April , including Variety , NBC , and the Sundance Channel .
Haggard maintains that his only involvement with the group has been the $ 20,000 donation and attendance at a $ 1,000 - per-person luncheon to benefit the project on June 25th .
Otherwise he says he has never given permission for them to use their likeness .
The Green Train website no longer lists Haggard as a founder or supporter , but they still claim that Jewel , Willie Nelson , Cher , the Dave Matthews Band and many other artists “ support ” the project .
Regardless , I ’d recommend sending your money elsewhere .

( CNN ) -- Federal agents have located financier Robert Allen Stanford and served him with papers accusing him and three of his companies of orchestrating a $ 9.2 billion investment fraud scheme , the FBI said Thursday .
Stanford , who was located in Fredericksburg , Virginia , has no criminal charges pending against him and was not taken into custody , FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said .
But the Securities and Exchange Commission said Stanford was behind " a fraud of shocking magnitude , " and the FBI served him a copy of the SEC complaint , Kolko said .
The FBI wo n't talk about a criminal investigation of Stanford 's activities , but federal law enforcement officials familiar with the case leave no doubt that federal agents are investigating his financial dealings .
Multiple officials indicated criminal charges are not imminent and would not discuss potential charges .
Stanford has arranged to give his passport to one of his attorneys who will offer it to federal authorities .
The FBI would not say whether Stanford is under surveillance , but said they expect to know his whereabouts .
" He 's not hiding from us at all , " one official said .
CNN 's efforts to reach Stanford or company representatives were unsuccessful .
In September , Forbes magazine ranked him No. 205 in its " 400 Richest Americans " article .
In a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Dallas , Texas , the SEC accused the financier 's Stanford International Bank of using a network of financial advisers to sell about $ 8 billion of " certificates of deposit " to investors .
The bank boasted of a unique investment strategy that it said had allowed it to reap double - digit returns on its investments for the previous 15 years , the SEC said .
The civil complaint alleged an additional scheme relating to $ 1.2 billion in sales .
The bank , based on the Caribbean island of Antigua , claims its network has $ 51 billion in deposits and assets under management or advisement , with more than 70,000 clients in 140 countries .
But the allegations against Stanford and his companies have sparked runs on Stanford banks in Antigua and in Venezuela , where the government took over the local subsidiary after it recorded " extraordinary " withdrawals Tuesday and Wednesday , said Edgar Hernandez Behrens , Venezuela 's superintendent of banks .
The SEC complaint also named James Davis , SIB 's chief financial officer ; Laura Pendergest - Holt , chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group ; and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The White House wo n’t say it explicitly .
Neither will the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Yet there is a whiff in the air that U.S. policy is about to change when it comes to medical marijuana .
The message is clear , said UCLA professor Mark Kleiman , a former Justice Department official and an expert on crime and drug policy .
“ It is no longer federal policy to beat up on hippies , ” said Kleiman .
Tell that to the DEA .
In California this past week , agents raided four dispensaries in Los Angeles and seized 500 pounds of pot .
“ It ’s a little bit surprising , because I think current DEA management did n’t get the message , ” said Kleiman .
“ The message is , this is no longer drug warrior time .
We are not on a cultural crusade against pot-smoking . ”
California law permits the sale of marijuana for medical purposes , though it is still against federal law .
Thirteen states have laws permitting medicinal use of marijuana .
California is unique among them for the presence of dispensaries , businesses that sell marijuana and even advertise their services .
Legal under California law , such dispensaries are still illegal under federal law .
“ Anyone possessing , distributing or cultivating marijuana for any reason is in violation of federal law , ” Sarah Pullen , a DEA spokeswoman in Los Angeles , said Thursday .
That may be the law , but it contradicts the medical marijuana position of the new president .
“ The president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws , and as he continues to appoint senior leadership to fill out the ranks of the federal government , he expects them to review their policies with that in mind , ” said White House spokesman Nick Shapiro , repeating past statements .
So on Friday , DEA officials in Washington declined to comment at all on the subject .
As a presidential candidate , Obama repeatedly promised a change in federal drug policy in situations where state laws allow use of medical marijuana .
“ I think the basic concept of using medical marijuana for the same purposes and with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors , I think that ’s entirely appropriate , ” Obama told the Mail Tribune of Medford , Ore. , in March .
A year earlier at a campaign stop in New Hampshire , Obama said : “ I would not have the Justice Department prosecuting and raiding medical marijuana users . ”
At age 47 , Obama is part of a generation that had plenty of exposure to pot .
In his memoir , “ Dreams from My Father , ” he described time spent as a youth struggling with questions about his race and identity , and turning to drugs — including marijuana and cocaine — to “ push questions of who I was out of my mind . ”
The new president is unlikely to make any official change in policy before he has a new DEA chief and drug czar in place .
Yet experts believe it is already clear the Obama administration will change the strategy , if not the law , on medical marijuana .
Philip Heymann , a former deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration who is now a Harvard professor , said it ’s time for the agency to put more effort into fighting drugs more dangerous than marijuana .
“ I do expect him to appoint an administrator who takes marijuana less seriously than is traditional for the DEA , as I think most Americans do , ” said Heymann .
Heymann said he expects the Obama administration will eventually instruct the DEA to emphatically scale back raids on dispensaries , and conduct such raids only in instances where investigators believe a business is abusing the dispensary system as a cover for other criminal behavior .
So last week ’s raids in California may be the last of their kind .
“ The DEA ’s not likely to want to confront a new president , ” said Heymann .
“ It may simply be that they ’re behaving as they have traditionally , and they have n’t anticipated the change Obama and his spokesman are signaling . ”

Why do people do good things ?
Is kindness hard - wired into the brain , or does this tendency arise via experience ?
Or is goodness some combination of nature and nurture ?
Dacher Keltner , director of the Berkeley Social Interaction Laboratory , investigates these questions from multiple angles , and often generates results that are both surprising and challenging .
In his new book , Born to Be Good : The Science of a Meaningful Life , Keltner weaves together scientific findings with personal narrative to uncover the innate power of human emotion to connect people with each other , which he argues is the path to living the good life .
Keltner was kind enough to take some time out to discuss altruism , Darwinism , neurobiology and practical applications of his findings with David DiSalvo .
DISALVO : You have a book that was just released called Born to Be Good : The Science of a Meaningful Life .
What in a nutshell does the term “ born to be good ” mean to you , and what are you hoping people learn from reading the book ?
KELTNER : “ Born to be good ” for me means that our mammalian and hominid evolution have crafted a species — us — with remarkable tendencies toward kindness , play , generosity , reverence and self - sacrifice , which are vital to the classic tasks of evolution — survival , gene replication and smooth functioning groups .
These tendencies are felt in the wonderful realm of emotion — emotions such as compassion , gratitude , awe , embarrassment and mirth .
These emotions were of interest to Darwin , and Darwin - inspired studies have revealed that our capacity for caring , for play , for reverence and modesty are built into our brains , bodies , genes and social practices .
My hopes for potential readers are numerous .
I hope they learn about the remarkable wisdom of Darwin and the wonders of the study of emotion .
I hope they come to look at human nature in a new light , one that is more hopeful and sanguine .
I hope they may see the profoundly cooperative nature of much of our daily social living .
DISALVO : You ’ve said that one of the inspirations for your work was Charles Darwin ’s insights into human goodness .
Because most people equate his name with “ survival of the fittest , ” it ’ll probably be surprising to many that Darwin focused on goodness at all .
What were a few of your take aways from Darwin ’s work that really inspired you ?
KELTNER : What an important question .
We so often assume both in the scientific community , and in our culture at large , that Darwin thought humans were violent and competitive and self - interested in their natural state .
That is a misrepresentation of what Darwin actually believed , and where the evolutionary study of human goodness is going .
My take aways from Darwin are twofold , and as you suggest above , I was surprised as well in arriving at an understanding of Darwin ’s view of human nature .
The first take away is found in Descent of Man , where Darwin argues that we are a profoundly social and caring species .
This idea is reflected in the two quotes below , where Darwin argues that our tendencies toward sympathy are instinctual and evolved ( and not some cultural construct as so many have assumed ) , and even stronger ( or perhaps more ethical — see his observation about the “ timid man ” below ) than the instinct for self - preservation :
“ For firstly , the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of his fellows , to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them , and to perform various services for them .
…
Such actions as the above appear to be the simple result of the greater strength of the social or maternal instincts than that of any other instinct or motive ; for they are performed too instantaneously for reflection , or for pleasure or even misery might be felt .
In a timid man , on the other hand , the instinct of self - preservation might be so strong , that he would be unable to force himself to run any such risk , perhaps not even for his own child . ”
The second take away comes from close study of Darwin ’s Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals , published one year after Descent of Man .
There , Darwin details descriptions of emotions such as reverence , love , tenderness , laughter , embarrassment and the conceptual tools to document the evolutionary origins of these emotions .
That led me to my own work on the physiology and display of these remarkable emotions , and to the science - based conclusion that these emotions lie at the core of our capacities for virtue and cooperation .
DISALVO : You recently wrote an article with the provocative title “ In Defense of Teasing . ”
Because we ’re ostensibly a society set against teasing in any form ( school , workplace , and so on ) , what do you think teasing has to offer that we might be missing ?
KELTNER : Teasing is the art of playful provocation , of using our playful voices and bodies to provoke others to avoid inappropriate behaviors .
Marc Bekoff , a biologist at the University of Colorado , Boulder , has found in remarkable work with coyotes that they sort out leaders from aggressive types in their rough - and - tumble biting .
The coyotes that bite too hard in such provocative play are relegated to low status positions .
We likewise accomplish so much with the right kind of teasing .
Teasing ( in the right way , which is what most people do ) offers so much .
It is a way to play and express affection .
It is a way of negotiating conflicts at work and in the family .
Teasing exchanges teach children how to use their voices in innumerable ways — such an important medium of communication .
In teasing , children learn boundaries between harm and play .
And children learn empathy in teasing , and how to appreciate others ’ feelings ( for example , in going too far ) .
And in teasing we have fun .
All of this benefit is accomplished in this remarkable modality of play .
DISALVO : Your team at U.C. Berkley has done a lot of interesting research on the vagus nerve and its association with altruistic feelings .
Tell us a bit about this research and its implications for better understanding the nature of altruism .
KELTNER : The vagus nerve is part of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system .
It is a bundle of nerves that originates in the top of the spinal cord , it activates different organs throughout the body ( heart , lungs , liver , digestive organs ) .
When active , it is likely to produce that feeling of warm expansion in the chest , for example when we are moved by someone ’s goodness or when we appreciate a beautiful piece of music .
University of Illinois , Chicago , psychiatrist Steve Porges long ago argued that the vagus nerve is a care - taking organ in the body ( of course , it serves many other functions as well ) .
Several reasons justify this claim .
The vagus nerve is thought to stimulate certain muscles in the vocal chamber , enabling communication .
It reduces heart rate .
Very new science suggests that it may be closely connected to oxytocin receptor networks .
And it is unique to mammals .
Our research and that of other scientists suggests that the vagus nerve may be a physiological system that supports caretaking and altruism .
We have found that activation of the vagus nerve is associated with feelings of compassion and the ethical intuition that humans from different social groups ( even adversarial ones ) share a common humanity .
People who have high vagus nerve activation in a resting state , we have found , are prone to feeling emotions that promote altruism — compassion , gratitude , love , happiness .
Arizona State University psychologist Nancy Eisenberg has found that children with elevated vagal tone ( high baseline vagus nerve activity ) are more cooperative and likely to give .
This area of study is the beginning of a fascinating new argument about altruism — that a branch of our nervous system evolved to support such behavior .
DISALVO : Oftentimes we learn about intriguing academic work being done on emotions , morality and related areas , but are left asking , “ OK , but how do we do any of this ?
Is there anything we can make actual use of here ? ”
Looking down the road , what do you want the impact of your work to be out in the world ?
KELTNER : I have always felt that our science is only as good as the truthful rendition of reality that it provides and the good that it brings to our species .
In summarizing the new science of emotion in Born To Be Good , I was struck by how useful this science is .
The ancient approaches to ethics and virtue — for example , found in Aristotle or Confucius — privileged things such as compassion , gratitude and reverence .
A new science of virtue and morality is suggesting that our capacities for virtue and cooperation and our moral sense are old in evolutionary terms , and found in emotions that I write about in Born To Be Good .
And a new science of happiness is finding that these emotions can be readily cultivated in familiar ways , bringing out the good in others and in oneself .
Here are some recent empirical examples :
Meditating on a compassionate approach to others shifts resting brain activation to the left hemisphere , a region associated with happiness , and boosts immune functions .
Talking about areas of gratitude , in classrooms , at the dinner table or in the diary , boosts happiness and social well - being and health .
Experiences of reverence in nature or around morally inspiring others improves people ’s sense of connection to others and sense of purpose .
Laughing and playing in the face of trauma gives the person perspective upon life ’s inevitable difficulties , and improves resilience and adjustment .
Devoting resources to others , rather than indulging a materialist desire , brings about lasting well being .
This kind of science gives me many hopes for the future .
At the broadest level , I hope that our culture shifts from a consumption - based , materialist culture to one that privileges the social joys ( play , caring , touch , mirth ) that are our older ( in the evolutionary sense ) sources of the good life .
In more specific terms , I see this new science informing practices in almost every realm of life .
Here again are some well - founded examples .
Medical doctors are now receiving training in the tools of compassion — empathetic listening , warm touch — that almost certainly improve basic health outcomes .
Teachers now regularly teach the tools of empathy and respect .
Executives are learning the wisdom around the country of emotional intelligence — respect , building trust — that there is more to a company ’s thriving than profit or the bottom line .
In prisons and juvenile detention centers , meditation is being taught .
Are you a scientist ?
Have you recently read a peer - reviewed paper that you want to write about ?

VIENNA , Jan 25 ( Reuters ) - The United Nations ’ crime and drug watchdog has indications that money made in illicit drug trade has been used to keep banks afloat in the global financial crisis , its head was quoted as saying on Sunday .
Vienna - based UNODC Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa said in an interview released by Austrian weekly Profil that drug money often became the only available capital when the crisis spiralled out of control last year .
“ In many instances , drug money is currently the only liquid investment capital , ” Costa was quoted as saying by Profil .
“ In the second half of 2008 , liquidity was the banking system ’s main problem and hence liquid capital became an important factor . ”
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime had found evidence that “ interbank loans were funded by money that originated from drug trade and other illegal activities , ” Costa was quoted as saying .
There were “ signs that some banks were rescued in that way . ”
Profil said Costa declined to identify countries or banks which may have received drug money and gave no indication how much cash might be involved .
He only said Austria was not on top of his list , Profil said .

Hey everyone , I ’m Shawn Baxter ( Snow ) from Capcom - Unity .
Our amazing Resident Evil 5
Demo goes live today on PSN , so I thought I ’d tease you a bit with some of the cool things to expect , whether you ’re an old fan or new to the series .
One of the first things I noticed is how good the game looks .
It ’s hard to get by the beauty RE5 has to offer .
Better still , you get to play through two beautiful stages in the demo .
Aside from the sweet graphics , there ’s plenty more that the demo has to offer .
For those new to the series , the controls can seem a bit different than you may expect .
The RE brand has always forced you to take your time , stop while shooting , and conserve your ammo .
It really helps add a sense of tension a normal shooter ca n’t offer .
But to help those who are new to the world of RE , we have new control types that ease things up a bit .
My favorite is Type A , which is probably best if you ’re a fan of the previous games , especially RE4 .
Next on my list is Type D , which I find myself loving more and more .
Type D is best if you ’re new to the game , and it offers something the others do n’t …
Strafing !
May seem like a simple thing , but in a game as tense as RE5 , it can really help in those situations where you have little time to react .
Alright , so I ’m sure you ’ll love the graphics and controls , but there ’s something even better that the Resident Evil 5 demo has to offer : Co-op .
Best part is , you can play co-op online over the PSN , or even split - screen for some couch co-op .
Now , of course you can play single player , but nothing beats actually playing through with someone who can plan and strategize with you .
For an RE game , the fact that I can play with a buddy adds a whole new level of fun .
Nothing like getting into a swarm of Majini , and having your partner shoot a few in the face so you can uppercut or flip - kick one of them !
Once you ’ve played through the demo , you may want to try taking on the Executioner ( huge axe - guy ) with a buddy .
The first time you play through the demo , run !
He is extremely tough .
But once you get comfortable with the game and controls , try and bring him down .
I ’ve tried , and he is extremely hard , but it is indeed possible to kill him , so do n’t give up .
Oh , and a quick tip I ’ve found is to aim for the heads on the Majini so they stagger back .
Chest shots work , but one shot to the head means only one bullet expended , then push Square to pull off one of the crazy powerful melee attacks .
If you get them to fall on the ground , run up to him and stomp ’em with your boot or stab with the knife if you ’re playing as Sheva !
February 2nd is just around the corner , so add me to your friends list , and I ’ll catch you online for some co-op Majini butt - kickin ’ !

At the centre of this programme is a controversial overeating experiment that aims to identify exactly what it is about some people that makes it hard for them to gain weight .
The world is affected by an obesity epidemic , but why is it that not everyone is succumbing ?
Medical science has been obsessed with this subject and is coming up with some unexpected answers .
As it turns out , it is not all about exercise and diet .
At the centre of this programme is a controversial overeating experiment that aims to identify exactly what it is about some people that makes it hard for them to bulk up .
If one looks at the weekly forecasts , they are considerably higher than the monthly actual amounts .
This seems to happen on a regular basis .
For the year 2008 , EIA 's forecasts averaged 654,000 barrels a day higher than I would have estimated based on weekly data .
This is about 3.4 % high - not great if that is the basis for statements about how demand is running .
On the post I put up yesterday called " A Few Thoughts about Petroleum Demand , Inventories , and Price " , a couple of people commented that my forecasts of expected petroleum demand did n't match up well with recent weekly surveys .
There is a reason for this , which is illustrated by EIA 's demand numbers for December which were released today :
The 654,000 barrel a day high bias is mostly on the " other than gasoline " portion of demand .
Weekly gasoline demand averaged " only " 193,000 barrels a day higher than the corresponding monthly amount , or about 2.2 % high .
Other than gasoline weekly demand estimates averaged 461,000 barrels a day high , or 4.4 % high .
Part of the problem seems to be misestimation of petroleum exports .
These have been chronically underestimated , and affect diesel more than anything else -- with is part of my " other than gasoline " pot .
But other portions have been mis-estimated as well -- tending in the direction of what amounts used to be .
Thus , if exports are increasing , the estimates tend to be more in the direction of too little exports .
When driving dropped off during the summer , the estimates tended to show too little impact .
During the hurricane disruption , the weekly estimates tend to show too little impact of the hurricanes .
The EIA makes two kinds of comparisons to a year ago :
• Comparison to the original four week average demand estimates
• Comparison to the four week average demand , adjusted to the actual level ( correct exports , etc )
Without looking carefully at the data , one cannot tell what one is looking at .
If the high bias continues to be in the data , what you really want is a comparison of the most recent four week average estimate with the weekly estimates a year ago , before they were corrected to the actual level .
This seems to be the approach TWIP uses .
The Weekly Petroleum Status Report seems to use the adjusted four week total as the base for its comparison .
Thus , it compares the amount from a year ago , at its true lower level , with a current estimate , which if experience holds up , is probably too high .
Using this approach , one gets the indication that total products supplied is only down 0.8 % for the most recent four weeks .
This is true if somehow the EIA suddenly started estimating the recent numbers without the high bias .
If the weekly numbers still have a high bias , the real indication is that demand is down something like 4 % ( 3.4 % average bias , plus 0.8 % change gives expected demand down about 4.2 % ) .
Of course , at some point EIA may start getting the weekly estimates right , in which case one does n't have to worry about this issue .
Until then , if you see something that looks like great news about demand bouncing back , check carefully to see how the numbers are calculated .
RIO DE JANEIRO , Feb 11 ( Reuters ) -
The war against drugs is failing and the U.S. government should break with " prohibition " policies that have achieved little more than cram its prisons and stoke violence , three former Latin American presidents said on Wednesday .
The respected former presidents urged the United States and Latin American governments to move away from jailing drug users to debate the legalization of marijuana and place more emphasis on the treatment of addicts .
Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said there was no meaningful debate over drugs policy in the United States , despite a broad consensus that current policies had failed .
" The problem today in the U.S. is that narco - trafficking is a crime and so any politician is fearful of talking about narco - trafficking or talking about policies because they will be called soft , " he said .
Gaviria has joined with former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to try to change the debate on drugs in Latin America , where trafficking gangs have killed tens of thousands of people and weakened democracies through corruption .
From Mexico's gang wars to the drug - funded FARC guerrilla group in Colombia and daily shoot - outs between gangs and police in Rio de Janeiro 's shantytowns , much of the region is scarred by drug violence and many believe U.S. policies have failed .
A United Nations meeting in Vienna next month will frame international drugs policy for the next 10 years , and the three former presidents , whose group is called the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy , said it is time for change .
They pointed to falling street prices for cocaine and still high levels of consumption in the United States despite decades of policies focused on punishing users and cutting supplies from Latin American countries such as Colombia .
' PREJUDICES , FEARS '
The presidents ' commission released a report calling on governments to refocus policies toward treating users , move toward decriminalizing marijuana , and invest more in education campaigns .
It said current policies were rooted in " prejudices , fears and ideological visions " that inhibited debate .
Even as the group met in Rio on Wednesday , police arrested 51 people in a major operation in the city and other states against a suspected drug smuggling ring that sent cocaine to Europe and brought back synthetic drugs like Ecstasy .
Organized crime has flourished around drugs and is now threatening the stability of Mexico , where a spiraling war between rival gangs killed more than 5,700 people last year .
Cardoso , one of Latin America 's most respected figures , said U.S. leadership was essential to break the cycle of drug - related crime and violence .
" It will be almost impossible to solve Mexico 's problems and other countries ' problems without a more ample , comprehensive set of policies from the U.S. government , " he said .
Despite winning power on broad promises of change , drugs policy featured little in U.S. President Barack Obama 's election campaign and there are few indications that he will embark on a major overhaul .
Gaviria said Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its repressive approach as Latin America and Europe move toward treating drug abuse as a health problem rather than a crime .

In the PLT discussion list thread titled “ How to handle large data ” , Kenichi wanted to load a very large file into DrScheme , 120,000 lines long , and it was hanging .
Noel explained that because of debugging and performance instrumentation , DrScheme adds a lot of overhead , and that MzScheme could load the file just fine .
Eli explained that DrScheme ’s overhead could be made much smaller by making the contents of that file one big piece of quoted data , and that the overhead could be completely eliminated by putting the data in a file and then loading it .
The following code is a generalization of the two approaches that he described there , which were tailored to Japanese postal data .

Representative Dennis Kucinich plans to introduce a resolution in the House soon calling for an immediate ceasefire .
There are a number of whereases in the draft , recounting the human toll of the war and the blockade , but the punchline is very simple :
< blockquote > Resolved , That the House of Representatives calls on the Government of Israel and representatives of Hamas to implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and to allow unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza .
</ blockquote >
" A resolution has co-sponsors , " a Kucinich staffer once said .
It 's great that Dennis is on the floor of the House telling the truth .
But it 's terrible for the prospects of changing disastrous U.S. policies towards the Palestinians for Dennis to be standing alone .
Who will co-sponsor the Kucinich ceasefire resolution ?
So far the original cosponsors include John Conyers , Keith Ellison , Maurice Hinchey , Marcy Kaptur , Jim McDermott , Nick Rahall , Diane Watson , and Lynn Woolsey .
When the House voted on AIPAC 's resolution endorsing the war , five people voted no : Dennis Kucinich , Gwen Moore , Ron Paul , Nick Rahall , and Maxine Waters .
Twenty - two Democrats voted " present , " including many who had spoken strongly against the resolution and / or against the war : Neil Abercrombie , Earl Blumenauer , Peter DeFazio , John Dingell , Donna Edwards , Keith Ellison , Sam Farr , Raul Grijalva , Maurice Hinchey , Hank Johnson , Carolyn Kilpatrick , Barbara Lee , Betty McCollum , Jim McDermott , George Miller , Jim Moran , John Olver , Donald Payne , Loretta Sanchez , Pete Stark , Diane Watson , and Lynn Woolsey .
On July 19 , 2006 , Kucinich introduced a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon .
That resolution was co-sponsored by : Neil Abercrombie , Tammy Baldwin , Wm. Lacy Clay , Emanuel Cleaver , John Conyers , Danny Davis , Peter DeFazio , Lloyd Doggett , Bob Filner , Raul Grijalva , Maurice Hinchey , Michael Honda , Sheila Jackson - Lee , Marcy Kaptur , Carolyn Kilpatrick , Barbara Lee , Betty McCollum , Jim McDermott , Cynthia McKinney , Gregory Meeks , George Miller , Gwen Moore , James Moran , John Olver , Major Owens , Nick Rahall , Charles Rangel , Bobby Rush , Louise Slaughter , Hilda Solis , Pete Stark , Nydia Velazquez , Maxine Waters , and Lynn Woolsey .
If everyone listed above who is currently a Member of Congress co-sponsored the Kucinich resolution , the resolution would have about fifty sponsors .
And that would be a good start .
It would give a very different message to the world than five people voting no on the AIPAC resolution .
And it would encourage other Members of Congress to take a first step away from the disastrous policies that Congress has been supporting .
Of course every Member of Congress should be hearing from their constituents .
But , if your Member of Congress is on the above list , you have a special responsibility to act now to ask your Representative to co-sponsor the Kucinich resolution .

Migrate Visual Studio C and C++ projects to Eclipse CDT
A step - by - step guide to moving Microsoft VS projects to Eclipse C/C++ Development Toolkit
The Eclipse Platform is an open source tool to assist you with moving a project from the design to the test phase within a single development environment and without the need for separate tools for each stage .
Eclipse was developed to assist the tools development community , concentrating on the core functionality of the tool instead of concentrating on the IDE itself .
This is achievable because of programming model of Eclipse , which supports software building blocks called plug-ins .
Originally , Eclipse started with Java programming IDE , as it was the need of the hour .
Because of its extensibility , it was embraced for developing applications for other programming languages , such as COBOL and C/ C ++.
The focus of this article is on C and C++ applications .
Most C and C++ projects for deployment on Windows are developed using Microsoft Visual Studio .
This article provides a step - by - step procedure for migrating Microsoft Visual Studio C/C++ ( MSVC ) projects to Eclipse .
Along the way , we compare and contrast the benefits of using MSVC and Eclipse CDT .
Prerequisites
Eclipse Platform Download Eclipse from the Eclipse Foundation .
Eclipse C++ Development Toolkit ( CDT )
Get this Eclipse plug - in for C and C++ development ( see About CDT ) .
Visual Studio / Platform SDK
This should be your current development IDE for C/C++ applications in Windows .
The recent version of Platform SDK ( MSVC Express ) is undergoing some changes that restricts you to building executables in the conventional way using an nmake makefile .
This article assumes you are building the executable through a makefile .
Be sure to identify the version you are using .
See Related topics for links to download each .
Visual Studio and Eclipse compared
Microsoft Visual Studio has a long history with wide use among Windows application developers .
It is the leader in C and C++ Microsoft Windows application development , as well .
By contrast , Eclipse CDT is relatively new and quite popular these days in the developers community .
Eclipse CDT is designed to satisfy the developers of many OS platforms , such as Linux® , and is dependent on the gcc compiler and other open source tools .
There are many ways of comparing Eclipse with Visual Studio .
One can compare the user interface ( UI ) , architecture , cost , manageability , and many other criteria .
Since this article looks at C and C++ development , we compare and contrast the strengths of both the tools with respect to C and C++ application development for Windows .

About CDT
Eclipse C++ Development Toolkit ( CDT ) is an extension to the Eclipse platform in the form of a plug - in .
This plug - in is available for download for all platforms .
The open source nature of the plug - in with its user - friendliness makes it more popular not just among the Linux developers but also among C++ developers on other platforms .
CDT and the Web Tools plug-ins are the two most popular Eclipse plug-ins .
Nearly two out of three developers using CDT are Windows users .
CDT has subcomponents or plug-ins that are independent projects in the CDT community .
The most important is the CDT primary plug - in , which provides the core CDT capabilities .
CDT Debug UI provides the UI capabilities for the debug editors and views .
CDT UI plug - in provides the UI - related features , views , editors , wizards , etc. CDT Debug provides core debugging capabilities .
CDT Feature provides CDT Feature component .
CDT core presents Core Model , CDOM , and other core components .
CDT
Launch provides launch mechanism for launching external executables and tools .
CDT Debug MI is the application connector for MI - compatible debuggers .
CDT editors have several features that make them popular .
For example , syntax highlighting and code assist make software development quick and easy .
Syntax highlighting is configurable and can be personalized to your individual taste .
Code assist is the code completion feature that is similar to the one in Visual Studio .
Custom - defined code templates can be added to the plug - in , which can be used by code assist .
In the following sections , we will learn how to use CDT effectively to migrate the Visual Studio projects to the Eclipse CDT Workbench .
VS to Eclipse
In this section , we migrate a simple HelloWorld Win32 application developed using Microsoft Visual C++ 6 .
If you do not have an existing Win32 application , create a HelloWorld Win32 application using Visual Studio .
Create a makefile from the Projects > Export Makefile menu in Visual Studio .
Figure 1 . Create a HelloWorld Win32 application using Visual Studio
Start Eclipse and open the C/C++ perspective .
Select Window > Open Perspective > Other Figure 2a . Open the C/C++ perspective Select C/C++ perspective Figure 2b . Select C/C++ perspective
Note : C/C++ perspective will be listed in the Select Perspective dialog only if the CDT plug - in is installed .
Create a standard C/C+ +
Make project via File > New > Standard Make C++ Project .
Name the project HelloEclipse in the Project Name edit box in the New Project dialog that appears and click Finish .
Figure 3a .
It 's HelloWorld time Figure 3b .
Name your project HelloEclipse
Now we have to import the files created by Visual Studio into Eclipse .
Go to File > Import .
Select Filesystem in the Import dialog and click Next .
If the newly created project is not visible , go to Window > ShowView > C/C++ project .
Figure 4 . Import the HelloWorld Visual Studio project files
Browse to the directory where the Visual Studio project was created , select the *.c* , *.h*,*.rc , *.ico and the .mak file to be imported and click Finish .
Figure 5 . Import the *.c* , *.h*,*.rc , *.ico and .mak files
Addition of environment variables Figure 6 .
Add environment variables
Right - click on the project and select Properties .
In the Properties for HelloEclipse dialog , select C/C+ +
Make Project on the left side , and add INCLUDE and LIB environment variables to point to Visual Studio 's include and lib paths .
If you are using the platform SDK , point to its include and lib directories .
Figure 7 .
Point the Visual Studio include and lib paths in the right direction
Open the .mak file imported from the Visual Studio project and make the following changes : Change the configuration ( CFG ) from Debug to Release so we get a release version of the application .
It would look like CFG= HelloWin - Win32 Release .
Figure 8a .
Change the configuration from Debug to Release
Add the command for executing the application in the ALL : tag : @cmd /c $ ( OUTDIR ) \$( EXENAME ) .exe Define EXENAME=HelloWin Figure 8b . Define EXENAME
The next step is to create a new make target .
Right - click on our current project and click on Create Make Target .
Figure 9a .
Create a new make target Create a make target for our project .
" Target name " specifies any name you wish .
" Make target " specifies the .mak file we just modified in the previous step .
" Build command " is specified by unchecking the Use default checkbox in the build command so the build command is nmake .
To make the Make targets view visible , go to Window > Show View > Make Targets .
Figure 9b .
The make target should be HelloWin.mak
Double - click on the HelloEclipse target we created to build and run the Win32 application .
Figure 10 .
Run the application
With VC ++ 2005 Express , making many changes in the traditional Visual Studio C/ C++ , there is a project initiated at Eclipse to solve this issue .

Challenges to Eclipse CDT as an IDE for Windows development
Let 's look at the various challenges posed by Eclipse CDT in various phases of the software development cycle .
Design
UML has become the de-facto standard for representing and designing software applications using object - oriented languages .
IBM offers two Eclipse - based Java development tools : Rational® Application Developer and Rational Rose® XDE Developer for Java technology .
Both offer model - driven development with UML support , Java code round - trip engineering , automatic or on - demand model - code synchronization , and other helpful features .
Though we have a UML plug - in for Eclipse , there is no tight integration between UML to C/ C++ in Eclipse platform today .
Development
Visual Studio's most interesting feature is its resource editor .
Whether it's the SDK or MFC resource editor , both are used extensively to develop the static UI controls for the application .
Today , Eclipse CDT offers no support to develop a UI .
Consider using the Eclipse visual editor project when generating .rc files for Windows development .
Microsoft changes its compilers between versions , which makes it a challenge for Eclipse CDT to support the various versions of SDK tools Microsoft releases .
It is not viable today for you to migrate MSVC code totally to open source .
In Linux , such an undertaking is complex .
The SDK tools of Microsoft cannot run on open source , such as Linux .
The SDK tools have to be run within the Windows emulator to make the SDK tools run on Linux .
However currently in Windows platform , developers with the help of platform SDK , Eclipse CDT and Debugging Tools for Windows can see Eclipse platform as an alternative for MS Visual Studio .
Debugging
Eclipse CDT relies on GNU Debugger , GDB .
GDB is a source - level debugger for C , C++ , Ada , and other languages .
Neither Eclipse nor GDB understand the debugging information generated by Microsoft compilers .
As a result , it is a challenge to select CDT as a full - time development environment for Windows development .
However , you can use Debugging Tools for Windows for debugging side by side with Eclipse as a development environment .
Testing
CppUnit is the testing framework for C/C++ similar to JUnit for Java .
The CppUnit plug - in for Eclipse is also available and can be used side by side with CDT for testing the CPP code .
See Related topics for a CppUnit tutorial .
Tools and other criteria
Apart from normal SDK development on Windows , Visual Studio supports many other developments , including DDK , . NET , WMI , Web development , IE component development , MDAC , and more .
More contributions are expected in this space from Eclipse plug - in development community .
All open source tools , such as listdlls , process explorer , and task handler , can be considered to provide support inside Eclipse CDT , which can bridge this gap to a certain extent .
Conclusion
The growing popularity , versatility , and open source nature of Eclipse motivates many to embrace Eclipse as the development platform of the future .
Nevertheless , porting Windows applications to use open source development tools like GCC , GDB , or GCC / GDB for Windows providing functionalities similar to Windows SDK is a nontrivial task today .
However , Eclipse is an effective open source alternative to visual studio when we consider the entire SDLC phases .
With more and more plug-ins supported in Eclipse for C/C++ application development in Windows , Eclipse CDT may become a default IDE for C/C++ development for Windows .

In an age where the record industry is trending back towards singles , but still trying to sell albums , mixtapes have become indispensable promotional tools , much to the chagrin of record execs everywhere .
Hustlers know that they work , even if it can all be a bit much ; you got to give them a taste before you can get them hooked .
It ’s a tried and true method that ’s been around as long as the game , but is now becoming more ubiquitous , not to mention ambitious in scope and scale .
It ’s hard to wade through them all , especially when you ’ve got Lil Wayne putting out 17,000 in the last two years , or Charles Hamilton doing one a month for a year , but that does n’t mean there are n’t a lot that are worthwhile .
Even better , nearly all of them are available for free download .
Here are a few recent ones that have caught my attention .
Theophilus London – This Charming Mixtape
This Brooklyn - born MC ’s debut mixtape has probably been my favorite of this young year , and not just because Theophilus pulled on the nerd - strings of my heart with his Elvis Costello - inspired cover .
The tape starts with an impassioned reading of Amadou & Mariams ’s “ Sabali ” and ends with a rousing gospel choir singing “ Happy Day , ” and does n’t let up for second in between .
The rhymes have got swagger to spare , but it ’s the production that keeps this one in heavy rotation .
Chopping up Whitney Houston ’s “ I Will Always Love You ? ” A lot better idea than you ’d think .
Chopping up Bill Withers ’ “ Ai n’t No Sunshine ” ?
Works exactly as well as you ’d think .
I really appreciate a rapper willing to take risks , and This Charming Mixtape is full of them .
In fact , if this were a proper album , I think it ’d be massive .
Unfortunately , it ’d probably be impossible to get all the samples cleared .
Either way , this is the rare mixtape with no annoying DJ - drops .
When you play it all the way through at a party it keeps people dancing the entire time .
I would know , because I did .
J.Period & Q - Tip – The [ Abstract ] Best
After taking a nine - year break , the Tribe Called Quest vet more than made up for the hiatus with The Renaissance .
That album brought his production up to the 21st century , but if you forgot what made him a legend in the first place , this mixtape serves as a great history lesson .
Fresh tributes from the likes of Kid Cudi mingle with classics from the likes of De La Soul , on a well - curated mix by venerated DJ and remix specialist J. Period .
And if that was n’t enough , Stevie Wonder ’s verse is worth the price of admission alone .
And in this case , the price is nothing .
Paper Route Gangstaz – Fear and Loathing in Hunts Vegas
This might not be the most adept comparison , but Fear and Loathing in Hunts Vegas reminds me of a Numero Group compilation .
It ’s regionalistic , and it ’s music that will most likely be completely forgotten about six months from now ( despite connections to Diplo ) and will probably only sell a few thousand copies in the meantime .
The production is crappy , but in a good way , if that makes sense .
It ’s not crappy cause someone did n’t try hard enough , it ’s crappy because they did n’t have enough money .
Just like those tiny , forgotten soul labels .
The hunger is palpable , but that ’s the case on most of those CDs guys are always asking you to listen to when you walk down the street .
What keeps me coming back to this one is the incredible range of samples , and talented emceeing .
They go from singing about dirt roads , grandmothers and collards over a sped - up sample of Sam Cooke ’s “ A Change Is Gonna Come ” to “ Grind Baby , ” built over a Weezer track .
As a bonus , Wale guests , and odds are if that dude ’s on a track , the mixtape is legit .
Fasten your seat belts — data transfer is going into overdrive .
The ubiquitous Universal Serial Bus , better known as USB , is on track to make its first major upgrade in eight years — a tenfold speed increase over the current USB 2.0 standard .
That means we 'll be able to rip music , video , photos from the vast array of peripherals we connect to our computers much more quickly , and it makes such up - and - coming devices as HD video cameras that much more practical .
USB 3.0 will also deliver greater power efficiency and the ability to recharge a wider variety of gadgets — and it will most likely mean the death of the competing standard known as FireWire .
To get a sense of the speed increase , consider this : Under USB 2.0 it takes about 10 minutes to transfer a high - def video from a Blu-ray disc .
With USB 3.0 , it will take just about a minute .
" What the user will see is really a much faster response time , less waiting , more productivity , " says Patrick Moorhead , vice president of advanced marketing at AMD , one of the supporters of the USB 3.0
standard .
But none of this will happen tomorrow .
The first USB 3.0 devices probably wo n't show up until the end of
2009 or early 2010 , say analysts .
Users can get a glimpse into future devices sporting SuperSpeed USB as early as the annual Consumer
Electronics Show in January , and Wired.com will be there .
" The first places that you will see this show up is where you get the biggest benefits — HD video cameras and hard drives , " says Moorhead .
The USB Implementers Forum , a nonprofit group founded by companies to promote the standard , will announce Monday the final set of specs that will clear the way for the adoption of USB 3.0 by device and component manufacturers .
" USB 3.0 will take USB 2.0 to the next level and take away performance as an issue for data transfer in many devices , " says Brian O'Rourke , an analyst with research firm In - Stat .
" USB 3.0 will make it even more pervasive across devices than it is today . "
Since the USB specification was first introduced in 1996 , it has changed the way we interact with our computers .
USB has allowed everything from keyboards , mouse , PDAs , printers , digital cameras and personal media players — pretty much the entire spectrum of consumer electronics — to be connected to a host PC using a single standardized socket .
It has also made the process truly plug - and - play .
Devices can be connected and disconnected without having to reboot the host computer and the technology offered perks such as allowing for many devices to be charged using the USB socket with no need for individual device drivers to be installed first .
Not surprisingly , USB 's ease of use and capabilities has meant it has become nearly ubiquitous .
More than 2.6 billion USB - enabled devices were shipped in 2007 , estimates research firm In - Stat .
And USB 's star will continue to rise , says the firm .
Nearly four billion USB - enabled devices are expected to ship by 2012 .
Its ubiquity has meant that some manufacturers use USB ports and plugs for recharging devices such as Bluetooth headsets and phones without utilizing its data - transfer capabilities .
But USB 2.0 is getting a bit long in the tooth , with its slow speed , inefficient power usage and relatively small wattage .
The new standard takes aim at all of those shortcomings .
Pour on the Speed
At a glance : USB 3.0
Faster : 10 times faster than USB 2.0 and six times faster than FireWire 800 Greater power efficiency : New interrupt driven protocol optimizes power management .
Better Power Output : Power output bump to 900 milliamps from 100 milliamps allows more devices to be charged faster via USB .
Backward Compatible : New connectors and cables will work with work with devices running the older USB 2.0
The new spec will support data transfers at 4.8 gigabits per second , or Gbps , nearly 10 times faster than the current standard 's 480 megabits per second and six times faster than FireWire 800 .
It 's also 400 times faster than the 12 Mbps offered by the original spec , USB 1.0 .
USB 2.0 is also known as " Hi - Speed USB , " while USB 3.0 will have the confusingly similar moniker " SuperSpeed USB . "
The new USB 3.0 connectors and devices will be compatible with older USB ports ( on devices using USB 2.0 and 1.0 ) but they will be limited to the older ports ' slower speeds .
Power and Efficiency
USB 2.0 uses a polling - based architecture , which means the host computer has to constantly check the bus to see if any devices are attached and if so , whether they are doing anything .
As a result , that keeps the host computer busy , drawing power even when it 's not needed .
" It 's a problem when you attach a USB device to a laptop running on battery , " says Steve Kleynhans , vice president , client computing for research firm Gartner .
USB 3.0 offers better specifications for power management .
" We will move to an interrupt - driven architecture where your PC can ignore the connected device till the latter actually does something , " says Kleynhans .
" That can really lower the power consumption . "
It also has better power output , 900 milliamps compared to 100 milliamps with USB 2.0 .
That means up to four devices can be charged from a single USB port and charged faster .
Standardizing the specifications for USB 3.0 has n't been easy .
Two months ago , Intel released part of the draft specifications for USB 3.0
to developers resolving a dispute between itself , Nvidia and AMD over it .
Nvidia and AMD claimed that Intel was not sharing the specifications that potentially compete with it .
Intel denied it .
" There was some debate between us , " says Moorhead , " but we have buried the hatchet and we are all in the same boat now . "
USB Implementers Forum chairman Jeff Ravencraft declined to be available for comment .
While
USB 3.0 devices are coming soon , consumers wo n't immediately see all the benefits .
" You can get the USB 3.0 speeds only when one 3.0 device connects to another , " says Gartner 's Kleynhans .
So the latest SuperSpeed USB - enabled devices connecting to older PCs running USB 2.0 or lower will experience data transfer rates that are much slower .
Killing FireWire
USB 3.0 is likely to signal the death of FireWire / IEEE 1394 , a competing interface standard also known as i.
Link and Lynx .
Today , the industry is bifurcated between IEEE 1394 and USB 2.0 .
Many devices support both , though a single standard would be optimal .
" If we are all aligned , we are saving money and development time for the industry , " says Moorhead .
With
Apple seemingly taking step away from FireWire , it seems like USB could gain the upper hand .
Apple 's newly introduced MacBook computers lack a
FireWire port and instead has USB .
MacBook Pro still sports FireWire
800 .
That leaves Sony as one of the few remaining proponents of the standard .
" FireWire stably declining in most markets and USB 3.0 will continue that trend , "
says O'Rourke .
" We could see USB emerge as the standardization of a high - speed interconnect . "
Monday 's first USB 3.0 developer conference will be a big step towards that , say experts .
" It 's for everyone in the USB value chain , from chipmakers to software makers to learn the new USB standard and get on it , " says O'Rourke .

Peel Regional Police Thursday night laid charges against a Toronto man who terrified fellow airline passengers by trying to open a door midflight over the Dominican Republic .
Peel investigators flew to Punta Cana , where the plane made an unscheduled stop , and charged Adrian Worrell , 33 , of Toronto with endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight , mischief endangering life and several assaults , a police spokesperson said .
Police returned with the prisoner Thursday night .
The man is charged in connection with events on Skyservice Airlines flight 828 , which originated Tuesday in Grenada and stopped in Barbados , bringing the passenger list to 202 .
It reached Toronto one day late on New Year 's Eve because of the emergency .
Problems started with an argument over legroom , witnesses said .
The man began hitting the fully reclined seat in front of him , after the plane had reached cruising altitude .
" I heard a loud banging , " passenger Beresford Moseley of Barbados , seated five rows ahead of the disturbance , recounted after arriving at Toronto 's Pearson airport .
" The flight attendant told him to stop , " said Shery Henry of Toronto , who also turned around to look .
" All of a sudden he got up .
He started running up the aisle , then he went from side to side trying to open the emergency exit doors .
" He tried both , " Henry recalled .
" He said , ` God sent me .
I 'm supposed to kill myself and take you with me . '
I started screaming and crying . "
A flight attendant called for help .
Six to eight men tackled the man , the witnesses said .
Two male flight attendants and the passengers tied him with his own belt and with straps used to secure babies .
" He said , `I like the pain .
Give me more pain , '. "
Henry recalled .
" A flight attendant told me and others , ` If he gets away from them , do n't let him get to the flight deck , '. "
Moseley said .
" We got to tackle him next . "
But it was over .
The man was immobilized .
Half an hour later , the plane made an unscheduled landing at the eastern tip of Dominican Republic in Punta Cana .

Neanderthal genome to be unveiled
The entire genome of a 38,000 - year - old Neanderthal has been sequenced by a team of scientists in Germany .
The group is already extracting DNA from other ancient Neanderthal bones and hopes that the genomes will allow an unprecedented comparison between modern humans and their closest evolutionary relative .
The three - year project , which cost about 5 million euros ( US $ 6.4 million ) , was carried out at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig .
" We are working like crazy at the moment , " says project leader Svante Pääbo , adding that his Max Planck colleague , computational biologist Richard Green , is coordinating the analysis of the genome 's 3 billion base pairs .

And while the Republicans continue to wallow in their flop sweat and hypocrisy , with the news of the Panetta pick for the CIA , the Democrats show that they are once again the unparalleled masters at fratricide :
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , who this week begins her tenure as the first female chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said today that she was not consulted on the choice and indicated she might oppose it .
“ I was not informed about the selection of Leon Panetta to be the CIA director , ” Feinstein said .
“ My position has consistently been that I believe the agency is best served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time . ”
The choice of Panetta was seen as a sign that Obama considered it more important to have a steady political hand and astute manager at the helm of the agency , rather than someone with deep operational experience .
In picking Panetta , Obama risks raising anew questions about the politicization of the CIA , a concern cited by leading congressional officials .
A senior aide to Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va. ) , outgoing chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said that the senator “ would have concerns ” about a Panetta nomination .
Rockefeller “ thinks very highly of Panetta , ” the aide said .
“ But he ’s puzzled by the selection .
He has concerns because he has always believed that the director of CIA needs to be someone with significant operational intelligence experience , and someone outside the political realm . ”
THE HYPNOTIST , dangling a swinging pocket watch before the subject ’s eyes , slowly intones : “ You ’re getting sleepy … You ’re getting sleepy … ”
The subject ’s head abruptly slumps downward .
He is in a deep , sleeplike trance , oblivious to everything but the hypnotist ’s soft voice .
Powerless to resist the hypnotist ’s influence , the subject obeys every command , including an instruction to act out an upsetting childhood scene .
On “ awakening ” from the trance half an hour later , he has no memory of what happened .
In fact , this familiar description , captured in countless movies , embodies a host of misconceptions .
Few if any modern hypnotists use the celebrated swinging watch introduced by Scottish eye surgeon James Braid in the mid-19th century .
Although most hypnotists attempt to calm subjects during the “ induction , ” such relaxation is not necessary ; people have even been hypnotized while pedaling vigorously on a stationary bicycle .
Electroencephalographic ( EEG ) studies confirm that during hypnosis subjects are not in a sleeplike state but are awake — though sometimes a bit drowsy .
Moreover , they can freely resist the hypnotist ’s suggestions and are far from mindless automatons .
Finally , research by psychologist Nicholas Spanos of Carleton University in Ontario shows that a failure to remember what transpired during the hypnosis session , or so - called posthypnotic amnesia , is not an intrinsic element of hypnosis and typically occurs only when subjects are told to expect it to occur .
The Consciousness Question
The iconic scene we described at the article ’s outset also raises a deeper question :
Is hypnosis a distinct state of consciousness ?
Most people seem to think so ; in a recent unpublished survey , psychologist Joseph Green of Ohio State University at Lima and his colleagues found that 77 percent of college students agreed that hypnosis is a distinctly altered state of consciousness .
This issue is of more than academic importance .
If hypnosis differs in kind rather than in degree from ordinary consciousness , it could imply that hypnotized people can take actions that are impossible to perform in the waking state .
It could also lend credibility to claims that hypnosis is a unique means of reducing pain or of effecting dramatic psychological and medical cures .
Despite the ubiquitous Hollywood depiction of hypnosis as a trance , investigators have had an extremely difficult time pinpointing any specific “ markers ” — indicators — of hypnosis that distinguish it from other states .
The legendary American psychiatrist Milton Erickson claimed that hypnosis is marked by several unique features , including posthypnotic amnesia and “ literalism ” — a tendency to take questions literally , such as responding “ Yes ” to the question “ Can you tell me what time it is ? ”
We have already seen that posthypnotic amnesia is not an inherent accompaniment of hypnosis , so Erickson was wrong on that score .
Moreover , research by Green , Binghamton University psychologist Steven Jay Lynn and their colleagues shows that most highly hypnotizable subjects do not display literalism while hypnotized ; moreover , participants asked to simulate hypnosis demonstrate even higher rates of literalism than highly hypnotizable subjects do .
Other experts , such as the late University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist Martin Orne , have argued that only hypnotized participants experience “ trance logic ” — the ability to entertain two mutually inconsistent ideas at the same time .
For example , a hypnotist might suggest to a subject that he is deaf and then ask him , “ Can you hear me now ? ”
He may respond “ No , ” thereby manifesting trance logic .
Nevertheless , research by the late Theodore X. Barber , then at the Medfield Foundation , and his colleagues showed that participants asked to simulate hypnosis displayed trance logic just as often as hypnotized people did , suggesting that trance logic is largely a function of people ’s expectations rather than an intrinsic component of the hypnotic state itself .
Brain Changes
Still other investigators have sought to uncover distinct physiological markers of hypnosis .
Under hypnosis , EEGs , especially those of highly suggestible participants , sometimes display a shift toward heightened activity in the theta band ( four to seven cycles per second ) .
In addition , hypnotized participants frequently exhibit increased activity in their brain ’s anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) .
Yet neither finding is surprising .
Theta activity is typically associated with states of quiet concentration , which frequently accompany hypnosis .
The ACC is linked to the perception of contradictions , which many hypnotized participants experience as they imagine things — such as childhood experiences in the present — that seem to conflict with reality .
Further , psychologists have reported similar brain changes among awake subjects .
For example , the ACC becomes activated during the famous Stroop task , which requires subjects to name the colors of ink ( such as “ green ” ) in which competing color words ( such as “ blue ” ) are printed .
Thus , these brain changes are not unique to hypnosis .
Fueling the perception of hypnosis as a distinct trancelike state is the widespread assumption that it leads to marked increases in suggestibility , even complete compliance to the therapist ’s suggestions .
Nowhere is this zombielike stereotype portrayed more vividly than in stage hypnosis shows , in which people are seemingly induced to bark like dogs , sing karaoke and engage in other comical behaviors in full view of hundreds of amused audience members .
Yet research shows that hypnosis exerts only a minor impact on suggestibility .
On standardized scales of hypnotic suggestibility , which ask participants to comply with a dozen suggestions ( that one ’s arm is raising on its own power , for example ) , the increase in suggestibility following a hypnotic induction is typically on the order of 10 percent or less .
Moreover , research demonstrates that a formal hypnotic induction is not needed to produce many of the seemingly spectacular effects of hypnosis , such as reduction of extreme pain or various physical feats , popular in stage hypnosis acts , such as suspending a participant horizontally between the backs of two chairs .
One can generate most , if not all , of these effects merely by providing highly suggestible people with sufficient incentives to perform them .
Stage hypnotists are well aware of this little secret .
Before beginning their shtick , they prescreen audience members for high suggestibility by providing those people with a string of suggestions .
They then handpick their participants from among the minority who comply .
We agree with Lynn and psychologist Irving Kirsch of the University of Hull in England , who wrote in 1995 that “ having failed to find reliable markers of trance after 50 years of careful research , most researchers have concluded that this hypothesis [ that hypnosis is a unique state of consciousness ] has outlived its usefulness . ”
Increasingly , evidence is suggesting that the effects of hypnosis result largely from people ’s expectations about what hypnosis entails rather than from the hypnotic state itself .
Still , it is always possible that future studies could overturn or at least qualify this conclusion .
In particular , research on potential physiological markers of hypnosis may elucidate how hypnosis differs from other states of consciousness .
Although hypnosis poses fascinating mysteries that will keep scientists busy for decades , it seems clear that it has far more in common with everyday wakefulness than with the watch - induced trance of Hollywood crime thrillers .

I 've been gaming for close to 20 years now .
In that span of time , we 've gone from 16 - bits to 64 - bits to no longer using bits to describe the amazing level of graphic detail appearing on screen .
The world of side - scrolling action games like Contra has given way to sandbox - style games like Grand Theft Auto and the bullet - time pioneer Max Payne .
We 've seen the rise and fall of arcades , and each year expands the capacity for online play , expansions and party linking .
Gaming has evolved in every way but one – the level of acceptable conversation regarding gaming and gaming critique .
It never fails to amaze me how a debate can break out over the number of strings on a certain guitar used in Rock Band or other items of gaming trivia , but the very concept of talking about race or gender in videogames is considered verboten .
Journalist N'Gai Croal calls race " the third rail of gaming journalism " with good reason – his comments on the problematic racial imagery in Resident Evil 5 unleashed a firestorm all over the internet , causing major gaming sites like Kotaku and Destructoid to ask their audiences to breathe , and actually think about what N'Gai said in his piece before jumping to conclusions .
Such threads remind me that in many ways I am seen as a curious outlier in the general gaming equation .
I am both black and female , which stands in stark contrast to the generally accepted ideal of a gamer .
In Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat , an academic collection exploring gaming and gender disparities , Nicole Lazzaro 's essay Are Boy Games Even Necessary ?
breaks down how the industry came to construct the identity of a gamer :
At its formation , the game industry used traditional market research data to understand and segment the market .
They came up with their target customer : a 23 - year - old single male technophile .
The vast majority of computer games still focus on the tastes and preferences of the industry 's first adopter , chasing him as he gets older .
Because the average game player is 33 years old ( ESA 2006 ) , games offer more mature themes , lifting experiences from R- rated movies like Rambo .
However , this identity construct has been stubbornly held out as the industry standard , even as innovations like the Nintendo Wii redefined the market for video games , even as research notes that women constitute 52 % of self - identified casual gamers , and 74 % of those willing to pay for gaming content , and even as more and more women become vocal about their love of video games .
It is this idea of " the single ( white ) male technophile " that contributes to the myopia of both the gaming industry and the more obnoxious players and informs the assumptions that most of the people on the game boards happen to be white and male , regardless of their actual identification .
It also leads to a commonly accepted culture of harassment , where those who identify themselves as women and minorities are subject to gender - and race - based harassment , simply for letting people know that they are different .
Bullying people into silence rarely provides space for the perspectives needed to grow and improve the gaming industry .
And the net result is that many gamers just leave large forums and go to seek out our own communities .
I started gaming with groups of people – first my cousins , then my friends .
The people I game with now are a diverse group .
As biracial , Latina , Asian and African - American women , we seek out other gamers to play with and expand our social circles without engaging with the larger online communities .
While we read the larger blogs for news and gossip from the industry , many of us engage on sites like Gamers of Color , Cerise , Women Gamers or The Escapist , where raising questions about the racial and sexual politics of a game will actually result in a conversation , instead of endless denials and circular conversations .
The only flaw with this strategy is that by staying in our own respective areas we effectively cede the conversation to those who wanted to silence us in the first place .
And the worst of it is that we really are n't asking for all that much .
It is entirely possible to have a discussion of all the innovative things Resident Evil 5 is doing with the franchise ( like the introduction of light as a major thematic element in a survival horror game ) while calling out issues with racially charged imagery ( like the images in the demo , detailed by Eurogamer ) .
One can have a discussion of morality in the Grand Theft Auto series while simultaneously discussing the overall sexism within the game .
It is not impossible to become a socially conscious gamer .
All it takes is a willingness to discuss issues in gaming openly and honestly .
And yet , for some reason , gamers are afraid to actually take a long look at the entertainment they enjoy and to admit that yes , something could potentially be racist or sexist .
This does n't mean it 's a horrible game that should be banned – it just means these are things to understand and potentially fix for the next instalment of the series .
Why is it so hard just to have a conversation ?
What are we afraid of ?
TT Games and Warner Bros .
Interactive Entertainment have teamed up once again to deliver an all - new Lego experience to the Nintendo DS , this time simply focusing on the toys themselves with Lego Battles .

Lego Battles is a game for the Nintendo DS that combines three popular Lego toy lines - Lego Castle , Lego Pirates and Lego Space - allowing players to create bases and customized squads in order to engage in more than 70 different levels worth of fierce block combat , or head - to - head via Nintendo DS wireless multi-card play .
Players will mix and match units from all three Lego sets , resulting in epic confrontations the likes of which we 've only dreamed about .
A pirate ship filled with ninja versus a spaceship manned by wizards ?
It 's the kind of stuff you 'd find airbrushed on the side of a van 30 years ago .
“ LEGO ®
Battles offers players the action - packed and humor - filled gameplay that make LEGO games great , along with the added bonus of linked multiplayer battles on DS , ” said Tom Stone , Managing Director , TT Games Publishing .
“ We are excited to introduce a new LEGO videogame experience to fans and young gamers and look forward to expanding upon the beloved toy lines . ”

So the next Lego title from TT games is n't Lego Transformers .
It 's time to see if the Lego brand can stand on its own two blocking legs .
Look for Lego Battles to erupt on the Nintendo DS this summer .
Governor Blagojevich Angers , Frightens Prop Townspeople
By Marcus Gilmer in News on Jan 9 , 2009 9:50 PM
The first person that came through the door at the Governor 's press conference was n't Blago , but rather a man in a wheelchair .
He was the first of several " ordinary " citizens that stood beside the Governor as he gave his impassioned , defiant , and arrogant speech .
But what did these Citizen Props think of the Governor ?
This man is very angry .
Whether it 's because he was napping in his office ( as we would have been ) or because the Governor is just plain pissing him off is unclear .
But what is clear is that he is n't having any of Blago 's bull .
This man is terrified .
Mostly because he is the first line of defense .
There is nothing else between him and Blago .
We would wet ourselves if we were that close to The Hair .
Clearly , Blago possesses powers beyond our comprehension .
He appears to have used the Force , a la Darth Vader , to incapacitate this toddler .
While she dreams of unicorns and gumdrops , Blago is free to go about his scheme .
Update :
The always stellar Best Week Ever has a pretty funny breakdown of their own .

As many as 25 people are feared dead
At least 23 people have been killed in Madagascar after police opened fire on an opposition demonstration in the island nation 's capital , reports say .
Some reports suggest that as many as 30 people may have been killed .
There have been repeated protests against the dismissal of Antananarivo Mayor Andry Rajoelina , who is engaged in a power struggle with the president .
The sacked mayor accuses President Marc Ravalomanana of misspending public money and being a dictator .
" Up to now , 25 are dead , " an unnamed senior police officer at the scene was quoted by Reuters as saying .
The fire brigade said at least 23 people had been killed , AFP news agency said , while local media reported that 30 people were killed .
The crowd was walking peacefully , then all of a sudden , the military opened fire

Demonstrators had been marching towards President Ravalomanana 's compound when riot police opened fire .
Earlier , during a rally attended by 20,000 people , the former mayor 's supporters had declared him head of a " transition higher authority " .
Unarmed protesters Immediately after the shooting , Mr Rajoelina said on Viva Radio : " The people were not armed , they only had their courage . "
It is not clear if he was with the demonstration when the shooting broke out .
There were dozens of injured people at the city 's main hospital .
Jocelyn Ratolojanahary , whose hand was bandaged , told Reuters .
She said : " The crowd was walking peacefully , then all of a sudden , the military opened fire . "
President Ravalomanana reportedly blamed the opposition leader for the violence .
" He ( Rajoelina ) led people to take the presidential palace by force and did n't know how to control them , " Mr Ravalomanana told state television , according to Reuters news agency .
Mr Rajoelina was sacked by the government on Tuesday and replaced as mayor by Guy Randrianarisoa , a local city official .
Mr Rajoelina , who has successfully tapped into widespread frustration with the government , has said he would set up a transitional administration unless the president steps down .
Dozens of people were killed in unrest in January after anti-government protests turned into rioting and looting .
Madagascar , the world 's fourth - largest island , has become a destination for tourists as well as foreign companies , searching for oil , gold , cobalt , nickel and uranium .

Erlang ’s dynamic nature came in useful for me on BeerRiot last night .
I ’ve blogged about hot code loading before , but last night I dipped into the world of OTP applications and Mnesia .
We have a phrase around the office : “ Do it live ! ”
It comes from the incredible freakout of Bill O’Reilly .
We use it to mean something along the lines of , “ This is a startup .
The plan might change at any time .
Changes go to production when we need them to , and we roll with bugs as best we can . ”
Far from encouraging careless , fickle choices , it ’s a reminder that the camera is on , we ’re live , and we are actively developing a product that is under close scrutiny .
Luckily , we have the power of Erlang behind us .
The dynamic nature of the language and runtime is a fantastic fit for an environment in which things may change at a moment ’s notice .
Erlang ’s dynamic nature also came in useful for me on BeerRiot last night .
I ’ve blogged about hot code loading before , but last night I dipped into the world of OTP applications and Mnesia .
I realized late yesterday afternoon that I had left the login code in a state where usernames were case - sensitive .
People could have signed up as “ Bryan ” and “ BRYAN ” , even though I already owned the login “ bryan ” .
Basically , I was lazy ; the username lookup code was roughly :
%% Name is the test username as read out of the http request mnesia:transaction ( fun ( ) -> mnesia:match_object(#person{name=Name , _= '_'} ) end ) .
What I needed to do was downcase both the test name and the stored name , and compare those results .
I could have just tossed in a call to string : to_lower and reloaded the login module , except that I ’m trying to support UTF - 8 everywhere .
To downcase a UTF - 8 string , I needed another library ( because I ’m not going to both implementing my own ) .
Google pointed me in the direction of Starling .
Despite the strange build process [ ] , starling provides an Erlang interface to the ICU libraries , to enable unicode manipulations .
A quick build and test , and we have
LowerName = ustring : downcase ( ustring : new ( Name ) )
Toss an application : start ( starling ) in the BeerRiot startup code , and everything ’s set to go … but why would I want to restart the webserver ?
Restarting is lame – we ’re doing it live !
Instead of restarting , we ’ll connect to the webserver through an erl shell ( see my earlier hot code loading post about doing this ) and modify the running system .
We just need two simple commands to get this done .
1> code:add_paths ( [ " / path/to/starling/ebin " ] ) . ok 2 > application : start ( starling ) .
Command 1 tells Erlang to add a path to its library loading search .
Command 2 starts the starling application .
Starling is now up and running , and we can ustring : downcase / 1 as much as we want .
But , I really do n’t want to downcase every stored username every time .
It ’s also kind of nice for people ’s usernames to display as they typed them , but not require the same capitalization in their login form .
So , I ’ll need to store the downcased version somewhere , in addition to keeping the original .
I could put it in a new table , mapping back to the persons table , but it ’s person data – let ’s keep it with the person .
I need to add a field to my person record .
But if I do that , all of my code looking for a person record of the current format will break .
I need to update all of my person records in storage as soon as I load the code with the modified person record definition .
Mnesia gives us just the tool for this : mnesia:transform_table / 3 .
All we have to do is provide a function that knows how to translate an old person record into a new one .
Something like this will do :
% % old def : - record ( person , {id , name} ) . % % new def : - record ( person , {id , name , login} ) .
add_login( ) -> mnesia:transform_table ( person , fun( {person , Id , Name} ) -> { person , Id , Name , ustring : downcase ( ustring : new ( Name ) ) } end , record_info ( fields , person ) .
Stick that code in the person module , where the person record is defined .
Now , connect back to the webserver and simply :
3 > l( person ) .
{ module , person} 4 > person:add_login( ) .
There ’s a short period of time in there , between the ends of commands 3 and 4 where any code that looks up a person record will break .
But , it ’s short , and the entire rest of the site will continue functioning flawlessly .
And that ’s the amazing power of Erlang .
A very brief , very limited hiccup , and new functionality is deployed .
Assuming the appropriate code was put in place to start everything up on restart , the system will come up in exactly the state you want it if the server should ever reboot .
Now back to tinkering … 🙂
I oughta ‘ make ‘ you ‘ rake ’ my lawn , which you ’re on , by the way , sonny .

A Palestinian injured by Israeli air strikes in Gaza arrives at Nasser hospital in Cairo , Egypt , 30 December 2008 .

GAZA
CITY
IRIN

As of the night of 30 December the death toll from the Israeli offensive had reached 380 , with 1,800 wounded , according to the Gaza health ministry .
The UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) said 30 children and nine women were among the dead and 250 children had been injured .
Fifteen medical patients passed through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt for emergency care on that day , said WHO .
Hospitals in the enclave have been overwhelmed by the trauma cases flowing into emergency rooms since the morning of 27 December .
An official from the Palestinian Medical Relief Society , Aed Yaghi , said at a press conference on 30 December that there were 2,053 hospital beds in Gaza , and warned it was not enough .
“ One hundred and fifty patients were brought in at once , ” said Khaled Abu - Najar , a staff nurse in al - Shifa ’s emergency room .
“ We lack beds , sterile gloves , sheets , scissors and gauze to treat patients . ”
Shortages
He said there were shortages of chest tubes , forceps , artery clamps , ventilators and monitors .
Nearly half of the emergency room staff are volunteers recruited since 27 December , said Abu - Najar .
“ We are short of rooms and supplies , we are up to our necks , ” said Ramez Zyara , one of nine general surgeons working 24 - hour shifts at al - Shifa .
The small team treated hundreds of patients on 30 December for crush injuries and severe trauma .
“ The buildings are falling on the heads of the patients , ” said Zyara .
The intensive care ( ICU ) , burns , orthopedic and surgery units have reached capacity , said al - Shifa hospital director Hussein Ashur , while 10 of the 12 operating rooms are being used for emergency care .
There are 25 life support systems — also used to measure a patient ’s blood pressure , temperature , oxygen circulation and heart activity — in the ICU of al - Shifa .
“ We need at least 25 more , ” said Ashur .
He also said there were shortages of dressings , and gauze used in X - ray machines .
“ We have not received medical supplies at al - Shifa for three months , ” said Ashur .
The first emergency medical aid deliveries reached Gaza on 30 December .
Some 90 trucks — 53 supplied by aid agencies — entered via the Kerem Shalom crossing , according to WHO .
Kamal Adwan hospital
Kamal Adwan is the primary hospital serving Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya .
Jabaliya , Gaza ’s largest refugee camp , is home to 300,000 .
The hospital lacks medicine , including basic antibiotics , analgesics and hydrocortisone , said hospital director Bassam Abu - Warda .
“ If there is a major Israeli invasion we will collapse , ” warned Abu Warda .
“ On Saturday [ 27 December ] 93 patients came for emergency care ; we had to set up make - shift beds . ”
Since 27 December Abu - Warda has added 24 beds to the existing 71 .
Paramedics at Kamal said they did not have enough staff , medical supplies or ambulances .
Magdi Hatib , 48 , witnessed his brother , Akram Hatib , 35 , torn apart by burning shrapnel from an Israeli missile on 27 December in the Beach refugee camp of Gaza City , home to Gaza prime minister Ismail Haniyeh .
“ He was bleeding on the ground for 15 minutes till we could approach him , fearing a second explosion , ” said Magdi .
“ There were no ambulances , so we took him to al - Shifa hospital by taxi . ”
Rafah tunnels bombed
Israel bombed dozens of tunnels in the Rafah area on 30 December , saying they were used by Hamas for smuggling weapons .
Health ministry spokesperson Hamam Nasman said shipments of Egyptian fuel were the only means of running his fleet of ambulances , half of which are not operating due to a lack of spare parts — a result of the border closures by Israel since June 2007 when the elected Hamas government took over in the enclave .
The tunnels have been used to import fuel , cooking gas , medicine and food supplies to circumvent the Israeli blockade .
Residents flee their homes
Meanwhile , residents in Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya were fleeing their homes in anticipation of further bombardments .
“ We evacuated our home last night — my wife and our two - year old son Karim , ” said Sami Abu Salem , 38 , an editor , after the Israeli authorities warned residents the home of a militant leader in the area would be targeted .
“ We took basic food items with us and we are still afraid to return , ” said Abu Salem .
The Coastal Municipalities Water Utility in Gaza said that if the water supply network is damaged it will be impossible to repair , due to the lack of fuel and spare parts .
Access for aid agencies to Gaza has been severely restricted since the beginning of November .
A ground invasion would make matters worse .

The Consumerist has noticed a seemingly slight but very important ( and disturbing ) change in Facebook 's terms of service , regarding user - generated content .
In short , all of the content you 've ever uploaded on Facebook can be used , modified or even sublicensed by Facebook in every possible way - even if you quit the service .
The TOS says the following :
You hereby grant Facebook an irrevocable , perpetual , non-exclusive , transferable , fully paid , worldwide license ( with the right to sublicense ) to ( a ) use , copy , publish , stream , store , retain , publicly perform or display , transmit , scan , reformat , modify , edit , frame , translate , excerpt , adapt , create derivative works and distribute ( through multiple tiers ) , any User Content you ( i ) Post on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof subject only to your privacy settings or ( ii ) enable a user to Post , including by offering a Share Link on your website and ( b ) to use your name , likeness and image for any purpose , including commercial or advertising , each of ( a ) and ( b ) on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof .
It also used to contain another bit that is now missing .
You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time .
If you choose to remove your User Content , the license granted above will automatically expire , however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content .
This is also reinforced by the " Termination " section :
The following sections will survive any termination of your use of the Facebook Service : Prohibited Conduct , User Content , Your Privacy Practices , Gift Credits , Ownership ; Proprietary Rights , Licenses , Submissions , User Disputes ; Complaints , Indemnity , General Disclaimers , Limitation on Liability , Termination and Changes to the Facebook Service , Arbitration , Governing Law ; Venue and Jurisdiction and Other .
Sure , most users do n't really care ( or think they do n't care ) about all this , but the idea that you now cannot stop Facebook from using your content should you ever want to is frightening to say the least .
Is Facebook Connect the reason ?
Commenter OrtensiaCadmium on Consumerist finds a probable reason for this change in Facebook TOS .
" That 's fairly common language in terms for various sites such as Facebook .
While it gives Facebook some far - reaching and scary possibilities , the basic idea is that things you upload may end up residing on servers outside of Facebook 's direct control .
These broad rights make it so that you can't sue Facebook for some cached content on some other server ... "
Yes , with Facebook Connect in place , it 's likely that Facebook simply must do this in order to avoid possible lawsuits over content that is n't even stored by them anymore .
However , the same commenter rightfully notices that " ... yes , it also means they can sell your photos or use them in advertising with no recompense to you . "
It 's not just your stuff , it 's everyone 's stuff
The possible implications of this TOS change go beyond these concerns .
Sure , you can choose not to use Facebook at all , but that does n't mean a thing .
Someone can still take your photo , slap it on Facebook , and now neither you nor the author of the photo can stop Facebook from using the photo in whichever way they please .
Looking at it globally , millions of people are uploading bits of information on everyone and everything , to a huge online database , and by doing so they 're automatically giving away the rights to use or modify this information to a private corporation .
And not only that ; they now also waiver the right to ever take it back from it .
Facebook should take a long , deep look into how it treats its users .
Until now , users had options with regards to how the data they generated on Facebook was used .
Now , they have no options whatsoever , rather than quit the service altogether .
It 's a major difference ; I 'm not going to take it lightly , and neither should you .
This clip wins at internet .
Let 's face it .
Most fan mash - ups are NOT full of win .
But not since chocolate accidentally fell into an open jar of peanut butter have two things belonged together so much .
And just in case you have n't blown your nerdgasmic wad ... Have you seen the ( poorly shot but ultimately awesome ) swiped footage from last year 's Comic - Con of the upcoming TR2N ???
The announcement of a new ‘ Green Ammunition ’ for the military brings up an interesting question .
Can war be eco-friendly ?
I find it interesting ( twisted , actually ) that something that is designed to kill can be called green .
Now , before you castigate me for being a peacenik hippie who ’s missing the point ( yes , I am a peacenik ) , let ’s look at the issue .
Some definitions of ammunition :
A projectile for firing from a rifle , revolver , or other small firearms , typically of metal , cylindrical and pointed , and sometimes containing an explosive .
Projectiles , such as bullets and shot , together with their fuses and primers , that can be fired from guns or otherwise propelled .
Nuclear , biological , chemical , or explosive material , such as rockets or grenades , that are used as weapons .
[ social_buttons ]
That about covers it , does n’t it ?
What other purpose could ammunition serve , other than to maim , kill , or otherwise mangle a person until they are no longer functioning ?
So how does that fit into the green theme ?
Population reduction ?
The thought that the military is trying to be more eco-friendly when killing people ( I understand that we consider the people killed to be ‘ enemies ’ , but they ’re still people , yes ? ) goes contrary to my personal belief that wars do n’t solve anything .
They never have .
What wars do create is a huge demand for supplies and weaponry , including ammunition .
And who profits ?
The arms manufacturers and dealers do .
War also creates environmental hazards to those who live near the conflicts ( but are n’t killed by the ammunition ) , to those who live near training grounds , and to the soldiers themselves .
According to the press release about the green ammunition :
“ Mk281 does not contain toxic chemicals or energetic materials , which aligns it with the Department of Defense ( DoD ) and Environmental Protection Agency ’s joint mission to solve Unexploded Ordnance ( UXO ) issues .
The Army ’s current 40 mm training cartridge , M918 , is a 1970 ’s pyrotechnic design that contains heavy metals in the fuze and potassium perchlorate in the flash / bang payload .
It takes 6 - 10 million training rounds each year to keep war - fighting skills sharp , and with a fuze failure rate of 3 % - 8 % , M918 creates an annual taxpayer bill of > $ 500 M in UXO clean - up costs .
By presidential executive order , the DoD is required to buy “ green ammunition ” for use on all training ranges .
According to the Defense Science Board ’s 2003 , written for the DoD , 40 mm “ green ammunition ” is critical to conquering UXO issues . ”
Well , there ya go .
Ammunition without toxic chemicals .
Killing and training to kill with eco-friendly weapons .
Repeat after me : “ Just call it green and it ’s all good … ”

President Barack Obama has lifted a ban on federal funding for foreign family planning agencies that promote or give information about abortion .
The US is one of the biggest supporters of family planning programmes globally , but former president George W Bush blocked funds for abortion services .
Powerful anti-abortion groups in the US have criticised the lifting of the ban .
But aid agencies welcomed the move , saying it would promote women 's health , especially in developing countries .
A White House spokesman said Mr Obama signed the executive order without asking for coverage by the media late on Friday afternoon .
The issue of abortion services remains controversial in the US , pitting anti-abortion groups against pro-choice Americans who back a woman 's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion .
The BBC's Richard Lister in Washington says this may be why President Obama signed the order with so little fanfare .
Highly contentious Organisations that had pressed Mr Obama to make the abortion - ban change were jubilant .
Today [ President Obama ] is effectively guaranteeing more abortions by funding groups that promote abortion as a method of population control
Douglas Johnson
National Right to Life Committee
Enormous implications
They called the funding ban the " gag rule " because it cuts funds to groups that advocate or lobby for the lifting of abortion restrictions .
The Planned Parenthood Federation of America hailed the president for " lifting the stranglehold on women 's health across the globe with the stroke of a pen . "
" No longer will health care providers be forced to choose between receiving family planning funding and restricting the health care services they provide to women , " the organization said in a statement .
But anti-abortion groups were quick to criticise the reversal of the funding ban .
" President Obama not long ago told the American people that he would support policies to reduce abortions , but today he is effectively guaranteeing more abortions by funding groups that promote abortion as a method of population control , " said Douglas Johnson , legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee .
A 1973 decision by the US Supreme Court legalised abortion .
A Gallup poll conducted last year showed that 54 % of Americans think abortion should be allowed under certain circumstances , 28 % believe it should be legal under any circumstances , while 17 % back a total ban .
See - saw issue
The policy has become a see - saw issue between Republican and Democratic administrations .
HAVE YOUR SAY I am personally opposed to abortion .
However , as a US citizen , I would rather see uncensored information available to all Jim Nordblom , Mapleton , USA Former President Bill Clinton , a Democrat , repealed the policy when he took office in 1993 and George W Bush reinstated it in 2001 .
The ruling is also known as the Mexico City Policy , because it was first introduced at a UN conference there in 1984 by former Republican President Ronald Reagan .
In a move related to the lifting of the abortion rule , Mr Obama is also expected to restore funding to the UN Population Fund ( UNFPA ) in the next budget , the AP news agency reported .
The Bush administration contended that the fund 's work in China supported a Chinese family planning policy of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation , claims the UNFPA has vehemently denied .
In a separate move earlier on Friday , US regulators cleared the way for the world 's first study on human embryonic stem cell therapy .
While the decision of the US Food and Drug Administration is independent of White House control , Mr Obama is widely expected to adopt a more pragmatic and science - oriented approach to stem cell research .

A Domain - Specific Language for the Generation of Optimized SIMD - Parallel Assembly Code
Christopher Kumar Anand , Wolfram Kahl
SQRL Report No. 43
26 pages
Software Quality Research Laboratory
Department of Computing and Software
McMaster University
May 2007
Abstract
We present a domain - specific language ( DSL ) embedded into Haskell that allows mathematicians to formulate novel high - performance SIMD - parallel algorithms for the evaluation of special functions .
Developing such functions involves explorations both of mathematical properties of the functions which lead to effective ( rational ) polynomial approximations , and of specific properties of the binary representation of floating point numbers .
Our framework includes support for estimating the effectiveness of different approximation schemes in Maple .
Once a scheme is chosen , the Maple - generated component is integrated into the code generation setup .
Numerical experimentation can then be performed interactively , with support functions for running standard tests and tabulating results .
Once a satisfactory formulation is achieved , a code graph representation of the algorithm can be passed to other components which produce C function bodies , or to a state - of - the - art scheduler which produces optimal or near - optimal schedules , currently targeting the ``Cell Broadband Engine '' processor .
Encapsulating a considerable amount of knowledge about specific ``tricks '' in DSL constructs allows us to produce algorithm specifications that are precise , readable , and compile to optimal - quality assembly code , while formulations of the equivalent algorithms in C would be almost impossible to understand and maintain .

Be Part Of History -- Help NASA Name The Next Space Station Module
WASHINGTON -- NASA is asking the public to help name the International Space Station 's next module - a control tower for robotics in space and the world 's ultimate observation deck .
Eight refrigerator - sized racks in the Node 3 module will provide room for many of the station 's life support systems .
Attached to the node is the cupola , a one - of - a - kind work station with six windows around the sides and one on top .
The cupola will offer astronauts a spectacular view of their home planet and their home in space .
In addition to providing a perfect location to observe and photograph Earth , the cupola also will contain a robotics workstation from which astronauts will be able to control the station 's 57 - foot robotic arm .
Individuals can vote for the module 's name online , choosing one of four NASA suggestions -- Earthrise , Legacy , Serenity or Venture -- or writing in a name .
Submissions will be accepted Feb. 19 through March 20 .
The name should reflect the spirit of exploration and cooperation embodied by the space station and follow in the tradition set by Node 1 , named " Unity , " and Node 2 , named " Harmony .
"
The winning name will be announced at the Node 3 unveiling April 28 at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
The node is scheduled to arrive at Kennedy April 20 and is targeted for launch in late 2009 .
For more information , to submit a name and to view pictures of the node and cupola , visit :

Defense Secretary Robert Gates predicts the U.S. will be in Afghanistan for years to come .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In an article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs , Gates laid out the state of the U.S. military — and how well it is poised to face the future .
Gates , who came to his post under Bush and was asked to stay by Obama , said the ability of the United States to deal with future threats will depend on how it performs in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ To be blunt , to fail — or to be seen to fail — in either Iraq or Afghanistan would be a disastrous blow to U.S. credibility , both among friends and allies and among potential adversaries , ” Gates wrote .
Gates said the number of U.S. combat units in Iraq will decline over time – “ as it was going to do no matter who was elected president in November , ” he added .
“ Still , there will continue to be some kind of U.S. advisory and counterterrorism effort in Iraq for years to come , ” he said .
In Afghanistan , however , troop levels will likely continue to increase in the year ahead .
“ Afghanistan in many ways poses an even more complex and difficult long - term challenge than Iraq — one that , despite a large international effort , will require a significant U.S. military and economic commitment for some time , ” the defense secretary and former CIA head wrote .

Sun Station : The Free Solar Charging Station
February 3rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Yesterday , we took a look at the RITI Printer — a nifty concept printer that uses coffee grounds for ink .
But another entrant in the Core 77 Greener Gadgets Design Competition may be even more innovative : the Sun Station .
Julene Aguirre - Bielschowsky has designed a piece of public furniture that doubles as a solar energy charging station .
The Sun Station is made up of concrete , teak wood , and stainless steel .
It theoretically can provide 84 W of energy generated by monocrystalline solar cells .
The cells are located 3 meters above ground for less shading and maximum efficiency , and energy is stored in a battery pack or grid -tied system under the Sun Station ’s seat .
The device ’s socket is protected by a transparent safety cover .
A display that highlights the Sun Station ’s energy use is located under the socket .
With 94 votes , the Sun Station is one of the most popular entrants in the Greener Gadgets competition — vote now if you want it to gain even more clout .

Oh , and if you ’ve been living under a rock , the official trailer can be seen past the break .
Klein bottles are an entertaining mathematical idea–a shape with no volume .
A Klein bottle is basically a tube where the inside is connected to the outside .
Making a Klein bottle in our 3D world requires a bit of cheating to work , by adding a hole in one of the walls of the tube to provide a place for an intersection .
The most common physical realization is a glass Klein bottle , which you can ogle and buy at Acme Klein Bottles .
They also sell wonderful knit Klein bottle hats which can be bought with a matching mobius strip scarf .
I was lucky enough to be given a set as a gift , and it is cozy and bright and wonderful .
My only complaint is that the narrow neck of the Klein bottle makes it hard to pull it inside out ( or right side out , since it is the same thing ) to play with it .
I have found that the concept of a mobius strip is more understandable when you can hold it in your hands and turn it around and around , and I thought the same would be true with a Klein bottle , if only it were a little more flexible than my hat .
With that in mind , here ’s how to make a simple fabric Klein bottle you can play with from two sleeves of a worn out shirt .
You ’ll want to use something like a soft old long sleeved t- shirt .
The jersey knit gives it enough stretch to be able to play with it , and starting with sleeves means you know that you can fit your arm inside .
Cut the sleeves off , and cut off any cuff binding as well .
Cut a notch out of one of the elbows , and sew around the edges to keep it from fraying .
Slide one sleeve inside the other and stitch around the shoulders to join them together .
Then slide the uncut sleeve through the elbow hole in the other one .
Turn the sleeve that you did n’t cut a hole in inside out so that the other sleeve is inside it .
Line up the wrists and sew around the edges to complete the tube .
Reach in and pull out the center and you can see the familiar shape .
Then keep turning it inside / right side out just for fun !

Before the 1990s , only a handful of countries offered consumers any formal relief from debt , but since then , and especially in the past few years , consumers have flocked to a series of new and increasingly forgiving systems , especially in Europe .
Take , for example , France .
The just - released 2008 filing figures for the French system of " consumer overindebtedness " ( surendettement des particuliers ) show that France passed an important landmark last year .
In February 2004 , the administrative commissions in charge of delivering relief to overburdened consumers in France started referring the most hopeless cases to a new track that is functionally equivalent to a U.S. Chapter 7 -- theoretical ( but not practical ) liquidation of valuable assets followed by immediate discharge .
This new " procedure for personal re-establishment " ( procédure de rétablissement personnel ) got off to a slow start , with only about 11 % of all fully administered cases in 2004 diverted to this more aggressive form of relief , but by 2008 , that figure had almost doubled , surpassing the 20 % mark for the first time ( 21 % of the nearly 160,000 fully administered cases were diverted to the PRP last year ) .
Particularly disturbing for those who continue to insist that private ordering is the better approach , the percent of cases concluding with a consensual , creditor - accepted workout fell to 55 % this past year , down from about 65 % in 2006 and earlier years .
Creditors , it seems , are increasingly happy to wait and see what the formal , coercive system brings , rather than agreeing to write down obviously uncollectible debts .
This pattern has repeated itself in every major consumer debt relief system I 've observed , and Nick Huls and Nadja Jungmann , in particular , have written some great stuff attempting to explain this phenomenon in the Netherlands ( sorry - - I could n't find any internet examples for a link ) .
The ostensibly more rigorous European systems are offering relief to lots of people in exchange for no payment : about 80 % of some 100,000 consumer insolvency cases in Germany , and about a third of some 2500 cases annually in Sweden , for example .
With the corresponding figure rising in France annually , and especially in light of the headaches that the BAPCPA have caused in the U.S. , it is no longer altogether clear that the U.S. offers the " most liberal " consumer debt relief today .
More debts are nondischargeable in the U.S. , and the budgets that the IRS guidelines allow are in many cases less " livable " than those offered by similar guidelines in Europe .
This is a developing story , but we in the U.S. can no longer comfort ourselves after the latest round of backpeddling consumer bankruptcy reforms by saying " at least it 's still easier to get relief here -- look at those poor schmoes in Europe ! "
A federal grand jury in Birmingham today returned an indictment against a former Decatur police sergeant , who is
thought to have faked his own abduction
after stealing thousands of dollars in confiscated drug money .
Faron
White , 48 , of Falkville ,
was charged with theft from a program that receives federal funds .
He was arrested in Las Vegas earlier this month and returned to Alabama .
White also face charges in state court .
Also indicted was a civilian police volunteer with whom investigators say was having an affair with White .
Elizabeth Richardson , 29 , of Decatur , was charged with accessory after the fact .
Richardson is accused of helping White stage his disappearance .
" Theft of federal funds is a theft from taxpayers and will be prosecuted vigorously , " U.S. Attorney Alice Martin said in a prepared statement .
Authorities believe about $ 70,000 was stolen .
The Decatur Police Department has asked the FBI to conduct an audit in an effort to determine exactly how much was taken .
White , a married father of three , was a decorated police officer who was Decatur 's 2007 American Legion officer of the year .
A class action lawsuit seeking $ 200 million was filed against the Washington D.C. Water and Sewer Authority ( WASA ) by the single father of twin boys who were poisoned as infants by lead contaminated tap water .
John Parkhurst filed the suit on behalf of himself and other parents in D.C. whose children were poisoned due to extremely high levels of lead in the municipal water supply from 2001 to 2004 .
“ In June 2001 , WASA discovered that that toxic levels of lead were leaching into the District ’s drinking water .
Not only did the Authority fail to eliminate this danger , it actually took affirmative steps to hide the lead contamination from its customers and federal authorities .
At the same time , WASA encouraged the public to consume this dangerous product .
As a result , tens of thousands of children and pregnant mothers faced elevated risks for years longer than they should have .
WASA ’s actions endangered thousands of children living in the District between 2001 and 2004 , many of whom , like Jonathan and Joshua Parkhurst , are now profoundly affected by their ingestion of this highly poisonous element . ”
– Stefanie Roemer , Sanford Wittels & Heisler .
[ social_buttons ]
One expert called the contamination and WASA ’s efforts to cover up the contamination and its consequences “ the largest environmental crime in U.S. history . ”
The complaint lays out the defects associated with lead poisoning in kids , including brain damage , decreased growth , reduced IQ levels , speech and balance problems , below - average learning skills , and hyperactivity .
A recent study by Dana Best , M.D. , of Children ’s National Medical Center and Marc Edwards , Ph.D. , was cited , which found that elevated levels of lead in D.C. ’s children are directly correlated to the amount of the District ’s tap water they were exposed to .
“ For the first time , parents know who is to blame for the poisoning of their children .
The recent study shows that when the levels of lead in the District ’s water spiked , there was a 10 - fold increase in elevated blood levels of our District ’s children .
Rather than protect our children , WASA undertook Herculean efforts to shield itself from liability and to otherwise deny responsibility for seven and a half years .
Through this lawsuit , parents like Dr. Parkhurst will be able to hold WASA accountable and will be able to get the help their children so desperately need . ” – Kate Kimpel , Sanford Wittels & Heisler
Parkhurst ’s twin boys first showed evidence of lead poisoning in 2002 , during their two - year - old checkup .
They have both experienced serious behavioral and learning difficulties and been diagnosed with significant problems in attention and learning .
Parkhurst ’s costs for their medication and therapy is $ 30 K to $ 40 K per year , which will add up to a half a million dollars by the time they reach 18 .
The lawsuit requests $ 200 million in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount of money in punitive damages from WASA for failing to notify parents of young children in D.C. of the presence of lead in the drinking water , and for failing to notify them about the dangers associated with drinking the tap water .
Also listed in the complaint were the facts that WASA failed to take appropriate measures to remedy the dangers and that it continued to cover up the severity of the lead contamination from 2001 onward .
The suit asks for the establishment of a system of medical monitoring and care for the poisoned children , as well as a system of educational intervention and services for the children poisoned by the contaminated water .

President Obama emphasised cybersecurity while campaigning
A review of how well the US thwarts spies and malicious hackers has been started by President Barack Obama .
The wide - ranging review is set to last 60 days and takes in all the " plans , programs and activities " of official US cyber security efforts .
The end result will be a strategy to improve the way the US defends itself against net - borne threats .
While campaigning , President Obama likened net risks to the threat of nuclear or biological attack .
National security
" The national security and economic health of the United States depend on the security , stability , and integrity of our nation 's cyberspace , both in the public and private sectors , " said John Brennan , assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security , in a statement .
Mr Brennan said he was sure that US critical infrastructure could be protected without trampling on privacy rights and civil liberties .
The Bush administration was widely criticised for ignoring safeguards on snooping by its intrusive monitoring of phone and net traffic in the name of stopping terrorism .
The Obama cybersecurity review is being co-ordinated by Melissa Hathaway , who co-ordinated cyber- monitoring for the director of national intelligence under George Bush .
The review comes in the wake of several incidents pointing to the growing problem of cybersecurity .
In September 2008 , the US Government Accountability Office , which audits official strategies , warned that for years the Department of Homeland Security had " yet to fully satisfy its cybersecurity responsibilities . "
In November 2008 , a congressional panel warned that China had stepped up the computer - based espionage it carried out against the US .
The panel said China was stealing " vast amounts " of sensitive information from US computer networks .
In December 2008 , a report produced by the Commission on Cybersecurity said : " Cybersecurity is now one of the major national security problems facing the United States . "

It is not any one cigarette or one extra drink that is ruinous to the health .
The damage is done over the years , almost imperceptibly .
Grave threats to the health of democracy can also accrue so incrementally that they draw little attention .
A committee of peers diagnose one such danger today in a report on the steady creep of surveillance .
The charge of hysteria is routinely used to sweep aside such talk when it comes from crusading journalists and pressure groups .
The Lords constitutional affairs committee , however , cannot be dismissed the same way .
A more dignified band of dignitaries would be hard to imagine – it includes a former attorney general who is a conservative champion of that antiquated role , a Tory expert on the constitution , and a founder of that force of militant moderation that was called the SDP .
Their insistence that mundane data collection “ risks undermining the fundamental relationship between the state and the citizen ” may be dramatic , but it is rooted in careful argument .
Privacy is not only a precondition to a life of any quality , it is part of the meaning of liberty .
The rule of law in Britain is not codified in a constitution , but underpinned by shared support for the twin ideals of executive restraint and individual freedom .
Under the gaze of 4 million CCTV cameras , and in the face of the burgeoning electronic tabs being kept on citizens , both ideals are strained .
Bit by bit the state – and private firms – cease to believe that the courtroom is the place to hold individuals to account , and instead grow used to monitoring them in all sorts of contexts in the name of convenience .
Bit by bit , meanwhile , individuals learn to live with the ubiquitous prying eye .

The Child Porn Lie ( And Other Hits ) / Violet Blue :
The top five underreported sex stories of the year
Sure , we all heard about the Spitzer scandal , and the sad news that the DC Madam hung herself , but what about the sex stories no one told you about ?
A lot happened in sex this year ; did you know that Playgirl Magazine folded ( putting many gay porn stars out of work ? )
And why so little buzz that sex toys are no longer banned in Texas , a move that significantly impacted Texan vegetable industry sales , while shares of battery stocks climaxed ?
Then one study said that women are n't turned on by naked men , though they do get turned on by explicit imagery of all kinds , and another stated that most would pick the Internet over sex any day of the week .
Even though for most of us girls , the Internet is our sex toy .
Australia announced a national " mandatory " Internet filtering program against " obscene " material to the horror of many , and Britain passed a law banning " extreme " porn ( even possession is illegal ) making UK spanking enthusiasts want to spank the government right back .
Many women from British BDSM communities spoke out against the law and its infringement on their liberty .
Scholars also proved that strip clubs are not harmful to neighborhoods : American Ethnography Quasimonthly dispelled myths about the effects of adult businesses on communities with hardcore academic studies ( hardcore as in thoroughly researched and cited - mind out of the gutter , please ) .
Then , in Texas , offended parents sued a school over the school 's privacy - invading sex offender check system .
Over in Europe , people started getting threatening settlement letters for illegal porn downloads in a porn piracy witch hunt - when they had n't downloaded a thing .
And the US recession was helped along by the widespread practice of people trading sex for home loan borrower portfolios .
While substitute schoolteacher Julie Amero 's schoolroom computer pop-up porn case was resolved ( though justice went unserved ) Prince ( or The Artist Formerly Known as Loved by LGBT Communities Worldwide ) came out - as homophobic .
We found out that red state teens regularly break their abstinence pledges and pregnancy rates in the 13 - 17 age range of evangelical young girls are off the charts .
Companies started to realize that sex does n't really " sell " .
A study claimed that monogamy has to do with genetics - the " monogamy gene " , do you have it ?
Yet another study linked homophobia and homoerotic arousal .
The Craigslist Experiment troll was sued in Federal court ; he ran a fake Craigslist sex ad and published the privacy information of all who responded and now he 's facing charges for it .
COPA ( the Child Online Protection Act ) was overturned , and for good , solid constitution - upholding reasons .
Google Trends was used to show that Kentucky is the most obscene state in the nation .
( Road trip ! )
The journal of the American Psychological Association , Janis Wolak and co-researchers examined several fears about child sexual predators online - and they concluded that many are myths .
Lastly , bloggers caught the Geek Squad pilfering porn .
But of all the underreported news and developments about sex , these top five should have seen more headlines - and they might shock you :
5. Google Can't Find the Clitoris
Blogger and erotic filmmaker Tony Comstock ( comstockfilms.com , not work safe ) wanted to see what would happen when he searched for sex with the filters on .
Disturbingly , he discovered that with SafeSearch turned on , Google delivered no - zero - results for the word " clitoris , " but 33 million " safe " results for the word " penis " .
Which leaves us all wondering why a penis is somehow safer than a clitoris .
True , one could argue that because the penis is a biological reproductive organ and the clitoris is not - she exists purely for female pleasure - that one might want to protect " the children " from knowing about it .
Susie Bright said that the word " clit " was the new four - letter word .
Maybe it 's just a glitch .
Or maybe clitoris really is a myth , after all .
4. Minors : Harmful to Themselves ?
A 15 - year - old Ohio girl was charged with felony child pornography for taking naked pictures of herself .
Next , you 'll be charged for sexually abusing yourself .
Ohio , can we have a re-count , please ?
3. Bush 's Last Attacks - Aimed At Your Vagina
When having a vagina ( and control over what happens to it ) becomes a threat to morality , we all know Sheriff Bush will ride into town and save the good folk .
Or , he 'll sneak around the back door trying to put a lock on the front door , as it were .
After the Bush administration proposed and pushed regulations via the Department of Health and Human Services to define contraception ( birth control ; condoms ) as abortion - he wants to leave us ladies with a little parting gift .
As in , parting us with our right to choose .
Bush has just imposed a 127 - page rule preventing any health care provider from being fired for refusing a patient medical care on religious grounds .
So , depending on what religion of health care provider you end up with : people wo n't be able to get contraception at pharmacies , rape victims can be denied access to the morning after pill , abortions can be denied
2. Thought Crimes : Child Porn Conviction for Manga ?
Christopher Handley , an Iowa manga and comic book collector is facing obscenity charges based on erotic manga that he ordered from Japan .
The government alleges that the drawings contain images that appear to be depictions of minors engaged in sexual conduct .
Comic legend Neil Gaiman spoke out about the issue , reminding us that the laws being used against the comic collector are supposed to be for actual depictions of child porn , and that such an extreme prosecution could be leveled at Gaiman himself for comics he himself has created and sold for decades .
This appears to fly in the face of a Supreme Court ruling this year stating that " virtual child pornography , " featuring computer - generated or manipulated images but no actual children engaged in sex acts , cannot be constitutionally prohibited ( unless it is deemed " obscene " ) .
The person has to believe that they are seeing depictions of illegal sex acts .
The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund is working with the defense in Handley 's case .
1. The Child Porn Statistics Lie : Exposed
Information laundering is when someone makes a statement and then it gets quoted all around until no one knows where it came from , but takes the statement as fact .
In Statistics Laundering : false and fantastic figures , the author drilled down to the sources of oft - quoted statistics about the prevalence of child porn and found that most claims are inaccurate , misquoted or simply made up .
How can we stop it if we do n't have accurate data ?
Out - of - date , false and / or misleading " statistics " concerning the prevalence of " child porn " material on Internet Web sites wo n't save a single victim if we do n't know the facts about the real threat level of the threat .
But , sensationalism sells , even when it 's proven to be bad mojo .
Why did n't we hear more about this ?
Maybe because everyone 's still trying to find the clitoris .

LONDON , Jan 19 ( Reuters ) -
The price investors pay to insure themselves against the U.S. government defaulting on its debt jumped to a record high on Monday , according to data provider CMA DataVision .
Five - year credit default swaps on U.S. Treasuries widened to 69.5 basis points from 61.1 basis points at the New York close on Friday , CMA DataVision said .
That means investors were paying $ 69,500 a year to insure against default on $ 10 million worth of bonds .
Trading volumes were said to be reasonable considering U.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Day holiday .

Paul Krugman debunks Joe Scarborough 's talking points on how the Republican party has actually governed as compared to their rhetoric .
It would be nice if we had more progressives than just Paul Krugman who actually know something about economics allowed on our airwaves to shoot these guys down when they tell such obvious lies .
Scarborough : Let me just say though , George Bush over the past eight years had the most disastrous spending policy .
They decided to cut taxes .
They decided to increase the deficit .
They decided to increase entitlement spending while they were fighting two wars .
They made no tough decisions what so ever .
You can't say that that 's the traditional conservative approach to economics .
It was a disaster and I think we can all agree with that can we not ?
Krugman :
You 've got some mythical image of what a modern conservative is .
Reagan increased spending while cutting taxes .
Bush increased spending while cutting taxes ...
Who is your ideal here ?
Krugman follows with giving us a dose of reality from Scarborough 's talking points about how we were just so full of bipartisan love and that worked so well while Clinton was in office .... and calls what happened while he was President and Republicans controlled the Congress what it was ... gridlock .
He manages to get Scarborough to admit that we need some bold steps now if we 're going to fix the mess we 're in .
I do n't think bold is what we 're going to get as long as the Republicans feel obstructing is better for them for political purposes than actually fixing our economy .
" Have we seen the worst from the financial sector ? "

On Thursday , February 5 , 2009 , surgeons at the University of California , San Diego Medical Center removed a patient ’s diseased kidney through one incision hidden in the belly button .
No other incisions were used .
This groundbreaking procedure is the 15th in a series of single - incision clinical trial surgeries performed by the UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery .
“ The successful removal of a kidney containing a seven centimeter tumor , with a single incision , is a pivotal advancement in cancer care , ” said Ithaar H. Derweesh , MD , associate professor of surgery for the Division of Urology and urologic oncologist at UC San Diego Medical Center and Moores UCSD Cancer Center .
“ This less invasive approach offers patients a shorter recovery time , less need for pain medication , and an improved cosmetic outcome . ”
During a traditional laparoscopic surgery , three to five small abdominal incisions would be made to insert a camera and instruments to remove the kidney .
This novel surgery required one incision in the navel .
“ The idea of being able to perform a surgery with fewer incisions and requiring a shorter hospital stay is particularly attractive to cancer patients who may face repeated surgeries , ” said Santiago Horgan , MD , professor of surgery , and Director of the Center for the Future of Surgery at UC San Diego .
“ We are currently testing these scarless procedures for the treatment of cancer , obesity and other digestive disorders . ”
According to the American Cancer Society , kidney cancer is an expanding cancer , increasing at a rate of two to three percent each year and affecting approximately 55,000 patients in the United States .
Risk factors for developing kidney cancer include smoking , obesity and hypertension .
“ Kidney cancer is among the 10 most common cancers in men and women , ” said Derweesh , an expert in kidney - preserving surgeries and a member of the American Urological Association ’s Guideline Committee for the treatment of kidney tumors .
“ The combination of kidney cancers being diagnosed at earlier stages and smaller sizes , and the ability perform less invasive surgeries , presents a new horizon of care for these patients . ”

TrailerAddict 's Top 10 trailers for 2008 !
IT professionals have good reason to feel anxious about their careers : Job losses among IT workers are mounting as CIOs cut their IT budgets and as IT departments shed staff and institute hiring freezes .
RELATED STORIES
IT Professionals Fear Layoffs , Salary Caps in 2009
IT Salaries Expected to Rise in 2009
Highest - Paid IT Skills , Certifications During Recession
IT Job Losses Continue to Pile Up
But new research may give IT professionals some much needed good news : IT research firm Computer Economics is projecting that IT salaries will increase in 2009 .
Computer Economics is n't predicting a substantial increase in IT pay , but an increase nonetheless , at a time when many companies are resorting to salary freezes to keep personnel costs in line with revenue shortfalls .
The research firm , which specializes in IT management metrics , predicts that IT salaries will grow by about two percent this year .
IT executives , directors , managers and application developers will see slightly larger increases than that two percent .
Computer Economics predicts that base salaries for IT management and for people in application development functions will creep up between two and three percent his year , as certain programming and IT architecture skills remain in high demand and as employers offset reductions in bonuses for managers with higher base salaries .
Meanwhile , wages for other IT workers will inch up between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent .
Computer Economics '
IT salary projections are slightly lower than those released by Robert Half International in October , 2008 .
At that time , the IT staffing firm predicted salary increases of 3.7 percent for IT professionals in 2009 .
John Longwell , Computer Economics ' research director , acknowledges that his firm 's forecast is conservative .
He notes that a salary survey Computer Economics conducted during the fourth quarter of 2008 showed that the median pay raises IT organizations planned for their staffs was three percent .
Computer Economics adjusted that figure to two percent to reflect the continued deterioration of the economy and rising unemployment .
Longwell says that if inflation remains flat or negative , smaller pay increases this year could do more to boost IT professionals ' real income than larger pay increases did in previous years , when inflation and energy prices were high .
" If there 's no inflation and if your salary increases two percent , your personal income in real terms increases , " he says .
" Compare that against , if you get a six percent raise but there 's eight percent inflation , your real personal income declines . "
IT Better Positioned to Survive Recession Than Other Functions
Longwell believes IT spending has been " fairly restrained " since the 2001 recession , which hammered the IT industry .
Since then , IT organizations have been cautious about adding staff and have found ways to run lean , for example , by outsourcing more and automating more data center work , he says .
Consequently , Longwell adds , IT leaders can make a strong case that their departments are already running efficiently and can't afford more cuts .
" Companies laying off workers may also be looking to IT to increase the productivity of remaining workers , " he says .
" So all those things make us believe that IT is n't going to face the severe cuts that other areas might face . "
Computer Economics ' research is based in part on a salary survey it conducted in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
The company uses its own historical survey data , as well as data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , to create a statistical model based on the relationships among IT job titles and metropolitan areas .
Computer Economics uses the statistical model and survey data to project 2009 salaries for 70 specific IT functions by metropolitan area .
A little over a week ago , Gmail made it possible to “ go offline ” and take the contents of your email archive wherever you like .
Slate ’s technology columnist , Farhad Manjoo , wrote an effusive piece declaring Gmail the victor in a battle between desktop email clients and webmail that ’s been raging since the mid-1990s :
“ Gmail has bested the Outlooks of the world [ … ]
If you ’re still tied to a desktop app — whether Outlook , the Mac ’s Mail program , or anything else that sees your local hard drive , rather than a Web server , as its brain — then you ’re doing it wrong . ”
Self - described “ pixel - pusher ” and member of the greater Twitter Mac cabal , Neven Mrgan , retorted with this gem :
“ Well , I ’m convinced .
I guess I ’ll just switch to an email client that does n’t allow me to drag a goddamn file into the message to attach it . ”
While chuckle - worthly , this is n’t strictly true : it ’s possible to drag a file onto any file - type input form element in Safari , and the site - specific browser Mailplane makes more general drag - n - drop possible with Gmail on a Mac .
Neven ’s commment does , however , illustrate the core problem with email clients , desktop or web - based : they ’re all utter failures at something .
The Problem With Desktop Email Clients
Manjoo is more than right in claiming that Gmail has bested desktop email clients on most fronts .
He talks about Gmail ’s speed , its efficiency , that the user does n’t have to worry about storage , about how its search actually works .
Weirdly , though , he does n’t elaborate on one of Gmail ’s best design decisions : conversations .
Gmail presents email threads as one long conversation , starting with the oldest message and ending with the most recent .
When coming back to a conversation , older messages are collapsed until you need them .
No matter who joins the thread , the conversation will remain one unified , chronological , vertical stack of messages .
You can archive entire conversations , and they pop back into your Inbox when continued by new messages .
Anyone who ’s given Gmail a fair shake will quickly find conversations indispensable .
Going back to any other email client is agonizing and disorienting , like being knocked around and dumped out of the back of a pickup on the outskirts of a strange town .
In desktop email clients , new messages arrive completely bereft of context .
The only way to orient yourself is to either remember what the conversation was about or read through the mess of quoted text that may or may not be present at the bottom of the message , depending on what kind of email client or prefences the sender has .
You could try searching to re-orient yourself , but good luck with that in Outlook or Mail.app .
With conversations , Google has offered the only advancement in the information architecture of email clients in decades .
Apple , on the other hand , has given us basically bupkiss , rendering Neven ’s defense a bit silly .
While they clearly do n’t expect many people to use it judging from the attachment toolbar button on the New Message window , it ’s lovely of Apple to support drag - n - drop in their Mail.app .
But without fundamental improvements like conversations , that ’s sort of like bragging about the automatic windows on your car sitting on cinderblocks in the front law : nobody ’s impressed anymore , and it ’s not going anywhere .
I ’ve been trying the beta releases of a desktop email client called Postbox .
Other than being a slightly more palatable version of Mozilla Thunderbird , there ’s precious little to recommend it .
It learns essentially none of the lessons of Gmail , which is probably why one of the top requests from beta testers is a real conversation view .
The developers are focusing on nigh - on useless features like social software integration , similar to Apple wasting its last major release of Mail.app on templates , notes that do n’t go anywhere , and half - assed RSS reading .
It ’s one of the only new non-amateur desktop email clients to come out in ages , and it ’s no savior .
The problem with desktop email clients is that they ’ve gone nowhere , and appear to be going nowhere fast .
While Google has delivered solutions that make email less excruciating , Apple , Mozilla , Microsoft , and now Postbox are twiddling their thumbs and staring at the ceiling .
The primary recommendation for a desktop email client is that you end up with a copy of your messages on your hard drive , and even that argument is moot .
So why do people keep using desktop email clients ?
The Problem With Webmail ( Really , With Gmail )
First of all , most webmail is n’t Gmail .
Most webmail in 2009 is designed to look like a desktop email client .
Web interfaces that attempt to mimic desktop software have been perpetual and stunning failures , so it ’s baffling as to why they ’re still designed this way .
I ’m not going to waste time tearing down the Yahoo !
Mails and Hotmails of the world , or whatever terrible webmail interface your university , company , or ISP forces you to use .
They ’re abominable , and that ’s why Slate has columnists covering Gmail and nobody gives a rip about Yahoo !
Mail even though they ’re the market leader .
Gmail does everything it possibly can to tastefully straddle the line between web and desktop application .
For all its functionality , it still feels more like a web page than a web app .
There ’s no attempt at drag - n - drop , fake windows , big candy icons , or any of the usual signatures of desktop software .
Other than their custom buttons , Gmail tries not to break too many of the web ’s rules and conventions in its attempt to provide a fast and efficient interface to one ’s email .
Unfortunately , this restraint is n’t enough to keep me from trying desktop clients like Postbox , or even secretly firing up Mail.app once a month to see if I can stand living without conversations for more than two minutes ( I can ’t ) .
This is probably heresy coming from a web application developer , but I think web applications are mostly ghastly .
I hate using them .
When I ’m faced with a computing problem , I want to solve it with a polished , stable , native application for my operating system that looks and feels like it belongs on my computer .
I do n’t believe in Rich Internet Applications — they ’re a boogeyman that I keep hoping will disappear .
The problem with Gmail is that it could be a “ real ” application .
While its conversations and search - that - actually - works are ( sadly ) innovative , they ’re not impossible to implement as part of a platform - native email client .
I enjoy using Gmail , but I ’d enjoy it even more if it obeyed the rules of my operating system , not the rules of the web .
The web has a lot to offer certain types of problems , but I ’m not convinced that email is one of them .
The Problem , In Summary
The problem with desktop email clients is that they ’re not webmail .
The problem with webmail is that it ’s not a desktop email client .
My hunch is that the very thing geeks seem to like about desktop email clients - that you end up with a copy of our messages on your hard drive - is the very thing that drives most users to webmail .
Desktop email clients have to deal with synchronization , and there ’s no good way to hide from the user the impedance mismatch of syncing a local and a remote data store .
Less technical users get frustrated by the schizophrenic behavior of desktop email clients : messages they thought they moved to a folder never left the Inbox ; messages they thought they sent are sitting in their Drafts folder hours later ; messages they thought were deleted are still there on the server .
Webmail alleviates this problem by allowing users to interact more directly with the data store that contains their email archive .
It ’s an illusion , but it ’s a more complete illusion than desktop email clients can offer .
When using Gmail , you feel like things are actually and really happening when you send an email or archive a conversation .
Until , of course , your internet connection falters and you discover that you ’ve lost your most recent actions in some local event queue in your browser .
If you ’ve managed to make one or another of the current lousy options work for you , congratulations : way to get that car off the cinderblocks .
The rest of us loathe our email clients , and would basically kill for something better .
The solution , I think , is to make desktop mail clients more like webmail , and absolutely not the other way around .
The more webmail tries to behave “ native ” , the worse it works .
The more desktop mail clients strive to provide an intelligent information architecture and reliable synchronization , the more users win .
But before life with email really improves , the major desktop email client vendors need to catch up to Gmail .
After Taking Two Consecutive Electoral Drubbings in the Rest of the Country , the Republicans Are a More Solidly Conservative Southern Regional Party Than Ever Before -- and Risking Further Isolation for Opposing President Obama 's Economic Rescue Plans
Feuding Elephants : Republicans appear to be sharply divided along regional lines over President Obama 's economic stimulus package , with the bulk of the opposition to the plan coming from conservative Southerners .
Nowhere is that division more evident than among the nation 's 22 GOP governors , with a handful of Southern conservatives declaring they wo n't accept parts of the president 's stimulus , while other GOP governors from the Northeast , the Midwest and the Far West fully supporting it .

The creator of the late , great seriesadmits he was reluctant to audition Jason Bateman for the role of Michael Bluth .
" I think he had done , like , 13 failed pilots , " says Mitchell Hurwitz , " and when I saw his name on the sign - in sheet , I thought , Oooh , no , I do n't want to read Jason Bateman here .
I want to do something really special here and take a risk . "
Then Bateman nailed it .
" He was dry and spot - on and subtle and had such a developed sense of humor . "
It does not come as a surprise that Bateman is funny .
His peers clamor to offer comments about this , about him , and , please know , this is unheard - of .
" Am I too late ? " Hurwitz asks in a breathless e-mail .
" You do n't get to praise Jason face - to - face .
He tricks you into talking about yourself .
So please let me get something on the record so he knows how much I love him . "
Charlize Theron , his love interest in both last summer 's Hancock and a story line of Arrested , e-mails while on vacation to say that his acting made her " pee my pants laughing . "
Ellen Page takes a break from a Canadian hike to call and establish that " he has a dirty sense of humor , but he gets away with it because he 's so adorable . "
Jennifer Garner e-mails : " He happens to be an excellent actor who is also hilarious . "
And Portia de Rossi refers to him as " one of the most naturally funny people I know , and , believe me , I know some naturally funny people . "
She 's calling from Ellen DeGeneres ' dressing room .
" No one takes the piss better than J.B. , " says his good friend and Arrested Development older brother , Will Arnett .
" I can be feeling on top of the world , my clothes nice and pressed , and he comes out and asks , ` Hey man , do they make that in a men's ? ' "
Bateman at 40 is 98 percent handsome , one percent crow 's - feet , one percent freckles , with a seal - pelt - like head of hair that he credits for doing most of his work for him : " Well , shit , if I can part my hair , I do n't have to act as much : ` The guy is a dork . '
Now I just need to talk . "
This month , he will appear with Russell Crowe in State of Play as a bisexual club promoter with an OxyContin addiction ( " Got it ! " ) , and he 's busy shooting the comedy Couples Retreat with Vince Vaughn and gearing up for the Arrested Development movie .
On the show , he could get the audience on his side by engaging the tiniest muscle in his forehead , or flexing his Adam 's apple .
His movie roles , too , showcase his kind of slow - burn sarcasm and minimalism .
( Has any guy ever established himself to be a bigger asshole in fewer words than when he offered , all matter - of - fact , " Cold feet " in Juno ? )
He started working in Hollywood at age 10 on Little House on the Prairie .
Then came Silver Spoons , the underappreciated It 's Your Move , that Valerie Harper show ... and then not much in his twenties and early thirties .
He had to squeeze in a deferred adolescence sometime — the one he did n't have time for as a family breadwinner .
His father managed his career and his sister Justine 's ( she played the beautiful , ditzy sister on Family Ties ) .
His mother , a former flight attendant , became his set - sitter .
" My parents were n't making as much money as I was making , " he says , straddling a bench in the Central Garden at the Getty Center in Los Angeles .
" Who does ?
It 's a huge amount of money . "
And it was hugely stressful to earn it .
" When you 're a child actor , if you do n't have a C average , you lose your work permit , you 're off the show , and I think they can sue you , because you are shutting down a television series , " he says .
" So anytime there was a major grading period , I have very vivid memories of just stomach - churning and tears and knowing that if I do n't pass these tests ....
We were living hand - to - mouth .
Or Los Angeles hand - to - mouth .
Miss a payment on the mortgage , and you 're gone . "

So who does that to a kid ?
" Obviously , in hindsight , it was a challenging way to be brought up , " he allows .
" Having said that , I am very , very happy with who I am and my relationship with my parents .
Who has n't had an atypical upbringing ? "
He tends to ask and answer his own questions , and they 're probably the same questions some shrink posed to him : " Was I the ideal age to be presented with a huge challenge like that ?
I was probably a little young . "
Which explains why he was a little too old when he began " playing as hard as I had been working .
That involved anything you can imagine .
How many clubs can you go to ?
How many drinks can you have ?
How many superhot chicks can you go home with ?
After a while , it 's not cute .
After 30 , it 's really not cute . "
At times , he considered selling everything he owned and heading to the international terminal at LAX to choose a city where he could start over .
" So many people who had teenage careers end up the subject of some VH1 show .
What happened to him is miraculous , " says director Jason Reitman , who cast Bateman in Juno .
" He figured out who he was as an adult , and who he was was a spectacularly self - aware , funny guy . "
He 's also a sincere guy , especially when he 's talking about his wife , Amanda Anka , a voice - over actress and the female voice of NBC 's prime time .
They married in 2001 but had known each other since high school ( her father is the singer Paul Anka ) .
" Once I got my shit together , I knew she might be a fantastic candidate for the better half of my life .
I only wanted to get married once , so I had to look for someone with longevity , which would be a friend .
And a friend that I really want to sleep with , too — then that 's the ticket . "
As for her wanting to sleep with him ?
" There are pills for that . "
The only topic that he's any sweeter on is their two - year - old daughter , Francesca .
The merest mention of the Gap ad and billboard featuring the two of them makes his already wide grin stretch about three sizes .
" Anyone who has a kid , when friends ask you if you have a picture , you go , ` Yeahyeahyeah , ' and whip out your phone to show off .
This was that times ten .
Look up there .
She 's mine . " he says .
" And I love her . "
Neither he nor Arnett have forgotten that when Arnett and his wife , Amy Poehler , were featured in the Gap 's 2007 campaign , their billboard was in a higher profile Los Angeles location .
" They got the Sunset building , " Bateman says .
" We got Hollywood Highlands .
It 's a close second . "
Not that he minds .
" If I can be number two or four or five — in State of Play , I think I 'm sixth — it does n't matter ; I just want to be in it .
I am trying to keep that ball rolling and not screw things up , and not ever have my name get in the way again .
Because that 's something you just can't fix . "

Let ’s take a look at different ways of getting through to management .
From 1999 to early 2002 , I was the head of information technology for a doomed startup company .
I did n’t take vacation time , and I stupidly believed management when they said that I ’d be paid later .
As they went into crisis mode , all the workers ’ salaries were cut drastically .
I also stupidly believed them when they said that , since I had accepted the pay cut , I could reduce my hours to full time ( you read that right ) , and that anything over would be paid at a time and a half equivalent of the corresponding hourly rate .
As the company ’s financial situation continued to slide , I started asking for the money that was owed to me .
You can imagine how well that went .
Finally , push came to shove .
Someone in the accounting department ( who also doubled as the HR person ) told me to go to the California Department of Industrial Relations and tell my story to them .
She said that this would do more to compel the crooks than if someone firebombed the building .
I said that I had a better idea …
I packed up my stuff and left a short letter on my keyboard , along with a floppy disk and the Pelican case which held all of the removable backup drives .
The letter said something like this :
I resign , effective immediately .
[ Company Name Deleted ] owes me $ 8320 for vacation time worked and overtime .
After repeated requests , I have not been paid .
The passwords required to access the administrative level accounts are contained on this floppy disk .
They are encrypted with a very strong encryption algorithm .
If [ Company Name Deleted ] ever wants to have administrative access to its critical systems ( servers , firewalls , routers , etc. ) , for a one time consulting fee of $ 8320 ( cleared funds )
I could provide [ Company Name Deleted ] with the passphrase required to access this information .
About fifteen hours later , I got a call from that person in the accounting department .
She was laughing .
“ I have your check .
You can pick it up anytime , but they do n’t want you to come inside the building . ”
HAHA
“ That ’s fine .
Tell them I could n’t stand the stench for even a minute longer anyway . ”
I went over there , sat in the parking lot and called the girl from accounting .
She came down with the check and handed it to me .
We both laughed at how stupid and evil these pricks were .
The people in charge of that company all had doctorates or law degrees from Ivy League schools .
It ’s too bad that their own opinions about how smart they were and their lists of publications did n’t translate into any viable products or revenue streams .
I ’m sure it did n’t dawn on them that the hired - help - outsider computer guy , with just a lowly undergraduate degree * gasp* , would ever think of actually trying get what the company owed him for work already completed .
I felt really bad for the graduate students who got caught up with this swindle .
As regular employees quit or got fired , members of the board , some of whom were professors , took graduate students and pressed them into service , doing the work that we had been doing .
Why pay someone thousands of dollars per month to do something that you can get graduate students — who are paid mostly with government grant money — to do ?
Better yet , undergrads .
They ’ll work for letters of recommendation .
All of this , and much , much more was in direct contravention of easily a dozen University of California — woops , I let a bit of detail slip — guidlines established to guard against this nonsense .
Remember , this was a private , for profit company that had a few too many tentacles still attached to the University of California at _____ ( fill in the blank , my guess is that all of the UCs are the same in this regard ) .
I ’ll give you another hint about where this was .
The lab ( but not the company in question ) was written up in a series articles in a large regional publication that neglected to mention the Main Prick ’s rabid alcoholism and psychotic tendencies .
He is one of the Big Deal names in neuroscience .
Well , I deposited the check and it cleared .
I gave them the password .
That was it .
The hilarity actually continued because their operation went on to self destruct in a spectacular manner .
You would n’t even believe me if I told you what happened .
The point is :
If you find yourself working for a pack of psychopaths , expect the very worst .
Psychopaths will look right at you and lie .
And never , ever expect them to deliver on their promises .
Having the terms in writing may help .
Having the executives by the nuts is better .
I was at a point in my life where I literally did n’t care what those bastards said or did .
I was just sick of being fucked with and lied to .
Part of me expected to wind up in some kind of trouble , but it ’s amazing what not giving a rat ’s ass can do for you when you ’re backed into a corner .
Instead of cowering and just taking it , one more time , I simply refused to yield .
I told my dad about this .
He does n’t understand computers or startup companies at all , but he was savagely beaten as part of his strict Catholic upbringing .
“ By the time I was 14 , the beatings stopped . ”
“ How did you get them to stop beating you ? ” I asked .
“ I let Mother Superior know that someone was going to die if she hit me with that stick again , and it was n’t going to be me . ”
Well , that ultimatum to Mother Superior went a bit further than strong encryption on a password file or taking over a factory , but these are things that even any psychopath can understand .
And people sometimes wonder how I came to be milking my own cow in a remote part of New Zealand …

Via : Dow Jones / CNN :
Union employees who have staged sit -in protests at an Illinois door - and - window factory will receive the compensation required under state law , Attorney General Lisa Madigan said .
Under the agreement reached late Wednesday afternoon , more than 200 unionized employees of Republic Windows & Doors will receive pay for an additional 60 days .
They also will receive vacation pay .
Last week , the factory notified its nearly 300 employees , of which about 80 % are unionized , that it would close by Friday because Bank of America Corp . ( BAC ) had told the company it would be cutting off all financing .
On Tuesday , Bank Of America said it would provide a “ limited amount ” of additional loans to Republic , a day after the protests escalated into an intense labor - relations fight that threatened to have financial ramifications for the banking giant .
On Monday , one day before being arrested on unrelated corruption charges , Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich called on state agencies to suspend business with the bank .
The agreement announced Wednesday is the result of negotiations under way since Monday between local , state and federal officials ; the United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers of America ; Bank of America ; JPMorgan ; and Operation PUSH .
Madigan said she remains concerned about consumers who may have paid deposits toward the purchase of windows and may need assistance communicating with the company to obtain refunds of their deposits .
Consumers having difficulty reaching Republic regarding their deposits should call the Attorney General ’s Consumer Fraud Hotline at ( 800 ) 386-5438 .

The editor and publisher of a major Indian newspaper have been arrested for " hurting the religious feelings " of Muslims after they reprinted an article from The Independent .
Ravindra Kumar and Anand Sinha , the editor and publisher of the Kolkata - based English daily The Statesman , appeared in court yesterday charged under section 295A of the Indian Penal Code which forbids " deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings " .
Sections of central Kolkata have been paralysed by protests for much of the past week after The Statesman republished an article by The Independent 's columnist Johann Hari .
Titled " Why should I respect oppressive religions ? " , the piece was originally printed in The Independent on 28 January .
In it , Hari said he believed the right to criticise any religion was being eroded around the world .
The Statesman , a highly respected liberal English - language daily , reprinted the article on 5 February , causing a major backlash among a small group of Muslims who felt that the piece slighted the Prophet Mohamed and insulted their religion .
Peaceful protests were held outside The Statesman 's offices at the weekend but by Monday , demonstrations had turned violent .
Angry crowds began blocking roads , attacking police and calling for the arrest of the article 's author and the newspaper 's publisher and editor .
On Monday and Tuesday police used baton charges to try to disperse crowds and more than 70 protesters were arrested .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Staff at The Statesman were forced to barricade the front entrance to their building and were escorted into their offices through a side door by police .
The office is opposite the Tipu Sultan Masjid , Kolkata 's largest mosque .
One journalist at The Statesman said : " The police have surrounded our building all this week but the protesters kept coming back .
There was a small section who were absolutely hellbent on causing problems . "
Last night , Hari defended his article .
" I wrote in defence of the right to criticise religion – all religion – and it is vitally important to keep that right alive in the world 's largest , and in many ways most admirable , democracy , " he said .
On two separate occasions Mr Kumar , The Statesman 's editor , issued statements standing by his decision to publish the article .
But he also said he had not meant to cause offence to any religion .
A note published on 8 February said The Statesman had reprinted Hari 's article because " it mourned the marginalisation of the middle , liberal path in modern society " .
It added : " The Statesman has always upheld secular values and has a record of providing space to all viewpoints , even contentious ones .
If we were unable to fulfil this role , we would rather cease publication with honour than compromise our basic values .
" The publication of Johann Hari 's opinion was not intended to cause hurt , or defame any community or religion .
Nor was it intended to provoke societal tension .
If unwittingly we have aggrieved any section of society , we deeply regret it . "
As well as the protests , a complaint was also filed at a police station by a member of the public , Mohd Shahid , calling for arrests .
Speaking to The Independent last night , Mr Kumar said he voluntarily attended the police station yesterday to try to calm tensions .
" Upon learning that a case had been registered by Kolkata police , I contacted officers and offered to assist the investigation and to aid efforts to defuse tensions , " he said .
" Following this , the arrests were made early today and we were released on bail last night . "
Since Mr Kumar 's arrest yesterday protesters have dispersed .

" Being able to put Live Nation and Ticketmaster into an equal partnership will allow the companies to get through this difficult period and be able to expand live entertainment options to audiences throughout the world , " Ticketmaster Chairman Barry Diller said .
But regulatory experts have said the deal could be delayed by an antitrust review because of the companies ' dominant role in the entertainment business .
Ticketmaster sells tickets for more than 80 % of the major arenas and stadiums in the U.S. , according to concert tracking firm Pollstar .
Live Nation is the world 's No. 1 concert promoter and owns more than 140 venues .
It has comprehensive deals to the tours of such artists as Madonna , Jay - Z , U2 , Nickelback and Shakira — and recently developed its own ticketing service .
The ticketing - service move brought the companies closer to an all - out scramble for ticketing deals .
A merger heads that off , but experts say snuffing out that competition could draw close scrutiny from regulators wary of the company building a concert industry monopoly .
On the other hand , the deal could end up benefiting concertgoers by giving the combined company more bargaining clout with artists , potentially reducing performers ' stakes in ticket sales and thus lowering ticket prices .
The deal already has at least one prominent detractor , however .
Bruce Springsteen , already furious with Ticketmaster for directing fans to a subsidiary selling tickets for above - face value , recently posted a statement on his website saying a deal with Live Nation could end up " returning us to a near - monopoly situation in music ticketing . "
The deal will put under one roof some of the USA 's biggest concert venues , its dominant ticket sales company , and wide - ranging management and promotion deals with hitmakers including the Eagles , Christina Aguilera , Madonna , and Jay - Z .
The companies are poised to say that consumers will benefit .
For example , it might be easier for ticket buyers to pick the seats that they want , and avoid the confusion and sticker shock that sometimes comes when people see ticket handling fees tacked on to the admission price .
By eliminating duplication , the companies expect to see $ 40 million in cost savings a year .
Live Nation , which sells more than 45 million concert tickets a year , launched its own ticket sales service in January after its deal with Ticketmaster expired .
Ticketmaster , which handled more than 141 million tickets in 2007 , countered by acquiring a controlling interest in Front Line Management — a firm run by long - time music executive Irving Azoff .

This is the site for Tim Kreider 's cartoon , " The Pain - - When Will It End ? " .
For Tim Kreider 's writing , please see www.timkreider.com.
Artist 's Statement This is Ms. Phelætia Czochula - Hautpänz , the former intern of Mr. Kreider , briefly to assist in his time of sorrow .
It becomes my duty unhappily to announce the unfortunate death of the famous and beloved cat of Mr. Kreider , " The Quetzal . "
As the long readers will know , Mr. Kreider owned this animal for almost twenty years and was unhealthy devoted to it , and now finds himself to be inconsolable .
I have created as my gift to him this collage of images from his many beloved cat cartoons , which it is hoped readers also will enjoy .
Mr. Kreider is now to enter a time of mourning that does not exceed one year .
He asks that in lieu of flowers those who wish to express the consolations send drugs or caresses .
On a personal note , I would state that although I myself was not fond of the cat , which seemed to consider me a rival for affections of Mr. Kreider and despised me , I considered it a " worthy foe , " and now offer my respects with solemnly .

I 'm afraid I 'm not likely to make it off the East Coast for this one ( unless they 're paying for travel ) , but it can't hurt to ask .
Researchers from Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine appear to have reversed the neurological dysfunction of early - stage multiple sclerosis patients by transplanting their own immune stem cells into their bodies and thereby " resetting " their immune systems .
The patients in the small phase I / II trial continued to improve for up to 24 months after the transplantation procedure and then stabilized .
They experienced improvements in areas in which they had been affected by multiple sclerosis including walking , ataxia , limb strength , vision and incontinence .
The study will be published online January 30 and in the March issue of The Lancet Neurology .
Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system .
In its early stages , the disease is characterized by intermittent neurological symptoms , called relapsing - remitting MS .
During this time , the person will either fully or partially recover from the symptoms experienced during the attacks .
Common symptoms are visual problems , fatigue , sensory changes , weakness or paralysis of limbs , tremors , lack of coordination , poor balance , bladder or bowel changes and psychological changes .
Within 10 to 15 years after onset of the disease , most patients with this relapsing - remitting MS progress to a later stage called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis .
In this stage , they experience a steady worsening of irreversible neurological damage .
" This is the first time we have turned the tide on this disease , " said principal investigator Richard Burt , M.D. chief of immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases at the Feinberg School .
The clinical trial was performed at Northwestern Memorial Hospital where Burt holds the same title .
The 21 patients in the trial , ages 20 to 53 , had relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis that had not responded to at least six months of treatment with interferon beta .
The patients had had MS for an average of five years .
After an average follow - up of three years after transplantation , 17 patients ( 81 percent ) improved by at least one point on a disability scale .
The disease also stabilized in all patients .
In the procedure , Burt and colleagues treated patients with chemotherapy to destroy their immune system .
They then injected the patients with their own immune stem cells , obtained from the patients ' blood before the chemotherapy , to create a new immune system .
The procedure is called autologous non-myeloablative haematopoietic stem - cell transplantion .
" We focus on destroying only the immune component of the bone marrow and then regenerate the immune component , which makes the procedure much safer and less toxic than traditional chemotherapy for cancer , " Burt said .
After the transplantation , the patient 's new lymphocytes or immune cells are self - tolerant and do not attack the immune system .
"
In MS the immune system is attacking your brain , " Burt said .
" After the procedure , it does n't do that anymore .
"
In previous studies , Burt had transplanted immune stem cells into late - stage MS patients .
" It did n't help in the late stages , but when we treat them in the early stage , they get better and continue to get better , " he said .
" What we did is promising and exiting , but we need to prove it in a randomized trial , " Burt noted .
He has launched a randomized national trial .

With her upcoming wedding to NFL football player Hank Baskett in June , you might be thinking that would be enough to keep Kendra busy .
Nope , the blonde beauty has scored her very own reality show on E ! .
The network has signed her on for eight shows that will document the 23 year old leaving the mansion and starting a new life on the ' outside ' .
We will be watching for sure !
Guest appearances by Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt are expected .
The show executives expect it to be a hit , citing the fact that after five seasons of GND , Kendra has gotten herself quite a big fan base , the Bitten and Bound crew among them .

From now on , if you want to fill the seats at your funeral and you live in Detroit , you wo n't want to die on the wrong day .
People may never get word that you 're gone .
That 's because , starting next month , the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press will be offering home delivery just three days a week .
So , readers who 've made a daily ritual of perusing obituaries with their morning coffee -- and who wo n't go out to buy the paper or go online -- are n't necessarily going to learn about the deaths of their acquaintances .
" We 'll have to go back to word of mouth , " says David Techner , funeral director at Ira Kaufman Chapel in Southfield , Mich .
" We 'll try to condition people : ' Make sure you call all your mom 's friends to say she died . ' "
In so many ways lately , our daily routines are under siege .
Sure , change always has been part of the human experience .
But given the economic freefall and the transformations brought on by technology , countless rituals that once defined and comforted us are disappearing in a flash .
Researchers say we 're now living in an age of " accelerated change " -- and to cope , we should spend less time lamenting and more time adapting .
Some rituals may return when the economy rebounds ; in a survey last month , 60 % of Americans said they 've cut back on their daily trips to " fancy coffee " outlets , which explains the 69 % drop in Starbucks 's latest quarterly profit .
Other rituals we can feel disappearing for good .
Fewer of us collect record albums or CDs to line the walls of our living rooms ; now our music has been reduced to a scrolling list of song titles on our iPods or computers .
Five of the Somali pirates who released a hijacked , oil - laden Saudi supertanker drowned with their share of a reported $ 3 m ( £ 1.96 m ) ransom after their small boat capsized , local sources said today .
A pirate who was not part of the pirate operation but knew those involved , Daud Nure , said the boat with eight people on board overturned in a storm after dozens of pirates left the Sirius Star , following a two - month standoff in the Gulf of Aden , that ended yesterday .
He said five people died and three people reached the shore after swimming for several hours .
Jamal Abdulle , a resident of the Somali coastal town of Haradhere , close to where the ship was anchored , also confirmed that the boat sank and that the portion of the ransom money that had been shared between dozens of pirates was lost .
The Saudi owners of the ship , Vela International , today confirmed that the vessel and crew had been released .
Among the frees hostages were two British crewmen , chief engineer Peter French , from County Durham , and James Grady , from Renfrewshire .
US navy photos showed a parachute , carrying what they described as " an apparent payment " , floating towards the tanker .
Vela 's president , Saleh K'aki , said : " We are very relieved to know that all the crew members are safe and I am glad to say that they are all in good health and high spirits .
" This has been a very trying time for them and certainly for their families .
We are very happy to report to their families that they will be on their way home soon . "
The Sirius Star and its 25 - member crew had been held since 15 November .
Its cargo of crude oil was valued at $ 100 m at the time .
The capture was seen as a dramatic demonstration of the pirates ' ability to strike high - value targets hundreds of miles offshore .
On the same day the Saudi ship was freed , pirates released a captured Iranian - chartered cargo ship , Iran 's state television reported today .
It said the ship , Daylight , was carrying 36 tonnes of wheat when it was attacked in the Gulf of Aden on 18 November and seized by pirates .
All 25 crew are in good health and the vessel is sailing towards Iran , the TV report said .
The US navy announced this week it will head a new anti-piracy taskforce after more than 100 ships were attacked last year .
Nato and the European Union already have warships patrolling the Gulf of Aden and have intervened to prevent several ships from being captured .
More than a dozen ships with about 300 crew members are still being held by pirates off the coast of Somalia , including the weapons - laden Ukrainian cargo ship , MV Faina , which was seized in September .
The multimillion dollar ransoms are one of the few ways to earn a living in the impoverished , war - ravaged country .
Somalia has not had a functioning government since 1991 and nearly half of its population depends on aid .
Unfortunately , it does n't take a lot of digging into most of these stories to find out they 've been , well , inflated a bit .
And sometimes , they 're complete bullshit .
Everyone likes a good " rags to riches " story .
After all , if some dude can go from living in a cardboard box to being the CEO of a major corporation , we can do it too !
6 Bill Gates
The Rags to Riches Story :
Bill was a college dropout who finessed his way into the upper echelons of IBM to sell his operating system .
Now he sleeps on a bed made of solid gold .
According to the media , Bill Gates is the Rocky Balboa of the business world .
They 've compared him to other college dropouts ; from Kanye West to some guy who runs the IT Department at Bradley College .
Gates proved that if you 're smart and willing to work hard , you can build an empire !
And you do n't even have to go to college !
Yay !

Why it 's a Load of Crap :
First of all , the college Gates left was Harvard , not the community college that most of the people who cite his story are thinking of leaving .
He entered Harvard by scoring 1590 out of 1600 on his SAT -- the man was , and still is , a genetically mutated genius .
But one with the type of parents who could afford Harvard .
Luxury office , giant window .
Just your average college dropout .
In fact , Gates 's parents have a lot to do with his success , and even why he was able to drop out of school .
At a very young age , Bill was staying up all night experimenting with computer programming .
Keep in mind , this was the late 60s and early 70s , so having access to a computer was like having access to a helicopter .
He gained incredible amounts of experience because his upper class parents were able to enroll him in an exclusive prep school that had a computer available .
This was only possible because Bill 's father was a prominent attorney , and his mother 's side of the family was n't exactly poor either .

Later , Gates left college because it did n't provide the training in computer programming that he needed for the software business he was running on the side .
It was n't that Gates could n't keep up at Harvard ; Harvard could n't keep up with Gates .
Again , this is the kind of risk you can take when you have well - to - do parents who can get you right back into school if things do n't work out .
If the dude scraping by on student loans and corn dogs tries the same thing , he 's probably going to wind up bussing tables at Chili 's the rest of his life .
Of course here is where Gates used his genius and creativity to invent the modern operating system ...

Oh , wait , no .
It turns out he bought the program that would later become MS - DOS from another programmer , for a one - time fee of $ 50,000 .
He then took it to IBM and other PC manufacturers and made a pile of money big enough to ski down it .
Now , we 're not saying Bill Gates is n't a smart guy or that he did n't work hard .
By all accounts he puts in more hours working than most people put into being awake .
But , an " Upper Middle Class Guy With an Extraordinarily Fortunate Background to Riches " story is a completely different deal than a " Rags to Riches . "
The dude was n't exactly an orphan begging for scraps .
And it 's not like he was turning tricks as a male whore to put his start - up capital together , the way Steve Jobs did [ citation needed ] .
My Grandmother is on twitter .
Not in the conventional sense .. kicking back with a Macbook Pro , tweetdeck running on a separate screen .
No , my Nonna only really geeks out on her sewing machine .
It ’s the only tech she can really operate with confidence .
With everything else it ’s “ Computer says no . . ”
She ca n’t really operate the home phone if she has to use more than one button .
Yet through me .. whenever I ’m visiting and occasionally over the phone , She tweets .
It started during the inauguration of Obama .
I twitter - quoted a couple of her comments as we were watching the TV and someone said ..
“ your Gran needs her own account .
” Why not I thought .
She is always saying what she thinks and I wish people were sometimes there to hear it .
Then there are the times
She gives me tidbits of her past that I ’m desperate to remember but never write down .
Twitter would be perfect for these times ..
Not only to live blog her thoughts and past when I ’m visiting , but also to give her that window to the world .
She is now answering questions and asking me about the people behind the avatars .
She does n’t know what an avatar is , and I know the technology baffles her .
It just makes me happy that as She is engaged in this new adventure , she forgets she is an 85 year old lady living alone , waiting to die .
When she lost her daughter , my Mother , last year I noticed a rapid decline in her will to do anything .
She blamed herself , God , anything for the hand she felt she was dealt , forgetting all that was good about her life , her family .
She started to give up .
Occasionally this now changes .
When her failing mind reminds her , she will still ask me if ‘ those people on the computer ’ have asked her any questions .
I get my laptop out and we sit there going through her replies .
She is now even keeping her answers short and concise watching me as I type them in ..
Aware that 140 characters is not long enough for a life story .
Especially a life as crazy as hers has been .
And she forgets all she is sad about .
It ’s as if I have suddenly invited a hundred people into her home and she is momentarily worried she does not have enough biscuits to go round .
One moment she is lost in a YouTube video showing her a place she has not seen for 60 years ..
The next I ’m explaining why these people she has never met are so interested in her life .
And she smiles .
Twitter is becoming a micro diary of facts and figures , memories and moments in a woman ’s life that I have known all of mine .
Yet much of what she is talking about I have never heard .
My Granddad was the story teller .
My Nonna his obedient wife , helper and eventually nurse .
Now it ’s her stories .. and they tell me of a strong independent lady who has experienced far more than I could ever have imagined .
She may not update regularly , but when she does , her straining short term memory takes a break as we smile our way through tales of times gone by , adventures and a childhood still fresh in her mind .
These are my favorite times with my Grandmother .
Thank
You to all those who have engaged with her .
you make an Old lady , and her grandson , very happy .

What should be my design title ?
This is a different approach from our usual inspirational features , hope you will follow along .
This question was brought up by a good buddy of mine on what should be his design title ?
In order to take myself out of the limelight and focus on my health , and to allow everyone at Apple to focus on delivering extraordinary products , I have decided to take a medical leave of absence until the end of June .
I have asked Tim Cook to be responsible for Apple 's day to day operations , and I know he and the rest of the executive management team will do a great job .
As CEO , I plan to remain involved in major strategic decisions while I am out .
Our board of directors fully supports this plan .
I look forward to seeing all of you this summer .

This honestly comes as quite a surprise , especially given that Jobs just recently issued that note which seemed to be aimed at quelling fears of this exact situation bubbling up .
Inletter -- sent just last week -- Jobs stated that a hormone imbalance was to cause for a recent noticeable weight loss , but that the ailment was being treated in a " relatively simple and straightforward " manner .
This clearly calls that info out , and raises a number of questions about whether or not Apple and Jobs knew there was something more serious happening .
Of course , this story puts the latest exclamation mark in a sentence strewn with flare - ups of news over Jobs ' health which began with his gaunt appearance at last year 's WWDC .
Though Jobs battled pancreatic cancer in 2004 , as far as we know he has been free of the disease since a complicated surgery known as the " whipple procedure , " and this latest statement makes no connection otherwise .
One note of interest is that this is n't the first time Tim Cook has taken the reins at Apple .
He held the spot in 2004 while Jobs was treated for and recovered from the aforementioned cancer .
Whatever the current case may be , here 's hoping Jobs has a speedy recovery -- though what Apple 's future looks like after this is anyone 's guess .
Here 's a quick little gallery of Steve Jobs ' progression over the past three WWDCs :
I feel the liberaltarianism discussion is often muddled because of confusion over a number of different ideas .
I ’m going to try to clear my own head here .
Maybe it will be useful to others .
I think it ’s important to distinguish “ small government ” from “ limited government , ” and to distinguish between a couple different senses of “ limited . ”
Let ’s say government is small when government spending as a percentage of national economic output is relatively low .
Small government , in this sense , will tend to have relatively low taxes .
But the overall tax take tells us little about how the tax burden is distributed .
It does n’t tell us what the money is spent on .
And it does n’t tell us much about economic liberty .
Which society is freer ?
One with a smaller government where the very rich pay all the taxes ( 90 percent of the population pays no taxes ! 90 percent libertopia ? ) or one with a slightly larger government with a relatively low level of taxation spread more or less evenly over the whole population ?
( Should we do a poll on this ? )
The fact that a government is small does n’t rule out the possibility of egregious restrictions on non-economic liberties or of incredibly burdensome economic regulation .
Suppose it takes two years to fill out all the paperwork , get all the licenses , etc. to start a small business , but once you do that , your profits are n’t taxed all .
Suppose many forms of exchange are simply prohibited .
You might have small government , low taxes , and very little economic freedom .
Of course , a small government can ban abortion , prostitution , drugs , a free press , etc. just as well as a big one .
Such a government may need to spend a lot of its modest budget on police and prisons instead of on genuine public goods .
The size of the budget as as percentage of output does n’t tell you anything about the composition of spending .
This is a really important point .
The United States spends a lot on prisons , the military , drug law enforcement , border patrol , etc .
A lot of this is the opposite of rights - respecting , and a lot of it is downright wasteful .
The composition of spending is important both as a matter or morality and a matter of economic growth ( which I happen to think is also a matter of morality . )
Which is all to say , the fact that a government is small logically implies almost nothing about either liberty , justice or efficiency .
( Also , as a technical tangent , there may be economies of scale in the provision of certain public goods .
So a smaller country whose government provides precisely the same goods as a bigger country may turn out to have a bigger government , simply because it costs them a little more to provide the goods .
Slightly weaker economic performance relative to the bigger country may result , but a cutback in spending on those goods wo n’t improve performance if they are growth - enabling . )
Limited government is really what matters , but “ limited ” is also a bit ambiguous .
The most important sense is “ rights - respecting . ”
Bills of rights are meant to declare that legitimate ( and legal ) government is limited to activities that do not violate rights .
Many disputes between classical and modern liberals turn on their theories of rights .
For example , if the collective action problems inherent in the provision of certain public goods justifies taxation , then a state that collects taxes for this purpose does not violate property rights .
If you think there is no such justification for taxation , you ’ll tend to see the taxing state as violating rights and thus overstepping its proper limits .
If you think there is such a justification for taxation , and believe there is an abundance of collective action problems that may be resolved only by government action , then you may think that a quite high level of taxation and government spending is perfectly consonant with limited , property - rights respecting government .
Here ’s an aside about libertarian theory that I think helps transition to another , related , idea of “ limited . ”
Though most libertarians are not anarchists , the outsized influence of property - rights - focused anarchists within the broader libertarian community somehow seems to create a lot of confusion , when it ought to help clarify the issue .
The so - called “ minarchist ” or “ minimal government ” view accepts the public goods justification of the state , while the anarchist rejects it .
The anarchist argues either ( 1 ) that the protection of rights is an individual good and that individuals can successfully protect their rights by going to the market and contracting with private rights - protection agencies or ( 2 ) all public goods , including the protection of rights , can be successfully provided using markets and other forms of voluntary association .
Anarchists often argue that if the public goods argument for state protection of rights ( and the system of public finance it implies ) is sound , then there is no principled basis for stopping at “ minimal ” government .
The scope of legitimate government will be however wide the logic of the public goods or market failure argument happens to take you .
There are a number of possible minarchist replies here ( the specialness of the use of coercion in the rights protection business , etc. ) , but I basically think the anarchist critique is correct .
If there is something especially unstable in private markets for rights protection , and that fact justifies public provision of that service , then there might be other kinds of market failures that justify the public provision of those markets ’ services .
I think this takes us to another sense of “ limited government ” as “ limited to what non-government alternatives cannot do better . ”
An obvious implication of market failure arguments for state provision of certain services is that the state should not be in the business of providing services where markets or other voluntary mechanisms are superior .
There ’s no justification for the coercive tax - financing of state enterprises when those goods and services would be provided ( usually with higher quality and a lower price ) with no state coercion .
Also , state enterprises will tend to crowd out private enterprises both by ( a ) absorbing capital and using it badly and ( b ) by virtue of its inherent advantages in securing anti-competitive subsidies and barriers to entry , which is all the more reason to limit government to the things we actually need it for .
Let me wrap it up .
The “ size ” of government is not a good proxy for either economic or non-economic liberty or for economic performance .
Advocates of “ small government ” need to worry more than they do about the moral and economic dimensions of the composition of spending , and they need to realize that they care more than they think they do about questions of “ distributive justice , ” which is pretty obviously manifest in enthusiasm for reforms , like the “ flat ” and “ fair ” tax .
I think our real concern ought to be limited government .
But whether you think an ideally limited government is also small will depends on lots of things including your account of rights , your beliefs about the relative efficiency and reliability of state vs. market provision of various goods , your beliefs about the necessity of public spending to facilitate growth , and more .
The claim behind my version of “ liberaltarianism ” is that there is a principled position between classic night - watchman “ minarchism ” and full - on modern liberalism .
If you ’re not an anarchist or totalitarian , then you think that it ’s possible for the state to do either too little or too much .
Minarchist libertarians seem to be a bit embarrassed by the concessions they do make on the way to arguing for a state , and so stick as close as they can to their anarchists friends without going all the way stateless .
But the anarchists are right that the minarchists have , in some sense already “ given away the store , ” and that it would be pretty surprising if the logic of the minarchist argument allowed them to stop where they do .
On the other side of the equation , modern liberals need to get more credit from libertarians in desiring and defending limited government .
The governments of the successful liberal democracies are in fact remarkably limited relative to the possibilities , both in terms of respect for rights and in refraining from crowding out the efficient private provision of goods and services –which explains their success .
That said , it would be pretty surprising if either the modern liberal state or modern liberal theory ( which often looks suspiciously like ad hoc apologetics for the modern liberal state ) gets the limits of government right as either a matter of morality or efficiency .
There ’s lots of other stuff to talk about : the paternalism of modern liberalism as a failure of limited government ; the consistency of social insurance and poverty - mitigating redistribution with a principled account of limited government ; and other stuff–but those are separate posts .
We 'd like discussion of this page to happen here on this page ’s Discussion tab and general discussion of the conversion to occur on the eaa - phev maillist .
About the Open Source PriusPlus Project
The PriusPlus project is an open source project set up to develop a method to convert a ' 04 - '07 Toyota Prius into a Plug - in Hybrid .
The project is a combination of hardware and software development to allow qualified individuals or individuals working with a qualified electrician to convert their own car to a PHEV .
Current Status
While the documentation is not yet as thorough as would be desired , the necessary information is available to complete a conversion .
Please use the links above to navigate to the various documentation pages .
Many photos are available on the RawData page .
See this 2007 08 01 maillist post for the Latest News .
If you are interested in helping improve the documentation , please contact Chris Ewert ( chris at infolaunch.com )
Another avid Prius enthusiast named Cheap ! is currently in the process of his own conversion using CalCars PriusPlus processes and documenting his progress at priuschat .
Be sure to heed all warnings and read the Safety section below .
Overview
The PriusPlus conversion retains the OEM hybrid battery and its management computer while adding a lead - acid pack consisting of 20 BB Battery EVP20 - 12B 12V , 20 Amp - hour sealed AGM PbA batteries .
PbA battery chemistry is very inexpensive but leads to significant limitations ( see below ) .
However , with this relatively inexpensive conversion ( as little as $ 4000 parts cost , including the battery ) you can be the first in your community to actually own and drive a plug - in hybrid , and you can achieve 100+ mpg ( plus electricity ) for 15 - 20 miles / day !
News flash ( Sept '07 ) : Reasonably - priced conversion options using Nilar NiMH packs of 3 sizes and possibly PSI Li-ion phosphate packs are now becoming available , as well as pre-built battery boxes and wiring harnesses .
Stay tuned for details .
Though we are using the best and most cost - effective PbA modules we could find , a PbA PHEV is neither economically nor operationally up to par .
But as of now , it is the only relatively inexpensive way to own and drive a real PHEV .
More advanced batteries are on the way and may well be available by the time ( 1 - 2 years from now ) the PbA battery needs replacement ( see below for specifics . )
Below is a fairly comprehensive list of our public domain PbA Prius conversion ’s advantages , operating and mechanical characteristics , and limitations :
Advantages
Detailed instructions for easy installation by anyone trained in high - voltage safety
Pure electric propulsion at up to 34 mph for up to 10 - 12 miles per charge
Lower gasoline use at all speeds until the PHEV battery is depleted
Displacement of gasoline : at an equivalent energy cost of less than $ 1.00 / gallon ( at up to $ 0.09 / kWh ) , possibly using low - cost nighttime electricity if your utility provides optional time - of - use metering with renewable electricity , if you have solar panels on your home or specifically buy electricity from renewable sources
No modification of the Prius ’ hybrid propulsion system , for uncompromised vehicle reliability
Several selectable text and graphics display screens for real - time observation of hybrid system and PHEV parameters
A pull - out power cord that plugs into any standard U.S. 15A , 120VAC outlet or a mounted bumper inlet
An interlock to prevent driving away while the battery charger is still plugged into a live electrical outlet
Prius - forced limitations
This conversion will no doubt void parts of Toyota ’s warranty .
U.S. law prohibits aftermarket modifications from voiding any part of a vehicle ’s warranty except for problems specifically caused by the modification .
If repair of the OEM battery , transaxle , or other parts of the hybrid system becomes necessary , Toyota may argue that the PHEV modification has caused the problem .
The outcome is uncertain , see also our Warranty article .
EV - only mode ( which inhibits ICE operation ) works only up to 34 mph , 120A of power ( modest acceleration ) , and a few more obscure limits
The conversion ’s data display can share the vehicle ’s multifunction display screen only in 2004 - 5 Prii ; later models require an additional display screen ( optional on 2004 - 5 Prii ) .
When the Prius starts the ICE for the first time after being turned on , the ICE must warm up for several minutes before EV mode can be re-entered .
This process burns more fuel than normal .
The charge / discharge limits are affected by the temperature of the OEM battery .
PbA limitations
The conversion adds 300 + lbs to the vehicle ’s weight to provide 10 miles ( 16 km ) of electric range per charge ( 16.7 usable Wh/kg )
Though I have safely driven 17,000 miles in my converted Prius , the added weight could possibly cause vehicle instability during driving , and the battery may modify the effectiveness of the vehicle ’s rear crush zone .
Existing conversions sit 1 - 2 inches low in the rear .
Air shocks or heavier - duty rear springs would be nice , but have not yet been developed .
Though there are indications that improved hybrid efficiency due to a lower combined internal resistance of the two - battery combination at least partially compensates for the added weight , city gasoline mileage is otherwise reduced by up to 10 % .
Operating costs are high due to an expected cycle life of only 300- 400 deep cycles , providing only one to two years of daily driving ( at 400 cycles , 10 electric miles per 2.1 kWh cycle , and $ 800 / pack , battery cost is $ 0.95 / kWh throughput or $ 0.20 / electric - mile ( in addition to the cost of electricity , usually 2 - 4 cents / mile depending on utility rates ) .
For decent battery life , the battery must always be charged within a day of discharge , making charging a required rather than optional operation ( if planning to drive to somewhere without access to electricity , temporarily turn off PHEV operation ) .
PbA batteries perform very poorly in cold weather .
Though our design includes a thermally insulated battery pack , heated during charging , this feature has been insufficiently tested due to moderate California temperatures during development .
Safety
By Ronald Gremban : On March 5 , 2013 , a fire that started in my Prius , in my garage , burnt up my home .
No one was hurt , but my partner Lynne just escaped , and a wonderful cat that lived with us died .
Though the DIY conversion described here was no longer in the car , the cause of the fire is as yet unknown , and many thousands of pure gasoline cars burn up every year killing many people , I mention this as a cautionary tale of a worst - case scenario that can happen despite care .
And note that the designs presented here have not been tested to be safe against all possible failure modes .
Potentially lethal voltages are involved .
It is important for the high - voltage wiring to be done by an electrician or an engineer experienced with high - voltage safety .
Once the conversion is complete , all high voltages are inside screw - or bolt - secured areas , but these areas are exposed during parts of the conversion process , during battery replacement and other servicing , and possibly after a crash .
In keeping with hybrid automotive standards , high voltage cabling is labeled with orange ( as # 4 gauge and larger orange wire is not readily available , we specify the addition of orange shrink - wrap at each end )
This design should be adequate to contain the batteries in any normal driving conditions , but extreme or off - road maneuvers could damage the installation , potentially causing a hazard .
More importantly , though we believe the parts are well - secured , we are not automotive design engineers , the design has not been crash - tested , and its characteristics during and after a crash are unknown .
In particular , it is uncertain whether the battery box would remain intact and in place during a roll - over incident .
PbA modules could tear out of their brackets and fly around the passenger compartment Though these AGM PbA modules are not flooded , they could leak acid if crushed .
Short circuits could arise , causing sparks , hot , molten metal , and possibly igniting a fire .
The battery pack may modify the characteristics of the vehicle ’s rear crush zone .
Operational characteristics
Entry into EV - only mode is automated .
Manual entry is also available .
Due to a complex interaction with Toyota ’s battery management computer , EV - only mode is unavailable for a short distance ( usually less than ½ block ) after slowing down from highway speeds .
The paralleling of the PHEV battery to the OEM battery is switched on and off as needed .
Occupants will hear the contactor periodically doing this , but will not directly feel any effects from it .
When the PHEV battery is fully charged , EV - only mode can be sustained up a steep , extended hill at maximum allowable EV - only power ( 100 - 120A ) .
At lower states of charge , the voltage may fall , causing the engine to start .
When going down a long hill at low PHEV battery SOC , some regenerative current does flow back into the PHEV battery .
This effect , however , is not as large as would be desirable .
The Prius ’ hybrid system allows EV - only mode only when the OEM battery temperature is below 107 deg F , but non-EV - only maximum battery temperature is enough higher that Toyota ’s battery cooling system does not work hard to avoid exceeding 107 degrees .
The conversion modifies this system so that the fan comes on at full speed whenever OEM battery temperature is above approximately 90 deg F .
This almost always keeps OEM battery temperature within EV - only range , but is somewhat noisy .
Other characteristics
It will probably be helpful at various points to refer to specific Prius Service Manual < ref > awaiting url to Prius Service Manual website .</ ref > pages , available for download by paying Toyota $ 10 / day for access ( only one day is needed ) .
The mechanical design is sturdy and simple .
It should be easy for anyone mechanically inclined to build ; even more so if and when various prefabricated parts become available .
This conversion includes a simple and inexpensive insulated battery box that is both air - cooled when necessary and heated as needed , but only during charging .
The thermostatically - controlled cooling fans need only run at high ambient temperatures , to keep battery temperatures below 120 deg F .
However , they are also run during non-heated charging to ensure any venting of the modules is flushed to outside the passenger compartment .
PbA batteries have increasingly poor operating characteristics at low temperatures , starting around 55 deg F .
We thermally insulate and heat them to retain their usefulness down to lower ambient temperatures .
An advantage of retaining the OEM battery for normal hybrid operation is that poor PbA cold - weather performance affects only PHEV , not normal hybrid , operation .
Since we have not come up with a scheme to heat the battery pack from waste engine heat , and electric heating from the battery would be unproductive , we heat electrically only during charging .
This should keep the battery pack sufficiently warm for effective charging and for several hours thereafter in most climates .
The system has not been sufficiently tested , however , due to very moderate California weather during development .
Heating is accomplished via ordinary drugstore electric heating pads , thermostatically controlled via a thermistor and powered by the AC line during charging .
They consume about 100 watts when in use , so overnight heating can add 1 kWh , or around 25 % , to cold - weather electricity consumption .
Planned Enhancements / Options
A new version of the logic board has been designed , as much as possible , to accomodate a DC : DC converter such as the Manzanita Micro PFC - 40 , various battery chemistries , various separate PHEV battery management systems ( BMS ) , and digital data acquisition .
Manzanita Micro is designing a PiPrius PHEV conversion kit for sale , using a lower - voltage pack of larger PbA batteries and their PFC - 40 charger as both a charger and DC : DC converter between batteries .
It is our intention to develop a version of this conversion that uses the PFC - 40 in the same ways .
It will probably require the next version of our logic board , and will have the following relative characteristics : Advantages Lower peak currents in both batteries , due to a 40A current limit between them Increased regenerative braking back into the PHEV battery , mainly valuable during extended downhill grades Possibly slightly longer EV range , due to the above advantages A range of PHEV battery voltages can be accommodated .
Various battery chemistries can be used and accurately kept within their specifications by the required battery management system ( BMS ) .
Because the PHEV battery must have a BMS , it is possible to more carefully control its minimum state - of - charge ( SOC ) , thereby more carefully trading off useful capacity vs. cycle life .
Disadvantages
During charge , the battery pack is not isolated from input power .
This means extra care must be taken to electrically insulate the battery pack from the vehicle chassis , the hybrid system , and all possible human contact points .
The batteries are not kept in parallel during post -PHEV hybrid operations , possibly limiting hybrid efficiency to that of an unmodified Prius .
More complex PFC - 40 switching may minimize or eliminate this effect .
Unless voltage minima and maxima turn out to be sufficient cues , a battery management system ( BMS ) , including reasonably accurate state - of - charge ( SOC ) measurement , will be required to maintain SOC limits .
Advanced batteries
More advanced batteries may be retrofittable to the conversion .
This will probably require upgrading to CalCars ’ not - yet - designed next version of logic board , and will also probably require additional battery management electronics .
Any new battery ’s enclosure , mounting , and thermal management system will no doubt also be very different .

Note that figures are for usable , not total , capacity in kWh ( usually 80 % , but much less for the current PbA pack ( 4.8 kWh total capacity ) , due to Wikipedia : Peukert 's Law ) .
Parts availability
All parts are off - the - shelf with the following exceptions :
the logic board
Once we know demand , we will order a bunch fabricated .
Post - fabrication rework is also required due to major architectural changes since its inception .
A reworked , stuffed , and fully - tested form of this board may be made available at some point .
If so , it will probably cost hundreds of dollars and save 20 - 40 hours of parts purchase , identification , stuffing , soldering , and testing .
We do plan to redesign this board in the future , using IC logic , a PLA , and / or a microcontroller .
The new version will probably be required for eventual upgrade of a conversion to use a more advanced battery pack .
a version of CAN - View with relays to control the conversion .
2006 + Prii require a version capable of driving an add - on touch - screen ; this should be available by the time anyone needs it .
a charger designed for the PbA battery pack .
Three options are planned : a Delta-q charger ( http://www.delta-q.com) designed for the PbA battery pack , at a projected price of $ 800 .
We are in discussions with the company and will soon know if / when pre-production units will be available ; UL - approved units are likely to be available in 2007 .
the Brusa NLG503 charger , available through http://www.metricmind.com/index1.htm for $ 2650 retail including cables ( a group rate is possible ) .
Users can reprogram this charger for other voltages and battery chemistries , so it would be a good purchase for developers anticipating an eventual high - tech replacement battery .
( eventually ) the Manzanita Micro PFC - 40 charger , available through http://manzanitamicro.com for around $ 2000 .
This charger has programmable but less sophisticated charging algorithms , but can also double as a high - power DC : DC converter between the battery packs .
Its output is not line isolated .
Its incorporation will require modifications / enhancements of this conversion , and control circuitry and algorithms that have not yet been developed .
mechanical parts that require fabrication from off - the - shelf pieces such as angle aluminum and sheets of ABS , plexiglass , and / or lexan ( polycarbonate )
Some of these parts may eventually become available prefabricated .
we , or some other supplier or affiliate , may offer various components to speed and simplify the conversion .
We ’re interested ( see the Conversion Interest page ) in knowing how much interest there is for pre-assembled ( or at least pre-cut ) components , at a higher cost than fabrication via you own free labor but no doubt lower than what you would have to pay a fabricator .
The table below outlines approximate component costs , as well as estimated labor costs for component fabrication or assembly .
A range is given , as the number of components made and where they are done has a great bearing on the final cost .
We are not fabricators , professional assemblers , or product retailers , so these are guesses as to what a for - profit company or craftsman would charge .
If a great number of kits or components are desired , offshore fabricators may beat these estimates by a lot .
Please answer the new questions for our information - gathering at the Conversion Interest page .

The heart that grew back : ' Miracle ' of girl whose heart healed itself after a third was removed in emergency operation
' Miracle ' : Kirsty Collier 's heart grew back after a third was removed when she was a baby
Aged four months , Kirsty Collier lay dying on the operating table with a serious heart defect .
Her surgeon had tried his best to correct the problem but thought the organ was so badly damaged that there was no hope .
As a last - ditch attempt to save Kirsty 's life , he decided to cut away a third of her heart , enlarged because of her condition , in case that restarted it .
And against all the odds , it once again began to beat .
For Professor Stephen Westaby , that , in itself , was a miracle .
But ten years on , Kirsty 's heart has proved even more of a surprise .
For it has healed itself in a way experts never thought possible , and is now the normal size and shape for a girl of her age – without a single telltale scar from the original surgery .
Kirsty was born with a rare heart condition , which is frequently fatal within the first three months of life .
The defect meant that her left coronary artery , which carries blood to the heart muscle , was connected to the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta .
As a result , the organ was starved of oxygen and became enlarged .
Kirsty had numerous heart attacks as a baby and her prospects seemed bleak .
As her condition became critical , Professor Westaby was called upon to carry out corrective surgery at the John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford .
Fight for life :
When she was 4 months old , Kirsty was having numerous mild heart attacks because her heart was starved of oxygen
But Kirsty was linked up to a heart lung bypass machine for the surgery – and when the surgical team attempted to get the heart to take over once again , they found it was so badly damaged that it was unable to pump blood again .
' We felt there was no hope at all , ' Professor Westaby told Sky News .
A message was even sent to Kirsty 's parents to warn them ' it was not going well ' .
' She was essentially dead and was only resurrected by what I regarded at the time as a completely bizarre operation , ' added Professor Westaby .
However , the surgeon had a hunch that reducing the size of Kirsty 's heart would ease the pressure on the muscle , allowing it to contract properly .
Almost too late : Kirsty was finally sent to a specialist heart unit after being sent back and forth to her GP for the first four months of her life
And using scissors , he removed a large section of the muscle wall , stitched it back together , and hoped for the best .
' I have to confess I never thought it would work .
It was an awful lot smaller . '
But the baby 's heart began beating again .
Today , Kirsty , of Cirencester , Gloucestershire , is a sporty tenyear - old who plays rugby at school .
' Her recovery is miraculous , ' said Professor Westaby .
' Bizarre operation ' : Faced with Kirsty dying on his operating table , Professor Stephen Westaby decided to cut away a third of heart in a last - ditch attempt to restart it
Her mother , Becky , 38 , said : ' She 's such a sporty girl .
It 's hard to imagine she was ill sometimes . '
Recalling her first sight of Kirsty after the operation , she added : ' There she was , my tiny baby , with tubes everywhere .
They said she 'd take a step forward and a step back .
But I could tell by looking at her that she would keep going .
It 's amazing what she has overcome .
' She 's such a brave little girl but and has never let her condition affect her life at all .
I think that has been behind her recovery – she does n't think about it . '
Kirsty 's father Wayne , a computer - software salesman , said : ' It was a dark day when she went in the operating theatre .
It 's unbelievable .
She has a normal life like any other girl . '
Kirsty with her mother Becky Collier .
Kirsty , 10 , has made a ' miraculous recovery ' since the operation and now plays rugby at her primary school
Professor Westaby said the results of a recent MRI scan of Kirsty 's heart were ' fascinating ' because of the extent the heart has healed itself .
' An adult heart would n't do that . '
As for Kirsty , she has refused to let her early problems shape her life .
' I do n't want to be different to anyone else just because I 've had a heart operation , ' she said .
newswire article reporting oregon & cascadia animal rights | environment Activists Crash Sea Lion Press Conference At Bonneville Dam author : Columbiana Today , activists from the Sea Lion Defense Brigade and In Defense of Animals , along with several autonomous individuals , crashed a press conference held by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife ( ODFW ) and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife ( WDFW ) at Bonneville Dam .
The press conference was being held to pre-emptively curb public revulsion over the agencies ' plans to kill sea lions on the river beginning next week .
They did not announce the conference publically , and they made it clear that " press ID will be required " in order to attend .
Nevertheless , activists and some independent media representatives managed to skirt the crack security out there ( yes , the same crack security that allowed six sea lions to be mysteriously trapped and killed last year ... ) , and infiltrate the conference .
They actually gave us all hard hats and ID badges .
This is a very quick and brief report - back , as I must be elsewhere now .
However , I urge other indy reporters and activists who were there today to add their own observations and photographs to this report .
Activists were there to ask the hard questions that are not being asked by the corporate media .
Questions like , " Are n't you again raising the fishing quota this year , at the same time that you are talking about the need to kill sea lions ? "
" How many years in a row have you raised the quotas for commercial and sport fishermen ? "
" Did n't you just raise the quota to 13 % , and did n't you say in your own documents that a 13 % take by fishermen would pose ' no significant impact ' to the salmon population ?
How , then , can you tell the public that the sea lions ' alleged take of 4 % of salmon poses a significant impact to the salmon population ? "
" Have n't sea lions always co-existed with salmon on the Columbia river , without posing a threat to either species ? "
" Is n't it true that dams and over - fishing are causing salmon to go extinct , not sea lions ? "
" Why are you not addressing the salmon crisis in a non-lethal , and far more effective , manner by curbing fishing ? "
And many other questions .
Bizarrely , the corporate " reporters " stood mutely by while these questions were blatantly skirted by the people who organized this press conference .
When one activist demanded answers regarding the raising of the fishing quotas at a time when salmon populations are imperiled , Diana Fredlund of the Army Corps of Engineers leapt between the questioner and the government " expert " who could not answer the question .
Diana brusquely told the questioner that " we are not here to answer questions . " ... At a press conference .
The corporate reporters never even batted an eye nor asked a single relevant follow up question .
The same thing occurred again and again , as activists and indy reporters sought answers to legitimate questions about this very misguided program .
Thank God for indymedia , because I 'll bet you do n't see most of this on the news tonight .
The highlight of the occasion was to be a demonstration of the newly refurbished traps .
Those following this story will recall that six sea lions were mysteriously trapped in two separate traps last year , and died under very suspicious circumstances which have still not been adequately explained .
This proved to be such a PR disaster for the agencies involved in the trapping program that they halted trapping for the remainder of last year .
Today , we were told that the traps have been redesigned to work flawlessly , with a remote control device that would make it impossible for any problems like that to occur this year .
The official at the controls warned everyone that the doors , when they closed , would close very quickly and everyone should be ready with their cameras .
Reporters and corporate - media - pseudo - reporters eagerly lined the banks for the big moment .
Someone asked for a countdown , and the official obliged .
" Three !
Two !
One ! " .... and ... nothing .
The traps did not spring .
" Aw , would n't you know , " grumbled the official I was standing near .
They tried again .
" Three !
Two !
One ! " ... nothing .
The remote control failed to work , the traps failed to close .
A long and ponderous moment .
The awkward silence was finally broken by IDA 's Matt Rossell .
I will paraphrase , but later I can quote directly from the video tape : " Given what just happened , " He began , " How is the public to have any trust or confidence in your agencies ?
Given this , and what happened last year , how are we to place our trust in your ability to pull this off in a humane and competent manner ? "
Again , no answers .
And no follow up by the corporate media .
Before I close this report , I want to just underline the horror that seems to have been missed here by most of the reports I 've seen on this subject :
If people do nothing , sea lions will be killed , beginning next week .
Sea lions will die for the crime of eating .
This is wrong .
Plans are to trap as many as they can , but everyone involved concedes that they will then turn to shooting the sea lions in the water .
This should matter to anyone who cares about Cascadia .
If it matters to you , DO something .
Please .

During the early years of interactive fiction , the art of dealing with one 's inventory was a novel and often tricky concept .
Often times one had to be resourceful enough to combine disparate objects , use them in out - of - context situations , and on more than one occasion resort to using household items as weapons of mass destruction .
When a problem was met that could not be solved immediately , it was frequently the case that a newly - discovered item served as an epiphany within itself .
For this reason , gamers learned quickly to type GET $ EVERYTHING in every situation and , on the advent of point - and - click strategy games , clicked everything thrice for good measure .
Hoarding items became as important a skill as the most complex puzzle - solving abilities .
With this in mind , a number of early games - the Zork series being particularly heinous offenders - did not require you to use every item you acquired to beat a game .
There were multiple solutions , shortcuts , and a number of items which were only useful in so far as they kept you alive .
In particular , many games required you to eat and drink within a certain number of turns or distance traveled , lest your onscreen character starve to death .
Apparently a number of gamers complained about this too - realistic routine , and it was more or less dropped from strategy games at some point .
However , the food and drinks themselves remained , containing important clues or providing solutions to various puzzles ( drink the potion to fly , eat the meat to acquire the bone , etc. ) in order to win the game .
Ken and Roberta Williams ' fifth addition to their highly - recommended King 's Quest series was marked by a number of new features , all of which paled in comparison to the use of voice acting , a first for point - and - click adventure gaming .
The title was a big hit among PC gamers , though of course it was not without its flaws .
However , by far , the biggest flaw in the game itself was not the result of poor programming or technical mischief , but rather an amalgamation of false expectations of the average player , the increased demand for total player freedom by the gamer market , and the cold story logic of the game itself .
In short : do n't eat the pie .
Early in the game , the main character , King Graham , was provided with a pie from the local town bakery .
Some players simply scarfed down the pie , to no obvious detriment .
They continued on , battling their way through foreign lands , deadly deserts , and underwater dangers .
Finally , they arrived at a showdown between Graham and an Abominable Snowman .
How did you defeat him ?
By using the pie , of course .
" But I already ate the pie , " the gamer laments , " and I do n't have a saved game file from before I ate the pie ! "
Poor King Graham ...
Of course , players claimed this was unfair .
Eating the pie should cause King Graham 's head to explode !
( Or , at the very least , give him a fatal case of gas . )
Other players chided their friends for not keeping several save files in rotation ( a fairly common , but not required , practice for adventure games . )
However , everyone in the industry generally agreed that it was bad practice for a ) point - and - click games to become unwinnable and b ) for the character of an adventure game to die .
Although Sierra never relented on point B , in all of their future games of the King 's Quest , Space Quest , and Leisure Suit Larry series , decisions made early in the game could affect the overall outcome of the game , but never threatened the winnability of the entire gameplay itself .
Eventually , of course , as interactive fiction games became less common in the gamer 's marketplace and were in turn taken over by freeware enthusiasts and volunteer coders , point B also vanished into the history of adventure gaming , with games such as Day of the Tentacle , Escape from Monkey Island , and an ever - increasing market of low - budget , freely distributed point - and - click adventures subjecting the main character to less tortured scenarios and more open gameplay - if you ate the pie , another one was made available at the bakery .
Problem solved .
So , was it a design flaw ?
Bad logic circuitry ?
Or was it simply an " asking for it " consequence of poor in - game decision - making and even poorer environment management by the user ?
As the old joke goes , " 50 million stupid people can't be wrong ... "
IPwatchD an IP conflict detection tool for Linux
Project name : IPwatchD - IP conflict detection tool
Author : Jaroslav Imrich
Project 's Home Page : IPwatchD
Introduction
Prerequisites
* build - essential - C compiler and other development tools
* libpcap - dev - Network packet capture library
* libnet1 - dev - Network packet construction library
* libnotify - dev - sends desktop notifications to a notification daemon
# apt - get install build - essential libpcap - dev libnet1 - dev libnotify - dev
Installation
When using a GNU / Linux operating system , from time to time you may come across a situation where network connectivity was interrupted due to the IP conflict .
An IP conflict event occurs when two or more hosts on the same network are configured with identical IP addresses .
At the present , there appears to be no code in the Linux kernel to take care of this situation by means of appropriate Gratuitous ARP response .
Very often a network administrator is left in the complete ignorance by the Linux kernel and needs to troubleshoot IP conflict the hard way .
Fortunately , there is a simple daemon called IPwatchD which main purpose is to catch and evaluate packets on the network and this way is able to prevent an IP conflict occurrence .
This is done by help of libpcap library .
IPwatchD daemon is written in C language and can run in passive or active modes .
The difference between a passive and active mode is that in the passive mode IPwatchD only logs every IP conflict event by engaging syslog daemon , and in active mode IPwatchD takes one step further and responds to Gratuitous ARP request which is the main construction block when it comes to the IP conflict prevention .
This article will explore this simple daemon in terms of installation , configuration and usage .
Before we can install IPwatchD under the GNU / Linux operating system it is recommended to confirm that all prerequisites needed by IPwatchD are installed on the system .
Here is a list of packages you would need to install on Ubuntu 8.10 .
On ubuntu or debian linux you can install those packages with a following linux command
Now , that we have installed all required prerequisites , it is time to compile and install IPwatchD daemon .
There are two types of IPwatchD installations .
Desktop version with build - in GUI message notification
Server version which encompasses just the IPwatchd daemon without a GUI message notification
IPwatchD Desktop version
$ bunzip2 ipwatchd-x.x.tar.bz2
$ tar xvjf ipwatchd - x.x.tar
$ cd ipwatchd-x.x/src
$ make
# make install
IPwatchD Server version
$ bunzip2 ipwatchd-x.x.tar.bz2
$ tar xvjf ipwatchd - x.x.tar
$ cd ipwatchd-x.x/src
$ make daemon
# make install
Difference between Desktop and Server version is that in Desktop version IPwatchD reacts to the IP conflict event by displaying a message on the GUI as well as to the relevant long files .
In the contrary to the Desktop version , Server version only logs an IP conflict event to the relevant log files .
The installation routine of IPwatchD for both Desktop and Server versions is very similar .
Download IPwatchD source code tarball and enter following linux command s: Once a binary is compiled , login as a superuser ( root ) and enter :
To install a IPwatchD server version compile a IPwatchd source code by :
Once a binary is compiled , login a superuser ( root ) and enter :
At this point all IPwatchD executable binaries are copied into the /usr / local / sbin .
The configuration file can be found in /usr / local / etc directory .
NOTE : To uninstall IPwatchD , simply as a root user issue a command :
make unistall
Configuration
eth0 active
Usage
# /usr/local/sbin/ipwatchd -c /usr/local/etc/ipwatchd.conf
ps aux | grep ipwatchd
root 10814 0.0 0.2 2032 572 ?
Ss 19:27 0:00
/usr/local/sbin/ipwatchd -c /usr/local/etc/ipwatchd.conf
root 10818 0.0 0.3 3240 796 pts/1 R+ 19:27 0:00 grep ipwatchd
As it was already mentioned above , an IPwatchD daemon can work in two modes .
To instruct this daemon to listen on the eth0 in active mode amend a configuration file /usr / local /etc/ipwatchd.conf with a following line : IpwatchD daemon is also able to work with virtual interfaces .
So feel free to add line " eth0:1 passive " if you want IPwatchD listen on eth0:1 network interface in a passive mode .
Curent version of IPwatchD 1.1.1 does not start by it self .
To start IPwatchD run a following linux command as a root user : Confirm that IPwatchD is running on your system by ps command :
You should get an output similar to the one below :
To logic here is as follows , modern operating systems are trying to avoid an IP conflict by sending a special type of ARP broadcast packets at the boot time or during a network interface reconfiguration .
This type of special broadcast packet is called [ http://wiki.wireshark.org/Gratuitous_ARP
Gratuitous ARP ] .
The purpose of the Gratuitous ARP packet is to discover , if an IP address they are about to acquire is not already taken by yet another host .
An alternative to the GUI notification message is a syslog file .
IPwatchD also logs all relevant IP conflict events into the syslog file .
Here is a sample message generated by IPwatchD daemon :
an 11 20:50:47 linuxconfig - desktop IPwatchD [ 13215 ] : MAC address 8:0:27:b6:5a:6 c causes
IP conflict with address 10.1.1.6 set on interface eth0 - active mode - reply sent
Jan 11 20:50:47 linuxconfig - desktop avahi-daemon [ 3965 ] : Withdrawing address
record for 10.1.1.6 on eth0 .
Conclusion
To stop IPwatchD daemon you can use kill command .
This way IPwatchD daemon receives SIGTERM signal which will gracefully stop this process , release a used memory and stop listening on a network interface .
For the long run , to make it automatic , you can also create some simple daemon init.d script and link it from an appropriate runlevel directory on your system .
IPwatchD is certainly a handy tool which can sometimes save you a day .
However , there are also some limitations .
Current version of IPwatchD 1.1.1 is limited to only GNOME graphical user interface .
Nevertheless , it is still possible to use a Server version and refer to the syslog file in case of some unexpected connectivity problems .
Edwin Salpeter and the Gasbags of Jupiter
By Larry Klaes
‘ The Gasbags of Jupiter ’ sounds for all the world like the title of an early 1930s novel that would have run in a venue like Science Wonder Stories .
In fact , as Larry Klaes tells us below , the idea grew out of Carl Sagan ’s speculations about free - floating life - forms that might populate the atmospheres of gas giant planets like Jupiter .
Cornell physicist Edwin Salpeter had much to do with the evolution of that concept , helping Sagan produce a paper that was a classic of informed imagination ( and one that led to numerous science fiction treatments as the idea gained currency ) .
Larry ’s celebration of Salpeter ’s life gives a nod to that paper but also notes his deep involvement in the study of the most distant celestial objects .
On March 14 , the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University will commemorate the life of one of their most prestigious faculty members : Edwin E. Salpeter , the James Gilbert White Distinguished Professor of Physical Sciences Emeritus .
Salpeter died of leukemia last November 26 at his home in Ithaca , just before his 84th birthday .
At the Heart of the Quasar
The biographies on Salpeter , who came to Cornell in 1948 , primarily mention his work in the astrophysics of distant cosmic objects .
As just one example , Salpeter was among the first scientists to come up with the current explanation for the enormous energies from quasars , which is short for QUAsi-StellAr Radio sources .
The cores of these very distant galaxies contain supermassive black holes which collect vast amounts of debris that are pulled into fast - spinning accretion disks around these gravitational wells .
So much debris falls onto these black holes that it is often ejected back into deep space in relatively tight beams known as relativistic jets , which shoot out across intergalactic space for many thousands of light years .
Quasars are some of the most luminous objects in the Universe and thanks to Salpeter ’s work on understanding their nature , astronomers have a much better idea how these distant bodies are such powerhouses .

But perhaps the most recognized work of Salpeter is , ironically , one that many probably do not know he was involved with , or that his collaborator was one of the most recognized names and faces in science :
The late Cornell astronomer Carl Sagan , who died in December of 1996 from myelodysplasia , a rare form of leukemia .
Pushing Habitability to New Extremes
Among Sagan ’s many and varied interests , perhaps his favorite was extraterrestrial life .
Sagan was one of the pioneers who brought about the acceptance by the mainstream science community of the possibility that beings of all kinds existed beyond our planet Earth .
He would often speculate on alien life on worlds and in realms few had considered at the time .
One of Sagan ’s truly revolutionary ideas about aliens was the concept of creatures that dwelled not on or in the surface of some Earthlike planet but spent their entire lives floating in the atmosphere of giant gaseous worlds such as Jupiter , which could hold over one thousand Earths .
Unlike the inner terrestrial worlds such as Venus and Mars , Jupiter and its fellow giants are made up primarily of atmospheric gases , though the incredible pressures in these worlds ’ lower layers of air turns the hydrogen in them into a metal .
Sagan thought that since the upper atmosphere of Jupiter was relatively friendlier by comparison and contained many complex organic molecules , they may have had time in the five billion years since the formation of the Solar System to turn out some type of life , an aerial form of creature that never touched or knew a planetary surface .
To determine just how scientifically plausible such aliens might be , Sagan asked his colleague Salpeter to help him produce a paper on the subject which was titled “ Particles , Environments , and Possible Ecologies in the Jovian Atmosphere . ”
The paper first appeared in the prestigious The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series in late 1975 .
A Jovian Taxonomy
Sagan and Salpeter envisioned three main types of Jovian creatures .
There were sinkers , small organisms which were constantly falling towards the deadly deep , dense , and hot layers of the planet but always managed to survive long enough to produce offspring that would stay up in the more habitable air layers to repeat their cycle of life .
The other aerial residents of Jupiter were known as floaters , which Sagan would later describe as being “ kilometers across , enormously larger than the greatest whale that ever was , beings the size of cities . ”
Floaters were seen as drifting across the vast alien sky in great herds , looking like a collection of immense balloons , which in essence there were , using the lighter elements of Jupiter ’s atmosphere to stay aloft .
Image : Salpeter and Sagan ’s Jovian aerialists , as imagined by the artist Adolf Schaller .
As with life on Earth , the Jovian ecosystem would also have its share of predators which Sagan and Salpeter named , appropriately , hunters .
The hunters were envisioned as being fast and able to maneuver , preying on the floaters “ for their organic molecules and for their stores of pure hydrogen . ”
Love and Death Among the Gasbags
As author William Poundstone stated in his 1999 biography Carl Sagan : A Life in the Cosmos about this paper and its authors , “ they produced one of the more singular scientific articles of the time , a quantitative analysis ( with sixty equations ) of life , love , and death in the air of Jupiter . ”
Poundstone was especially amused about Sagan and Salpeter ’s speculations on how such Jovian natives might reproduce , highlighting the paper ’s statement that “ the distinction between hunting and mating under these conditions is not sharp . ”
The paper also noted that the two Voyager space probes scheduled to make flybys of Jupiter in 1979 had cameras powerful enough to just resolve the floaters if such beings existed at that world and were high up enough to be spotted .
Whether the images of Jupiter ’s swirling , colorful face that were later returned by the twin robot explorers were ever scrutinized for any floaters remains unknown .
Landmark as this paper was , it was the appearance by the Jovian aerial beings in Sagan ’s equally landmark television series Cosmos that brought this concept to the general public .
In the second episode of the thirteen - part PBS series first shown in 1980 , the Jovians were briefly introduced in a magnificent painting made by artist Adolf Schaller .
Sagan also mentioned his colleague by name as the person who helped to bring these strange beings to life in both the episode and in the companion book to the series .
The Cornell scientist noted that even if sinkers , floaters , and hunters did not actually live on Jupiter , they might still dwell on some other worlds in the Milky Way galaxy .

See the virtual autopsy
Many people hate the idea of a loved one being dissected – even if it could provide vital clues about how and why they died .
But it may not be necessary for much longer .
A growing number of countries , including the UK , Australia , US , and Japan , are looking towards virtual autopsies as an alternative to opening the bodies of people who die in suspicious circumstances .
By combining surface scans of the body with CT and MRI scans , it is possible to work out what happened to a person without cutting them open .
A small biopsy of tissue is also taken to measure cellular structure and to check for the presence of drugs .
Virtual autopsies have several advantages : as well as overcoming moral objections to autopsy , it also means the pathologist has a permanent 3D record of damage to the body , something which is n’t possible once you begin cutting it open .
Description of autopsies will also become less subjective , as the data can be reinterpreted by independent pathologists if need be .
The video above was created by scanning the head of a man who committed suicide by shooting himself through the forehead .
It shows how the bullet entered the skull , then travelled through the brain and out the other side .
The apparent marks around the mouth are interference lines caused by metal or amalgam fillings in the dead man ’s mouth .

Clearer picture
Michael Thali at the University of Bern , Switzerland , who developed the Virtopsy , is now combining his reconstructions of bodies , with 3D reconstructions of crime scenes and objects or weapons that may have caused the injuries or death .
In doing so , he hopes to get a clearer picture of the sequence of events that caused the injuries .
At the American Academy of Forensic Sciences meeting in Denver , Colorado , on Wednesday , Thali demonstrated the effectiveness of his method with a Virtopsy image of a decomposing head .
It showed that the Virtopsy had enabled him to localise the source of trauma within the brain – an improvement on conventional autopsies .
If you cut into an extremely decomposed head , he said , “ Everything is thrown out ” .

The majority of dinosaurs were peaceful , plant - eating creatures that developed the Earth 's first strong social communities .
Herds , packs and families of dinosaurs were commonplace .
Many fossils have been found where groups of dinosaurs died together , such as the ones which sank in the quicksand off the Isle of Wight .
In Alberta , Canada , a mass grave has been discovered containing at least 300 grazing dinosaurs of all ages and sizes .
This herd was swept to death by a flash flood while trying to cross a deep river .
In Montana , in the USA , an even bigger herd of about 10,000 dinosaurs has been discovered .
These creatures were poisoned by volcanic gases and buried in ash .
Their fossilised bones stretch out in a straight line for more than a mile .
Modern understanding of how dinosaurs lived together was transformed by a fossil specialist called Dr Jack Horner , who made a most extraordinary discovery in the mid-1970s .
Horner and his team were fossil - hunting in Montana when they came across America 's first dinosaur nesting site .
They found a number of dinosaur eggs as well as the fossilised remains of baby dinosaur embryos .
They called these creatures Maiasaura , which means " good mother lizard " .
Each season Maiasaura returned to the same breeding grounds where they refurbished their old nests .
These dinosaurs lived in colonies and looked after their young in herds until they were old enough to start families of their own .
Here , beyond all reasonable doubt , lie the origins of the family unit .
More than 200 dinosaur - egg sites have now been found across the world .
The eggs range in size from as small as a pebble to as big as a football .

Other dinosaur - like creatures , too numerous to mention , also lived through these times .
The pterosaurs were enormous flying reptiles that dominated the prehistoric skies .
One of them holds the world record for biggest wingspan of any creature ever to have lived .
At nearly 20 m across , its wings were as large as those of a Second World War Spitfire .
A mystery of feathered flight : where did the world 's first birds come from ?
Hermann von Meyer , a German fossil - hunter , thought he'd got the answer to this puzzle in 1861 when he announced the discovery of what he claimed was the first ever bird .
He called it Archaeopteryx .
It was about the same size as a modern magpie , and was definitely bird - like .
Its feathers were arranged in just the same way as modern birds ' , with an aerodynamic configuration to make flight possible .
It even had bird - like claws on its legs , and a wishbone .
Von Meyer 's fossil dated back some 140 million years , at about the same time that the first flowers were beginning to bloom ( see Part 2 ) .
Since then , a further 10 Archaeopteryx specimens have been found in a region of Germany called Solnhofen .
But for years a mystery remained .
From what did these creatures descend , and how did they learn to fly ?
So perplexing was this puzzle that the birds were shunted into their own separate group , neither reptiles like the dinosaurs , or mammals like man .
They were just , well , birds .
Then , in 1995 , Chinese scientists announced that they had dug out a fossil which proved conclusively that some dinosaurs did indeed have down - like feathers .
Sinosauropteryx caused a sensation .
It was a small , 1.5 m - long , two - legged dinosaur with the jaws and flattened teeth typical of meat - eating dinosaurs .
It had clawed fingers , and its hind limbs show that it must have been a fast runner .
At last , the puzzle of where birds descended from seemed to have been solved .
They are indeed the last and only surviving branch of the dinosaurs .
But this still left several perplexing questions unanswered .
Sinosauropteryx feathers show no signs of the aerodynamics needed for lifting a body into the air .
It could n't fly .
So what were its feathers for ?
Experts began to think that perhaps feathers were not originally intended as equipment for flight at all .
Perhaps it was only later , by some freak or accident , that they became adapted for the purpose .
Small dinosaurs may have developed feathers as a way of keeping warm – a form of insulation .
Feathers are now thought to have been common on all kinds of dinosaurs .
The reason this has only recently come to light is that feathers are not normally preserved in fossils .
Lots of dino - birds have now been discovered in China 's treasure trove of fossils and bones .
One of the most famous is Dave , the fuzzy raptor , unearthed in 2000 .
He was covered from head to tail in a coat of fine feathers , although they were n't designed for flight .
The final part of the bird riddle remains unsolved .
How and when did they adapt their insulating feathers into wings for flight ?
Did they jump from the trees after spying a tasty meal from on high , swooping down to snatch their prey ?
Or did they run along the ground , perhaps trying to escape some other hungry beast , and flap up to safety ?
No one is certain , although another recent fossil from China 's " Pompeii " , a microraptor , suggests the " top - down " theory , because it has both the right kind of feathers for flight and the right sort of claws for climbing trees .
But just how and when its feathers of flight evolved is still a mystery , whose answers probably lie somewhere in rocks still waiting to be found .
One of the people who make me think that Perl is still worth knowing is chromatic , the ex-editor of O’Reilly ’s perl.com .
He ’s one of the core team who are working to bring the Perl 6 Christmas , a vector of test infection , an extreme programming practitioner and , right now at least , no longer on Giles Bowkett ’s christmas card list .

This was an allusion to something chromatic had said when I interviewed him for the article - at the time he was pitching that very book , but it seems he got knocked back .
So , he ’s writing a book and a blog on Modern Perl , and a jolly good blog it is too .
It reads like a manifesto in places , but it ’s a good manifesto , so that ’s okay .

The star has only made three cameo appearances since becoming governor
California governor and former action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger is to play himself in a film being made by Sylvester Stallone .
The 61 - year - old will make a rare big - screen appearance in The Expendables , Stallone 's publicist confirmed .
The film , in which Stallone also stars , follows a group of mercenaries trying to overthrow a South American dictator .
Actors Jet Li , Dolph Lundgren , Eric Roberts , Mickey Rourke and Forest Whitaker will also star .
As well as acting , Stallone is also writing and directing the film .
Publicist Sheryl Main said Schwarzenegger will play himself as California 's governor and will shoot his scene in Los Angeles .
The actor has made just three cameos for friends since becoming governor in 2003 , including Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson film The Rundown in 2003 and Around the World in 80 Days in 2004 .
Schwarzenegger and Stallone co-founded the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood together in 1991 , along with Bruce Willis , but the Terminator star severed all his financial ties with the business in 2000 .
Could the United States Be Kicked Out of Kyrgyz Air Base ?
( This Is Actually Important ! )
Created : February 03 , 2009 14:43 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Via Nathan Hodge at Danger Room , there are Russian reports that Kyrgyzstan is going to end American access to their Manas Air Base .
If true , that ’s huge : Manas is a massive logistics hub for resupplying U.S. forces in Afghanistan by air .
At the moment , Taliban and aligned forces are going after NATO supply lines to Afghanistan that run by ground through Pakistan , and losing access to Manas would compound problems for the United States in Afghanistan significantly .
Manas is the only regional airbase the United States has access to for Afghanistan outside the country .
As the Associated Press notes , the United States lost access to its the so - called “ K - 2 ″ air base in Uzbekistan in 2005 , the only other aerial resupply point alternative , which the United States had leased .
For at least three years , the United States and the Kyrgyz government have been working out payments for the expensive base , all while the Russians have been pressing the former Soviet Republic to get the Americans out .
If these reports are correct , the Afghanistan war just got a lot harder .
A Pentagon spokesman , Lt. Col.
Mark Wright , says that the State Department has n’t sent any notice to the Pentagon of any impending changes about Manas access , and could n’t confirm these early reports .
Wright continued to say that there were “ multiple supply routes , both air and ground ” to keep resupplying troops in Afghanistan , but would n’t get into any specifics about rerouting in the “ hypothetical ” case of losing Manas .
When Cyber Criminals Eat Their Own
Some of the most prolific and recognizable malware disbursed by Russian and East European cyber crime groups purposefully avoids infecting computers if the program detects the potential victim is a native resident .
But evidence from the Conficker worm -- which by some estimates is infecting more than one million new PCs each day -- shows that trend may be shifting .
According to an analysis by Microsoft engineers , the original version of the Downadup ( a.k.a. " Conficker " ) worm will quit the installation process if the malware detects the host system is configured with a Ukrainian keyboard layout .
However , the latest variant has no such restriction .
Stats collected by Finnish computer security firm F - Secure show that Russia and Ukraine had the second and fifth - largest number of victims from the worm , 139,934 and 63,939 , respectively , as of Tuesday , Jan. 20 .
In the past , attackers from the infamous rogue anti-spyware families -- such as Antivirus 2009 -- have been programmed so that they fail to install if the installer detects the system is running a Russian or Ukrainian version of Windows .
Cyber crime affiliate sites such as " installscash.com " will pay affiliates good money for installing their adware and spyware on machines in dozens of countries .
But affiliates who try to make money infecting Russian and former Soviet Republic nations that make up the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) are out of luck ( see snapshot above , taken from installscash.com ) .
" We do not purchase Russian and CIS traffic , " reads the " terms " page of the installscash.com affiliate agreement .
The same goes for the popular pay - per- install affiliate program run by webmaster - money.org , which pays from one to 55 cents per install , depending on the country where the user victim lives .
That program does not pay for installs in Russia and in nearly two dozen other countries , nearly all of which are CIS nations .
All of this strongly supports the notions that not only are some of the most active malware writers living in Eastern Europe , but they 've also found it easier to fly under the radar of local law enforcement by not fleecing their own people .
E.J. Hilbert , a former FBI investigator who now works security for MySpace.com , helped Ukrainian authorities pursue some of the most wanted cyber crooks of his day .
Hilbert was heavily involved in going after guys who frequented online cyber crime bazaars like Carderplanet.com , which traded in stolen credit cards and other personal data .
Hilbert said the only real rule on Carderplanet and other such forums was that users did n't traffic in data belonging to CIS residents .
" There was a simple rule on Carderplanet : ' You do n't mess with the Commonwealth of Independent States , ' " Hilbert said .
" The subtext there was : ' If you ignore that rule , [ the authorities ] would come knock at your door . ' "
But Eugene Kaspersky , co-founder of Russian computer security software maker Kaspersky Lab , said the perception that all Eastern European cyber criminals - both individuals and groups - avoid attacking their own is neither accurate nor complete .
Kaspersky said cyber crime groups and individual actors in that region generally fall into one of three camps :
" Some of them [ are ] clever enough not to attack victims in their native country , " Kaspersky told Security Fix , so as not to attract attention from local authorities .
" Some of them [ are ] ' patriots . '
They said things like , ' We do not attack our own country , citizens / businesses but only targets abroad , ' and ' We invest money into the country by stealing from Western victims . ' "
A great many Russian and CIS - based criminal hackers , however , do n't pay much attention to where their victims are located , simply because it does n't matter to them , Kaspersky said .
What does matter , of course , is extracting cash or other useful resources from victims .
" Many criminals -- but not majority , of course -- in the third category were arrested or are under investigation , but those criminals are replaced with newcomers . "
There are signs that with the explosive growth in ready - made exploit kits , such as keystroke - logging malware like Zeus and Limbo , plenty of people in Kaspersky 's third category are willing to take the risks .
In December , Security Fix highlighted research that examined the geographic distribution of victims who had Zeus or Limbo on their computers .
This is possible because both keylogger programs record the country code indicated by the victim 's Internet address , and because the researchers had access to more than 70 so - called " drop sites " where these keyloggers regularly delivered data stolen from victim PCs .
Most of the drop sites studied in that report were created by Limbo keylogger toolkits .
Overall , Russia had the largest number of Limbo victims , with 26,700 infected machines ( 16.3 percent of the total ) .
The next largest group of Limbo victims were from the United States ( 14.4 percent ) and Spain ( 12.7 percent ) .
Hilbert said even if the attackers in control of those Russian PCs infested with keylogger software do n't use or sell financial data stolen from those machines , they can still use those systems to relay junk e-mail or attack others online .
" You may not get much [ financial data ] from a bunch of PCs used primarily by Russian schoolkids , but you 're still going to get a bunch more PCs to add to your botnet , " Hilbert said .
Update , Jan. 30 , 11:44 a.m. ET : Data from anti-spam outfit Spamhaus.org also supports the notion that cyber crooks increasingly are targeting their own .
Spamhaus 's " composite block list " or CBL , lists the number of distinct Internet addresses identified as sending spam .
In the CBL 's breakdown by country , Russia is home to the second - highest number of spam bots , just behind Brazil .
Ukraine ranks sixth on Spamhaus 's CBL , just before the United States .

German navy in operations off Somalia
By Marius Heuser
14 January 2009
For more than two weeks , Germany has been conducting naval operations in the Gulf of Aden , in order to secure the international sea routes .
According to Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung ( Christian Democratic Union , CDU ) , this is " the most robust mandate " in Germany 's post - war history .
Jung had flown to Djibouti to see off the frigate Karlsruhe .
No longer was it a matter of providing " aid , protection and mediation , " as in earlier operations , Jung stressed , but the forces could expressly engage in combat .
The mandate , passed by the Bundestag ( federal parliament ) in December by a large majority , sanctions German military personnel not only to attack hostile ships but also to sink them .
The despatch of the frigate Karlsruhe is only the beginning .
When required , the frigate Mecklenburg Vorpommern can also be used directly for support .
This ship is presently working in the region with a clearly weaker mandate within the framework of Operation Enduring Freedom under US leadership .
Under the new mandate , up to 1,400 German military personnel can now be deployed in the Gulf of Aden .
The deployment is part of the European Union operation Atlanta , which was passed on November 10 , 2008 by the EU Council as an anti-piracy measure .
Five to ten countries are participating in the operation , including France and Britain .
Operational headquarters are in London , with a mobile command post alternating between Greece , Spain and the Netherlands .
In addition to the European armed forces , ships from Russia , the US , China and Iran are also deployed in the Gulf of Aden .
This massive concentration of foreign military in the region was made possible by UN resolution 1816 , passed on June 2 , 2008 .
This lifted Somali sovereignty over the country 's own coastal waters and permits any military power in the world to deploy a mission against the alleged pirates , even inside the 12 - mile area directly off the Somali coast .
This also covers air space .
The number of pirates operating off the Somalia coast has increased considerably in recent years , after the US - supported invasion of the country by Ethiopian troops .
Various sources put the figures between 100 and 300 pirate attacks , with 39 to 200 ships being captured , out of an estimated 16,000 - 30,000 ships passing through the region annually .
Altogether about $ 50 million in ransom has been obtained by hijacking ships .
The enormous military operation , however , cannot be explained simply by the fight against piracy .
In times of economic crisis , none of the world 's great powers want to cede control of this important maritime route to their competitors , and through which the majority of the Asia - Europe trade runs .
The geo-strategic significance of such commercial sea routes is comparable with aggressively contested oil and gas pipelines .
Germany alone imports 56 percent of its crude oil by sea and a high percentage of Germany 's foreign trade is also transported by sea .
Under the banner of the fight against piracy , international disputes are beginning over commercial routes and sea lanes that can result in violent military conflicts .
Already in the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , the " war on terror " has been used to justify imperialist politics .
The German government is now fashioning a close link between the fight against " terrorism " and its anti-piracy operation .
The Atlanta deployment and the US ' Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan are closely linked , as shown by the example of the frigate Mecklenburg Vorpommern .
According to a security strategy paper of the Christian Democrats ' parliamentary group from May 6 last year : " The spread of organized crime in weak states makes the threat of terrorism even more serious .
War , extremism and terrorism are being financed out of the proceeds of criminal activities , particularly from the drugs trade , but also from the illegal trade in arms , human trafficking , money laundering or piracy . "
Birgit Homburger of the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) expressed this link even more clearly when she told the Bundestag : " Cross - border international terrorism can no longer be differentiated from piracy and organized crime . "
She demanded that operations Atlanta and Enduring Freedom be combined .
The economic interests that lie behind the deployment of the German navy were also openly enunciated in the Bundestag .
Whereas humanitarian or at least security policy arguments were stressed during earlier debates about the deployment of Germany 's armed forces , the emphasis in the current debate was about respecting " German interests . "
For example , on December17 , Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier ( Social Democratic Party , SPD ) said , " Operation Atlanta should also improve the security of civilian navigation in the region , something in which we Germans also have an interest .
The Gulf of Aden is the backbone for the flow of trade between Europe and Asia ; 20,000 ships a year .
Many of these belong to German shipping companies that transport goods to or from Germany . "
Defence Minister Jung also invoked German interests when he implored the deputies to make " a contribution to restoring security on the seas and to guarantee free maritime trade , " since " we are export world champions . "
His party colleague Dorothee Bär concretized this point : " It is not only the Gulf of Aden that is threatened ; the liberty of world trade is also threatened .
The most important trade routes between Europe , the Arab peninsula and Asia pass through the sea lanes off Somalia .
Numerous German export goods reach their destinations on ships passing through the waters round the Horn of Africa .
As an export nation , we have a vital interest in preventing or limiting attacks on civilian shipping .
That applies to us in Germany , but it also applies to all of Europe . "
The FDP accused the government of inactivity .
Piracy should have been opposed much sooner , Birgit Homburger insisted : " This behaviour has disgraced the German navy . "
She also advocated taking harsher action against the pirates .
" It is not only necessary to chase away the pirates but also to hunt down the pirates , " she said .
This militaristic language , and the openness with which the various parties have endorsed a substantial military mission in the interests of German big business , shows the advanced extent of the imperialist ambitions of Germany 's ruling elite .
It is no longer prepared to factor in the widespread opposition in Germany to militarism and war in the implementation of its interests .
The fact that the parties in the Bundestag can behave so shamelessly is also linked to the fact that none of them advocates a principled opposition to military combat missions .
While the Left Party was the only parliamentary group to vote against the government motion , the party expressly endorses the use of force against piracy in the Gulf of Aden .
Left Party deputy Norman Paech made this clear at the beginning of his speech .
" In order to preclude any misunderstanding : The Left Party is for the security of the sea and trade routes and considers protection from piracy to be absolutely necessary and indispensable . "
Paech simply believes that a naval mission is the wrong way to proceed .
He wants to send the Bundespolizei ( German federal police ) to Somalia .
This was also confirmed by his parliamentary colleague Paul Schäfer : " The Left Party endorses the rapid construction of an international coast guard under the leadership of the UN in close coordination with the African Union .
Germany should participate by means of the Bundespolizei and render financial support . "
While the Left Party proposes " better ways " to protect international sea and trade routes , the government is converting the armed forces into an international intervention army with ability to implement Germany 's geo-strategic interests everywhere in the world against its rivals .
Among the official tasks of Germany 's armed forces , the government 's 1992 defence policy guidelines included the " Promotion and security of worldwide political , economic , military and ecological stability , " as well as the " maintenance of free world trade and access to strategic raw materials . "
The SPD - Green Party government then intensified this course and sent the armed forces on numerous military missions .
This was then laid down in 2003 in a new version of the defence policy guidelines , which extended the potential operational area for Germany 's armed forces to the entire globe and adopted the military doctrine of intimidation and preventive war developed by the US government as the guide for German defence policy .
In restructuring the German military into an aggressive intervention force , the development of the navy is a crucial factor .
Ever since German reunification in 1990 , the size of the navy has been systematically increased .
Whereas in 1990 it represented 7.5 percent of the overall armed forces , it is now closer to 10 percent .
In terms of defence expenditure , the proportion spent on the navy is rising even more rapidly .
In 1898 , when the German Empire under Kaiser Wilhelm began to develop its own deep - sea fleet , this German - English arms race led directly to the First World War .
The building of the first armoured ships in 1928 under SPD Chancellor Hermann Müller , finally heralded German rearmament and the rejection of the restrictions on the size of Germany 's fleet contained in the Treaty of Versailles .
The global military ambitions of a great power require a well - equipped navy .
Even now , with the recession deepening and markets on edge , Wall Street analysts say it is a good time to buy .
Still .
At the top of the market , they urged investors to buy or hold onto stocks about 95 percent of the time .
When stocks stumbled , they stayed optimistic .
Even in November , when credit froze , the economy stalled and financial markets tumbled to their lowest levels in a decade , analysts as a group rarely said sell .
And last month , as the Dow and Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index suffered their worst January ever , analysts put a sell rating on a mere 5.9 percent of stocks , according to Bloomberg data .
Many companies have taken such a beating in the downturn , analysts argue , that their shares are bound to bounce back .
Maybe .
But after so many bad calls on so many companies , why should investors believe them this time ?
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s top mobile phone maker Nokia is eyeing entering the laptop business , its Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said in an interview to Finnish national broadcaster YLE on Wednesday .
Nokia 's President and Chief Executive Officer Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo speaks during the ' Nokia World 08 ' congress in Barcelona , December 2 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Albert Gea
“ We are looking very actively also at this opportunity , ” Kallasvuo said , when asked whether Nokia plans to make laptops .
Industry has rumored about Nokia ’s possible plan to enter the PC industry since late last year , but Kallasvuo ’s comment was the first official admittance of such plans .
“ We do n’t have to look even for five years from now to see that what we know as a mobile phone and what we know as a PC are in many ways converging , ” Kallasvuo said .
“ Today we have hundreds of millions of people who are having their first Internet experience on the phone .
This is a good indication , ” he said .
Nokia ’s comments come a week after No 3 PC brand Acer launched a foray into the phone business with eight mobile phone models , joining leader Hewlett - Packard and No. 4 Lenovo in the high - growth space .
While strong profit margins in the smartphone industry attract PC brands , the attraction of the low - margin computer industry is less obvious .
“ Nokia maybe nervous about entering a market segment that is already heavily commoditized , but it would be in a position to exploit its enormous scale in manufacturing , supply chain and distribution , ” said Ben Wood , research director at CCS Insight .
“ All leading mobile network operators and retailers are adding connected notebooks and netbooks to their portfolios alongside mobile phones .
On this basis it comes as no surprise that Nokia is evaluating this segment , ” he said .
The global PC industry was resilient for most of last year when other technology sectors were ailing , but it too has now been caught up in the deepening economic downturn that has hit demand from consumers and corporate buyers .

[ Haskell - cafe ] Comparison of functional dependencies and type families [ was : Re : Type families not as useful over functions ]
Just for the record , here a few clarifications .
Expressiveness ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From a theoretical point of view , type families ( TFs ) and functional dependencies ( FDs ) are equivalent in expressiveness .
There is nothing that you can do in one and that 's fundamentally impossible in the other .
See also Related Work in < http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/SPCS08.html >.
In fact , you could give a translation from one into the other .
Haskell ~~~~~~~
This simple equivalence starts to break down when you look at the use of the two language features in Haskell .
This is mainly because there are some syntactic contexts in Haskell , where you can have types , but no class contexts .
An example , are " newtype " definitions .
Implementation in GHC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The situation becomes quite a bit more tricky once you look at the interaction with other type system features and GHC 's particular implementation of FDs and TFs .
Here the highlights : * GADTs : - GADTs and FDs generally can't be mixed ( well , you can mix them , and when a program compiles , it is type correct , but a lot of type correct programs will not compile ) - GADTs and TFs work together just fine * Existential types : - Do n't work properly with FDs ; here is an example : class F a r | a -> r instance F Bool Int data T a = forall b. F a b => MkT b add :: T Bool -> T Bool ->
T Bool add ( MkT x ) ( MkT y ) = MkT ( x + y ) -- TYPE ERROR - Work fine with TFs ; here the same example with TFs type family F a type instance F Bool = Int data T a = MkT ( F a ) add :: T Bool -> T Bool ->
T Bool add ( MkT x ) ( MkT y ) = MkT ( x + y )
( Well , strictly speaking , we do n't even need an existential here , but more complicated examples are fine , too . ) *
Type signatures : - GHC will not do any FD improvement in type signatures ; here an example that 's rejected as a result ( I assume Hugs rejects that , too ) : class F a r | a -> r instance F Bool Int same :: F Bool a => a ->
Int same = id -- TYPE ERROR
( You may think that this is a rather artificial example , but firstly , this idiom is useful when defining abstract data types that have a type dependent representation type defined via FDs .
And secondly , the same situation occurs , eg , when you define an instance of a type class where one method has a class context that contains a type class with an FD . ) -
TFs will be normalised ( ie , improved ) in type signatures ; the same example as above , but with a TF : type family F a type instance F Bool =
Int same :: F Bool ->
Int same = id * Overlapping instances : - Type classes with FDs may use overlapping instances ( I conjecture that this is only possible , because GHC does not improve FDs in type signatures . )
-
Type instances of TFs cannot use overlapping instances ( this is important to ensure type safety )
It 's a consequence of this difference that closed TFs are a features that is requested more often than closed classes with FDs .
Manuel PS : Associated types are just syntactic sugar for TFs , there is nothing that you can do with them that you cannot do with TFs .
Moreover , it is easy to use type families for bijective type functions ; cf. < http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2009-January/053696.html >.
( This follows of course from the equivalence of expressiveness of TFs and FDs . )
Ahn , Ki Yung : >
My thoughts on type families : > >
1 ) Type families are often too open .
I causes " rigid variable " > type error messages because when I start writing open type > functions , I often realize that what I really intend is not > truly open type functions .
It happens a lot that I had some > assumptions on the arguments or the range of the type function . >
Then , we need help of type classes to constrain the result of > open type functions .

One will soon need some class constraints .

In such cases , it may be more simple working > with functional dependencies alone , rather than using > both type classes and type families .
I wish we had closed > kinds so that we can define closed type functions as well as > open type functions .

2 ) Type families are not good when we need to match types > back and forth ( e.g. bijective functions ) , or even multiple > ways .

One of the ways AMD tests ATI Mobility Radeon GPUs , without having to design and build numerous mobile reference cards that fit in multiple notebook form factors , is to produce fully - loaded , custom reference cards that 'll fit into standard PCI Express x16 slots .
The cards wo n't be used in any actual retail product , but they allow AMD to test all of the various features and functionality , and experiment with clock speeds and voltages to fine tune and balance performance and power consumption .
What you see pictured here is an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4670 , PCI Express - based reference card .
We talked about the new mobility Radeon HD 4000 series during CES last month ; more details are available here .
The card pictured here is equipped with every type of output -- Displayport , DVI , VGA , S - Video / HD component , and HDMI -- and even has Cross Fire connectors for experimenting with multi-GPU configurations .
We 've got a couple of 512MB Mobility Radeon HD 4670 and 4570 class reference cards in house at the moment and will be bringing you a sneak peek at approximate performance using a desktop platform in the not too distant future .
For now , we thought you'd get a kick out of checking out an experimental design complete with a custom PCB and cooler Enjoy the geek porn .

A few months back I posted a Top Ten Ghost list in honor of Halloween .
Contained in the article was a mention of Slimer , the floating green blob from the Ghostbusters movies .
I ’m sure it is no surprise for Slimer to appear in such a list .
What was a bit of a surprise , at least for me , was how many people clicked on the link for Ecto Cooler in the post .
If you ’re not familiar , Ecto Cooler was the Hi-C tangerine and orange flavored drink featuring a picture of Slimer plastered on each box or can .
Unfortunately , it ’s long since ceased production , or at least ceased to exist under the Ecto Cooler brand .
But the reminiscing of all drinks got me thinking , why not profile some of the hits , or more accurately misses , of the drink world ?
Good or bad , sometimes remembering such things can be fun .
So this is a great look back on some of the sodas and soft drinks of years past :
The Pepsi Division
Crystal Pepsi ( 1992 - 1993 )
I think we ’d have to start any kind of discussion about dead soda with Crystal Pepsi ( or Pepsi Clear as it sometimes known by ) .
Sparked by a marketing fad that equated clarity with purity , Pepsi decided they wanted in and generated their infamous Crystal Pepsi drink .
Dubbed as a caffeine - free “ clear alternative ” to normal colas , it was backed by a large marketing campaign , including a television advertisement featuring Van Halen ’s hit song “ Right Now ” that premiered during Super Bowl XXVII :
Despite initial success , maybe due to the novelty of it all , sales for Crystal Pepsi quickly fell .
Was America not ready for clear cola ?
I remember trying it , and it seemed to taste like flat Pepsi , but maybe I got a bad can ?
The drink certainly has its fans .
Pepsi pulled it off the market , and revamped the soda several months later with a reformulated citrus drink titled “ Crystal From Pepsi ” .
Alas , Crystal From Pepsi failed as well .
No word on how Crystal Gravy fared .
Slice ( 1984-2000 )
Slice was supposed to be Pepsi ’s answer to Sprite ( at least in the U.S. market where they do n’t have a license for 7 Up ) .
Although interestingly enough , Sprite was originally Coke ’s response to the popularity of 7 Up .
Every one ’s imitating someone else , right ?
The Sprite brand was created in 1961 and took over the number one spot in lemon - lime drinks in 1978 thanks to Coke ’s market dominance .
Pepsi , as Coke ’s main competitor , decided to branch out beyond cola and Slice was born .
Not that Slice was just lemon lime soda .
Varieties of Slice have included Apple , Fruit Punch , Grape , Passionfruit , Peach , Mandarin Orange , Pineapple , Strawberry , Cherry Cola , “ Red “ , Cherry - Lime , Pink Lemonade , and Dr. Slice .
But the lemon line version was the original that spawned it all .
It existed until it was usurped in most markets by Sierra Mist around the summer of 2000 .
By 2003 , Sierra Mist became a national brand , and the remaining varieties of the Slice line faded away or were replaced by 2006 .
One exception is Dr. Slice , which can still be found in some fountains .
Josta ( 1995 - 1999 )
Josta was Pepsi’s “ high - energy drink ” that was predominately fruit and berry like , with a bit of spice , and a touch of the key mysterious ingredient guaraná .
The reddish brown drink was introduced in 1995 , but pulled from stores due to a “ change in corporate strategy ” in 1999 .
Shortly before the beverage was discontinued , an “ Association for Josta Saving ” was started and the Save Josta Campaign declared April 4 , 2007 “ National Josta Day ” in hopes of resurrecting the dead soda .
It has n’t worked , although I will say the use of the panther , the fancy foreign ingredients , and the marketing slogan “ Unleash it ” gives me flashbacks of Sex Panther .
I wonder if guaraná was actually bits of real panther ?
Pepsi’s Wild Bunch ( 1991 - 1991 )
Well that did n’t last long , now did it ?
The Pepsi Wild Bunch is actually three different sodas : Strawberry Burst Pepsi , Raging Razzberry Pepsi , and Tropical Chill Pepsi .
These were basically test products that were fruit - boosted Pepsi variations .
After all , Cherry Coke worked , right ?
That principle can apply to all fruits with colas , right ?
To further hurt matters , Pepsi actually sold the new flavors in a boxed three - pack and the Razzberry has been said to not really taste like raspberries .
At least it was a good effort .
Pepsi Blue ( 2002 - 2004 )
Undeterred by the Wild Bunch fiasco , Pepsi was determined to mix a berry - flavor with Pepsi .
Granted it took them over a decade to do so , but they got it done .
Sort of .
Apparently Pespi Blue was the result of taste - testing over 100 flavors spanning a nine month period .
It was launched in mid-2002 and designed to compete with Coca - Cola ’s Vanilla Coke .
Pepsi was also riding high on the success of Mountain Dew Code Red .
Unfortunately , some consider Pepsi Blue to be the company ’s equivalent of New Coke .
Well , either it or Crystal Pepsi .
So what was the problem ?
It might start with the fact it really did n’t taste like Pepsi .
It might have been better marketed as simply a berry drink .
Anyone thinking this was going to be like Cherry Coke ( i.e. flavored cola ) was disappointed .
In fact , Coke decided to release their own version of the drink called Fanta Berry .
Also , it looked like Windex .
That ’s probably not a good thing .
And to top it off , it was tinted using Blue 1 , a highly - controversial coloring agent banned in numerous countries at the time .
But Pepsi Blue lovers fear not , there is talk of resurrecting the soda in 2009 .
Mr. Green ( 2002 - 2003 )
SoBe is a subsidiary of Pepsi and briefly sold Mr. Green as their first and only soda .
It was along the lines of Dr. Pepper , but infused with ginseng .
And of course it was green , although it kinda looked like raw sewage .
The name comes from the SoBe lizard , which graces bottles of most SoBe products .
The marketing force behind Mr. Green was the in - your - face - Xtreme type of advertising that has been used so often during that time ( more on this later ) .
And like most SoBe products , there was message under the cap ( if you got a bottle ) along the lines of : Get a Job , Exercise your Brain , or Brush Your Teeth .
Pepsi Fire & Pepsi Ice
Alright , this one may be cheating a little bit .
Yes , these flavors did exist , but you could fill pages upon pages full with weird variants of any soda .
Particularly Coke and Pepsi , which have had numerous flavor variations , many of which were only available overseas or for limited times .
For example , did you know there was a Pepsi Ice Cucumber ?
Other odd examples include Pepsi Twist Mojito , Pepsi White ( with yogurt flavoring ) , Pepsi Holiday Spice , and Pepsi Carnival .
So why single out these two ?
I guess I ’m amused with the idea of Pepsi flavors available in the same flavors I can buy mouthwash in .
And they taste pretty much the same way .
Fire was a cinnamon like drink , ice has that minty flavor .
Or maybe I ’m fascinated by the simple question , what happens when you combine Pepsi Fire and Pepsi Ice together ?
Is that like Pop Rocks and Coke ?
Some things just should n’t be put together .
The Coca -Cola Division
Coke II ( 1985 - 1992 )
Let me set the scene for you .
Once upon a time , Coca - Cola basically had a monopoly on the soda market .
Not that there were n’t alternatives , but Coke destroyed them in market share .
Along comes Pepsi , which slowly begins to eat away at Coke ’s dominance .
As time passes Pepsi gets bigger and bigger , and by the early 1980s Pepsi had begun to outsell Coke in supermarkets , with Coke managing to maintain its overall edge through fountain sales .
Coke executives got worried and believed people wanted a sweeter Pepsi - like soda .
Hence “ New Coke ” is created .
This was not a good decision .
Although the product tested well and was liked by more people than history may remember , a number of consumers did not like the New Coke and these people were very vocal .
There was a backlash to the new drink and Coca - Cola Classic was revived .
Even Fidel Castro , a long time Coke drinker , contributed to the backlash , calling New Coke a sign of American capitalist decadence .
I guess we can say that Max Headroom was not able to get consumers to “ Catch the Wave ” .
Coca -Cola executives announced the return of the original formula on July 10 , less than three months after New Coke ’s introduction .
On the floor of the U.S. Senate , David Pryor called the reintroduction “ a meaningful moment in U.S. history . ”
The new product continued to be sold and retained the name Coca - Cola until 1992 , when it was officially renamed Coca - Cola II .
The older product was brought back as Coca - Cola Classic and eventually just Coke .
Surge ( 1996 - 2003 )
It was the mid 1990s and Mountain Dew was very popular .
Problem was , Coca - Cola did n’t have an equivalent to compete with the Pepsi product .
Well , that ’s not entirely true .
Coke had Mello Yello .
You might remember it from the movie Days of Thunder , in which Tom Cruise ’s character , Cole Trickle , drove a Mello Yello - sponsored car to victory in the Daytona 500 .
As a kid I always loved Mello Yello , it was just that you could n’t really find it anywhere .
At least not where I was .
That would change when the family would go on vacation .
There was always a chance the soda would appear in the hotel vending machines , sort of a soft drink lottery .
I often looked forward to the prospect of Mello Yello more than the vacation .
Turns out Mello Yello is popular in certain areas of the South , I even saw a Mello Yello Slurpee in Mississippi .
It just does n’t have nationwide appeal apparently .
Enter Surge , a citrus soft drink introduced to compete with Pepsi ’s Mountain Dew .
Except it was green , not yellow .
It actually first debuted in Norway under the moniker Urge .
Not sure on reason behind the name change , but it hit the U.S. backed by a heavy marketing campaign that focused on “ extreme ” stuff and people yelling “ Surge ! ” .
Here ’s an example :
and another …
And then there ’s this parody :
But like all the beverages on this rundown , it has since ceased production .
Coca - Cola now makes Vault , a similar soda that veers a little more towards energy drinks like Red Bull than pure soda .
If you ’re feeling nostalgic , you can visit savesurge.org , or listen to this song , or go to Norway where Urge apparently is still around and kicking .
OK ( 1993 - 1995 )
OK Soda was a soft drink created by Coca - Cola that aggressively courted the Generation X demographic with unusual advertising tactics , including endorsements and even outright negative publicity .
There is an OK manifesto , and on each can one of the ten statements from the manifesto was printed around it .
Also , the design of the can would be in the style of underground comics .
Despite all the “ coolness ” , the soda did not sell well in select test markets and was officially declared out of production by 1995 .
The drink ’s slogan was “ Things are going to be OK , ” and you could even call their toll free 1 - 800 - I - FEEL - OK hotline .
As an added bonus , here ’s the whole Manifesto for you :
OK Soda Manifesto
1 . What ’s the point ok OK ?
Well , what ’s the point of anything ?
2. OK Soda emphatically rejects anything that is not OK , and fully supports anything that is .
3 . The better you understand something , the more OK it turns out to be .
4. OK Soda says , “ Do n’t be fooled into thinking there has to be a reason for everything . ”
5. OK Soda reveals the surprising truth about people and situations .
6. OK Soda does not subscribe to any religion , or endorse any political party , or do anything other than feel OK .
7 . There is no real secret to feeling OK .
8. OK Soda may be the preferred drink of other people such as yourself .
9 . Never underestimate the remarkable abilities of “ OK ” brand soda .
10 .
Please wake up every morning knowing that things are going to be OK .
Citra ( 1996 -2004 )
Citra was a grapefruit - flavored soft drink released into by Coca - Cola Company around the same time as Surge .
Think of it as akin to Squirt or Fresca , at least foreign Fresca .
In the United States Fresca is a diet soda , but not elsewhere .
The original marketing campaign had the theme “ Curiously crisp Citra ” .
Although not completely dead , Citra was rebranded as Fanta Citrus in 2004 .
Although finding Fanta Citrus is another endeavor on its own .
Sprite Remix ( 2003 - 2005 )
We mentioned of few Pepsi ’s ill - fated attempts at flavor variants , so it ’s only fair to mention at least one of Coca - Cola ’s .
Although ill - fated would n’t be the right word to describe the Sprite Remix sodas .
They had their fans , particularly the Aruba Jam ( Cherry ) flavor .
You ’ll also notice Tropical and Berryclear varieties .
Granted we could have highlighted Sprite Ice or Sprite on Fire , but we already did those variations with Pepsi and the Remix flavors actually got themselves a following in the U.S.
Not only did they work as a soda , they apparently work well in mixed drinks too .
Mr. Pibb ( 1972-2001 )
Mr. Pibb , or Mr. PiBB as it ’s often spelled , is n’t exactly gone , it was replaced by Pibb Xtra in 2001 with a slightly tweaked formula .
That has n’t stopped the Internet petitions or an entire episode of American Dad constructed around the soda ’s disappearance .
When Pibb Xtra came out , bottlers were allowed to use up their remaining stocks of real - deal Mr. Pibb .
By 2003 , all Mr. Pibb was gone and replaced with Xtra .
Anything sold as “ Pibb ” to this day is “ Pibb Xtra ” .
That ’s how Mr. Pibb quietly ended , but let ’s go back to the beginning .
In 1972 Coke came up with the promotional campaign dubbed , “ Private Air Force for Mr. PiBB ” which came complete with free swag .
I guess Coke was trying to “ rally the troops ” behind it ’s new creation , their answer to Dr. Pepper .
Of course the later ad slogan became “ Put it in your Head ” .
You decided which one is better .
Maybe it does n’t really matter , as I ’ll refer to the late Mitch Hedberg .
He once said , “ Mr. Pibb is a replica of Dr. Pepper but it ’s a BS replica because the dude did n’t even get his degree .
Why ’d you drop out of school and start making pop so soon ? ”
Although I will offer a counter argument to Mr. Hedberg , which is : Mr. Pibb + Red Vines = Crazy Delicious .
The Wild Card Division
Hubba Bubba
What ?
They made a soda based on bubble gum ?
Yes , Sir ! Hubba Bubba Bubble Gum Soda and the diet version were pink soft drinks manufactured thanks to The Wrigley Company , maker of Hubba Bubba bubble gum .
The drink was actually the brainchild of Steve Roeder , who came up with the bubble gum soda concept by using snow cone flavoring with soda water .
Legend has it that he approached Bazooka gum first , before getting the go ahead from Wrigley .
If you ’re interested in bringing this bad boy back , you can sign the online petition .
Or if you ’re jonesing for bubble gum soda now , you can try and hunt down Bubble Yum soda .
Rondo
Rondo was a citrus - flavored soft drink available in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
Marketing dubbed it a soda which was “ blended from fine essences ” and also “ lightly carbonated ” .
The best part about the soda , its slogan : Rondo , The Thirst Crusher .
Its commercials featured people crushing the cans in various ways , something like this :
If that ’s not enough , there ’s a parody of the drink in the movie Idiocracy .
Instead of Rondo , it is Brawndo : The Thirst Mutilator .
That in turn lead to a real Brawndo energy drink and ad campaigns like this :
Red Fusion ( 2002 - 2004 )
Sporting an alluring red color and the use of a variety of fruit flavors , Red Fusion was a cherry variant of Dr. Pepper .
It was also the first new flavor added to the Dr. Pepper family of beverages in the company ’s 122 - year history .
Too bad it was more or less cancelled one year into its run , even if it lingered around a little longer .
It tasted like a a sweeter , cherry flavored , watered down Dr. Pepper , although some compared it to Cherry NyQuil .
Kick
Not too much to say on this one .
Kick was RC Cola ’s attempt at a citrus soda to compete with Mountain Dew .
Damn that Mountain Dew , so popular is spawned a couple of imitators .
And neither was up to the challenge of taking down the Dew .
This version was an even more sugary , syrupy one , with caution tape imprinted upon the can telling me how dangerously ass - kicking it was .
In fact , it was the “ psycho nitro drink … in a can . ”
The Kick name came from the ( also ) failed sports drink line , Quick Kick .
Orbitz
Orbitz is not your traditional soft drink .
From the Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation , it ’s a non-carbonated fruit - flavored beverage .
The fact it had no fizz in it is not its most significant feature .
That would be the small edible balls floating in it .
As you can see above , colored globular gelatin balls are floating in the liquid , and combined with the packaging it gives off the vibe of a Lava Lamp .
And who would n’t want to drink a Lava Lamp ?
Though I will say that when I see something floating in a drink , I ’m reminded of Skittle Bräu .
That ’s not all bad .
Orbitz was introduced around 1996 and came in six flavors : Raspberry Citrus , Blueberry Melon Strawberry , Pineapple Banana Cherry Coconut , Vanilla Orange , Black Currant Berry , and Charlie Brown Chocolate .
The latter two were introduced after the initial launch .
The marketing campaign went some thing like this , “ Set gravity aside and prepare to embark on a tour into the bowels of the Orbiterium . ”
Too bad people did n’t want the Canadian drink with slimey balls in it .
But it could n’t have just been the balls , people drink Bubble Tea .
Either that or Orbitz was a head of its time .
Although Orbitz may be dead , it lives on in a bastardized form .
Lifesaver Drink
Like Orbitz , this may stretch the definition of soft drink a bit .
It was n’t carbonated , but it was sure full of sugar .
And who does n’t want to drink their Halloween candy ?
It would be stupid not to do it !
I stumbled upon these bad boys in high school , and remember them tasting like drinking an unfrozen Flavor Ice .
That may not appeal to many of you , but I wanted more .
Unfortunately , as quickly as I found them they disappeared from local supermarkets .
Most people I talk to are not even aware they existed .
But they did , I have visual proof ( and in 5 flavors ) !
Super Mario Soda
Nothing is better after a hard session of video gaming then throwing back a cold drink .
So why not make that drink Mario related ?
Shasta Cola thought it was a great idea and made this soda in four different flavors , each featuring a Mario World character on the can .
Choices were as follows : Mario Punch , Luigi Berry , Princess Toadstool Cherry ( how did this one not become Peach ? ) and Yoshi Apple ( speaking of which , how did Yoshi not get the Berry flavor ? ) .
Also goes great with Sonic the Hedgehog potato chips .
7 - Up Gold ( 1988 - 1988 )
7 Up Gold was a Dr. Pepper invention , but was unveiled under the 7 Up brand after the companies merged .
It was marketed for a short time in 1988 as a spice - flavored beverage , similar in taste to Vernor ’s Ginger Ale .
It seemed to be quite popular with people who actually tasted the stuff .
However , there was a certain amount of irony in 7
Up ’s marketing slogan of “ Never had it , never will ” .
That was pretty much how consumers viewed the product .
The slogan was actually made in reference to caffeine , although that did n’t make much sense either since 7 Up Gold did list caffeine as one of its ingredients .
dnL ( 2002 -2005 )
No , that ’s not just a 7 - Up can that ’s upside down .
It ’s dnL Soda , a Cadbury Schweppes beverage that was part of the 7 - Up family of drinks .
Basically it was the polar opposite of 7 - Up as it was a caffeinated green drink in a clear bottle ( as opposed to a caffeine - free colorless drink a green bottle ) .
Although that did n’t translate as well to the can versions .
dnL has a citrus - like flavor and was marketed by the slogan , “ Turn your thirst upside - down . ”
The story is that dnL is more lime than lemon , hence the green color and hard to pin down taste .
Well , that ends our tribute to fallen sodas .
I know there were a bunch that were n’t mentioned , particularly flavor variations of established soda , so feel free to chime in with your own favorites in the comments section .

COLUMBIA , S.C. --
Now that Michael Phelps wo n't face drug charges , he can try to distance himself from a photo that showed the Olympian smoking a marijuana pipe .
A South Carolina sheriff decided Monday after a highly publicized investigation that he simply did n't have enough physical evidence to charge the 14 - time gold medalist .
" We had a photo and we had him saying he was sorry for his inappropriate behavior .
That behavior could 've been going to a party , " Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said .
" He never said , ' I smoked marijuana . '
He never confessed that , " the sheriff said .
Phelps , who lost a major endorsement and faces a three - month competition suspension in the fallout from the photo , said he was ready to put the ordeal behind him .
" For me , it 's all about recognizing that I used bad judgment and it's a mistake I wo n't make again , " the swimmer said in a statement .
" For young people especially -- be careful about the decisions you make .
One bad decision can really hurt you and the people you care about .
I really appreciate the support my family and fans have shown me . "
The photo showed Phelps smoking from a marijuana pipe at a party in November when he visited the University of South Carolina .
Lott said authorities seized the marijuana water pipe , known as a bong , in the photo during the investigation but could n't prove Phelps had smoked from it .
Holding a bong is not a crime , he said .
" They 're sold in stores .
We 're kind of sending a double message , " Lott said .
" You can buy rolling papers at any convenience store in the world , but we 're telling kids not to smoke dope . "
Phelps did n't get through the scandal unscathed , though .
USA Swimming suspended Phelps for three months in the wake of the photo , and Kellogg Co. said it would not renew its endorsement deal with him .
And while the swimmer wo n't face any charge , eight people were arrested during the investigation when a small amount of marijuana was found in raids on two homes .
The bong was found in a car .
Seven people have been charged with simple possession of marijuana , which carries a maximum penalty of 30 days in jail or a $ 575 fine .
Another person was arrested for driving under suspension .
The sheriff , known for his tough stance on drug crimes , said ignoring the photo would have sent a message of tolerance .
Phelps ' " bad decision and the highly published photo placed me and the Richland County Sheriff 's Department in a no-win situation .
Ignore it and be criticized or address it and be criticized .
I chose to do what was right , " said Lott , a Democrat who was first elected in 1996 .
Lott rose from patrol officer to captain of the narcotics division in the early 1990s .
He was well - known in the county for wearing stylish suits like the drug agents on " Miami Vice " and driving a Porsche seized from a drug dealer .
The sheriff said the investigation involved two narcotics officers that logged 25 hours over about a week .
He said the house where the November party took place and another suburban home near Columbia had previously been investigated for drugs .
His investigation was criticized in newspaper editorials , on talk shows and by defense attorneys who questioned whether the sheriff was being overzealous because of Phelps ' celebrity status .
Even if the sheriff had the evidence needed , he acknowledged he could not force Phelps to return to South Carolina to face a misdemeanor possession charge .
One of the attorneys representing the three students arrested said the accused were all in their early 20s .
Attorney Dick Harpootlian said the police kicked in the doors with guns drawn during the raids and found less than a cigarette 's worth of marijuana in the house where the party was held .
The other raid netted about four or five cigarettes ' worth , Harpootlian said .
The lawyer expects his clients to either have the charge dismissed or for them to get a conditional discharge , which allows offenders to avoid punishment as long as they comply with certain conditions for six months and stay out of trouble .
" We hope these kids are treated the same as any other kids , " he said .
The photo surfaced in the British tabloid News of the World on Feb .
1 . The swimmer , who won a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Games , never disputed its authenticity .
Lott said the person who took the photo sold it for $ 100,000 .
He would not identify the photographer or say how he knew the amount .
The party occurred nearly three months after the Olympics while Phelps was taking a break from training .
This is n't the first embarrassing episode for Phelps after an Olympic triumph .
In 2004 , a few months removed from winning six gold and two bronze medals in Athens , the swimmer was arrested on a drunken driving charge at age 19 .
He pleaded guilty and apologized for the mistake .
IN ALMOST any discussion of world affairs , there is one thing on which doves and hawks invariably agree : much more needs to be done to shore up states that are failing , in a state of collapse , or so poor that they are heading in that direction .
For development - minded people , such benighted places are an obvious concern because of their desperate suffering ; and for hard - nosed strategists , states that hardly work are places where terrorists could step into the vacuum .
Indeed there is a certain convergence between these points of view : aid workers agree that security is essential to prosperity , and generals want economic development to boost security .
In America these days , defence planners say they worry more about weak states , even non-states , than about strong ones .
“ Ungoverned , undergoverned , misgoverned and contested areas ” offer fertile grounds for terrorists and other nefarious groups , says the Pentagon 's National Defence Strategy , issued last year .
The penning of that document was overseen by the defence secretary , Robert Gates , who will remain in charge of defence policy under Barack Obama .
Large chunks of its language could have been issued by bleeding - heart aid agencies or the United Nations : it speaks of the need to “ build the capacity of fragile or vulnerable partners ” and to address “ local and regional conflicts ” that exacerbate tensions and encourage drug - smuggling , gun-running and other illegality .
To the chagrin of old - school sceptics , nation - building is now an integral part of American strategy .
Similarly , the European Union 's declared security strategy sees state failure as an “ alarming ” phenomenon .
It opines that : “ Neighbours who are engaged in violent conflict , weak states where organised crime flourishes , dysfunctional societies or exploding population growth on its borders all pose problems for Europe . ”
A rather precise taxonomy is offered by Robert Cooper , a British diplomat and Eurocrat , in his book , “ The Breaking of Nations ” .
He splits the world into three zones : Hobbesian or “ pre-modern ” regions of chaos ; areas ruled effectively by modern nation - states ; and zones of “ postmodern ” co-operation where national sovereignty is being voluntarily dissolved , as in the European Union .
In his view , chaos in critical parts of the world must be watched carefully .
“ It was not the well - organised Persian Empire that brought about the fall of Rome , but the barbarians , ” he writes .
Strategists have worried about failing states ever since the end of the cold war .
At first , zones of war and chaos were seen primarily as threats to the people living within them , or not far away .
But since the attacks on America in September 2001 such places have increasingly been seen as a threat to the entire world .
Western intervention is now justified in the name of fighting terrorism , not just of altruism .
Take the case of Somalia : America sent troops there in 1992 to help the United Nations stave off a humanitarian catastrophe , but the armed chaos of Mogadishu soon drove it out .
In recent years , America has again been active in that region , carrying out air strikes in Somalia against suspected jihadist camps .
It supported Ethiopia 's military invasion in 2006 to defeat the Islamist militias that had taken power in Mogadishu ( arguably causing even more chaos ) and is now backing an African peacekeeping mission for the same reasons .
The waters off the Somali coast , moreover , have become one of the prime zones of piracy at sea , disrupting shipping through the Suez Canal .
Even China has felt the need to send warships to the Gulf of Aden to protect its shipping .
Afghanistan , too , is often seen as a classic example of the perils of collapsing states : acute poverty and years of civil war led to the rise of the Taliban and allowed al - Qaeda to turn into a global menace .
After the American - led intervention in 2001 , both have rebated themselves across the border in Pakistan 's lawless tribal regions , from where they wage a growing insurgency in southern Afghanistan , destabilise Pakistan and plot attacks against Western targets around the world .
Western intelligence agencies say that , with the recent improvement in security in Iraq ( a totalitarian state that became a failed state only after the American - led invasion ) , the world 's jihadists now prefer to head for Pakistan , Somalia or Yemen .
Misrule , violence , corruption , forced migration , poverty , illiteracy and disease can all reinforce each other .
Conflict may impoverish populations , increase the availability of weapons and debilitate rulers .
Weak governments , in turn , are less able to stop corruption and the production and smuggling of arms and drugs , which may in turn help finance warlords , insurgents and terrorists .
AFP
Irregular forces , highly irregular wars : come to Taliban country
Instability breeds instability .
The chronic weaknesses of civil institutions in Sierra Leone and Liberia contributed to the outbreak of devastating civil wars in both countries , fuelled by the profits from the illegal smuggling of “ blood diamonds ” .
Meanwhile war and genocide in Rwanda contributed to the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1990s .
The chaos there , sustained in part by fighting over mineral resources , sucked in Rwanda , Burundi and Uganda .
Chad and Sudan support rebels in each other 's countries .
At the very least , there is evidence that economic growth in countries next to failing states can be badly damaged .
And if a poorly functioning but important oil - producing state like Nigeria were to fall apart , the economic fallout would be global .
Moreover , weak governments may lack the wherewithal to identify and contain a pandemic that could spread globally .
That said , the interplay of these factors is hard to describe , and the very definition of failed states and ungoverned spaces is anything but simple .
Few states have completely failed , except perhaps for Somalia .
And even here , the territory is not completely ungoverned .
A part of the country , called Somaliland , is more or less autonomous and stable — and another bit , Puntland , is relatively calm , although it is the source of much piracy .
The region to the south is dominated by warring clans , but even here some aspects of normal life , such as mobile telephone networks , manage to survive .
Lesser breeds before the law
One starting point in any analysis of failed countries is the theory of Max Weber , the father of social science .
He defined the state as the agency which successfully monopolises the legitimate use of force .
But what does legitimate mean ?
In some places , state power is exercised , brutally but effectively , by whoever is top dog in a perpetual contest between kleptocrats or warlords whose behaviour is lawless in every sense .
If definitions are elusive , what about degrees of state failure ?
Perhaps the most detailed study is the index of state weakness in developing countries drawn up by the Brookings Institution , a think - tank in Washington , DC .
This synthesises 20 different indicators and identifies three “ failed ” states — Somalia , Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — along with 24 other “ critically weak ” ones .
One striking feature of such tables is that states fail in different ways .
Among the ten worst performers , Iraq is comparatively wealthy and does well in social welfare , but is highly insecure ; Zimbabwe is comparatively secure , but ruined economically and politically .
The next ten - worst performers are even more mixed .
The collapse of states is as varied as the states themselves .
Some were never functioning states at all , just lines drawn on maps by colonisers .
Many African borders encompassed lots of ethnic groups and divided some of them .
When the colonialists left , so did the bureaucracies that supported these entities , abandoning them to poverty , civil war or both .
The cold war helped fuel many conflicts , for instance in Angola and Mozambique , where superpowers backed rival factions .
Other parts of Africa , such as Somalia , fell apart after the withdrawal of superpower support .
The conflicts of Central America died down in the years following the end of the cold war .
But the fighting in Colombia has dragged on , as the FARC guerrillas finance themselves through drugs and kidnapping .
The end of Soviet communism freed or created many countries in Europe .
Some prospered as they were absorbed into NATO and the European Union , while others fragmented bloodily , notably Yugoslavia .
Enclaves of “ frozen conflicts ” remain on Russia 's periphery — for example Abkhazia , South Ossetia and Transdniestria which survive as unrecognised statelets with the Kremlin 's support .
Whichever way state collapse is assessed , it will always be an imperfect measure of priorities for policymakers .
On a map of the world using the Brookings index of weak states , the epicentre is self - evidently sub-Saharan Africa , particularly around Congo , with blobs of red in Iraq , Afghanistan and Myanmar .
But this overlaps only in part with , say , the ungoverned spaces that America 's State Department regards as the nastiest havens for international terrorists , such as al - Qaeda .
On that list , Iraq and Afghanistan figure prominently — but in these countries , arguably , the problem is more one of national insurgencies than international terror .
Once the tribes of western Iraq ( whose grievances were local ) had been induced to switch sides to the Americans , al - Qaeda was quickly evicted from that area .
Al - Qaeda 's senior leaders are sheltering in Pakistan , yet this ranks as only the 33rd - weakest state on the Brookings index .
One area of concern is the Sahel , a vast semi-arid area south of the Sahara desert .
The Americans fear that in this region Islamist terrorists could begin co-operating with existing rebel outfits , such as the Tuareg , or with drug smugglers .
The Pentagon has created a new Africa Command to help monitor the area more closely and train local government forces .
The State Department identifies other ungoverned spaces such as Yemen ( 30th on the Brookings index ) , parts of Colombia ( 47th ) , the seas between the Philippines ( 58th ) and Indonesia ( 77th ) , bits of Lebanon ( 93rd ) and the “ tri-border area ” between Brazil , Argentina and Paraguay ( none ranked as particularly weak ) .
Conversely many of the most wretched places in the world — Congo , Burundi , Zimbabwe , Haiti , Myanmar and North Korea — are not known as havens for international terrorists .
Attacks linked to al - Qaeda , moreover , have been conducted in well - run countries such as Britain and Spain .
For American counter - terrorism officials , the biggest terrorist threat to the homeland is posed by European radicals who are able to travel to America more freely than , say , a Yemeni .
Some scholars worry about social breakdown in poor mega-cities .
But to regard the British Midlands and the banlieues of Paris as ungoverned spaces would be stretching a point .
The common denominator for al - Qaeda 's activity is not state failure , but the fact that attacks are carried out by extremists claiming to act in the name of the world 's Muslims .
Their safe havens are not necessary geographical but social .
Being based in a remote spot , far from government authorities , may be important for training , building esprit de corps and , in the view of intelligence agencies , trying to develop chemical and biological weapons .
But for al - Qaeda , remoteness alone is not enough .
Terrorists need protection too , and that has to be secured from local populations as in Pakistan 's tribal belt .
International terrorists , moreover , need to be able to travel , communicate and transfer funds ; they need to be within reach of functioning population centres .
Stewart Patrick of the Council on Foreign Relations , an American think - tank , argues in a forthcoming book that international terrorists do not find the most failed states particularly attractive ; they prefer “ weak but moderately functional ” states .
The shell of state sovereignty protects them from outside intervention , but state weakness gives them space to operate autonomously .
Afghanistan 's history is telling .
Al - Qaeda was forged from the Arab volunteers who had fought with the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet occupation of the country .
With the end of the cold war and the fall of the communist government in Kabul , the country fell into civil war .
Arab fighters largely pulled out in dismay .
Some went to Bosnia and Chechnya .
Others intensified insurgencies back home in Egypt and Algeria .
Osama bin Laden found shelter in Sudan under the protection of its Islamist regime .
What took him back to Afghanistan was the rise of the Taliban .
Afghanistan at that time was not an ungoverned space , but a state sponsor of terrorism ; indeed , al - Qaeda arguably became a terrorist sponsor of a state .
Terrorism aside , what of other global plagues ?
Afghanistan is still the world 's biggest source of the opium poppy , despite the presence of foreign troops .
Next is Myanmar , also near the bottom of the pile .
But Colombia , though not “ critically ” weak , is the biggest producer of cocaine .
The cocaine routes pass through countries of all sorts ; Mexico is among the top performers in the Brookings index , but is the main drugs highway to America .
Similarly , piracy depends on geography .
A non-existent state may allow pirates to flourish , but without the proximity of a shipping route they have no targets to prey on .
Measures of corruption , such as Transparency International 's Corruption Perceptions Index , correlate strongly with the index of state weakness .
But here too there are anomalies : Russia is ranked as a middling country in terms of state weakness , but does worse in the corruption index ; Italy scores below some African countries .
When it comes to pandemics , there is no simple correlation between disease and dysfunctional states .
The countries suffering most from HIV / AIDS are in southern Africa : apart from Zimbabwe , most governments in that region are quite well run .
The states that have seen the most cases of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu are Indonesia , Vietnam , China and Egypt , none of them among the worst cases of misrule or non-rule .
Everybody agrees that more effective government around the world is desirable , especially for those living in or near broken countries .
Failed states always cause misery , but only sometimes are they a global threat .
Given that failures come in so many varieties , fixing them is bound to be more of an art than a science .
" There were so many people who wanted to buy the original , " he said .
" It is one of those lovely posters that have resonance in any time , or for anyone who works under pressure .
We have sold them to doctor 's surgeries , civil servants , even to Downing Street .
It is lovely and British , and that 's why we loved it in the first place . "
Andy Dick Admits Drinking Destroyed Him , Joins Sober House
One time funnymanis n't so funny when he drinks and he is now able to see that and is trying to do everything in his power to keep himself clean and sober .
After waltzing in and out of rehab ten times , it seems like he is now desperate to make that change .
Dick 's latest arrest came last summer when he was caught groping a 17 year old girl in Murrieta , California .
He was charged with drug possession and sexual battery and wound up with three years probation .
Is that enough for Dick ?
Wearing an alcohol monitoring bracelet to warn the authorities if he is drinking , you would think he did n't have a choice but to stay sober or go to jail .
Andy spoke exclusively to Entertainment Tonight :
" What happens to me when I drink is ... I turn into a moron .
I would n't wake up and say ' Today , when I drink , I 'm going to be ... in the back of a cop car , urinating all over myself , crying ... you do n't set out to do that .
I 've got to learn how to rein it in ...
I do n't have an editing system on my brain or mouth . "
The actor feels certain that his addiction has cost him his career and that it will be hard to get that back .
He can be seen on VH1 reality show Sober House .
He was introduced on the show last night as a new celebrity guest .
Good luck to Andy !

ASPEN , Colorado ( CNN ) --
A man delivered bombs wrapped as Christmas presents to two banks Wednesday along with a note threatening " mass death " if they did not turn over tens of thousands of dollars , police in Aspen , Colorado , said Thursday .
A surveillance camera photo supplied by Aspen police shows the man identified as James Blanning .
Authorities were quickly alerted , and the man apparently halted his plan , leaving two bombs that were intended for other banks in an alley , police said .
" You had better be a very cool individual and not start a panic or many in Aspen will pay a horrible price in blood , " said the note , which was released by police .
The man , identified as James Blanning , 72 , who had had previous run-ins with law enforcement , was later found dead after apparently shooting himself , police said .
Watch how the situation unfolded »
His body was found in his car in a rural area east of Aspen .
" At this point , we believe Blanning was acting alone , " Aspen Assistant Police Chief Bill Linn said Thursday .
Authorities ordered the evacuation of a 16 - block area of Aspen on New Year 's Eve , one of the busiest nights of the year for the resort town , after the bombs were found .
Linn said that it is impossible to calculate how much revenue businesses in the area lost on New Year 's
Eve because of the bomb scare but that it was easily " in the millions . "
Bomb squads ultimately detonated the devices , and no one was injured .
Linn praised the banks for their " clearheaded response " in immediately alerting authorities on Wednesday .
The calls to police came about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday .
Blanning had delivered " large plastic tubs " containing " wrapped Christmas - style presents " along with a threatening note to a Wells Fargo Bank branch and a Vectra Bank branch , police said .
Watch how notes threatened destruction »
Repeatedly using the word " we , " as though a group of people was behind the plot , the obscenity - filled note described a bomb filled with " unique chemicals and electronics " and demanded that $ 60,000 in hundred - dollar bills be handed over in 20 minutes outside the bank .
The note also refers to the Iraq war and describes President Bush as " Rove 's and Chaney 's [ sic ] monkey . "
Read note police say was left by suspected bomber »
" This is as much a suicide mission as a bank robbery , " the note said .
The devices in the alley were first to be detonated , Linn said .
" They were found to contain improvised incendiary devices made of gasoline and containing what appeared to be cell phone actuators and anti-tamper devices , " he said .
Authorities could n't determine whether the bombs would have worked .
When one bomb was detonated at Wells Fargo Bank , it triggered a fireball that was quickly extinguished , but authorities do n't know whether that was the result of the detonation or the device itself activating , Linn said .
When Blanning 's body was found in his vehicle , he had " at least a rifle " with him , and may have had other weapons as well , Linn said .
Authorities say the man also delivered a hand - written note to the Aspen Times .
A copy of the note showed a 10 - line printed scrawl that included the words " Will & Testament " and " 2 crime scenes " with two apparent addresses of apartments in Denver .
" For the first two years I was in prison I woke up every morning wishing I was dead .
Now it comes to pass .
I was and am a good man , " the note begins .
Public records show that Blanning was convicted of several crimes , including forgery and theft , in 1996 in Rio Blanco County in northwest Colorado .
His sentence was scheduled to end in 2009 , but he was out of prison on parole .
In 1994 , the Rocky Mountain News published a story about Blanning , then 58 .
" An embittered man with a rope around his neck held off authorities from a perch on the roof of the Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for seven hours Thursday , " the story said .
Blanning ultimately surrendered in that incident , according to authorities quoted in that story .
CNN left a phone message at a Denver address for Blanning found via a public records search .
The call , which sought comment from a representative for him , was not immediately returned .
No public statement has been made on Blanning 's behalf .
Substantial business was lost Wednesday evening , according to a report in the Rocky Mountain News .
Watch a " surreal situation " in Aspen »
" This has got to be the worst for us .
...
Outside the Fourth of July , this is the cash cow of all cash cows , " the newspaper quoted the on -call manager of the Molly Gibson Lodge in Aspen as saying .
" Most of the restaurants are going to be terribly hurt . "
" People are losing so much money , it 's crazy , " Monique Wagner , front desk clerk at the Hyatt Grand Hotel , told the newspaper .

The police said that a 4 - year - old girl , Hayley Ng of Chinatown , died at the scene and that Diego Martinez , a 3 - year - old boy from Chelsea , died at New York Downtown Hospital .
Another 4 - year - old girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital , where she was listed in critical condition late Thursday ; her name was not released .
About 10 other people , children and some adults , had minor injuries , the authorities said .
The driver of the van , identified as Chao Fu , 52 , of Brooklyn , was not charged ; his license and registration papers were in order and he tested negative for alcohol , said Paul J. Browne , the police spokesman .
Mr. Chao had double - parked and entered a store , leaving the van running and in reverse gear , thinking it was in park , Mr. Browne said .
Mr. Chao first realized that the vehicle had moved “ when he came out of the store and it had already crashed , ” Mr. Browne said .
The silver - colored van , a 2000 Ford , was emblazoned with the name of a downtown restaurant , China Chalet .
A woman who answered the phone at the restaurant on Thursday afternoon said in Chinese that “ something happened . ”
The woman said the company ’s owner was not available for comment , and then hung up .

The children had just spent an hour at the Chatham Square branch of the New York Public Library at 33 East Broadway , in the same block where the accident occurred .
They had listened to a librarian read the children ’s books “ Snow , ” about animals in a winter wonderland , and “ Shark in the Park , ” about a boy who spots a shark through a telescope .
They also browsed in the children ’s section , a library spokesman said .
PRINCETON , NJ --
In the days immediately after Barack Obama 's nationally televised address to Congress on Tuesday night , his public support has increased significantly to 67 % in Feb.
24 -26 Gallup Daily polling , and is now just two points below his term high .
This comes on the heels of a term - low 59 % reported by Gallup on Tuesday .
Obama 's speech was well - received , and appears to have won him back support he had been losing in prior days , and then some .
The speech certainly came at an opportune time for Obama , but a recovery was easily achievable because the decline in his approval rating was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of Americans expressing no opinion , rather than an increase in the proportion disapproving of his performance in office .
Since the speech , the percentage having no opinion of Obama has fallen back to 11 % from 16 % , while his approval rating has increased eight points .
There has been a slight drop in his disapproval rating as well , from 25 % to 21 % .
Obama 's approval rebound is due to increased support from all political groups , but especially from independents and Republicans , whose support had been waning .
Over the past week , independents ' approval of Obama dropped from 62 % to 54 % , but is now back to 62 % .
There has been a sharp increase in support among Republicans , from 27 % to 42 % .
Democrats ' support for Obama was already extremely high at 86 % , but even this has climbed slightly , to 90 % in the latest polling .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,551 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 24 - 26 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Drum Major John Coleman offered
a quick nod , a fleeting wave and what looked like a wink
-- all while keeping stride -- as he marched the Cleveland Firefighter 's Memorial Pipes & Drums past President Barack Obama last week .
Some might call it a heartwarming moment of patriotism during the inaugural parade .
The band 's leader calls it a violation of the rules , captured by CNN .
Coleman has been suspended as drum major for six months .
" We had gone over and over time and again with everyone in the band that this was a military parade .
Protocol and proper decorum had to be followed at all times , " said bandleader Pipe Major Mike Engle .
" Unfortunately , John chose to ignore that . "
Coleman said he did n't do anything grossly demonstrative : " I looked over , and he smiled and waved .
I was just acknowledging the president , who was acknowledging our band . "
Engle , who said other pipe bands complained about Coleman 's gesture , said even sneaking a glimpse was out of bounds .
" He has to abide by the rules , " Engle said .
" It had to be done . "
Rachel Maddow .

America 's latest media darling - not counting the one in the White House - is kneeling on the floor like a big kid , scribbling notes on a scrap of paper .
In eight hours ' time 35 - year - old Rachel Maddow will be sitting alone , in front of an autocue , about to present the highbrow political television programme which bears her name .
For the moment she 's brainstorming ideas with her production team .
What should they focus on ?
President Obama 's proposed closure of Guantanamo ?
The 45,000 jobs lost before nine o'clock this morning ?
The banking meltdown ?
More troops in Afghanistan ?
There 's a level of intense and nerdy discussion in the room which makes John Humphrys and James Naughtie look like Ant and Dec .
This is n't the kind of cheery material for which American television is generally known .
But these are changing times , and The Rachel Maddow Show has become an unlikely hit .
Rachel Maddow - in her own words a mannish lesbian policy wonk who does n't own a television set - is not your average anchorwoman in America , or indeed on this side of the Atlantic .
Later today when she goes live on air she must swap her Red Sox T - shirt and baggy Levi 's jeans for what she calls " lady clothes " - a bland slate - grey trouser suit .
( She wo n't say who it 's by for fear of insulting the designer . )
Her chunky Eric Morecambe glasses will be exchanged for contact lenses ( which she 's still getting used to ) .
Reluctantly , there will be the merest smear of lipstick and blusher .
She will , however , cling on to her trainers , safely out of sight under the desk .
( The stylists at American Vogue recently offered her an array of extravagantly high - heeled Louboutin shoes for a photo shoot .
She insisted on a pair of Converse boots . )
With their ironed hair and shrink - wrapped foreheads , women on American television news programmes all too often come across as shrill harpies or eye candy .
Maddow seems to have both types on the run .
She goes on air as if she 's got nothing to prove , this despite the fact that she 'll have done hours of preparation : a cheerful and clever geek , fluent in irony , alternately idealistic and sceptical , who does n't believe in talking down to the viewers .
Her aim ?
To raise the level of debate in America so that the right kind of decisions are made in the future .
From the beginning of her show , she made a policy decision to avoid the kind of bar - room slugging match which political programming in the United States is famous for .
" I did that Punch and Judy stuff for so long on other people 's shows .
It may be kinetically entertaining but I do n't think you learn very much in that environment . "
She 's opted instead for arch analysis and informed banter .
It 's set a rigorous tone that has been surprisingly popular , somehow in tune with the tenor of the new administration .
Within a week of the launch last September , she 'd more than doubled the viewing figures .
True - her timing could n't have been better - everyone 's viewing figures were enjoying a spike .
However , she was regularly beating her CNN rival Larry King Live , a cable - news institution , in the sought - after , and elusive , 25 to 55 - year - old demographic .
In the same way that Ann Coulter emerged as the public face of the Bush era , Maddow swiftly emerged as the go - to media figure in the most picked - over election in American history .
Suddenly on the net everyone was talking about their new girl crush .
Here was someone on television with whom they connected ; who , in the cosy familiarity that comes from being on screen five nights a week , they imagined that they could be friends with .
They liked the fact that she can mix a mean cocktail , never shops for clothes and is more interested in her pick - up truck than lunchtime Botox injections .
" My husband is in love with Rachel Maddow , I am in love with Rachel Maddow , my eight - year - old son is in love with Rachel Maddow , " gushed one girl fan .
Gay , straight , parents , teenagers , rabbis , Republicans : everyone , it seems , was smitten .
One enterprising site began selling " Why I 'm Gay For Rachel " T - shirts .
As one commentator on Salon remarked : if the election campaign was indicating that America could be proved post- racial , maybe it could be post - gay too .
No one is more surprised by the attention than Maddow .
" People are kind and flattering , " she says , " but it is a remarkable and weird part of my life that I try not to dwell on .
I try not to let it swell my head . "
Two years ago she was a respected liberal pundit on the political news circuit , with a reputation for cheerfully slapping down ageing Republicans , but she did n't think she 'd ever land a regular job on television , let alone her own show .
She used to joke that she had a face made for radio .
" I 'm a big lesbian who looks like a man .
I 'm not Anchor Babe and I 'm never going to be , " she complained at the time .
" I one hundred per cent believe that the reason I have not gone further in television is not only because I 'm gay but because of what I look like . "
Even now she says : " I do n't honestly know why MSNBC hired me .
I guess we got good ratings .
We did n't suck .
All of a sudden it seemed I might be able to co-host sometimes . "
The emphasis on the way she looks remains a frustration .
( Under pressure to glam up , she 's joked in the past that programme makers " would brooch me if they could " . )
She says : " I get exasperated .
I do n't think very much about my appearance and when I do it 's not , how would you say ... strategic . "
She laughs .
" But it 's a visual medium and it really does matter what you look like .
I do n't care and I do n't want to have to care .
I want my appearance to be beside the point .
My goal is to do the physical appearance stuff in such a way that it is not comment - worthy . "
The irony is , perhaps , that part of her success is exactly because she does n't look like all the other cookie - cutter women on television .
She is 6ft tall and boyish ( so much so that for a radio show stunt she was once persuaded to go out onto the street and ask people to guess what gender she was ) .
" It 's true .
I am an unusual - looking person .
Maybe people tell themselves : ' Well , she is n't getting by on her looks , for sure .
Maybe she 's got something to say . ' "
The woman I meet after the show has reverted to skateboarding third grader as opposed to television personality .
However , she 's actually far more lovely - looking than she likes to make out .
The make - up has been scrubbed away once again ; the sensible grey jacket has , quite possibly , been rolled up into a ball and abandoned in the corner of her dressing room .
She 's been on the go since five o'clock this morning - before she starts preparing for her TV programme she will have recorded her daily show for the Air America radio station - and she is , she says , a little bit wired .
Only four weeks into the new television show Barack Obama 's team called up saying that the Democratic candidate was willing to give her an interview .
( She describes the new president as calm , confident , wonky .
" I like wonky in a politician . " )
Last month she was part of the channel 's high - profile inauguration team in Washington .
" It 's a pressure , now , having a hit show .
It 's the notion that people are really paying attention , " she says .
" A lot of the way I have proceeded through my broadcast life has been to pretend that it 's just me and my conscience .
I would study the material and essentially write an essay on a scrap of paper and memorise it .
The fact that I am starting to cotton on to the fact that people can hear me is unsettling . "
While she 's eminently likeable - self - deprecating , quick to belly laugh , unfailingly polite , chummy even - I suspect she finds interviews a whole new layer of public exposure .
She 'd far rather ask a question than have to answer one .
Ten years ago she was an academic and committed Aids activist , a graduate of Stanford and a Rhodes scholar , trying to finish her doctorate of philosophy in political science at Oxford University .
She seemed , if anything , hellbent on a life as a serious campaigner and academic , as far from the media spotlight as possible .
When she was awarded the Rhodes scholarship it's said she dyed her hair blue as a sign that she was n't part of the establishment .
At Oxford she disliked rarefied collegiate life so much so that she escaped to a squat in a basement flat near Arsenal football ground in London and took a job for an Aids charity .
Back in America she relocated to a particularly remote part of Massachusetts , where she hoped she'd be miserable ( she 's still based there ) : " I figured if I was n't happy I would get my doctorate finished . "
To make ends meet she took odd jobs .
" I was a waitress , bike messenger , bucket washer at a coffee - bean factory , yard help , landscaping labourer , handyman - I was very bad at that .
I went for a job at a video store and got turned down because I did n't know enough about movies . "
It was a friend who persuaded her to go for an audition as the sidekick for a morning show at the local radio station for a dare " and because we thought it might pay more than the minimum wage " .
As soon as she was on air , something clicked .
" I 'd never done anything like it before but I can remember thinking : ' I like this ' . "
In the early days the station would make her do stunts like dress up as an inflatable calculator ( how this worked on radio I 'm not entirely sure ) .
Ten years later she 's being courted by the likes of Vanity Fair and Newsweek .
She 's clearly relishing having her own serious platform on which to debate the issues of the day , but the last thing she seems to be interested in is being on television for the sake of it .
" I do n't think being on television , in and of itself , has any value .
The only reason to be on TV is to say something worthwhile . "
While plenty of people in the media are coy about revealing their sexuality , not being out was never an option .
" I 've been out the majority of my life .
I could not go back in , " she says .
" It would have looked very strange .
It was n't something I was going to lie about . "
As it happens , being at ease with who she is seems to have worked in her favour , because it comes across on air .
However , it was not always thus .
She grew up in Castro Valley which ( despite being near San Francisco ) was , she says , a narrow - minded kind of place where racism and homophobia were rife .
" I was a weird , depressive little kid who never really thought they would get to be an adult .
I never thought I 'd reach drinking age . "
Her father , a lawyer , had been in the air force , her mother was a school administrator .
She does n't recall the household being particularly bookish or academic .
Her parents remember a daughter who somehow taught herself to read by the time she was four .
As a teenager she had hopes of being an Olympic athlete until a run of injuries forced a rethink and she turned her attention to political activism instead .
" I would n't wish a torn biceps tendon on anyone , but it was a blessing in disguise . "
Before she knew she was gay , she 'd volunteered at a centre for Aids services .
This was 1987 , six years after the first cases of Aids and HIV had come to public attention , at a time when the San Francisco area seemed to be at the epicentre of the tragedy that was unfolding .
" I had a very acute sense that something was happening to ' my ' people even before I knew I was gay .
I was very moved by what was going on .
Growing up in the Bay Area as a gay kid was devastating .
It defined the world in a very serious way for me , in a life - or - death sort of way .
I had a lot of older friends and many of them died .
There was a sense of : look , your life is happening now .
This may be all you get . "
Maddow came out at Stanford , aged 17 , six months after she realised she was gay .
" I knew there was something .
My whole childhood I knew there was something , but I did n't know it was that . "
The only other woman she knew who was gay was the daughter of a Liberian fundamentalist Christian minister .
" I thought : if she can do it , so can I . "
However , appalled by the casual homophobia she 'd encountered on campus , she outed herself by broadcasting the fact on handmade posters which she pinned up in all the bathrooms in the student accommodation in the sure knowledge that by the end of the day everyone would have seen the poster at least once .
" It was confrontational , funny , theatrical .
On - my - own - terms aggressive . "
The student newspaper picked up the story ; the next thing she knew someone had sent a cutting to her parents , who she had n't yet told .
" By the time I got home it was really bad .
But they are great now .
They could not be more supportive .
They talk to my girlfriend every day . "
She met her partner Susan Mikula , a photographic artist , 10 years ago , when she was still broke and trying to finish her dissertation .
Mikula , who is 15 years older than Maddow , had just bought a run-down , ramshackle house and needed help doing it up .
" I drove out there , she answered the door , and it was love at first sight .
I had never had a monogamous relationship .
I had never wanted to .
But this was different .
We both had to extricate ourselves from other things .
Fortunately it was mutual . "
Their first date was at a firing range .
Despite living in Massachusetts , where gay marriage is legal , they have no plans to get married .
" I believe in the right .
I just do n't think you have to exercise it .
I like the idea of a subculture , " she says , and pulls a face .
" I 'm not a weddings person . "
The Rachel Maddow Show is plainly absorbing and all - encompassing - " I 'm motivated by fear of failure and a desire to make my existence useful " - but if Mikula asked her to give up her media career , she would , she says .
For now , her workload means that the couple divide the week - four nights together , three nights apart .
On top of everything else , there 's a book to write about America 's relationship with war .
Weekends are spent in the house where they first met .
It 's the only place , she says , where she really switches off .
During the week she stays in their tiny tenement apartment - the size of a van , she says - in the West Village .
She 's lived there for four years and is rather proud of the fact that she 's yet to use the oven , which she uses as a makeshift bookshelf instead .
Friends wish she 'd find an apartment with a doorman , because for all the positive fan mail she receives there has also been an anti-gay reaction to her new high profile .
" Most homophobic stuff has a violent tone to it .
It 's like : ' I 'm going to kill you . '
I get that all the time .
I work predictable hours , so if someone was going to be really creepy ... "
She pauses .
" I do n't enjoy being contactable .
I purposely make it hard to contact me .
I do n't have a landline phone .
I do n't have an office phone .
I do n't open my own mail . "
All evening strangers have come up to congratulate this big - hearted , serious - minded woman on her show .
The buzz around the media 's latest darling seems to be real .
As for reports of a post - gay America - they may be , for the moment at least , greatly exaggerated .

Joe Stump , Lead Architect at Digg , gave this presentation at the Web 2.0 Expo .
I could n't find the actual presentation , but fortunately Kris Jordan took some great notes .
That 's how key moments in history are accidentally captured forever .
Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a phone call .
In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that you may or may not have read before .
I of course take some pains to extract all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules .
What really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDB
Will be the biggest new kid on the block in scaling .
MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and I 've never thought of it in that way .
Well learn why Joe is so excited by MemcacheDB at the end of the post .
Impressive Stats
80th - 100th largest site in the world
26 million uniques a month
30 million users .
Uniques are only half that traffic .
Traffic = unique web visitors +
APIs + Digg buttons .
2 billion requests a month
13,000 requests a second , peak at 27,000 requests a second .
3 Sys Admins , 2 DBAs , 1 Network Admin , 15 coders , QA team
Lots of servers .
Scaling Strategies
Scaling is specialization .
When off the shelf solutions no longer work at a certain scale you have to create systems that work for your particular needs .
Lesson of web 2.0 : people love making crap and sharing it with the world .
Web 2.0 sucks for scalability .
Web 1.0 was flat with a lot of static files .
Additional load is handled by adding more hardware .
Web 2.0 is heavily interactive .
Content can be created at a crushing rate .
Languages do n't scale .
100 % of the time bottlenecks are in
IO .
Bottlenecks are n't in the language when you are handling so many simultaneous requests .
Making PHP 300 % faster wo n't matter .
Do n't optimize PHP by using single quotes instead of double quotes when
the database is pegged .
Do n’t share state .
Decentralize .
Partitioning is required to process a high number of requests in parallel .
Scale out instead of up .
Expect failures .
Just add boxes to scale and avoid the fail .
Database - driven sites need to be partitioned to scale both horizontally and vertically .
Horizontal partitioning means store a subset of rows on a different machines .
It is used when there 's more data than will fit on one machine .
Vertical partitioning means putting some columns in one table and some columns in another table .
This allows you to add data to the system without downtime .
Data are separated into separate clusters : User Actions , Users , Comments , Items , etc .
Build a data access layer so partitioning is hidden behind an API .
With partitioning comes the CAP Theorem : you can only pick two of the following three : Strong Consistency , High Availability , Partition Tolerance .
Partitioned solutions require denormalization and has become a big problem at Digg .
Denormalization means data is copied in multiple objects and must be kept synchronized .
MySQL replication is used to scale out reads .
Use an asynchronous queuing architecture for near - term processing .
- This approach pushes chunks of processing to another service and let 's that service schedule the processing on a grid of processors .
- It 's faster and more responsive than cron and only slightly less responsive than real - time .
- For example , issuing 5 synchronous database requests slows you down .
Do them in parallel .
- Digg uses Gearman .
An example use is to get a permalink .
Three operations are done parallel : get the current logged , get the permalink , and grab the comments .
All three are then combined to return a combined single answer to the client .
It 's also used for site crawling and logging .
It 's a different way of thinking .
- See Flickr - Do the Essential Work Up - front and Queue the Rest and The Canonical Cloud Architecture for more information .
Bottlenecks are in IO so you have tune the database .
When the database is bigger than RAM the disk is hit all the time which kills performance .
As the database gets larger the table can't be scanned anymore .
So you have to :
- denormalize
- avoid joins
- avoid large scans across databases by partitioning
- cache
- add read slaves
- do n't use NFS
Run numbers before you try and fix a problem to make sure things actually will work .
Files like for icons and photos are handled by using MogileFS , a distributed file system .
DFSs support high request rates because files are distributed and replicated around a network .
Cache forever and explicitly expire .
Cache fairly static content in a file based cache .
Cache changeable items in memcached
Cache rarely changed items in APC .
APC is a local cache .
It 's not distributed so no other program have access to the values .
For caching use the Chain of Responsibility pattern .
Cache in MySQL , memcached APC , and PHP globals .
First check PHP globals as the fastest cache .
If not present check APC , memcached and on up the chain .
Digg 's recommendation engine is a custom graph database that is eventually consistent .
Eventually consistent means that writes to one partition will eventually make it to all the other partitions .
After a write reads made one after another do n't have to return the same value as they could be handled by different partitions .
This is a more relaxed constraint than strict consistency which means changes must be visible at all partitions simultaneously .
Reads made one after another would always return the same value .
Assume 1 million people a day will bang on any new feature so make it scalable from the start .
Example : the About page on Digg did a live query against the master database to show all employees .
Just did a quick hack to get out .
Then a spider went crazy and took the site down .
Miscellaneous
Digg buttons were a major key to generating traffic .
Uses Debian Linux , Apache , PHP , MySQL .
Pick a language you enjoy developing in , pick a coding standard , add inline documentation that 's extractable , use a code repository , and a bug tracker .
Likes PHP , Track , and SVN .
You are only as good as your people .
Have to trust guy next to you that he 's doing his job .
To cultivate trust empower people to make
decisions .
Trust that people have it handled and they 'll take care of it .
Cuts down on meetings because you know people will do the job right .
Completely a Mac shop .
Almost all developers are local .
Some people are remote to offer 24 hour support .
Joe 's approach is pragmatic .
He does n't have a language fetish .
People went from PHP , to Python / Ruby , to Erlang .
Uses vim .
Develops from the command line .
Has no idea how people constantly change tool sets all the time .
It 's not very productive .
Services ( SOA ) decoupling is a big win .
Digg uses REST .
Internal services return a vanilla structure that 's mapped to JSON , XML , etc. Version in URL because it costs you nothing , for example :
/1.0/service/id/xml .
Version both internal and external services .
People do n't understand how many moving parts are in a website .
Something is going to happen and it will go down .
MemcacheDB : Evolutionary Step for Code , Revolutionary Step for Performance Imagine Kevin Rose , the founder of Digg , who at the time of this presentation had 40,000 followers .
If Kevin diggs just once a day that 's 40,000 writes .
As the most active diggers are the most followed it becomes a huge performance bottleneck .
Two problems appear .
You can't update 40,000 follower accounts at once .
Fortunately the queuing system we talked about earlier takes care of that .
The second problem is the huge number of writes that happen .
Digg has a write problem .
If the average user has 100 followers that ’s 300 million diggs day .
That 's 3,000 writes per second , 7GB of storage per day , and 5TB of data spread across 50 to 60 servers .
With such a heavy write load MySQL was n’t going to work for Digg .
That ’s where MemcacheDB comes in .
In Initial tests on a laptop MemcacheDB was able to handle 15,000 writes a second .
MemcacheDB 's own benchmark shows it capable of 23,000 writes / second and 64,000 reads / second .
At those write rates it 's easy to see why Joe was so excited about MemcacheDB 's ability to handle their digg deluge .
What is MemcacheDB ?
It 's a distributed key - value storage system designed for persistent .
It is NOT a cache solution , but a persistent storage engine for fast and reliable key - value based object storage and retrieval .
It conforms to memcache protocol ( not completed , see below ) , so any memcached client can have connectivity with it .
MemcacheDB uses Berkeley DB as a storing backend , so lots of features including transaction and replication are supported .
Before you get too excited keep in mind this is a key - value store .
You read and write records by a single key .
There are n't multiple indexes and there 's no SQL .
That 's why it can be so fast .
Digg uses MemcacheDB to scale out the huge number of writes that happen when data is denormalized .
Remember it 's a key - value store .
The value is usually a complete application level object merged together from a possibly large number of normalized tables .
Denormalizing introduces redundancies because you are keeping copies of data in multiple records instead of just one copy in a nicely normalized table .
So denormalization means a lot more writes as data must be copied to all the records that contain a copy .
To keep up they needed a database capable of handling their write load .
MemcacheDB has the performance , especially when you layer memcached 's normal partitioning scheme on top .
I asked Joe why he did n't turn to one of the in - memory data grid solutions ?
Some of the reasons were :
This data is generated from many different databases and takes a long time to generate .
So they want it in a persistent store .
MemcacheDB uses the memcache protocol .
Digg already uses memcache so it's a no-brainer to start using MemcacheDB .
It 's easy to use and easy to setup .
Operations is happy with deploying it into the datacenter as it's not a new setup .
They already have memcached high availability and failover code so that stuff already works .
Using a new system would require more ramp - up time .
If there are any problems with the code you can take a look .
It 's all open source .
Not sure those other products are stable enough .
So it 's an evolutionary step for code and a revolutionary step for performance .
Digg is looking at using MemcacheDB across the board .

According to some Twitter reports by friends of Google employees , Google has given management the mandate to reduce headcount at Google and layoff engineers and other employees , even on critical projects .
Yes , Google is trimming the fat , cutting back and optimizing its workforce .
Sure , it ’s difficult to take a Tweet seriously , but responses to @MaryHodder have been affirmative , and several friends have confirmed that 4 to 5 year employees with solid Google stocks have been laid off or friendly pressured to move on .
This description of the Google Layoffs from @ MaryHodder ’s Twitter thread :
Talkng to friend laid off from Google Friday .
Others in their eng .
gp as well .
They do n’t want to discuss publicly , but R ok w. my telling .
We think Goog is quietly laying ppl off so as not to alert press .
Mgrs have mandate to reduce headcnt , no matter how critical the project .
Full time eng on a critical path project .
so were others .. 4 - 5 yr employees .
Oddly , before this wk 2 othr Goog frnds told me uncomfortably they want to leave ..was shocked , they have great jobs , but pressure that Google just was n’t fun place anymore , but now think it could be really unpleasantly bad for ppl .
do n’t know , just anecdotal .
These ppl sounded pretty uncomfortable .
working 18 hr days .. if you have the big stock , might make you want to go .
For more discussion on the breaking Google Layoff news , be sure to monitor Twitter @ http://search.twitter.com/search?q=goog
Hodder ’s credentials as being on the Advisory Boards of Sphere , Technorati , Blogher and her connections in the blogging and search industries help to back up these Tweets and “ rumours ”

Hat Tip to Frank Watson
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- America 's civil engineers think the nation 's aging and rusty infrastructure is just not making the grade .
The engineers ' report card gives U.S. infrastructure a cumulative grade of D .
The American Society of Civil Engineers issued an infrastructure report card Wednesday giving a bleak cumulative ranking of D .
" We 've been talking about this for many many years , " Patrick Natale , the group 's executive director , told CNN .
" We really have n't had the leadership or will to take action on it .
The bottom line is that a failing infrastructure cannot support a thriving economy . "
Watch what the report had to say »
The ranking -- which grades the condition of 15 infrastructure entities such as roads , bridges and dams -- is the same as the the last time such a report was issued , in 2005 .
In 2001 , the grade was D+ , slightly better but still poor .
Roads got a D- , with Americans spending more than 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic .
" Poor conditions cost motorists $ 67 billion a year in repairs and operating costs .
One - third of America 's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 45 percent of major urban highways are congested , " the engineers ' report said .
Drinking water , D- .
" America 's drinking water systems face an annual shortfall of at least $ 11 billion to replace aging facilities , " the report said .

Christy Resendes Will Squeeze You Dry
Total Pro Sports –
Have you ever wondered about the benefits of taking steroids ?
Well one of them is that you do n’t need one of those expensive juicers to make yourself a freshly squeezed glass of orange juice .
All you have to do is squeeze the orange with your biceps like Christy “ Black Widow ” Resendes does .
Christy Resendes is a female bodybuilder and in this video she gives a demonstration of what she can do to an orange .
In one of the weirdest videos I have ever seen , Christy can be seen flexing , doing calf exercises with a guy on her back and also squeezing fruit .
We have no idea why someone would even consider taking steroids ( Her triceps are bigger then mine ) , just take a look at what it does to a wo ’man ’ , absolutely disgusting .
Talk about an ad for steroids , I wonder if A - Rod saw this before he started juicing ?

2.0 The Game of Go
Go is a two player board game in which chance plays no part .
It is an Oriental game which originated between 2500 and 4000 years ago and enjoys a similar status in Japan , China , Taiwan and Korea as Chess does in Western countries .
Go is played on a board which consists of a grid made by the intersection of horizontal and vertical lines .
The size of the board is generally 19 x 19 , however , 9 x 9 and 13 x 13 sized boards are also used for playing quicker games .
Intersection points are connected along the horizontal and vertical lines such that the neighbours of any given point are the intersection points that are horizontally and vertically adjacent to it .
Two players alternate in placing black and white stones on the intersection points of the board ( including edges and corners of the board ) with the black player moving first .
The aim of Go is to capture more territory and prisoners than your opponent .
2.1 Liberties and Capture
Empty points that neighbour a stone are called its liberties ( points marked L in Figure 1 ) .
Any stone which has no liberties is captured and removed from the board ( white stone in Figure 2 ) .
This is the only instance in which stones , once placed , are moved .
2.1.1 Suicide
A player cannot commit suicide by placing a stone in a position which leads to its immediate capture ( points marked X in Figure 3 ) .
2.2 Strings
Stones of the same colour can be joined into strings by being horizontally or vertically connected to each other ( Figure 4 ) .
Single stones can also be described as strings which we will refer to as unitary strings .
Instead of the stones in a string having individual liberties , the liberties of the constituent stones of the string become the liberties of the string ( points marked L in Figure 5 ) .
To be captured , a string must be surrounded by opponent stones such that no stone in the string has any liberties ( black stones in Figure 6 ) .
When a player fills the penultimate liberty of a stone or string , it is courtesy to declare " Atari ! " which alerts the owner of the stone or string of its impending capture .
2.3 Eyes
Eyes are formed when a string surrounds one or more empty intersection points ( point marked E in Figure 7 ) .
Strings which contain a single eye can be captured by first being surrounded and then the eye being filled ( Figure 8 ) .
Filling the eye does not violate the suicide rule since the opponents captured stones are first removed , creating liberties for the last stone played .
A string that has two eyes ( points marked E in Figure 9 ) is safe from capture since there is no way for an opponent to capture such a string .
The reason for the inability to capture a string with two eyes is that the stone played in the first eye will be subject to the suicide rule .
Dead or Alive
Strings which have two eyes are said to be alive .
In general , a string is alive if it cannot be captured even if the opponent moves first .
A string is considered to be dead if there is no way to stop it from being captured even if its owner moves first .
2.3.2 False Eyes
2.3.3 Seki
2.4 Repetition of Board Positions - Ko
To stop endless cycles occurring , a player cannot play a stone which causes a previous board position to be repeated .
In general , the only situation in which a cycle can arise is called a ko .
In Figure 10 , a white stone at 1 is captured by a black stone at 2 which could itself be captured by a white stone being played at 1 again .
Such a situation is prohibited by the rule against repetition .
A ko situation can lead to a ko fight ( Figure 11 ) in which the player which loses a stone in the ko ( white stone at 4 captured by black at 1 ) threatens an opponent stone elsewhere ( at 2 ) and then recaptures the opponent stone in the ko ( at 4 ) after the opponent responds to the threat ( at 3 ) .
2.5 Sente and Gote
Skilful players can engineer the game so that they gain the initiative for a number of moves and dictate the response of their opponent .
In such a case , a player is said to have sente and the opponent to have gote .
Sente usually occurs when players place their opponent in a situation of having to save stones and only having one option available to do so .
Sente allows a player to control the course of the game so as to execute a plan of several moves without the opponent being able to frustrate the plan in midstream .
2.6 Ladders
Ladders are a capturing race between a group that is almost enclosed , and a surrounding group .
Consider the initial stones in Figure 12 ( the stones without numbers ) .
The black stone is doomed to be captured no matter what the Black player does .
When White plays at 1 , the black stone is threatened with capture .
To defend this stone , Black plays at 2 .
White once again threatens capture by playing at 3 .
This process continues and results in a ladder being formed .
White eventually wins the ladder when the board edge is encountered .
2.7 Links
The only links between stones which is recognized in the rules of Go is between horizontally and vertically adjacent stones ( called nobi ) .
In practice however , there are several links which are recognized by experienced Go players ( Figure 13 ) .
The ikken tobi link can be physically connected as long as black plays next .
The kosumi link can be made as long as black plays next or each of the connecting points are empty if white plays first .
Of the other links , physical connection depends on the context of the surrounding stones .
If two strings are denied a physical connection they are said to be cut ( Figure 14 ) .
2.8 Groups
A group is composed of strings of one colour that are in close proximity to each other such as A and B , and C1 , C2 , C3 and C4 in Figure 15 .
Being in close proximity means that they can be securely linked by one of the links in Figure 13 ( other than nobi of course ) .
For the C group , C1 is linked to C2 by an ogeima link ; C2 is linked to C3 by an ikken tobi link ; and C3 is linked to C4 by a kogeima link .
Groups are the main perceptual units concerning the player throughout the game .
The most important attributes of a group is whether it is alive , and whether it can create two eyes or connect to a group with two eyes to ensure survival .
2.9 Armies
An army is a loose federation of groups of one colour that are in close proximity to each other .
In Figure 15 , the two groups ( A and B , and C1 , C2 , C3 and C4 ) form one army .
Being in close proximity means that there are no intervening enemy stings between the groups .
Although armies cover a large territory , they are not as secure for defending territory as groups .
Thus it is important for a players to convert armies into groups whilst stopping their opponents from doing the same .
Converting an army into groups implies playing stones in between strings of separate groups such that they can be linked together as described above ( e.g. by playing at one of the points enclosed by the dashed line in Figure 15 ) .
2.10 Winning the Game
A player may pass at any time and the game is over when both players pass consecutively .
A determination of territory begins by removing the stones in black strings and white strings which are dead .
Each player then adds the number of opponent stones they have captured and the number of empty intersection points which are surrounded by their stones i.e. points that cannot trace a path to an opponent 's stone along the horizontal and vertical grid lines ( points marked B in Figure 16 ) .
The player with the largest territory wins .
2.11 The Go Handicap and Ranking Systems
Go has a sophisticated handicap and ranking system .
Players are ranked according to their ability with a complete novice being ranked at 30 kyu ( pronounced " cue " ) .
After playing between 10 and 15 games , a player 's rank would likely be around 20 kyu .
After reaching 1 kyu , further improvement would result in a rank of 1 dan or first - degree master .
Amateur ranks continue up to 6 dan .
Professional ranks start at what would be 7 dan amateur and extend from 1 dan to 9 dan .
The amount of effort required to increase to the next best rank becomes harder as a player moves up in ranks .
For instance , to rise from 20 kyu to 10 kyu would require playing 1 or 2 games a week for around a year and possibly reading a few books on Go tactics and strategy .
[ The differentiation between professional ranks is also smaller than between amateur ranks .
The difference between a 1 dan professional and a 9 dan professional is approximately equivalent to the relative difference of 2 amateur ranks , say 4 dan to 6 dan . ]
Many years of full - time play is required to reach professional ranking .
To provide balance for both weak and strong players , the weak player is given handicap stones at the start of the game .
In the Chinese rules , the handicap stones are placed at the weaker player 's discretion whereas in the Japanese rules , the handicap stones are placed on set points called hoshi points .
The weaker player is given as many handicap stones as the difference between the players rankings .
For instance , a 10 kyu player would give 5 handicap stones to a 15 kyu player .
Ranks are usually determined in one of two ways .
The first is by finding the number of handicap stones a player needs to win about half the games played against a stronger player on a 19x19 board .
The other is by giving 1 handicap stone for each 10 stones that a player is beaten by .
The relative value of handicap stones diminish as the board size increases .
One handicap stone on a 9x9 board is worth two on a 13x13 board and four on a 19x19 board .
Playing first without handicap is equivalent to a 5 point advantage .
It is customary for the weaker player to play first using black stones .
If both players are ranked equally , the White player is given a 5 point bonus or komi ( pronounced " ko - mee " ) .
In tournaments the komi is usually 5 1/2 points so as to avoid ties .
3.0 The Challenge of Programming Go
Compared to the Chess programming field , the Go programming field is not well developed .
A strong commitment to research on programming Chess in the 1960's and 70's has not been replicated in the Go field .
There are fundamental differences between Chess and Go which have contributed to making Chess a more attractive research domain so far .
However , even allowing for the smaller amount of work done on programming Go , the performance of Go programs have not kept pace with the performance of Chess programs .
There are several reasons for this disparity , which is in part due to the complexity of Go and also the unsuitability of the programming techniques used in Chess as described below .
3.1 A Comparison of Chess and Go
1 . There are fewer types of pieces in Go than chess ( in chess there are 6 types of pieces , whereas in Go each player has only one type , called a stone ) .
However , the board size is much greater in Go ( 8x8 squares in chess vs 19x19 grid in Go ) .
2 . The size of the board , and the relative freedom in the placement of stones mean that there are also many more moves made in a typical Go game ( about 80 moves in chess vs. about 300 moves300 moves in Go ) .
3 . Stones can be placed anywhere on the board , making for a very large branching factor in the selection of each move ( estimated at ~ 200 ) , whereas pieces in chess are constrained to a much smaller set of legal moves ( branch factor of ~ 40 ) .
The diversity of chess pieces is exploited to reduce the branching factor in chess programs in a way that is not possible in Go ( see discussion of evaluation functions in 7 . below ) .
The branching factor also plays a role in the different stages of both games ( beginning , middle and end ) .
In the opening stage of chess , there are many well - known openings , and these are often followed for up to 10 moves .
In Go , the number of sensible openings is much larger , and set openings are rarely followed for more than about 3 moves .
However , there are sequences of moves in local skirmishes , known as joseki , that reflect optimal play ( for both sides ) in tactical battles in the corners .
Skill in the use of joseki libraries lies in selecting the right joseki to optimise interactions with stones outside the region of interest or diverge from the known sequence to serve other interests .
4 . Both games can be won by resignation of the opponent , or by an outright win - check - mate in chess , or surrounding more territory and taking more prisoners in Go .
In chess , the end of a game is easy to determine : checkmate is simply defined in terms of the position and threats to the King .
In Go , a game is finished when both players pass , but it is frequently difficult for beginners to know when the end of a game has been reached .
Beginners typically prolong play beyond the point where experts would stop , and their difficulties are echoed by Go programs , which also have difficulty estimating when to end a game .
The natural end of the game occurs when playing additional stones reduces the player 's score , either by filling in their own territory , or giving unnecessary prisoners to the opponent .
Go programs are often inefficient in both these ways .
There are several different rule systems for scoring in Go : they are all similar , based on calculating the sum of territory surrounded plus prisoners taken during the game for each player , and taking the difference between these scores ( a typical margin in a professional game would be less than five points ) .
5 . In both chess and Go , pieces can have long range effects .
In chess the effect is directly a result of some pieces ' ability to move many squares ( e.g , queens , rooks , bishops ) .
In Go , a stone once placed on a grid point does not move ( although it can be captured and removed from the board ) .
However , a group ( or pattern of stones ) does have long range effects in that it can play a role in a capturing race , or can affect the life and death struggle of another group .
For example , a stone played in the path of a ladder ( a group of stones involved in a certain type of capturing race ) can change the potential to link two stones later in the game - even though the stones are on the other side of the board .
6 . The state of the board changes rapidly in chess , as pieces move positions .
In Go , the board is only gradually changing , as stones are added to the existing configurations .
This gradual change compensates significantly for the greater memory load imposed by the larger board .
It also allows accurate " read - out " of board positions later in the game - even beginners can read out ladders up to 60 moves ahead ( a deep but narrow search ) .
The only time the physical state of the board changes significantly is when a group is captured , and the stones are removed from the board .
Groups worth as much as 30 points are often won or lost in a game as trade - offs for other groups , even though the final difference in scores may be just 2 points .
7. Evaluation of board positions ( in expert human play ) typically reflects both tactical and strategic factors in both chess and Go. However , in chess , there is a good correlation between the likelihood of winning ( from any stage of the game ) and the number and quality of pieces on each side .
Thus in computer chess programs , strategic factors have not been essential in evaluating board position .
In Go , there is no strong correlation between winning a tactical struggle over a group , and winning the game , as each tactical struggle over a group requires moves that are not contributing to another group .
Early in the game , players strive to achieve influence on the board , rather than directly taking territory .
In fact , taking territory at the start of the game can indicate an over - concentrated position , that will not be effective in containing the opponent 's territorial moves much later in the game .
Algorithmic approaches to measuring the influence of a position are a standard part of most
Go programs but there are no methods to confirm their efficacy , except for the strength of the program itself which is usually very weak .
8 . For all the reasons discussed above , programming approaches to chess are amenable to tree searches , with good evaluation criteria .
Such approaches have not succeeded in Go , because the branching factor is too large for brute force search techniques , and pruning is not a viable option without good evaluation measures .
9. Human lookahead in chess and Go is very different .
Beginners of both games might start by only looking ahead a few moves , but in Go , patterns such as ladders can be read out with very little effort , and beginners are soon able to trace the path of a ladder across the board ( which can require up to 60 moves ) .
However , in these read - out sequences , there is only one sensible move at each stage , i.e , a series of forcing moves , so there are no alternative paths to follow ( see the horizon effect below ) .
In a typical chess game , expert players may search alternative possible moves many steps ahead ( although typically about 10 ) , but for each move there are several alternatives .
In Go , there are too many alternatives that are reasonable to search far ahead in most moves , although for any move , there are likely to be some sequences that can be very deep ( e.g. , ladders ) .
This combination of factors is not captured well by either breadth - first or depth - first search techniques .
10 .
The horizon effect in chess is where a search to a specific depth ( such as 12 moves ahead ) elicits an evaluation that would be radically altered if a few more moves had been studied .
This effect is often seen in sacrifice moves .
The horizon effect begins to be a problem at the Grandmaster level in chess .
In Go , the horizon effect is seen in assessment of even beginner level play ( e.g. , ladders ) .
11 . Chess was used in the early 1970s to study human grouping processes , and Chase and Simon ( 1973 ) showed that expert chess players view the board in terms of hierarchical groups of stones .
In trying to replicate the results with Go players , Reitman ( 1976 ) found a completely different structure , in which stones are seen as part of many intersecting groups .
Identifying the eventual group to which stones belong is critical in determining their safety , however , from Reitman 's research , it appears that no clean assignments can be made until the end stage of the game .
Such results indicate sources of potential problems for computer go programs that assign stones into hierarchical groups in order to estimate features such as influence .
12 . One major difference in the actual playing of chess and Go lies in the standards of the opponents .
In chess , a similar standard is required for an even game .
In Go , there is a very effective handicap system , in which a weaker player starts with a predefined number of stones ( usually 2 - 9 ) placed at influential points on the board .
Thus the greater skill of one player is offset by the material advantage of the weaker one .
In such contests ( and most Go games are of this type ) neither player can assume an infallible opponent , for the weaker player tries to simplify the game , and play safely , whereas the stronger player must take more risks , and exploit the weakness of the other player .
Although the final score of a
Go game is often used as an indication of the relative strengths of the players , the important factor is winning , by however small a margin , rather than taking chances that may increase the margin , but are not as safe .
Thus , estimating the other player 's level of skill is a critical aspect of many Go games .
It is also the case that a Go player needs to be skilled at all facets of the game , rather than having great strength in just one area .
This requirement is because players exploit the weaknesses of their opponents .
It is common to rank the strength of computer
Go programs according to their first game against a human of a given level .
In subsequent games , the same human player will often overwhelm the same program that had won previously , because the human will learn the program 's weaknesses , but the program does not change .
3.2 The Complexity of Go
An algorithm which can be solved in polynomial time can be practically implemented to solve " real - world " problems .
Algorithms which cannot be solved in polynomial time are described as exponential - time algorithms .
Except for very small problem spaces , these algorithms are impractical .
Problems that can be solved by a computer with a polynomial amount of memory space are said to be solvable in P - space .
It has been shown that , given an arbitrary Go position on an n x n board , determining the winner is P - space hard ( Lichtenstein and Sipser , 1980 ) .
This result used together with situations arising from ko positions have been used to show that for an arbitrary
Go position on an n x n board , deciding whether Black can force a win or deciding on Black 's best move is exponential - time complete ( Robson , 1983 ) .
These results indicate that the use of approximation algorithms which return near - optimal solutions are necessary to solve some aspects of Go and that brute - force search methods will quickly run into difficulties .
A comparison of the complexity of Go to the complexity of other games is provided in Allis et al. ( 1991 ) .
They defined the terms cracked and solved , and illustrated the difference between search - space complexity and decision complexity .
A game is said to be cracked if a program is capable of achieving the best possible theoretical results regardless of its opposition .
To be solved , the best move must be explicable in human terms .
The difference between search - space complexity and decision complexity is illustrated by a variant of Go .
The variant consists of players alternatively placing stones on unoccupied points of the board or passing .
The first player to place 181 stones wins .
This variant has the same search - space complexity as Go , however , since if the player moving first does not pass is bound to win , the decision complexity is trivial .
Allis et al. graphed log log search - space complexity versus log decision complexity , dividing the graph into solvable and unsolvable space for 16 games .
Go was shown to be the most complex in both log log search - space complexity and log decision complexity and to be in the unsolvable area .
A comparison of Go and Chess shows that 9x9 Go is around about the same complexity as Chess ( 35 versus 50 in 10 log search space ) and that 19x19
Go is a vastly more complex game than Chess and may well be unsolvable as defined above ( Allis et al. ( 1991 ) .
3.3 Why Go Cannot be Programmed Like Chess
Chess programs typically use a heuristic search and evaluation technique .
Search trees of board positions are generated to a fixed depth and are heuristically pruned according to an evaluation of the merit of the board positions .
This approach works well in Chess because the board size is sufficiently small and the nature of Chess is more tactical than strategic .
Evaluation of a board position in Go presents problems not encountered in Chess .
Go is a much more strategic game in comparison to Chess .
Unlike Chess ,
Go does not focus around the capture of a single piece .
Positional advantages are slowly built up in achieving the long term goal of acquiring more territory than the opponent .
There are many direct and indirect ways to achieve this goal such as making territory , building influence , attacking weak enemy groups , securing friendly groups , destroying enemy territory etc .
Due to the large size of the board , a Go game is comprised of many small local skirmishes .
If a game of Chess were described as a battle , a game of Go could be described as a war .
Many good tactical moves at the local level must all compete for selection in the context of strategic global considerations .
Thus a player must balance resources to achieve local goals at many locations whilst trying to pursue an overall global objective .
Due to the problems associated with evaluation , the brute force methods employed in AI to program Chess will not work for Go .
As a domain , Go is rich for research in AI and cognitive science .
Hans Berliner , a former Correspondence Chess World Champion , a top- ranked U.S. over - the - board player and a well - known Chess programmer referring to Go as saying " ... this game may have to replace Chess as the `task par excellence ' for AI " ( Berliner , 1978 ) .
4.0 History of the Computer Go Field
Early work in programming
Go began in the late sixties and was primarily academic in nature .
Academic programs are not generally intended to contribute to a general programmable theory of Go , rather they use Go to further other research aims .
Serious attempts to develop commercial
Go programs was advanced by the spread of personal computers in the home and the financial inducement of the Ing prize .
4.1 Academic Work
4.1.1 Zobrist
The earliest
Go program was written by Albert Zobrist as part of a PhD thesis on pattern recognition ( Zobrist , 1970 ) .
The present description of Zobrist 's program will concentrate on those aspects that are relevant to computer Go considerations .
Influence Function
Zobrist introduced the idea of using an influence function to segment the board into black and white territories .
The influence function computed a numeric value for every point on the board .
Black stones were given a value of +50 and white stones a value of - 50 and empty points were given a value of 0 .
The neighbours of every point that had a positive influence value had +1 added to their influence value and similarly the neighbours of points with negative influence values had - 1 added to their influence values .
This process was repeated another three times ( for a total of four times ) .
This influence function spread black and white influence numerically and Zobrist then segmented the board into areas of contiguous positive and negative numeric values ( Figure 17 ) .
The program constructed an internal representation of the board which was stored as numeric values in various 19x19 arrays .
The representation included arrays containing information such as :
the occupation of a point ( black , white , empty ) ,
number of white and black neighbours , both horizontally , vertically and diagonally ,
the number of stones and liberties for each string ,
the number of empty points adjacent to each empty point , and
size ( including empty points ) and number of stones in each segment .
The program also used a second influence function to store an internal representation which measured the influence of stones .
It was similar to the influence described above except that occupied points were initially given values of +100 and positive points radiated + 3 to their neighbours whilst negative points radiated - 4 to their neighbours .
Since the computer played black ( positive values ) , this influence function overstated the opponent 's influence value so that the program would play cautiously .
Selecting a Move
Having constructed an internal representation , the program performed pattern recognition over the entire board which amounted to searching for certain numeric patterns contained in the program 's various arrays .
Along with each pattern would be stored an associated move and a numeric value reflecting the priority of the move .
When a pattern match was made , the numeric value would be added to the point corresponding to the associated move .
An attempt was made to match each pattern " known " to the program across the entire board , rotating and reflecting the patterns as necessary .
At the end of this process , the point with the highest value became the program 's next move .
Thus Zobrist 's program used summed feature evaluation to choose its next move .
The program exhibited weaknesses in its play which Zobrist wished to overcome .
He divided the game into four phases : corner and edge play at the beginning , extension into the centre of the board , defence and attack of loosely staked out territories , and stabilizing surrounded territories .
To enable the program to play appropriate moves during the various phases , only appropriate patterns ( along with patterns which were relevant throughout the entire game ) were allowed to be matched during those phases .
Results and Improvements
Another addition to the program was limited lookahead or heuristic search .
During the pattern recognition process , local areas would be suggested for further examination by lookahead which was carried out to a depth of three moves .
The program handled saving / capturing strings , connecting / cutting strings , ladders , and the formation of eyes using lookahead .
The performance of Zobrist 's program was modest , beating two novices but performing poorly against experienced players .
4.1.2 Ryder
Jon Ryder 's program ( Ryder , 1971 ) can be seen as an extension of Zobrist 's approach in as much as it used an influence function and move selection was based on summed feature evaluation .
However , Ryder added both strategic and tactical considerations and also used lookahead extensively .
The distinction drawn by Ryder between tactics and strategy was that tactical considerations dealt with short - term objectives whilst strategic considerations dealt with long - term objectives
Due to the intractability of using game trees in Go , a suitable replacement had to be found .
Ryder 's program used the combined analyses of many local tactical problems performed by lookahead together with other analyses as a replacement for the game tree .
Ryder saw
Go as a game which required a balance between acquiring actual or potential territory and avoiding the loss of important stones to the opponent .
He formulated three areas of interest which were designed to help maintain this balance : board organization showing degree of control of each side over various regions ; identification of areas of best play for both sides ; and analysis of strings to determine whether they are safe or endangered .
Selecting a Move
Move generation was accomplished in two passes .
In the first pass , the tactical status of all strings were determined .
Armies , walls and groups were identified and a process of developmental analysis was performed on each which resulted in determining areas and endangered groups for each player .
Each legal move was then examined in an attempt to eliminate as many as possible from future consideration with the fifteen best moves being further analysed in the second pass .
The second pass began with an analysis of the best fifteen moves from the first pass with respect to tactical and naive strategic theories .
The score obtained by a move from these analyses were added to the score obtained in the developmental analysis .
The move with the highest combined score after the first and second passes was then recommended as the next move .
Second pass analysis would stop before all fifteen moves were analysed if an " obviously " best move was identified .
Ryder 's program used a forward - pruning method to search the game trees that resulted during lookahead .
In forward pruning , a decision based on various criteria is made regarding the desirability of pursuing a given branch in a lookahead tree i.e. whether the future implications of a particular move is worth examining .
The criteria for terminating a particular search tree included whether a target string had two eyes , whether a saving move resulted in more than five liberties , or it was unlikely that the target would be captured .
The danger in forward pruning is that the best move may be discarded before it has been examined .
Influence Function
Like Zobrist , Ryder also used an influence function to provide a numeric number to indicate the degree of tactical control each stone exerted over its neighbours .
His influence function was similar to Zobrist 's in that black influence was positive and white influence was negative and the influence value at each point was the sum of the influence values propagated by its nearby neighbours .
Ryder 's influence function was simpler than Zobrist 's in that each stone contributed an influence value to its nearby neighbours according to a table of values ( Figure 18 ) .
Ryder 's influence function .
Both too much and too little influence at a point indicated a problem with playing at that point .
Too much influence indicated that there was an over - concentration to the detriment of the global situation whereas too little influence indicated that there was the possibility of capture by the opponent .
Optimal moves were those that were close to the peak of the value / influence curve .
Influence was regarded by Ryder to be a local property of a stone although he admitted that there were cases ( such as ladder - breakers ) , in which stones exerted control on distant parts of the board .
In such situation where the influence value was not a reliable measure , tactical evaluation was used to overcome the short - comings of the influence function .
One situation in which the influence function was not a good measure was that of connectivity .
Ryder defined two terms : connectedness and strongly related .
The definition for connectedness was that a point was connected to colour X if it was occupied by a non -dead stone of colour X , or if it was empty , it was adjacent to at least one stone of colour X and none of the opposite colour .
An extension to connectedness was half - connectedness .
An empty point was half - connected to colour X if it was adjacent to at least two stones of colour X and one or more stones of the opposite colour .
The definition of strongly related was that a point was strongly related to colour X if it was occupied by or adjacent to a stone of colour X . A point could also be strongly related to colour X if it was diagonally adjacent to a stone of colour X with at least one empty point ( kosumi link ) or no more than one empty point away ( ikken - tobi link ) .
Groups were defined as sets of points which were connected or half - connected .
The influence function was particularly suited to determining walls and armies .
Walls were defined as a connected set of points in which the influence values were equal to or larger than a predefined wall threshold .
Similarly , armies were defined as a set of points including empty points in which the influence value were equal to or larger than a predefined army threshold .
The tactical concepts employed in Ryder 's program included liberty estimation , ko , ladders and snapbacks , and eyes and false eyes .
Ryder admitted that improvement was needed in the program 's tactical ability which he described as " blunder avoidance " .
Representation
Information was included in the representation if it satisfied any of the following criteria : it was basic and was needed in many calculations ; it took a significant effort to re-calculate and was used more than once ; or it was accessed many times and was constant through many if not all of those accesses .
Groups and armies were represented in a pointer - based manner .
There was a pointer from each point in a group or an army to the entity descriptor of the group or army it belonged to .
Each entity had a pointer to one of the points that comprised it which was the base point for that entity .
Searches for points near entities were initiated from the base point .
The global representation of the board was contained in a 21x21 array ( 19x19 with an empty point border around the outside ) .
By using various bits in the memory location of each point in the array , the following information / pointers were able to be stored : area number ; army number ; wall number ; group number ; string number ; and current state ( black , white or empty ) .
Results and Improvements
Ryder reported the results of only one game which was lost to a novice which had just learned the rules and had been given some rudimentary tips on the tactics and strategies of Go .
With regard to Ryder 's main interest , he reported that the tactical analysis was quite an efficient searching mechanism which provided valuable information for move generation and compared favourably to the powers of analysis exhibited by human beginners .
He was also of the opinion that only a small effort would be required to improve the program 's tactical strength .
Future improvements suggested by Ryder included re-using previously calculated information in searching , the incorporation of distant ladder - breakers into tactical analysis and improving the definition of endangered groups .
Ryder identified the developmental analysis stage which consumed around 10 % of the processing time as needing attention .
One possible reason for the poor performance of Ryder 's program was that it made no distinction between the opening , mid and end games and was therefore playing inappropriate tactical moves in the end game in particular .
The addition of such distinction was recognized to be of importance in future improvements by Ryder .
4.1.3 Reitman and Wilcox
Walter Reitman and Bruce Wilcox began using Go to conduct research in 1972 .
The program that resulted from that research has been described both as the Reitman - Wilcox Go program and to the INTERIM .2
Go program .
After the research project was discontinued , Wilcox rewrote the INTERIM.2 program to produce NEMESIS , a commercial Go program .
The research conducted by Reitman and Wilcox using Go was predominately in the Artificial Intelligence area and included pattern recognition ( Reitman et al. , 1978 ; Reitman and Wilcox , 1975,1978 ) , planning ( Reitman and Wilcox , 1974 ) and replication of human perceptual and cognitive abilities in Go.
Indeed , the objective of program was to model human go play and to this end , they videotaped protocols and post - game analyses of a strong
Go player to try to ascertain how humans play Go .
According to Reitman and Wilcox , the three essential ingredients to a Go program are perception , knowledge and coordination ( Wilcox , 1988 ) .
They tried to incorporate into their programs representation as many of the perceptions of a skilled Go player as they could .
They identified and stored two types of Go knowledge : process knowledge which included how to kill a group , how to make territory , etc , and evaluation knowledge which enabled the stability of groups etc. to be judged , the estimation of relative values , etc.
Coordination of the program 's perceptions and knowledge was achieved through appropriate control structures which allowed it to choose the next move .
The INTERIM.2 program created and maintained a representation that was a selectively updated , multilevel network which Reitman and Wilcox said was analogous to the type of perceptual and cognitive representation a skilled Go player would create .
There was a hierarchy of experts and critics which operated on the network which chose the next move .
Lookahead was not full - board , rather it was a selective , goal - driven process .
The INTERIM.2 Program
INTERIM.2 summarized information up and filtered decisions down ( Wilcox , 1988 ) .
Information contained in low - level representations e.g. strings , were summarized and used in high - level representations e.g. groups .
The program made decisions at a high - level about what to " focus on " .
These decisions were filtered down to lower levels and influenced decisions made at those levels .
Flow of Control
The program stored its representation in a structure called GAMEMAP which was indexed through a set of interrelated arrays called GAMEBOARDS .
In each GAMEBOARD array there were pointers that pointed to every instance of a particular data structure e.g. STRING - BOARD contained pointers to every string on the board .
The GAMEBOARDS progressed from simple to complex : TYPEBOARD , STRINGBOARD , LINKBOARD .
Special GAME - BOARDS such as LENSBOARD , WEBBOARD , SECTORBOARD and TACTICSBOARD were designed to contain representations which corresponded to a skilled human players perceptual and cognitive representations .
The flow of control in the INTERIM.2 program oscillated between MOVE and REFLEX .
MOVE selectively updated the components of GAMEMAP that were affected when stones , black or white , were placed on the board .
REFLEX was responsible for choosing the program 's next move which was achieved by stepping through an ordered list of functions and accepting the first move returned by them .
The Tactician ( PROBE )
The program 's tactician , PROBE , was used to answer specific questions and therefore performed narrow , goal - driven lookahead instead of general purpose , full - board lookahead that is common in Chess programs .
The basic assumption behind PROBE was that if the results of a small number of intelligently chosen lines were the same for a given question , then those results would most likely be the answer to that question .
Such an assumption is not always valid , however , Reitman and Wilcox felt it was a small price to pay for a quick searching and was not dissimilar to the penalties experienced when human searches failed for similar reasons .
PROBE was designed to model how skilled human
Go players performed tactical problem solving by selective lookahead ( Reitman and Wilcox , 1979 ) .
PROBE would be employed to answer a specific question and would propose a reasonable initial move .
The initial move would be hypothetically played and a new hypothetical board position would result .
PROBE would then propose another reasonable move based on the hypothetical board position .
This would continue until a position was reached which could be judged as either a success or a failure with respect to the specific question that PROBE was trying to answer .
If the position was a success , PROBE returned the initial move as the result .
If the position was a failure , the hypothetical moves were retracted until there was a position in which a reasonable alternative move could be made and the process was repeated .
In unrestricted lookahead , all moves were examined in this fashion so that the best move could be discovered .
In PROBE , not even all reasonable moves were examined .
Each side was limited to two or three failed variations before the search was terminated and a failure result was returned .
The selection and examination of reasonable moves was conducted by a hierarchy of experts which formed , evaluated and implemented goal - directed " chains of thought " ( Wilcox , 1988 ) .
There were a variety of experts including experts that generated goals and subgoals , experts that proposed moves to realize goals , experts that used exclusively the current board position and current goals , and experts that used all goals and subgoals .
The experts contained a large amount of specific Go knowledge .
The control structures implemented by Reitman and Wilcox in PROBE allowed the knowledge contained in the various experts to be organized , easily debugged , and readily extended ( Wilcox , 1988 ) .
The goal - directed behaviour of PROBE resulted in very restrictive searching which typically resulted in around 60 - 80 hypothetical moves per lookahead ( Wilcox , 1988 ) .
Perceptions and Representations
INTERIM.2 maintained many different data structures in its representation .
Point occupancy ( black , white , empty ) was used to determine strings .
A basic property of each string was whether it could be captured or saved .
The links recognized by INTERIM.2 were kosumi , ikken - tobi , nikken - tobi , kogeima and ogeima .
Links were classified as normal ( connectable ) , dead ( unconnectable but potentially useful ) or string capture ( linkages between strings capturing an opponent string ) .
Basic properties of linkages included whether they could be joined or cut , whether they crossed opponent links , and why they were created .
Special edge linkages which were links from strings up to the fourth line to the edge of the board were also recognized .
Sector lines were long range links and were used in stability assessment and move generation .
Virtual strings were strings connected by unbreakable links .
Groups were sets of strings joined together by links .
Enclosed territory was a set of empty points or dead stones that were enclosed by strings , linkages and edge linkages .
The motivation for moves e.g. why a link was created , was explicitly tracked to facilitate move selection and to ease debugging .
Influence was radiated using Ryder 's algorithm .
Reitman and Wilcox saw influence as misleading in certain situations and therefore developed the notion of influence blocks .
Areas of empty , contiguous , same - signed influence points that did not include linkage points were collected into a structure .
The perimeter of these structures were located and then iteratively " shrunk " to provide nested loops .
Since shrinking did not take place across stones or linkage points , it was possible that the loops created in the shrinking process would become arc segments or strips .
Eventually individual structures emerged which were called influence blocks .
Points contained in an influence block were considered more likely to be turned into territory the further they were away from the perimeter of the block .
Creating and maintaining INTERIM .2's representation was described by Reitman and Wilcox as perception and the data structures used were also sometimes referred to as perceptual representations .
Two components of the perception system employed by the INTERIM.2 program are particularly interesting .
Webs were used to determine what regions could be " seen " from a stone and lenses were used to monitor actual patterns of stones in a game using the program 's knowledge of Go patterns .
A web was constructed around a group as concentric " circles " of liberty points ( circumferential strands ) to a maximum depth of nine levels .
Radial strands emanated from the groups .
The web did not continue behind other stones , either friendly or unfriendly .
Links between stones and between stones and the edge of the board ( up to three moves away ) also stopped a web .
The continuous loop of the outermost points of a web comprised its perimeter .
The points between the group and the perimeter were considered to be transparent .
The perimeter of a web was useful information for a group in deciding where potential threats might come from , where it could run to avoid those threats , the location of nearby friendly groups , where linkages might be attacked etc .
To Reitman and Wilcox , local stone configurations and their transformation by sequences of moves is a fundamental aspect of Go. Sequences of moves associated with standard configurations e.g. attacking or defending a kogeima link , are recognized by competent Go players .
Lenses were designed to monitor such configurations and suggest moves that were known pattern continuations .
A lens was comprised of a set of fields .
Each field consists of a set of points and watches for the development of a sequence of moves .
The lens in turn supplied information about the suggested moves and global status information to the tactician .
When a field recognized a configuration , it supplied suggested moves and other associated information to the lens .
When fields no longer recognized patterns they were discarded which caused a lens to get smaller over time .
This in effect amounted to the " focus " of a lens becoming more concentrated over time .
Performance
The results of three games played by the INTERIM.2 program are reported in Reitman & Wilcox ( 1978 ) .
Two were won against players ranked 22 and 34 kyu and one was lost against a player ranked 4 kyu .
The computed ranking of the INTERIM.2 program from these games was 27 kyu .
Reitman and Wilcox were pleased with the performance of the INTERIM.2 program in regard to their initial objectives of modelling human play .
It played conservatively , choosing to defend endangered groups in preference to attacking opponent groups .
It defended well ; the only cases in which it lost groups ( other than due to bugs ) were when several groups were simultaneously endangered .
4.1.4 Other Academic Work
Some of the academic work that has used Go as a domain is presented below .
The various papers are described at a high level since , in general , they do not provide specific details that would be of use in developing a Go program .
Lehner
Paul Lehner , a student of Wilcox , produced a PhD on strategic planning in Go ( Lehner , 1981 ) which is also described in Lehner ( 1981 ) .
His work was based on representative search which Wilcox found to be frequently exhibited by Go players ( Kerwin and Wilcox , 1973 ) .
A representative search provides information about many potential move sequences that satisfy a strategic plan by examining only one of those sequences .
Lehner 's results suggested that representative lookahead was not alone sufficient to evaluate strategic plans , however , it could quickly reject strategically unsatisfactory plans .
He saw the use of representative search as providing a means to reduce the number of moves that would be passed on to a more precise tactical lookahead mechanism .
Stoutamire
Go was used as a domain for researching machine learning by David Stoutamire ( 1991 ) .
A simple error function was developed which , rather than incorporating tactical or strategic
Go knowledge , was derived from a database of expert games .
Stoutamire then developed a classification technique called pattern preference which automated the process of deriving patterns that were representative of good moves .
Due to exponential growth of the pattern database , a hashing function was developed which had the nice property of graceful degradation as memory requirements increased .
Sander
To avoid the combinatorial explosion that results from using tree search to evaluate and select moves , Peter Sander ( 1979 ) devised a program with a top - down or goal directed organization that used strategies to generate possible moves .
Sander 's program ( called Kyu ) generated bottom - up hierarchically structured descriptions of board positions which were incrementally updated after every move .
It progressively refined its strategies into goals and then selected moves .
Kyu only played the opening game to move 25 and an intended look - ahead mechanism was also not implemented .
Kyu 's data structures were based on linked records which represented strings , groups and armies of both colours .
From any point on the board , it was possible to access the string , group and army that the point belonged to if occupied , or had influence over it if unoccupied , by following pointers .
After each move , the data structures were incrementally updated to reflect the changes caused by a move .
The update was from low - level to high - level : from points to strings , from strings to groups , and from groups to armies .
The architecture which was instantiated in Kyu was summarized by Sander as being comprised of a multi- level structured data representation , and a hierarchically organized planning system which explicitly encoded strategies and goals .
He also believed that such an architecture had applications in different domains other than Go .
Friedenbach
Kenneth Friedenbach studied the interaction of perception and cognition in the solution of complex problems by using Go as a domain ( Friedenbach , 1988 ) .
He formalized the notion of abstraction hierarchies which are based on graph theory and then applied them to Go .
The use of Go as a domain was because , according to Friedenbach , concepts in the Go literature are related in a multi - level hierarchy .
Friedenbach 's model of perception and cognition involved three components .
The first was a hierarchy of static objects which consisted of five levels : the points of the board , strings of similar points , groups of related strings , loose federations of groups or potential groups ( armies ) , and a summary of the properties of the federations in a global level .
The second was an analytic component concerned with changes in structures as a result of sequences of moves or transformations that are considered .
The third was an integration component concerned with the retention and application of information from one analyses to another .
Four types of analysis were carried out .
Tactical Safety analysis was carried out at the string level and was concerned with capturing and protecting strings .
Strategic Safety analysis was concerned with killing and defending groups and involved analysing eyes and connections .
Strategic Development analysis was carried out at the group level and was concerned with open areas , balance measures , the growth of new groups , and the interactions of emerging groups .
Global Balance analysis was the highest level of analysis and was concerned with initiative and the overall strategy of the game .
Friedenbach characterizes an analysis by three conditions : the condition under which it is performed , the conditions under which it is terminated , causing its evaluation , and the conditions under which continuations are chosen .
Friedenbach uses tactical analysis as an example .
Tactical analysis is invoked whenever there is a string that has less than three liberties and is terminated when all strings have three or more liberties .
Continuation involves considering atari moves and captures by the attacker , and captures or liberty increasing moves by the defender .
A reanalysis would result if a move was made which affected the number of liberties of a key string during the analysis .
4.2 Programs
A description of past and present
Go programs are given for those programs that such details could be obtained .
Other programs are listed together with their programmer (s ) without description in the results in section 6 .
4.2.1 The Many Faces of Go
The Many Faces of Go ( MFG ) is one of the best commercial Go programs currently available .
David Fotland has been writing
Go programs on a part time basis since 1981 and released MFG in 1990 .
Fotland has continued to enhance MFG since then and has contributed regularly to discussions on the computer - go mailing list concerning computer go programming in general and MFG in particular .
MFG evolved from two other significant programs : G2 and Cosmos .
4.2.1.1 G2
Fotland 's first Go program determined territory by radiating influence .
Unfortunately , it could be beaten by a simple liberty filling algorithm so he discarded it and wrote G2 .
The internal structure of G2 was described by Fotland in terms of its data structures , its tactical analyser , and its move selector ( Fotland , 1986 ) .
G2 used full board reading and evaluated all legal moves with an emphasis on strategic moves .
After the full board evaluation of all moves , the move that received the highest score was played .
The Data Structures
Most of G2's code was devoted to updating the data structures .
Stones occupied points ( referred to as squares ) and were organized into strings ( referred to as groups ) and then into groups ( referred to as armies ) .
Data was associated with each point on the board and included the distance to the nearest and second nearest edge , a list of adjacent and diagonal neighbours , string number of the stone occupying the point , the number and a list of liberties , colour of stones on neighbouring points ( white , black , or mixed ) , an influence function , and the nearest occupied point in each direction .
Horizontally or vertically adjacent points containing like - coloured stones were organised into strings .
String data included colour , number and list of liberties , a list of its connections , a list of neighbouring enemy strings , the army it was part of , and an aliveness value ( described below ) .
The types of connections recognized by G2 included one and two point jumps , diagonal connection and knight 's move .
Connection data included the strings it joined , its type , the points involved , and its status .
Groups were comprised of strings which were connected by unbreakable connections or were both adjacent to a dead enemy string .
Group data included a list of its constituent strings and dead enemy strings used as connections , the number of stones and liberties , the number of eyes , and an aliveness value .
The Tactical Analyser
The tactical analyser was used to evaluate board positions so that a move could be selected .
Each group was assigned an aliveness value which was also inherited by its constituent strings .
The strength of G2 was primarily determined by the tactical analyser and consumed the largest portion of Fotland 's effort ( Fotland 1986 ) .
Since most of the program 's time was spent in the tactical analyser , it had to be both fast and efficient in its pruning of search trees .
Aliveness values resulted from a multi-stage process : strings which could be captured were identified as dead ; eyes were found by the eye evaluator ; unbreakable connection were identified ; connected strings were identified as groups ; territory was determined by the territory evaluator ; and the life and death evaluator assigned an aliveness value to each group which was then assigned to its constituent strings .
The tactical analyser examined every string with less than five liberties to determine whether it was dead i.e. , whether it could be captured ; strings which could obtain at least five liberties were assumed to avoid capture .
Interesting moves were suggested during lookahead to determine the status of a string .
Interesting attacking moves included geta moves for groups with two liberties , liberty filling moves , moves adjacent to an enemy string 's liberties , and liberty gaining moves for friendly strings .
Interesting defensive moves included diagonal moves into unoccupied territory , one point jumps , extensions , connections , and liberty filling moves ( for adjacent enemy strings ) .
The interesting moves were heuristically evaluated and the best were selected for further analysis .
The best of these moves was hypothetically played and the resulting situation analysed from the opponents point of view .
Once again , the best moves were chosen and the best one was hypothetically played .
Normal backtracking was used at each stage as well as alpha - beta pruning .
Thus , a depth - first tree was generated until the string being examined was captured or gained sufficient liberties to live .
The search tree was generated to a maximum of 80 moves which still enabled ladders to be accurately read .
The number of " best moves " considered ( between 1 and 3 ) depended on the depth of the current move in the search tree : more moves were considered near the root and less near the leaves .
Since the value of the terminal node had only two values ( i.e. , captured or escaped ) , alpha - beta pruning was very efficient ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
An eye evaluator was used to maintain information about eyes , half eyes ( eyes made in gote ) and quarter eyes ( eyes needing two moves to be made ) by evaluating small enclosed eyespace .
G2 recognised some basic dead shapes and various types of eyes including three in a row , four in a square , bulky five , pyramid , and cross .
Groups were determined by finding strings that were connected by unbreakable connections .
The tactical analyser tried to cut connections to test their strength .
Dead opponent strings could also be used as connections between live friendly strings .
Territory was determined by the territory evaluator .
As well as completely enclosed territory , G2 also evaluated territory near the board edge which did not need to be completely enclosed .
Territory could be made near the edge by being between a stone and the edge or a connection and the edge .
However , such territory could be challenged by a stone within four lines along the edge , and closer to the edge ( undercutting the edge ) .
The life and death evaluator analysed every group .
An aliveness value was assigned to each group by considering the number of liberties it had , its eyespace , the amount of territory it controlled , whether it could extend along the edge , its size , whether it was in contact with an enemy string , and whether it was completely surrounded .
The aliveness value rating itself had 20 different values including " has two eyes " , " has enough space to make two eyes " , " unsettled " , " not enough eyespace " , and " ca n't possibly make two eyes " .
The Move Selector
A rule - based strategic evaluator with 65 rules was used to select moves by choosing the highest scoring move using a two step process .
In the first step , strategic moves were evaluated and in the second step , all legal moves were evaluated .
Information from the data structures and the tactical analyser was used to evaluate board positions resulting from moves in both step one and two .
Fotland felt that this was the weakest component of G2 due to the weakness of the data structures ( Fotland , 1986 ) .
The rules suggested strategic moves to evaluate such as playing in an empty corner , make shimari or kakari , a move from the joseki dictionary , extending along an edge , invasions , contact fights , blocking , cutting , connecting , blocking an invasion on a wall , or making a ko threat .
In the first step , all the suggested strategic moves were evaluated .
A particular strategic move was hypothetically played and the resulting board position was evaluated .
The evaluation process consisted of assigning values to the board points and then summing them together to return an overall score .
The value for a given board point was determined by the aliveness value of the string that controlled it .
If the board position resulting from a strategic move did not satisfy the strategic goals associated with the rule that suggested it , the evaluation of the move was ignored .
In the second step , all legal moves ( including the strategic moves considered in the first step ) were evaluated .
The value assigned to a board position resulting from hypothetically playing a move was based on the aliveness , size , and amount of territory controlled by each string on the board .
The values that resulted for each move from step two were summed with the value they obtained if they were considered in step one .
The move with the overall highest score was then chosen as G2's next move .
Size , Performance and Timeline
Between 1981 and 1988 , Fotland spent around four years part time writing G2 .
He stopped work on G2 for several years because the available computers were not fast enough for the development of strong
Go programs ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
G2 was around 11000 lines of C code and used around 700 k for the code and data .
During that time , Fotland 's
Go skill advanced from 15 kyu to 1 dan .
G2 played at about the 25 - 20 kyu level and could beat beginners without much trouble ( Fotland , 1986 ) .
Fotland had some success at computer
Go competitions with G2 coming 4th in the world computer Go competition in Taiwan and 1st in the US computer Go championship in 1987 .
4.2.1.2 Cosmos
Fotland converted G2 into Cosmos in 1988 .
The main difference between Cosmos and G2 was that instead of evaluating all legal moves , only suggested moves were evaluated .
This transition was achieved by increasing the number of move suggestors to over 250 .
Quiescent search was added and the connection , eye , and territory evaluations were made more accurate ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
Data Structures
The data structures used in Comos were basically the same as those used in G2 .
The eye information included the number of eyes achievable in gote , the number of eyes achievable in sente , the number of eyes achievable if the opponent moved twice , a list of vital points , and eye type .
The information contained in the data structures was updated either incrementally ( e.g. , lists of liberties ) or after every move ( e.g. , influence ) .
Tactician
Essentially , Cosmos had the same tactician as G2 but better move generation and sorting .
In Cosmos , the tactician was only used to determine dead and threatened strings by trying to capture them .
Its parameters were maximum liberty count , maximum , depth , and maximum search size .
The maximum liberty count was 4 , and therefore as for G2 , strings with more than 4 liberties were assumed to avoid capture .
The maximum depth allowed was 100 .
The search size determined the playing level ( Stoutamire , 1991 ) and since forcing moves were not counted , ladders could be accurately read even at low playing levels .
Influence Function
Territory was determined by radiating positive influence from alive groups and negative influence from dead groups .
Radiated influence did not pass through stones or connections and was inversely proportional to distance .
Board Evaluation
Life and death of groups was the primary concern dealt with by the evaluation process .
Board positions were evaluated by a similar process to that used in G2 with the addition of quiescent search .
The tactician was used to determine dead and threatened strings ( those that could be captured if they moved second ) and whether the stones at the diagonal of eyes could be captured .
This information was useful in identifying unbreakable connections and forming strings into groups .
Eyes were analysed to determine their potential and then allocated to groups .
False eyes were identified by checking the diagonals of eyes and some dead shapes were also known by Cosmos .
Any group with enough eyespace to make two eyes was considered to be alive .
Potential eye space could be gained by extensions along the edge , possible connections , being adjacent to a threatened enemy group , and by controlling territory which was not already considered to be an eye .
There were 25 values that described a groups strength in terms of its life and death status .
The values were divided into five main categories which included very alive , alive , unsettled , weak and dead .
Determining the strength of a group included considering potential connections , potential eyes , and potential extensions along the edge .
Positive influence was radiated from alive groups and negative influence was radiated from dead groups with black and white influence being maintained separately .
Weak groups which were contacted by the influence from friendly alive groups were considered not to be surrounded .
Weak groups were further divided into those that could run and fight and those which would almost certainly die .
In general , board points were scored according to the radiated influence values .
However , occupied board points , board points adjacent to a stone and board points between a stone and an edge were scored differently .
Unsettled groups were scored according to who as to play next .
Move Selection
Cosmos had over 250 rules that suggested moves which included fuseki moves ( including shimari , kakari and joseki moves ) , edge moves , playing in the centre , playing safe when ahead of opponent , " squirming " around when behind opponent , pattern matching , saving weak friendly groups ( including making eyes , running , or fighting semeais ) , killing weak enemy groups , cutting , connecting , contact fights , ko threats , and filling dame .
Cosmos had a joseki library which contained around 5000 suggested joseki moves and a pattern database which had 60 patterns which were 5 x 5 in size .
Whenever a match was made , the rule ( code ) associated with the pattern was applied ( executed ) and would then suggest a move .
The addition of extra moves to be suggested could easily be accomplished by the addition of new move suggestor rules or the addition of patterns .
The rules would supply a guess value ( probable evaluation of the move ) , bonus value , minimum aliveness value , and would indicate which groups were being attacked or defended if any .
The moves were sorted by their guess values and , depending on playing level , a certain number were " played " .
Moves could be rejected before being evaluated if they did not " apply " .
A move applied if it accomplished what it was intended to do : if a move was intended to defend a group and the group ended up weaker than it started the move was rejected .
Surviving moves were awarded a sente bonus if they achieved sente .
The position resulting from the move was then evaluated .
The evaluation score , the sente bonus and the rule bonus were summed together and the highest scoring move was selected as the next move .
Size , Performance and Timeline
It took Fotland nine months to compress G2 down to 512 k and add a new user interface .
In 1988 Cosmos was released by Ishi Press for IBM - PC as Cosmos , The Computer Go Partner and was released a second time in 1989 .
Due to the amount of time spent on the user interface , Fotland was unable to devote sufficient time to improving Cosmos ' playing level and its performance in various world computer
Go championships was modest coming 8th in 1988 and 7th in 1989 ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
4.2.1.3 Many Faces of Go
After a rewrite of the user interface and addition of professional graphics and new features , Cosmos was released as The Many Faces of Go in 1990 .
Additions to MFG included a limited full board lookahead capability , consideration of the value of sente , and a strategy function which is used to focus attention on the important areas of the board and to identify urgent moves .
The number of patterns in both the joseki and pattern databases were increased .
The pattern database was also improved by increasing the pattern size from 5x5 to 8x8 , by storing many suggested moves for each pattern in a move tree ( rather than just one per pattern as for Cosmos ) , and by a complete rewrite which encompassed algorithms , code , and data structures and lead to an increase in speed ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
Data Structures
The dynamic data describing a board position is stored in three classes of data structures : incremental , locally recalculated , and globally recalculated .
The data in the incremental data structures is updated upon addition or removal of a stone and includes low level information such as lists of empty points , number of liberties etc .
Locally recalculated data is updated as it is needed i.e. , it is only updated for regions of the board which have been affected by a particular move or move sequence , and includes connection strength , and eyes .
Globally recalculated data is updated for the whole board and includes group strength and influence .
The locally and globally recalculated data structures are maintained by the evaluation function .
The dynamic data is stored globally and is generated progressively in several passes of increasing abstraction .
The dynamic data used in MFG includes point environment , string data , connection data , eye data , potential eye data , group data , territory , and score .
An instance of the connection data structure stores information pertaining to connectivity between two strings .
Each connection has a list connection points i.e. , a liberty of one string which is no more than three points away from the other string .
Thus , the connection recognised by MFG include hane , one point jump ( ikken tobi ) , knights move ( kogeima ) , two point jump ( nikken tobi ) , large knights move ( ogeima ) , three point jump , and bent three point .
Other special connections near the board edge are handled through the pattern database .
The data stored in the connection data structure includes the strings involved in the connection (s ) , the number of and lists of one , two and three point connections ( i.e. , as measured from the connection points ) , the type of each connection , and the strength of each connection ( e.g. , already cut , cuttable , shared connection , connected with aji , connected solidly ) .
Other than the type and strength data which is stored in a locally recalculated data structure , the connection data is stored in an incremental data structure .
The eye data structure records information pertaining to either a block of empty point or dead enemy strings which are partially or completely enclosed by friendly stones .
Data stored in the eye data structure includes colour , a list of the points in the eye , vital points , and eye type ( e.g. , one point , two point , line eye , big eye , and dead group eye ) .
The number of eyes ( to a resolution of 1/8 of an eye ) achievable under various conditions were recorded including the number of eyes if opponent moves twice , number of eyes if opponent moves next , and number of eyes if program moves next .
A board point can only be recorded as belonging to one eye .
The eye data structure is a locally recalculated data structure since eye data does not lend itself to incremental update .
In hindsight , Fotland says that a pattern based approach to recognizing eyes would be preferable ( Fotland , 1993 ) .
The evaluation of group strength and the generation of attacking and defending moves involves identifying potential eye space and running points .
The potential eye data structure contains type , value and location data for potential eyes .
An examples of data stored in the potential eye data structure is " extend along edge " ( type ) , value is number of new points of eye space , and location is the liberty to extend from .
Running points are stored by type ( e.g. , running towards friendly / unfriendly stones ) in several different lists .
Potential eyes and running points are stored in a globally recalculated data structure .
Tactician
Every string with three or less liberties and many strings with four liberties are read by the tactician .
Each string is read twice , once with White moving first and once with Black moving first .
The tactician determines whether a string is captured ( i.e. , can not live even if it moves first ) , threatened ( i.e. , it lives if it moves first and dies if it moves second ) , or stable ( i.e. , lives regardless of who moves next ) .
The tactician relies on simple heuristics concerned with the number of liberties and connectivity ; pattern matching is not used in the tactician .
The tactician has two separate move generators ; one to generate attacking moves and one to generate defensive moves .
The moves suggested by the move generators are sorted according to criteria which include second order liberties , cut points , and simple eye shapes .
Once sorted , an alpha - beta depth - first search is employed with the performance of the search depending on the quality of the move sorting ( Fotland , cgm1 5 Mar. 1993 ) .
Tactical searches are goal directed and are limited to a maximum number of nodes .
For string captures this is around 100 , however , when only one move is suggested , it is not counted towards the node limit .
In this way , ladders can be read without problems ( Fotland , cgm1 14 Oct. 1993 ) .
The number of nodes for a search are allocated to the branches according to the value given to the moves by the first ply move generator and thus different branches may end at different depths .
The branching factor at each successive ply is progressively constrained by the tactician .
The branching factor falls from five at the first ply to one or two by the fifth ply .
Since the data structures in MFG are separated into incremental , locally recalculated and globally recalculated , low level local tactical searches can be executed quickly by only updating the incremental data structures .
However , the possible goals of such a search are limited since the high level data structures are not recalculated .
It is not possible , for example , for MFG to search for x liberties and two eyes ( Fotland , cgm1 3 Nov. 1993 ) .
The tactician is used to read connections and eyes .
A cutting stone can be examined by the tactician to determine whether or not it will be captured .
Stones on the diagonal of eyes can be examined to determine whether they can be captured .
These types of search do not exceed around 12 ply since the program actually plays worse if more plies are considered ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
MFG uses caching to reduce the amount of time spent reading .
Since strings are read twice , tactical results related to eyes , capture or threat , and cuts are cached rather than re-evaluated .
Life and death analysis are cached as trees since they are smaller than the trees which would result from tactical searches ( Fotland , cgm4 16 Aug. 1994 ) .
Influence Function
The influence function radiates influence which is inversely proportional to distance .
Influence is radiated to a fixed maximum distance of nine although when lower playing levels are chosen , the distance is smaller .
Stones and connection impede the radiation of influence .
Black and White influence are radiated separately ( i.e , they are not summed together to give a single value for each board point ) so that their relative values can be compared .
Dead stones radiate negative influence and thus , since Black and White influence is maintained separately , dead stones reduce their own influence rather than increase their opponents influence .
The initial influence value radiated from a stone depends on its strength .
Influence is not used to determine group connectivity .
The use of influence in MFG includes determining thickness and territory , identifying surrounded groups , and generating moyo building or reducing moves .
Another way in which influence is used is to determine a group 's running ability .
A group 's ability to run towards a liberty depends on the relative values of friendly and unfriendly influence nearby .
The sum of a group 's ability to run toward each of its liberties determines its running ability whilst the gradient of the influence determines the direction in which it should run .
Evaluation
Board positions are evaluated in a multiple pass process .
The evaluation function consists of many components which include the tactical analyser and evaluators for connections , eyes , group strength , and territory .
A score for the position being evaluated is achieved by assigning a value between - 50 and +50 to each board point to indicate the level of Black or White control exerted on them .
The overall score for the board position is the sum of these values for each board point .
In order to try and overcome the difficulties associated with the horizon effect , Fotland chose to use quiescent search rather than modify the evaluation function .
In quiescent search , positions are evaluated when they become quiet rather than when they are in a state of flux ( e.g. , such as in the middle of a piece exchange in chess ) .
Positions which are not quiet are characterised by oscillations in the evaluation values returned for successive moves which makes it difficult to make good decisions based on the evaluations .
MFG uses quiescent search as part of the evaluation function for full board evaluation to overcome this problem by either calling itself recursively ( i.e. , generating further moves ) until a position becomes quiet or by using patterns suggested as obvious local answers to make the position quiet .
MFG will generate up to six plies of moves in a quiescent search which improves its performance by up to four stones ( Fotland , cgm1 30 Sep. 1993 ) .
Move Suggestion
Moves are suggested by a rule - based expert system and include fuseki ( e.g. shimari , kakari , and joseki moves ) , moves on the edge ( e.g. , invasions and extensions ) , playing in the centre , conservative play when ahead , risky play when behind , pattern matching ( e.g. , cutting and connecting , surrounding and escaping , invasion and defence , endgame , killing and saving groups , and shape - based moves ) , group defensive moves ( e.g. , making eyes , running , and fighting semeais ) , contact fights ( e.g. , blocking , extending for liberties , and hane ) , ko threats , and dame .
A limited form of full board lookahead is achieved by storing move sequences in the pattern and joseki databases .
Move sequences attached to patterns in the pattern and joseki databases are played onto the board and evaluated at their endpoints .
Thus if a particular joseki is suggested as appropriate , the stones in that sequence are played and the resulting board position is evaluated .
This enables MFG to " play " to the end of a lookahead sequence and minimax the score returned by the evaluation function for the resulting board position .
Pattern Database
Each pattern in the pattern database has a a move tree associated with it .
The pattern database contains around 1200 patterns of size 8x8 and around 6900 suggested moves with the average number of moves stored for each pattern being about 5 .
Each point in a pattern is marked as black , white , empty , white or empty , black or empty , black or white , or anything ( i.e. , do not care ) .
Patterns are categorised according to whether they are in the middle of the board or whether they contain edges and / or corners .
A successful match of a pattern depends on both matching the stones in the pattern with those on the board and matching any attributes associated with the pattern .
Each pattern has as many as 10 attributes which pertain to stones and include whether they were dead or alive , minimum number of liberties , and connectivity between stones .
To match over a 1000 patterns on a 19x19 board in 16 different orientations requires around 3 million primitive operations .
Since performance is a big issue , the patterns are compiled into a bit array which facilitates fast bit - parallel comparisons .
By using an 8 - bit hash function and bit - wise operations , the number of primitive operations is reduced to around 350000 .
This number of operations still takes enough time to make it too expensive to match all patterns more than once per move .
Patterns from the pattern database are evaluated after being played on the board in their entirety i.e. , they are evaluated at the endpoints of their move trees .
A small subset of patterns are used to read local sequences based on shape .
Fotland has recently begun evaluating the strength of one point jump connection using patterns ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
A fast pattern matcher is necessary for a strong Go program according to Fotland .
Pattern matching can be used to suggest and sort moves , and to classify connections and eyes .
Reading is employed to determine whether eyes are false .
Pattern matching on its own is not adequate for life and death and group strength determination ( Fotland , cgm1 8 Apr. 1993 ) .
The eye and connection patterns are hand coded decision trees .
One method that Fotland tried to increase the number of patterns in the pattern database was to take them from professional games .
When replaying a professional game , if MFG did n't consider the move played by a professional or the move played was low on the suggestion list , Fotland would manually cut-and - paste an 8x8 section from the game into the pattern database using a self - written graphics pattern database editor .
Fotland discontinued this method since most of the missed moves were tactical ( i.e. , based on read - out not shape ) or depended on a larger context than the 8x8 section that was placed in the pattern database .
Fotland found that the cut - and - paste approach to patterns was more profitable from even games played on the IGS ( Fotland , cgm1 13 Jan. 1994 ) .
Joseki Database
The joseki database contains around 45000 moves .
Joseki sequences are stored as directed acyclic graphs ( i.e. , they contain no loops ) having empty corners at their roots .
Moves in a joseki sequence can be one of several types including urgent , complex , trick , and bad .
The urgent move have priority whilst the complex and trick moves are only played if MFG is behind .
The bad moves are not for the program to play , rather they are used by the program to know how to respond to bad moves played by its opponent .
Joseki patterns are evaluated by being played on the board in their entirety and evaluating the resulting board position .
MFG selects joseki sequences that are appropriate given the status of the other corners ( Fotland , 1993 ) .
Strategy
A strategy function is used to focus attention on important areas of the board before each move ( Fotland , 1993 ) .
The dynamic data is examined to determine what phase the game is in , the relative score , the value of taking sente , and whether there are any urgent offensive or defensive moves that need to be made .
Urgent offensive and defensive moves are examined initially and if sufficiently urgent are played without any further considerations .
Urgent moves can be suggested by the pattern matcher or by examination of groups which are determined to need urgent attention .
Friendly groups which need urgent defence include big groups and cutting groups .
Opposition groups which need urgent attack include big groups , cutting groups , and groups adjacent to friendly groups needing urgent defence .
Move suggestion is affected by the phase that the game is in .
Certain rules will only fire in certain phases of the game .
The fuseki phase lasts until joseki sequences have been pursued in all the corners .
The middle game lasts until at least move 120 and MFG enters the end game when there are no unsettled groups on the board .
Transition between middle game and end game phases may occur many times during a game .
The types of moves suggested are also affected by the relative score .
MFG plays more conservatively when it is far ahead of its opponent and makes unsound invasions when it is far behind its opponent .
The relative score is classified into many states including " way ahead " ( over 40 points ) , " ahead ( 20 - 40 points ) , " about even " , " behind " ( over 10 points ) , and " way behind " ( over 20 points ) .
Move Selection
Since the evaluation function is very slow ( Fotland , cgm4 16 Aug. 1994 ) , a limit is placed on the number of full board evaluations which can be performed each move depending on the playing level .
MFG can only look at 5 to 10 moves in detail ( depending on playing level ) before selecting the move it finally plays .
A safeguard against errors in the evaluation function is that only reasonable moves are suggested for full board evaluation ( Fotland , 1993 ) .
By employing the strategy function , the move suggestion expert system , and the joseki and pattern databases , MFG fully examines a small number of moves , playing the one which receives the highest score from the evaluation function .
The score returned from a full board evaluation is also modified by the addition of sente if applicable .
Thus if MFG plays a sente move , the value of sente is added to the evaluation for the resulting position .
The value of sente varies from 7 points during the fuseki to 1 or 2 points in the endgame and is determined by the strategy function .
Size , Performance and Timeline
With some help from Ishi Press and a professional artist , Fotland rewrote Cosmos ' user interface and released it as MFG in 1990 .
Until the present time ( July 1996 ) , MFG has had 3 releases with various improvements .
MFG contains around 40000 lines of C code with around another 20000 lines of user interface code .
MFG has performed well in various world computer
Go championships including 4th in 1993 , 2nd in 1994 , and 3rd in 1995 .
According to Fotland , MFG gains about one stone in strength each year ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
MFG plays on both the IGS and the NNGS as ManyFaces .
MFG participates in the NNGS rating scheme and was rated 9 kyu ( as at July 1996 ) .
It was also awarded an 8 kyu diploma from the Nihon Ki-in in Japan based on its performance against a 1 dan amateur at 9 stones and a sample play against a professional in September 1995 ( Fotland , 1996 ) .
4.2.2 Go4 ++
Micheal Reiss started writing
Go programs in 1983 and his current program , Go4++ , has evolved from various predecessors over that time .
Reiss has met with some success in computer Go competitions and Go4++ came 2nd in both the 1st and 2nd FOST cups .
Reiss ' programming philosophy is to use simple algorithms on a large amount of data rather than complex algorithms on a small amount of data .
Go4++ calculates everything from first principles ; complex concepts are calculated from simpler concepts which are in turn functions of even simpler concepts .
Thus , Go4++ does not have an elaborate rule - based expert system at its core .
A positive consequence of this approach is that Reiss ' relatively weak ranking ( 2 kyu ) compared to other top
Go programmers is not a deficit .
It also means that Go4++ usually responds well to the strange moves ( by human standards ) that are quite often played by computer
Go programs and which are difficult to foresee when designing a rule - based system .
The major drawback of this approach is that it is computation intensive and requires a powerful computer .
At the foundation of Go4++ is a massive amount of connectivity data from which almost everything else is eventually derived .
Go4++ selects a move by first generating about 50 candidate moves that are analyzed by an evaluation function which estimates territory .
The move scoring the highest evaluation is played as the next move .
Thus , Go4++ uses 1 ply global lookahead although tactical lookahead and search is used in evaluating each move .
Candidate moves are generated by a process of pattern matching to determine the best 50 moves to examine in depth .
Go4++ has around 15 high level patterns which include terms for the probability of an eye , safety , and territorial value .
Whenever a match is made , the board point (s ) suggested as good places to play have an appropriate value added to them .
The 50 highest scoring board points are then examined by the evaluation function .
The board point which receives the highest score from the evaluation function is played as the next move .
In some circumstances , Go4++ effectively evaluates more than 50 candidate moves per turn .
Pattern matching is not applied to regions of the board where the stone safety ( see Stone Safety in section 4.2.2.2 ) and territory ( see Territory in section 4.2.2.2 ) do not differ from those of the previous move .
Thus after evaluating the 50 highest scoring board points after pattern matching , the next move is selected from the combined set of evaluation scores of the 50 board points just considered and the evaluation scores of any board points in the undisturbed regions which were considered during the selection of the previous move .
The evaluation function is a six step process : 1 . a connectivity probability map is generated , 2 . groups are determined , 3 . eye space is determined from which individual eyes are identified , 4 . the safety of each stone is determined , 5 . a radiation function combines the stone safety data and connectivity probability map to radiate safety to empty points , and 6 . territory is determined .
Reiss describes the evaluation function as pessimistic since whenever it is applicable , the evaluation function considers that the opponent is the next to move .
Connectivity Probability Map
Each time a hypothetical move is played on the board , a connectivity probability map for all friendly and opponent stones ( including the hypothetical stone ) is generated and stored .
The connectivity probability map for a stone contains the probability of connecting to nearby friendly stones already on the board or to an empty point if it was occupied by a friendly stone .
Stones and empty points which can be reached directly ( nobi ) , by a diagonal move ( kosumi link ) , a one point jump ( ikken - tobi link ) , a two point jump ( nikken - tobi link ) , a small knight 's move ( kogeima link ) , or a large knight 's move ( ogeima link ) are examined ( total of 32 possible points ) .
The probability of connecting two stones is calculated empirically by playing out the sequences of moves needed to determine whether the stones can be connected or whether the opponent can cut them .
This process requires the use of lookahead , particularly when ladders are generated by cutting moves ( e.g. , cutting a kogeima link generates two ladders , one for each cutting point ) .
If all possible cutting stones are captured , then the probability of connection is 100 % .
However , if the cutting stones can not be captured , a hand - tuned algorithm estimates the connection probability .
A massive amount of data is generated in calculating the probability map for each stone on the board for every hypothetical stone being evaluated .
The process is very computationally expensive and requires a powerful computer ( Go4++ currently runs on a Pentium - Pro 200 ) .
Group Determination
Stones and strings are catalogued into groups : any stones which are 100 % connected are considered groups .
A tactical search on all strings with less than 4 liberties is used to determine which strings are definitely dead .
Dead strings are not included as part of any group .
Eye Identification
Identifying eyes is achieved in a two step process : 1 . eye space is determined , and 2 . individual eyes are identified from the eye space .
A floodfill type algorithm is used to identify contiguous regions in which opponent connectivity probability is low .
Points in those regions whose 8 neighbouring points are mostly clear of opponent connectivity probability are considered to be eye space .
Individual eyes within a groups eye space are identified by shape .
There are several grades of eyes with the grade being a function of the opponent 's connectivity map .
Eyes with a grade above a certain level ( see Stone Safety below ) are considered to be true eyes .
Stone Safety
The safety of each group is determined by the number of true eyes it has .
The safety process is repeated 5 times ; each successive pass is more pessimistic about which points will eventually become true eyes ( i.e. , the threshold is raised for selecting which grade of eyes will eventually become true eyes ) .
The final safety value for a group is the average of its safety scores on each of the 5 passes .
Radiation Function
The safety value for each stone is radiated to the nearby empty points in proportion to the connectivity probability map for that stone .
The inverse of a stones safety ( 100 % - safety ) is radiated in the same manner and contributes to the opponents radiated value i.e. , dead stones radiated full opponent safety .
Black and white radiation ( including inverse radiation ) is summed at each empty point .
Territory
Black and white territory is estimated from the radiation values of the empty points .
The difference between black and white territory is returned as the evaluation of the hypothetical move for which it was generated .
Reiss '
Go skill has progressed from 10 kyu in 1987 to 4 kyu in 1992 to 2 kyu in 1996 .
Reiss has programmed full - time on Go4++ for about the last year ( 1996 ) and also programmed full - time for one and a half years around 1986 .
Other than for these two periods since starting
Go programming in 1983 , Reiss has programmed part - time with the most effort usually expended in the two months leading up to a competition .
There have been many commercial releases of Reiss ' programs by Oxford Softworks with another soon to follow .
Notable releases have been Go Player Professional and an updated windows version , Go Professional II , released in Japan .
Reiss characterized Go4++ as the weakest of the current strong programs at tactical situations requiring life and death analysis although it is good at creating moyos and gaining territory in the middle and endgame .
Since Go4++ tends to play well in the centre of the board , Prof .
Chen played 200 games against Go4++ in an attempt to test modifications to Handtalk which were designed at playing better in the centre .
According to Reiss , other weaknesses are the absence of global lookahead , lack of a concept of " shape " , and the reluctance of Go4++ to invade .
Since the evaluation function pessimistically considers that the opponent moves next during tactical searches , Go4++ does not usually evaluate the likelihood of invading stones forming eyes as being favourable .
To compensate for not invading well , Go4++ always plays it first move at the 3,3 point and also tries to live in as many places as possible to stop its opponent creating moyos early .
Reiss uses many empirically hand - tuned algorithms within Go4++ although no learning algorithms are used .
Carefully crafted changes to these algorithms can improve the strength of Go4++ e.g. , by making the connection algorithm more accurate , eye and territory evaluation also become more accurate , resulting in an increase in playing strength .
Before the 2nd FOST Cup in 1996 , Reiss tuned the performance of Go4++ by playing 700 test games against Handtalk , resulting in Handtalk 's only defeat during that competition .
4.2.3 Handtalk
Handtalk has been one of the strongest programs in recent years and is written by Zhixing Chen , a Chinese professor from the University of Guangzhou .
Although Handtalk becomes stronger each year and was awarded a 4 kyu diploma by the Nihon Kiin in 1996 , Prof .
Chen does not believe that Go programs will reach shodan by 2000 if shodan is taken at its international level ( 2 - 3 dan Japanese ) .
Details of the architecture and algorithms used by Prof .
Chen are not abundantly available .
Some of the details which have emerged from discussions that various people have had with Prof .
Chen at various competitions are provided below .
Handtalk is written completely in IBM - PC assembly language and is very small ( around 250k ) and very fast .
Only a very small number ( around 4 ) candidate moves are evaluated using a static evaluation function which seems to be accurate and stable .
Handtalk also uses an influence function whose influence decreases as 1/2 ^distance .
Handtalk does not use very much global search .
Pattern matching is used to some extent although i
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A giant lobster named George escaped a dinner - table fate and was released Saturday into the Atlantic Ocean after a New York seafood restaurant granted him his freedom , according to a statement from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
George the lobster was a " sort of mascot " for City Crab and Seafood in New York .
The lobster , which PETA said was 140 years old and weighed 20 pounds , had been confined to a tank at City Crab and Seafood restaurant in Manhattan when two customers alerted the animal group .
The PETA statement did not say how the extraordinary age estimate was determined , but restaurant manager Keith Valenti told CNN that lobsters can grow a pound every seven to 10 years , and he put George 's weight at 18 to 20 pounds .
" I 've been here for 12 years , and that 's the biggest lobster I 've ever seen , " Valenti said .
He said the lobster had been " sitting in the restaurant 's tank and acting as a sort of mascot , " but when PETA got involved and requested the release , it " seemed like the right thing to do . "
PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement , " We applaud the folks at City Crab and Seafood for their compassionate decision to allow this noble old - timer to live out his days in freedom and peace .
" We hope that their kind gesture serves as an example that these intriguing animals do n't deserve to be confined to tiny tanks or boiled alive . "
Shedding the tight confines of his old restaurant display tank , George was driven to Maine by PETA members and was returned to his natural habitat on the ocean floor Saturday , the organization said .
All About PETA • Marine Animals
MY LOVE OF Polaroid began in 1962 when I met photographer Nicholas Dean at the Grolier bookstore in Harvard Square .
He worked at Polaroid as a technical researcher , and part of his job was to test new films .
On his lunch hour and after work , he would drop by the store , then as now a destination for poets , and take pictures of anyone who was hanging around .
They were were black - and - white photos .
Peel apart , with a stick of preservative to fix the image from the ravages of light .
In 1964 , I moved into an apartment building where a Polaroid original , Dr. Cutler DeLong West , who started to work in crystallography with Edwin Land before Polaroid was even called Polaroid , lived on the first floor .
West rode his beat - up bike to Polaroid every day , ate all his meals in the company cafeteria , and exuded the Polaroid legend of mad scientist .
The Polaroid camera was my generation 's iPod , our BlackBerry , our GPS , our Kindle - that piece of technology that wows and then becomes an extension of the hand .
And Dr. Land , always called Dr. although he did n't have his PhD , was our Steve Jobs .
He was a brilliant scientist who got Ansel Adams , Marie Cosindas , and Walker Evans to use his instant cameras with panache .
In the late 1970s came a huge technological innovation : color instant film and a new model camera that was designed for it : the SX70 .
The seventh wonder of the world , many called it .
The film pack had a battery in it so that the camera could eject the image from the film pack .
And there was nothing to peel apart .
The picture developed in its thin packet within 60 seconds .
The camera folded up flat .
The camera I still use , the refrigerator - sized Polaroid 20 - by - 24 - inch Land Camera , was made to show off the charms and possibilities of the new color film .
Land wanted to see how big he could make an instant camera .
Getting the chemicals to spread evenly so as to transfer the image , from the negative to the positive , and to develop in 80 seconds , was a technological tour - de - force .
My love affair with the 20 - by - 24 was instantaneous .
The color of the film I used , called P3 , was soft and the images seemed three - dimensional .
I loved the gravitas of the camera and its simplicity : really a grandly enlarged cereal box with a hole in the front to let in light , and the Polaroid transfer mechanism in the back to catch the light .
And there was something mystical about the fact I had to get on my knees to manually pull the packet of negative , chemical pod , and positive out of the camera .
And then the world shifted .
Polaroid announced recently it would no longer manufacture instant film .
No two photographers can get together without talking about Polaroid .
What happened ?
It 's hard to get past the disappointment and anger - the harsh reality - that Polaroid film is gone .
It is beyond belief that Polaroid sold - for scrap !
- the machines that made the film , that it let the inventory of chemicals dwindle .
Some people say it goes back to Dr. Land and his brilliant scientist / marketer / businessman dichotomy .
Many say it was the lawsuit between Polaroid and Kodak , which ate up time , money , attention .
Had n't Land heard of licensing his technology ?
Some say it was the Polaroid culture .
Others say Polaroid could have survived if management and shareholders were content with a small profit rather than a huge pre-bubble profit .
Many ask :
With all the MBAs our country churns out , how come someone had n't learned how to save Polaroid ?
Did digital , even though it does n't give you an instant image to hold , make the end inevitable ?
In the end , each person has her or his own list of villains .
At the top of my list is Polaroid 's latest owner , Tom Petters of Minnesota , credited with selling the machines for scrap , dismantling the company , deciding all he wanted was Polaroid 's brand name .
I take cold and sad comfort that Petters , after ruining Polaroid , was indicted by the US Department of Justice , and is now awaiting trial , accused of conducting a 12 - year Ponzi scheme .

Other Van Halen News : Janie Liszewski Marriage , New Album
Eddie Van Halen has also revealed plans to marry his girlfriend and publicist Janie Liszewski this coming summer .
He also tells Rolling Stone he hopes to start recording Van Halen ’s first studio album in over a decade later this year .
It ’d be the first Van Halen album with David Lee Roth in 25 years .
For Indiana Jones , his various allies and his rivals , the keys to the past lie in a variety of repositories , some more mundane than others .
Some are as commonplace as a compilation of clues kept in a handwritten diary that eventually lead to the resting place of the Holy Grail .
Others are as exotic as the headpiece of a staff inscribed with instructions for building a decoder that , when used in just the right place at just the right time , allows you to find just the right place to dig for a lost treasure ( provided , of course , you have the whole inscription ) .
Sometimes even a tiled floor is where " X " , literally , marks the spot .
But never in the course of three — and soon to be four — feature films did scraping a tooth lead Jones to riches and rewards or even to solve scientific mysteries literally millions of years old .
While likely he could n't vouch for the riches , Matt Sponheimer , an NSF - funded bioarchaeologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder , argues that the intellectual effort of analyzing the chemical make - up of the teeth of early human ancestors has struck scientific pay dirt .
Matt Sponheimer , an NSF - funded bioarchaeologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder , argues that the intellectual effort of analyzing the chemical make - up of the teeth of early human ancestors has struck scientific pay dirt .
" What is truly surprising is that we may be able to discover how creatures moved across African landscapes 1.8 million years ago using this technique , " he said .
Of course Sponheimer , who seems quite familiar with the Indiana Jones saga , would be the first to concede that Jones would have been greatly hampered , even if he'd wanted to try this kind of thing because the laser , which is central to Sponheimer 's work , was not yet even so much as a ruby - red gleam in scientists ' eyes early in the 20th century , when the films are set .
" That , to me , is the story , " he says .
" It 's not so much about the early results , but what they reveal about the potential of the technique .
Indie would have been in this classroom saying that speculations about such ancient behaviors are not part of archaeology , because they 're not based on fact . "
Sponheimer , on the other hand , may help to change dramatically , science 's view of how early humans spent their lives with information stored in fossilized teeth from the dawn of time .
It is both a technological and archaeological challenge .
" Essentially what you 're doing is analyzing the isotopic composition of these teeth , " he says .
Upon reflection , he pauses and simplifies , " What we 're doing is shooting the teeth with a laser beam that removes the tiniest bit of material , material that is more or less invisible to naked eye . "
And that 's what he studies .
Contained in the material that the laser pares away are strontium isotopes , or different forms of the element strontium , a chemical found in plants .
The particular isotopes present in plants match up to the particular geographic location where the plants thrived and , most important , were also absorbed into the developing teeth of a young animal that ate the plants .
Because tooth formation takes place early in an animal 's life , it is possible to compare where animals ranged when they were young to where the teeth were recovered when they died .
And because the new technique causes minimal damage to teeth and early hominin teeth are so rare ( " They 're a hell of a lot rarer than diamonds , " Sponheimer notes ) , the laser sampling is an important advance over prior methods that caused significant damage to the fossilized rarities .
Comparing isotopic maps made in the field in Africa with the isotopic compositions of fossilized teeth in South Africa 's Transvaal Museum has allowed Sponheimer and colleagues to investigate migration patterns and other behaviors of these important human evolutionary relatives for the first time .
Except for modern - day Homo sapiens , the hominins are extinct .
But , scientists believe that understanding hominin behavior is essential to understanding the path of human evolution .
Land-use and movement patterns are essential to such studies , but have historically been almost impossible for anthropologists to track , millions of years after the fact .
The findings from the strontium isotope analysis suggest that most of the hominins spent their early lives in the same geological area on which they died , and probably did not move great distances .
They may also shed light on the long - debated question of whether or not these hominins followed a pattern similar to that of today 's chimpanzees , where males stay with their social groups and females find homes elsewhere .
The initial results are intriguing , he says , but he 's not ready to reveal them quite yet .
" We 'll be publishing these results soon , and we 're all entitled to a bit of mystery , however short - lived , " he says .
What makes this so important to the field , Sponheimer adds , is that it may ultimately provide physical evidence to support a previous conjecture , one way or another .
" In the past , there was no window into this kind of behavior , " he notes .
The new technique " opens that window to behaviors that we simply could not investigate in the past . "
Such great leaps forward in technology and in scientific techniques have changed the archaeological landscape forever so that we can now answer questions that early archaeologists , including the fictional Indiana Jones , would have considered insoluble , he says .
" Unlike Indiana , we do n't have whips and guns , " Sponheimer points out .
" But we have an archaeological record out there .
It 's got a story , we have to learn to make it speak and we have this tool , which is science , to do that .
We can now answer questions that would have been relegated to the fantasy bin years ago . "
Breaking the Spell is a 1999 anarchist documentary , directed by Tim Lewis , Tim Ream , and Sir Chuck A. Rock .
Using amateur camera footage recorded by protesters at the scene of the 1999 WTO riots , it documents the riot from the perspective of the anarchists , their opinions of fellow protesters , local politicians , and includes footage which aired nationally on 60 Minutes .
The film is currently distributed by CrimethInc. on the CrimethInc. Guerilla Film Series , Volume One DVD .
A pedestrian was struck by a sport utility vehicle on a street in Corona , Queens , on Wednesday morning , then immediately struck again by a cargo van that dragged the victim 17 miles through a web of city highways and to Coney Island in Brooklyn , the police said .
The pedestrian , apparently a male , was killed .
The victim had not yet been identified , though some paperwork was found in the clothing on his body , which was wedged under the van ’s chassis , the police said .
The authorities said there did not appear to be any criminality involved .
A cadre of uniformed police officers was retracing the van ’s route , searching for pieces of the victim ’s remains , Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said .
The chain of events began at 6 a.m. in the vicinity of 51st Avenue and 108th Street in Corona , and ended about an hour later at Neptune Avenue and Brighton 10th Terrace in Coney Island , the police said .
Police investigators said the driver who struck the pedestrian stopped immediately and dialed 911 .
But officers who went to the scene did not find a body .
The driver of the second vehicle — the red cargo van — later told the police that he saw vehicles in traffic ahead of him swerving , and that he believed they were trying to avoid a pothole .
It is likely they were trying to steer around the accident or around the victim lying in the road , the police said .
The second driver later told investigators that he kept driving , but that he stopped at some point to check his vehicle because something seemed to be wrong with it .
“ He apparently felt something , ” Mr. Kelly said .
“ The car was not driving in a normal fashion . ”
Seeing nothing unusual , however , the driver continued on his journey .
He drove along the Grand Central Parkway , then headed south on the Van Wyck Expressway and then west on the Belt Parkway .
When he exited in Brooklyn , others began flagging him down to tell him he was dragging something .
Witnesses who saw the red cargo van parked in Coney Island said they saw the body under it .
David Steinberg , 24 , who lives at the corner of Brighton 10th Terrace and Coney Island Avenue , said he was awakened by sirens around 7:15 a.m .
He looked out his window and saw a red Chevrolet minivan , parked on Coney Island Avenue , facing north .
A body was sticking out from the front end of the car — parallel to the car , the head and shoulders protruding from beneath front bumper .
When the police pulled back the white sheet covering the body , Mr. Steinberg said , he saw a middle - aged man with olive skin and dark hair .
He was shirtless and lifeless , lying face up .
“ His color looked off — he looked pale and cold , ” Mr. Steinberg said somberly .
Mr. Steinberg said he saw the driver , wearing a winter cap and jacket and looking tired and shocked , being questioned by police officers .
Mr. Steinberg said he had often seen the van parked on his block .
“ It was pretty freaky , ” Mr. Steinberg said .
“ It ’s really unfortunate . ”
Lannon Unick , 21 , came out of her house at 8:15 to find the gruesome scene .
“ It scared the hell out of me , ” she said .
She said she recognized the minivan as belonging to a man who had worked for the Cancun Express car service , across the street on Coney Island Avenue .
She said she had ridden in the man ’s vehicle three or four times when she was running late to go to her job at a bank in Bay Ridge .
Ms. Unick said the car service closed a couple of weeks ago ; the metal gate was pulled down in front of the business , and duct tape covered the phone number and other information on the awning .
“ He was a decent guy , ” Ms. Unick said of the driver , saying he had a son who lived in Queens .

The victim was identified on Thursday , and a video was released .

A classic Bugatti car , which gathered dust in a Tyneside garage for half a century , has been sold for 3.4 m euros ( £ 3 m ) at an auction in Paris .
Bonhams had listed lot 17403 as a " motoring icon " with an engine that has not been fired up for 50 years .
Relatives of reclusive Newcastle doctor Harold Carr found the 1937 Type 57S Atalante in a garage after he died .
It was originally owned by Earl Howe - first president of the British Racing Drivers ' Club .
Just 17 were built .
' True supercar '
Bonhams tempted bidders by writing in its sales description : " The new owner will have the pleasure of firing up [ engine ] 26S and hearing that turbine - like sound that so excited Earl Howe when he collected this car from Sorel in 1937 .
The 1937 Bugatti gathered dust in a garage for 47 years .
Pic Bonhams
" Once again [ chassis ] 57502 , a true supercar with impeccable credentials , emerges to take its place on the world stage . "
Earl
Howe took delivery of the sporty two - seat Atalante after it was completed in 1937 and kept the car for eight years .
After Earl
Howe sold it , it changed hands a couple of times before Dr Carr bought the car in 1955 from Lord Ridley , a member of the Northumberland gentry .
Dr Carr drove it until 1960 when he parked it in his garage - to be discovered after he died in 2007 .
The car has a remarkably low mileage with an odometer reading of just 26,284 .
It eventually sold for 3,417,500 euros ( £ 2,989,495 ) .
The Bugatti 57S is a highly coveted car by collectors , with at least four thought to belong to the Musee Nationale de L'Automobile in Mulhouse , France .
Others remain in the hands of private collectors .
NO MORE BUBBLE BOY ….
At an event in Elkhart , Indiana , today , an audience member asked President Obama , “ You have come to our county and asked us to trust you , but those that you have appointed to your cabinet are not trustworthy and cannot handle their own budget and tax issues .
I ’m one of those who thinks you need to have a beer with Sean Hannity , so tell me why , from my side … ”
As my friend Alex Koppelman noted , when the questioner elicited boos , the president intervened , silenced the crowd , and said the woman raised a legitimate question .
After addressing the substance , Obama joked :
“ Now , with respect to Sean Hannity , I did n’t know that he had invited me for a beer .
But I will take that under advisement .
Generally , his opinion of me does not seem to be very high .
But , uh , but I ’m always good for a beer . ”
Now , it ’s always good when a public official can defuse tension with a little humor , and I ’m very glad Obama defended the woman ’s right to ask a confrontational question .
But reading about this , another angle comes to mind : since when can critics of the president attend public events and ask unscreened questions ?
Apparently , as of about 20 days ago .
Throughout George W. Bush ’s presidency , White House staffers implemented what were generally called “ Bubble Boy ” policies .
The goal was to shield the former president from those who may have disagreed with him or might ask him questions he did n’t want to answer .
The anti-dissent policy was often taken to comical lengths , including blocking people from attending public events based on their bumper stickers , requiring loyalty oaths for tickets , and in at least one instance , rehearsing a town - hall meeting a day in advance .
In contrast , consider Obama ’s approach to diversity of thought .
The new president traveled to an economically - depressed community that voted heavily for his opponent in November .
Tickets to the event were publicly available to anyone , no loyalty oaths or Democratic fealty required .
White House staffers did n’t check bumper - stickers for conservative messages , and there was no “ blacklist ” of Republicans who would be denied entry .
There were no hand - picked questions and no hand - picked questioners .
So this is what it ’s like to have a president with the courage of his convictions , and the confidence to talk to Americans who may disagree with him .
I ’d almost forgotten .
Los Gatos , Calif .
I ’M the chief executive of a publicly traded company and , like my peers , I ’m very highly paid .
The difference between salaries like mine and those of average Americans creates a lot of tension , and I ’d like to offer a suggestion .
President Obama should celebrate our success , rather than trying to shame us or cap our pay .
But he should also take half of our huge earnings in taxes , instead of the current one - third .
Then , the next time a chief executive earns an eye - popping amount of money , we can cheer that half of it is going to pay for our soldiers , schools and security .
Higher taxes on huge pay days can finance opportunity for the next generation of Americans .
Clearly , the efforts over the past few decades to control executive compensation have n’t accomplished much .
Improved public disclosure was supposed to shame companies into lowering salaries , and it obviously has n’t worked .
In 1993 , President Bill Clinton changed the tax law to effectively cap executives ’ salaries at $ 1 million a year , but that simply drove corporate boards to offer larger bonuses and stock options to attract and keep talent .
More recently , “ say on pay ” proposals would have shareholders opine on their boards ’ compensation decisions , but “ say and pay ” wo n’t change the fact that luring a top executive away from another company is never easy or cheap .
The reality is that the boards of public companies hate overpaying for anything , including executives .
But picking the wrong chief executive is an enormous disaster , so boards are willing to pay an arm and a leg for already proven talent .
Putting limits on the salaries at public companies , or trying to shame them into coming down , wo n’t stop this costly competition for talent .
Adult Swim hired the incredible , Bill Sienkiewicz ( Elektra : Assassin ) , to do the dvd cover art for a show called The Venture Bros – which comes out Feb 23rd .
Sienkiewicz work is few and far between so I ’ll take what I can get .
If you ’re planning on higher education , prepare your billfolds to be swiped clean by the cost of tuition , hidden fees , living expenses , and textbooks .
Over the past few years , American publishers have driven the cost of textbooks to outrageous amounts , handing over a sure financial blow to already insolvent students .
Claire Suddath of Time reported in her article , “ Outsourcing the Textbook , ” that according to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance , “ U.S. textbook prices rose 186 % between 1986 and 2004 , or twice the rate of inflation . ” ( Suddath , Time )
As unscrupulous as college textbook price gouging is , there is an alternative if you ’re strapped for cash .
The same college textbooks are published by different companies all over the world to give equal opportunity for education in other countries .
The international edition textbooks are published at lower costs to be sold overseas and are available to purchase by any interested foreign or domestic buyer via the Internet .
What ’s the Difference : International vs. U.S. Editions
The content in international edition textbooks is exactly the same as their U.S. counterparts .
Some inconsiderable differences may be found in a lower quality of paper , the use of only black and white ink , and a paperback cover rather than a hard cover .
Also , supplemental material such as CDroms , etc. , may not be included with an international edition .
Aside from the material differences , the most significant is the pricing distinction .
Abebooks.com for instance , lists “ Biology with MasteringBiology , ” 8th Edition by Neil A. Campbell and Jane B. Reece for $ 59.69 as opposed to its $ 178.20 list price .
“ Introduction to Quantum Mechanics , ” by David J. Griffiths is $ 1.00 on Abebooks.com .
Its list price : $ 129.33 .
These books are listed as brand new , some in color , with the original packaging .
With shipping around $ 30 , you are still saving an exceptional amount of money , rather than buying books from the school bookstore .
Is Purchasing International Edition Textbooks Legal ?
Most sites offering the purchase of international textbooks by U.S. buyers will warn their purchasers that publishers of international editions do not authorize the sale and distribution of these books in the U.S. and Canada as it is an infringement of copyright and trademark laws .
Does this mean that it is illegal to purchase international edition textbooks ?
No .
Purchasing from international distributors or grey market importing is a legal form of commerce .
The dissimilarity is that grey market imports are unofficial and unintended by the manufacturer .
Tips On Ordering International Edition Books
There are many sites that offer the purchase of IE textbooks as the website mentioned above .
When you are searching for certain textbooks , make sure you have the following information :
Title
Author
IBSN number
Check for any revised or new additions and also ask the distributor before you place your order if any supplemental material comes with the textbook .
Also , because you are placing an international order , be sure to allow plenty of time to ship , at least eight weeks .
It may be wise to select more expedited shipping .
It is also best to order multiple books from the same bookseller .
This will help you save time and money , the things that are hard to come by .
The Perils Of Pet Food Update : March 29 , 2010
We now recognize that we are playing Russian Roulette with our pets ' lives with every serving of commercial dog and cat food .
It takes longer to read the list of recalled foods than it does to whip up a batch of homemade dog food or put down raw turkey or chicken meat from a plastic package for cats .
It does n't matter if the products claim to have " natural , organic or wholesome ingredients " because dogs and cats have not evolved enough to flourish on artificial nutrients and you can't put real food in a bag , can or pouch .
We know that the pet food manufacturers are self - regulated , we know that they are using substandard and nonfood products , we know that they have to add artificial nutrition and chemical flavor enhancers and we know that every year , 50 % of all the dogs and cats in the USA die from cancer !
The facts are in .
Read about the brave whistle blowers and help me spread the word to all the dog and cat owners in the world so that we can force the pet food manufacturers to produce real food products .
They would all have to be frozen and there would n't be any more bags of dry kibble -- I 'm dreaming , are n't I ?
Some dogs and cats beat the odds and live a happy , full life .
I had a kitty who beat the odds and lived to 22 but studies have shown us that cats are genetically programed to live to 25 .
For the most part , we see our pets dying too young and having the following problems that we take for granted : allergies -- high levels of artificial additives trigger imbalance arthritis -- from the high build up of artificial calcium deposits cancer -- Colorado State University states : Cancer is the number one natural cause of death in geriatric cats and dogs , and it accounts for nearly 50 percent of pet deaths each year .
bladder problems -- from high toxicity dental problems -- the mouth is an indicator of bad diet diarrhea -- a symptom of unwanted toxins passing through the large intestine diabetes -- too much sugar in the pet foods causes pancreatic problems digestive problems -- a dog or cat can't drink enough water to compensate for eating dry processed food ; their systems are n't designed to consume high amounts of grains , husks and foreign matter such as saw dust , beaks , feathers , feces which causes problems in the stomach , liver , kidneys and intestines gastric bloat -- caused by commercial kibble expanding in the dog's stomach often causing the stomach to flip which is gastric torsion hyperthyroidism / hypothyroidism -- caused by elevated levels of liver and adrenal enzymes kidney problems -- can be caused by artificial phosphorus and proteins in commercial foods liver problems -- the liver is the body 's main detoxifier and bears the brunt of low - grade food , synthetic drugs and environmental pollutants obesity -- caused by high sugar and carbohydrate levels in commercial foods skin problems -- the first place the body tries to reject toxins is through the skin Just One Of The Perils Of Commercial Cat Foods Cats are susceptible to Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex ( EGC ) , a group of skin lesions that can be caused by an allergic reaction to food .
EGC is commonly called Lick Granuloma .
This is a recent disorder that began shortly after we started feeding our cats imitation food out of bags and low - quality cooked food from cans .
Read more about it at PetPlace.com .
Cats MUST eat raw meat to be healthy and they can't get that out of a bag or a can .
Only from raw meat can they naturally process the amino acid , taurine , that is essential to their system .
Artificial taurine is added to virtually every commercial cat food ever since 1976 when Science Diet discovered that cats were getting sick from eating their food .
Artificial taurine is starting to cause more problems with the skin and eyes .
My beloved Mrs. McGillykitty has had funny lumps in her mouth since she was a kitten and we thought at first that she was getting stung by bees in the yard .
She started having tooth and gum decay at a very young age but that 's what happened to all my cats and I thought it was " normal " .
Gilly frequently had her teeth cleaned under full anesthesia and has had most of her teeth removed .
I have always bought the most expensive , veterinarian - recommended , so - called ' organic ' dry cat food and spent a fortune in vet bills for kidney , skin and dental problems .
My head was in the sand ...
In this photo of Gilly 's mouth , you can see that her chin is distended and swollen and her throat has festering sores .
She only has 3 ½ teeth but can eat raw , ground turkey easily .
The best way to prevent Lick Granuloma is to feed cats RAW food .
This is also the only way to prevent kidney problems , skin irritations , diabetes , cancer , hairballs , and dental problems .
I started homefeeding all my kitties raw , ground turkey ( see CATS ) more than three years ago and within minutes I saw improvement in their physical and mental health , especially Gilly's .
However , I 've discovered , the hard way , that you can't poison a cat for 9 years and expect them to be cured even when you start feeding them correctly .
( As of April 15 , 2007 , I can say that Gilly has been in remission for more than a year without serious flairups . )
My newest cat , Popoki , has never been fed commercial cat food .
He has a hard body like panther , a coat so glossy that he glows in the moonlight , perfect teeth and an amazing attitude .
Cats who are fed a raw diet are not as susceptible to fleas , ear mites or other pesky parasites .
They have a better chance of living a longer life according to their genetic code .

Chase CEO says ' stupid things were done by American banks , ' as bankers lose Davos clout Jeremy Gantz
Published : Saturday January 31 , 2009
Print This Email This JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon is telling a world grappling with the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression what it wants to hear :
 I take full blame for all the American banks and all the things they did ,  Dimon said during a panel on leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland Thursday .
Dimon , whose company received $ 25 billion from last October 's federal " bailout " legislation , said he knows that 's what people would like to hear , Bloomberg reported .
 God knows , some really stupid things were done by American banks ,  Dimon said Thursday .
But the 52 - year - old banker , who oversaw his company 's acquisition of failing U.S. banks Washington Mutual and Bear Sterns last year , also wondered where Washington 's policy makers were while U.S. banks were laying groundwork for the ongoing meltdown .
" Where were they ?
They approved all these banks ,  Dimon said .
Dimon was the only head of a major U.S. financial institution to attend the annual conference this year , according to Bloomberg .
That 's a break from Davos tradition : in the past , the world 's elite business leaders dispensed economic wisdom while political leaders often remained in the background .
" The number of VIP politicians is huge , and it's a lot less bankers this year , " said Rainer Ohler , senior vice president of Airbus SA .
" What you are missing really is the top shots in banking . "
Heads of state , now doing their best to hold the world economy together , have taken center stage at Davos .
Russia 's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Mexican President Felipe Calderon are a few of the more than 40 heads of state in Davos this year , the Associated Press reported .
Many of those political -- and financial -- leaders are scared stiff by the specter of U.S. protectionism .
Last week , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a " Buy American " measure -- part of the massive $ 819 billion stimulus package -- that would generally prohibit the purchase of foreign iron and steel for any infrastructure project in the bill .
" Everybody here [ at Davos ] is talking about protectionism .
There 's not a prime minister present not talking about protectionism , " said Peter Sutherland , former ( GATT ) trade chief and now chair of British Petroleum .
Outside the conference , hundreds protested the Davos forum and clashed with police .
Sixty people were arrested after hundreds of protestors converged on the centre of Geneva to protest against the World Economic Forum in Davos in defiance of a ban imposed by local authorities , a Davos police spokesman said .
That was after bottles and firecrackers were thrown at the riot police who charged the demonstrators , using teargas grenades .
A group of several dozen protestors marched through the snow - covered Alpine village , holding a giant banner that read " You Are The Crisis . "
With wire reports .
" This year is on the heels of two previous critically dry years , and this is the third year in a row , " Wirth said , adding that the zero- percent projection affects only the agency 's agricultural service contractors .
Today 's announcement was the agency 's initial water allocation projection for 2009 , and Wirth said officials were hopeful the allocations could be increased if there is more precipitation .
It marks the first time in 17 years that the Federal Bureau of Reclamation has announced that it does not have enough water to fulfill its agricultural contracts to parts of the Central Valley , including about 3 million acres of farmland typically irrigated by the agency .
In addition to 1992 , the agency also announced a zero- percent supply for agriculture in 1977 .
In both 1992 and 1977 , the water supply eventually increased to 25 % of the contracts , agency spokesperson Lynnette Wirth said .
Federal officials announced today that they may not be able to provide the agricultural water supply to more than 200 water districts in the Central Valley for the upcoming growing season " unless things begin to improve . "
According to a dry forecast projection released by the agency , agriculture contracts north and south of the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta would receive zero percent allocation while municipal and industrial groups would receive 50 % of their contracts in the same area .
Refuges and people under " water rights " contracts are projected to receive 75 % of their contracts , Wirth said .
Tom Birmingham , general manager of the Westlands Water District , which has the largest contract with about 1.2 million acre-feet of water delivered by the federal agency , issued a statement in response to the projection , describing a water crisis already underway .
" Farmers in the Westlands Water District have already begun destroying thousands of acres of almond orchards and plan on fallowing over 300,000 acres of land .
Wherever possible , almond production will be stunted in hopes of keeping the trees alive through this desperate time .
But there is no question that many years worth of investments will be lost , " he said in the statement .
" In Westlands , the crisis is well underway , " he continued .
" Cropping decisions have already been made .
Fields are being abandoned .
The unemployment rate in the community of Mendota alone has soared to 40 % . "
The state Department of Water Resources announced today that it would be able to allocate only 15 % supply to each of its contractors .
" Reduced deliveries will require contractors to rely on dry water year contingency plans to meet their needs .
If precipitation were to increase and hydrologic and reservoir conditions improve , it is possible the allocation could rise in coming months , " water resources officials said in a statement .
Laura King Moon , assistant general manager of State Water Contractors , a nonprofit association of 27 public agencies across California that buys water from the state , said " the drought has simply drawn the regulatory noose a little tighter . "
The SWC delivers water to more than 750,000 acres of farmland and to more than 25 million California residents .
" Water agencies up and down the state will be forced to adopt increasingly restrictive water management approaches , including mandatory conservation , rationing and rate hikes , " Moon said in statement .
" We need to move forward as quickly as possible with a proactive , comprehensive approach to protect fish as well as the water supply people depend on . ”

An early release of Microsoft 's uber - popular web browser Internet Explorer version 8 ( IE8 ) is now available for download .
The Redmond - based company boasts that it's the safest and most secure browser ever constructed , and has included several new features meant to protect users against even the most innovative hacker attacks .
As expected , Microsoft has simply added yet another digit to its browser , dubbing this one simple " IE8 " .
There are a number of good reasons to invest precious download minutes in Internet Explorer 8 ; at the top of the list is a special new feature meant to protect against something called a " clickjacking " attack .
That 's where a hacker sneakily slides a little link into a web page , which upon clicking leads an unsuspecting web surfer to a malicious file download .
It 's a whole new method of making Internet browsing a pain in the butt , and Microsoft claims IE8 has it beat early on .
Superseding a ClickJack : How so ?
According to Microsoft , IE8 allows web sites to protect their users without forcing anyone to download a nagging browser add - on .
Although the idea does make web sites more secure , security companies have already pointed out that if a web site does n't employ the feature it wo n't do the user any good .
" It does n't protect consumers , " said Robert Hansen , a prominent web security researcher .
" It only protects Websites that know about the header and output the header on the pages they want to protect . "

Thankfully , Microsoft 's new features do n't stop there .
XSS Filter : Anti-malware Detector
Internet Explorer 8 also has something called an XSS Filter , meant to detect whether or not a suspected web site is infected with spyware / malware .
Security gurus are , thus far , much more impressed with this little tool .
Serving a similar function is the SmartScreen filter , and InPrivate browsing , which basically wipes out cookies and temporary Internet files from the browser history .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Also new are features meant to limit the abilities of phishers and anyone interested in using code to write to executable memory space .
Although it does n't appear to be the perfect web browser quite yet , Microsoft appears ready to once again equip users for their perilous journeys across the webosphere .

Britain and the U.S. use similar tactics fighting ' terrorism , ' but Britain has taken the delusions to a new level : it now appears that the British have surpassed U.S. in becoming a police state .
Like the U.S. version of George Orwell 's book " 1984 , " Britain 's descent into a full - fledged police state has been building for a long time .
We 've reported on Britain 's super database , remote PC searching and the warnings issued over the egregious surveillance techniques , but there are still other facts to be examined .
Spying On Domestic Extremists and Political Dissenters
The British have set up a secret police unit to spy on British ' domestic extremists , ' or left - wing and right - wing political groups .
According to the Daily Mail , the Confidential Intelligence Unit ( CIU ) has the power to operate across the U.K. and will mount surveillance to build a detailed picture of radical campaigners .
According to the Daily Mail UK , " the CIU will also use legal proceedings to prevent details of its operations being made public . "
( Source : dailymail.co.uk )
The British government has not learned that this type of domestic spying almost always ends badly .
Watching ' terrorists ' inevitably ends up including mere radicals and simple political protestors -- ultimately , anyone who says something critical about the government instead of actual terrorists .

Taking Pictures Of The Police Could Be Deemed A Crime
As of February 16 , 2009 , anyone taking a photograph of a police officer in the U.K. could be deemed to have committed a criminal offense .

The U.K.'s Counter - Terrorism
Act 2008 amends the Terrorism Act 2000 regarding offenses relating to information about members of armed forces , a member of the intelligence services , or a police officer .
According to the SF
Examiner , the new set of rules targets anyone eliciting information about the aforementioned group that is likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism .
( Source : examiner.com )
Here 's the kicker in U.K. law : besides increasing anti-terrorism powers used by police officers to stop photographers , including press photographers from taking pictures in public places , interpretation of the new law applying to photographers will be up to the police and the courts .

Illicitly Monitoring Electronic Communications
Pending legislation in Britain would reportedly allow just about every governing body in the UK to see who is communicating with whom , and how often .
According to the report , town halls , police , security services and other public bodies will be able to view the communications details for any one suspected of committing a crime , paving the way for authorities to spy on any one and every one .
( Source : telegraph.co.uk )
In lieu of the nefarious U.S. PATRIOT ACT and other ' legislation ' that allegedly fights the war on terror , the U.K. Parliament passed the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 giving themselves unprecedented power to intercept electronic communications .
Attempts in 2002 to implement the extended electronic surveillance powers was put on hold due to public outrage .

Governments Accused Of Exploiting Terrorism
Both governments need to rethink the strategies they 're using to fight terrorism .
The ' legal ' justification utilized by the Bush administration in ' fighting terrorism ' are n't legal .
It 's hard to claim you 're fighting terrorism when you 're using something akin to terrorism to fight it .
( Source : pubrecord.org )
For years the U.S. has illicitly passed ' legislation ' that destroys civil rights and liberties , but the U.K. is starting to make America look better .
The delusional dictatorship created by the Bush administration to ' fight the war on terror ' -- coupled with illicitly expanding Federal police power -- has only succeeded in eroding rights worldwide .
( Source : reuters.com )
All is not lost though .
Dame Stella Rimington , a former head of MI5 , has accused the British government -- as well as the U.S. government -- of exploiting the fear of terrorism and trying to bring in laws that restrict civil liberties .
She 's right .
It 'll be interesting to see who crosses the police state implementation first unless citizens do something to stop it .

Today was very eventful and distracting ( thus the crazy late comic ) , but there are some very good things on the horizon .
I will make a proper announcement about one of them on Monday .
Not much to say about this comic .
I saw that Mtv had a whole Sunday night line up based on dudes jumping into active volcanos with razor wire tied to their balls .
I thought it was worth mentioning if for no other reason than to draw contrast to the Mtv that I grew up with .
I used to watch Mtv to … hold on … wait for it … see music videos .
Weird I know .
I ’m not saying they should go back to the way things were .
I understand that music videos make more sense for YouTube than THETube nowadays .
It ’s just startling to see the transformation they ’ve undergone in such a short time .
I really used to rely on people like Kennedy , Kurt Loder and Matt Pinfield to show me what was going on in the world of music .
The internet really made that entire chanel obsolete .
I agree they had to evolve or die , but 45 scripted reality shows about sunken - eyed debutards does not entertainment make .
Some day I ’ll tell you the story of how VH1 was n’t always about disease ridden skanks vying for the jock of a washed up 80 ’s rock star / rapper .
It ’s true .
I swear .
- Richard Perle ( Interview with journalist John Pilger , 2003 ) .
Listening to neoconservative mastermind Richard Perle at the Nixon Center yesterday , there was a sense of falling down the rabbit hole .
Perle was the ideological architect of the Iraq war and of the Bush doctrine of preemptive attack .
But at yesterday 's forum of foreign policy intellectuals , he created a fantastic world in which :
1. Perle is not a neoconservative .
2. Neoconservatives do not exist .
3 . Even if neoconservatives did exist , they certainly could n't be blamed for the disasters of the past eight years
" There is no such thing as a neoconservative foreign policy , "
" I do n't know whether President Bush ever read any of those statements .
My guess is he did n't . "
The Prince of Darkness -- so dubbed during his days opposing arms control in the Reagan Pentagon was not about to let details get in the way of his argument that " 50 million conspiracy theorists have it wrong , " as the subtitle of his article for National Interest put it .
" I see a number of people here who believe and have expressed themselves abundantly that there is a neoconservative foreign policy and it was the policy that dominated the Bush administration , and they ascribe to it responsibility for the deplorable state of the world , " Perle told the foreign policy luminaries at yesterday 's lunch .
" None of that is true , of course . "
Of course ...
He was a leading cheerleader for the Iraq war , predicting that the effort would take few troops , last only a few days , and that Iraq would pay for its own reconstruction .
Perle was chairman of Bush 's Defense Policy Board -- and the president clearly took the advice of Perle and his fellow neocons .
And Perle , in turn , said back then that Bush " knows exactly what he 's doing . "
Yesterday , however , Perle said Bush 's foreign policy had " no philosophical underpinnings and certainly nothing like the demonic influence of neoconservatives that is alleged . "
He also took issue with the common view that neocons favored using American might to spread democratic values :
" There 's no documentation !
I can't find a single example of a neoconservative supposed to have influence over the Bush administration arguing that we should impose democracy by force . "
Those in the room were skeptical of Perle 's efforts to recast himself as a pragmatist .
Richard Burt , who clashed with Perle during the Reagan administration , took issue with " this argument that neoconservatism maybe actually does n't exist . "
He reminded Perle of the longtime rift between foreign policy realists and neoconservative interventionists .
" You 've got to kind of acknowledge there is a neoconservative school of thought , " Burt challenged .
" I do n't accept the approach , not at all , " the Prince of Darkness replied .
Jacob Heilbrunn of National Interest asked Perle to square his newfound realism with the rather idealistic title of his book , " An End to Evil . "
" We had a publisher who chose the title , " Perle claimed , adding : " There 's hardly an ideology in that book . "
( An excerpt : " There is no middle way for Americans : It is victory or holocaust .
This book is a manual for victory . " )
Regardless of the title , Heilbrunn pursued , how could so many people -- including lapsed neoconservative Francis Fukuyama -- all be so wrong about what neoconservatives represent ?
" It 's not surprising that a lot of people get something wrong , " Perle reasoned .
At times , the Prince of Darkness turned on his questioners .
Fielding a question from the Financial Times , he said that the newspaper " propagated this myth of neoconservative influence . "
He informed Stefan Halper of Cambridge University that " you have contributed significantly to this mythology . "
" There are some 5,000 footnotes , " Halper replied .
" Documents that you 've signed . "
But documents did not deter denials .
" I 've never advocated attacking Iran , " he said , to a few chuckles .
" Regime change does not imply military force , at least not when I use the term , " he said , to raised eyebrows .
Accusations that neoconservatives manipulated intelligence on Iraq ?
" There 's no truth to it . "
At one point , he argued that the word " neoconservative " has been used as an anti-Semitic slur , just moments after complaining that prominent figures such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld -- Christians both -- had been grouped in with the neoconservatives .
" I do n't know that I persuaded anyone , " Perle speculated when the session ended .
No worries , said the moderator .
" You certainly kept us all entertained . "
- Dana Milbank ( " Prince of Darkness Denies Own Existence , " Washington Post , 2.20.09 .

Perle informed the gathering , hosted by National Interest magazine .
So what about the 1996 report he co-authored that is widely seen as the cornerstone of neoconservative foreign policy ?
Perle explained .
Mm-hmm .
And the two letters to the president , signed by Perle , giving abasis to Middle East policy and demanding military means to remove Saddam Hussein ?
Perle replied .
Right ...
And the Bush administration National Security Strategy , enshrining the neoconservative themes of preemptive war and using American power to spread freedom ?
The real estate business will never be the same because the rules of engagement have now been altered by the collapsing economy .
I made this argument many years ago and faced a strong amount of resistance .
My argument was that real estate agents and lenders / brokers are overpaid while Wall Street assumed the role of head money cartel funding the dealers while the Fed actually grew the homegrown credit .
The entire system was corrupt to the core and these pillars all caused the housing bubble ; the users , the pushers , the credit , and the Wall Street delusion .
I stand by that claim and I think most Americans are seeing through the crap the real estate industry complex has been shoveling .
In fact , on a recent NPR show they had a former Countrywide employee actually saying something to the effect of , “ hey , we did n’t force people to sign . ”
These people were delusional and much of our problems stem from this incestuous rewarding of financial deviants for juggling a decade long bezzle .
There is enough blame to go around but the magnitude of blame for certain groups is certainly not equal .
I hold some of these “ so - called ” professionals to a higher standard because they are professionals ( supposedly ) .
If you asked your cousin Johnny to operate on your foot and it gets massively infected with gangrene that is your fault .
But if you go to a medical doctor and the same thing happens , there is a certain shared responsibility at this point .
The same thing happened with real estate agents and lenders .
You were better off doing your own thing than listening to these people but many people fell for the suit and tie theatre and actually believed that most of these people knew what they were talking about .
They clearly did n’t .
The National Association of Realtors used to have an “ anti- bubble ” page which miraculously is no longer up .
Since the link is now inactive , thankfully another blogger over at Bubble Meter was smart enough to copy and paste some of the text back in November of 2005 .
Let us look at some of their sage advice shall we ?
“ Has there ever been a national housing price bubble ?
No , not since good recordkeeping began in 1968 .
There was a national decline in the 1930s during the Great Depression ; however , home prices were not a prime concern in that era .
The greatest issues were essentials such as food , clothing , employment and shelter of any kind .
Declining home prices were a natural result of a general economic collapse caused by the stock market crash in 1929 . ”
Bwahahaha !
Home prices were of little concern during the Great Depression ?
That ’s news to me .
Pass me the housing crack pipe please .
What they fail to mention is that there were many regional housing bubbles in our history including a 1920s Florida housing boom and bust .
Plus these blind mice were unable to see the biggest housing bubble while they were standing in it at the apex !
And incredibly , this was the first ever national housing bubble that just burst and the National Association of Realtors flat out missed the biggest economic event of our lifetime and it had a nucleus in their industry , housing .
Talk about missing the boat .
This almost reads like a poorly written comedic piece :
“ Should we be concerned that home prices are rising faster than family income ?
No .
There are three components to housing affordability : home prices , income , and financing costs – the latter are historically low .
During the last four - and - a - half years of record home sales , there has been a shortage of homes available for sale .
As a result , home prices during this period have risen faster than family income .
However , in much of the 1980s and 1990s , the reverse was true – incomes rose faster than home prices .
On a national basis , according to the Housing Affordability Index published by the National Association of Realtors , a median income family who purchases a median - priced existing home is spending a little over 20 percent of gross income for the mortgage principal and interest payment .
In the early 1990s , a typical mortgage payment was in the low 20s as a percent of income , and in the early 1980s it was as high as 36 percent .
Overall housing affordability remains favorable in historic terms . ”
Excellent point oh mighty NAR !
Keep in mind with the value of hindsight , this statement was made at the pinnacle of the housing bubble .
Since they used their own data to state the above , you have to wonder what that says about them ?
In fact , I just imagine a group of mortgage flunkies coming up with the toxic pay option ARM because of trying to keep that monthly affordability index low .
Options ARMs were nothing more than the music to keep the Ponzi scheme going a little further .
I ’ll give you one other piece of juicy information before moving on to the meat of this article :
“ What are the prospects of a housing bubble ?
There is virtually no risk of a national housing price bubble , based on the fundamental demand for housing and predictable economic factors .
It is possible for local bubbles to surface under the right circumstances , but that also is unlikely in the current environment .
There are tight supplies of homes available for sale in most of the country , and labor markets have been improving .
In other words , the two conditions necessary for price softness do not exist in most of the country .
The strong underlying demand for homes results from the simple fact that the population is growing faster than the supply of homes .
In addition , it is highly unlikely that the cost of construction will decline .
In fact , construction material shortages are expected to continue and the cost of building and development is trending up .
Baby boomers remain in their peak earning years .
Echo boomers – the children of the baby boom generation – are just entering the period of life in which people typically buy their first home .
The echo boom is the second largest generation in U.S. history .
Considering the median age of a first - time buyer is 32 , echo - boomers will be a big factor over the next decade .
In addition , immigration has been strong for many years .
Census data shows that immigrants eventually achieve homeownership rates higher than do native born Americans – this also will be a strong factor in housing demand in the future .
Also , minority ownership rates have been trending up .
All this means the demand for housing is historically high and is one of the reasons 2005 will be the fifth consecutive year of record home sales .
Even in an economic downturn , the demand remains . ”
Bwahahahaha !
Discredited !
How many times can you be wrong in one paragraph ?
Anyways , it is pretty clear why that “ anti- bubble ” Q & A page was taken down .
Yet I would even agree that certain organizations have artificially inflated prices higher .
These are the same groups that have stated that they wanted to help homeowners buy homes .
Yet with the caveat that they still get their cut .
Nothing sickens me more than this and Wall Street of course is the most guilty where you had the architects of these toxic products still receiving bonuses for creating a situation that has put our country in the biggest economic peril since the Great Depression .
Just look at what is happening with banks asking for a measly 10 percent down with a 30 - year fixed mortgage .
The fact we are debating bonuses is absurd .
If we had any sense we need to raid their accounts and take back every damn cent they made and throw them in prison .
If you robbed a bank and got away with $ 50,000 you ’d probably be in jail for many decades .
On Wall Street you can rob the taxpayer of billions and not only do you get rewarded , you get to walk away with a minor verbal lashing but a gorgeous golden parachute .
Pathetic .
Why is the 6 Percent Commission Finished ?
I think many will now agree that those in the financial and real estate industry were over paid for what they did .
In fact , I would suggest that they should n’t make a damn cent because the products they were pushing were toxic and self - serving in only making them a nice commission or bonus .
It was a pointless spectacle of greed and little did these people care about the sustainability of our nation ’s economy .
If there is a silver lining here is the snake oil salesmen are being exposed for what they truly are .
Titans of industry ?
Please .
Nothing highlighted this disdain for actual work when we saw how Congress bashed and shamed the auto industry while Hank Paulson was giving TARP money to his crony capitalist in the banking industry with no major oversight .
At that point , we knew exactly what our leaders thought about those that work with their hands .
Back to the NAR , they are now pushing for legislation that would actually make housing prices more expensive :
“ Late last year , NAR presented Congress with its core principles for stabilizing the housing market to launch an economic recovery .
In the current legislation , NAR strongly supports the provisions to reinstate the 2008 FHA , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limit increases through 2009 .
NAR also strongly supports eliminating the repayment requirement on the first - time home buyer tax credit .
“ This is critical to stimulating home sales and shrinking the housing inventory , which will in turn help stabilize home values , ” McMillan said .
Although Realtors ® support these provisions , a number of enhancements are needed to make them more effective .
In a letter sent to Congress earlier this week , NAR encouraged Congress to make the loan limit increases permanent so that secure , affordable , safe financing is available for American families regardless of where they live .
NAR is also pressing to expand the tax credit to all home buyers and extend the expiration date to December 31 , 2009 . ”
Did you get that ?
The NAR is actually pushing to make permanent loan limit increases in the face of a national implosion of home prices .
And by the way , the most important thing in buying a home is affordability !
The loan limit increase is a wet perverse dream of these people since they are tunnel vision focused on only the 6 percent cut of a larger loan .
Why would you be wanting higher loan limits when unemployment is soaring , wages are being cut , and hours are falling ?
This in fact will raise prices or at least keep them higher .
If you truly believe in a “ free - market ” what is currently going on is a washing out of years of a corrupt and broken system .
The most important variable in home prices is your income ( wages from your job ) in a healthy housing market .
Of course the NAR is only concerned about people buying homes even if they do n’t have a job to service the mortgage .
What do they care ?
These loans can be shoveled off on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which are now nationalized which means we are on the hook for them .
But they ’ll get that 6 % cut and that is what truly matters .
Yet the internet has redeemed my faith in people from going off the cynic ’s cliff .
For the first time this year more people get their information from the internet than from newspapers :
And that is why mainstream sources of media are cutting back and seeing ad revenues fall off a cliff .
Guess what ?
They are competing against thousands of independent contractors that are experts in very niche markets .
For example , why would you trust a journalist who by default has to cover hundreds of stories when you can have an expert on basketball , football , California housing , Wall Street , commodities , economics , farming , or any other niche tell you even more detailed information ?
Many bloggers do n’t have the filter since we are not representing anyone aside from our passion to write and get the information out .
And it is a labor of love for most but this above chart tells me that people are now much more savvy in where they get their information .
With the NAR Q&A from 2005 , is there any doubt ?
On the whole , the media was like a reed in the wind .
A few outsiders were screaming but it was merely background noise .
Yet the media is still missing the game .
They cry foul regarding a few million in yes , horrible programs but you tell me when have they ranted about the trillions being swindled by the Federal Reserve ?
That is the biggest damn story and they still do n’t cover it !
The only time I saw this on mainstream TV addressed was in the Republican debates when Ron Paul talked about it but he was marginalized .
Now that people are suspicious , the entire idea of the 6 % commission is going to collapse in a few years .
It already is but the entire model is going to change .
I know many want to believe that this wo n’t happen but it will .
Trends change .
If you are not part of the trend of course you are going to fight to keep the system from changing even if it hurts home buyers and sellers more than it helps .
Here are a few reasons why this is over :
( a) Zillow – Zillow has come an amazingly long way since it was launched on February 8 , 2006 .
It was funny that in the early days , many old school real estate folk thought that this was much to do about nothing .
Zillow provides tons of information regarding homes across the entire United States .
You are able to see previous sales and in 2007 , Zillow teamed up with Mircrosoft to provide Bird ’s Eye View a feature in Zillow .
The database has 70 million homes .
Now why is this tool useful ?
First , in the past a buyer had no easy way to see the previous sale price of a home without going to the county clerk ’s office .
Now , all it takes is a few seconds .
It was always to the advantage of realtors to hide this number because with recent appraisals , this was a method of doing a comp check and you basically took the 3 most recent sales and went from there .
To call this scientific is to make a mountain out of a mole hill .
You can see how information is power .
Now , people have the ability to look at a home price and many bought at the peak so a buyer is now more reluctant to buy because they have seen in action that yes , real estate does fall and sometimes spectacularly .
Now you do n’t need a degree to learn how to do a comp .
I talked about this long ago and you should read the article if you are interested but here is a quick method .
Pick a few random homes around the home you are looking at .
Take a look at previous sales prices .
Get square footage averages .
Factor in the S&P Case - Shiller drops for the MSA .
Factor that in and bam !
You now have a good estimate of the current market value .
Send 6 % commission to Dr. Housing Bubble , thanks .
And the paperwork is absurd .
You want us to believe that they were looking out for buyers ?
The fact that the market is imploding should tell you something .
If we standardize the forms and make it transparent , there is no need for complicated forms .
If anything , an entrepreneur real estate lawyer can create an online form for a flat fee and make beacoup dough .
The forms are complicated for the nice commission .
If we are now for change let us change the damn forms .
( b) Redfin and ZipReatly – many sites are popping up with discount agents .
These are fantastic because they introduce true competition into the marketplace .
The NAR has artificially caused prices to stay even higher and their recent press - release of pushing for permanent loan cap increases is only self - serving and in the worst interest of future buyers .
Sellers are also hurt because you have a smaller pool of buyers because of these restrictions .
Prices need to hit equilibrium levels and although you think your Real Home of Genius is worth $ 500,000 , you ’re probably only going to get $ 250,000 in the market .
These new sites are what Travelocity , Expedia , and Priceline are to the travel agent industry a few years ago .
Now really , is it that hard to find a home and price it ?
Come on !
When I got my real estate license earlier in the decade I studied while watching my favorite TV show and working out at the same time ( calculus it was not ) .
In fact , having Zillow and these other sites is really all you need to make an informed and smart decision .
I see brokers and agents as nothing more than a car salesman .
Nothing wrong with the profession but they are massively over paid ; and look how that is going for the auto industry as well .
I know many in the industry will try to argue that the commission is split between an agent and their broker .
Usually 60/40 for newcomers but the ratios can be different .
Even with that , let us look at a $ 500,000 home in California :
$ 500,000 x 6 % = $ 30,000
$ 15,000 bucks for a few hours of work is insane .
And yes , I realize that you found the buyer or seller but so what ?
Some people make $ 15,000 a year and you ’re telling me finding a shack to sell is “ worth ” $ 15,000 ?
Please .
That is why the market is issuing its final verdict .
And good riddance .
I am happy to see this collapse in California because so many young professionals , singles and couples , and prudent Americans are looking to buy a home and the only way they were able to do so is by committing financial suicide .
If you really care about “ affordability ” how about we give $ 10,000 of that $ 15,000 to cut down the cost for the buyer ?
We have as much luck with that as Paris Hilton becoming a medical doctor .
The Market is Changing for the Better
But there are some better changes in the marketplace .
NAR membership is declining from the peak reached in October of 2006 :
From the peak , membership has fallen by 218,000 according to the above monthly data sheet released by the NAR .
That is a significant drop and represents a decline of 16 % .
So without a doubt , there is a trend happening here .
Every once in awhile I come across a fantastic internet nugget .
Sometimes these articles / blogs / links are buried from years ago because no one really seemed to care about them during the time .
Today ’s find was a report submitted to the Federal Trade Commission / U.S. Department of Justice back in November of 2005 .
Keep in mind this was posted at the same time the NAR came out with their anti-bubble piece .
The report was submitted by David Barry discussing competition policy and the real estate industry .
An absolute fascinating read but I ’ll break down important points in the document :
Let us first look at the breakdown of pay for agents :
Wow .
To say that this group has the “ lowest productivity of any job in America ” is pretty strong .
The author actually states that the real estate brokerage profession “ should be ashamed of its dismal performance ” and this was at the height of the bubble .
1.1 million agents in America come out averaging 6 home sales per year .
They work about 40 hours per sales which amounts to 12 % of the work year or five hours per week .
And you wonder why I had such a frustration at the skewering of the auto industry from Wall Street and lenders .
Hypocrites .
At least these people put in their 40 hours .
Some people are telling me “ this doom and gloom is tough , tell me what industries are hiring ” so I ’ll give you a few :
( a) Some reports state that the Internal Revenue Service issued a “ shocking call ” for “ hundreds of new IRS officers , reflecting the need for more government cash .
Here is the site .
If you are laid off from the financial industry and have a good head on your shoulders , here you go .
Starting wages are at $ 45,000 and go up but hey , those six - figure jobs were bubble jobs anyways .
( b) The SEC is now hiring as well and will be thanks to the massive corruption .
( c) Bankruptcy lawyer , restructuring specialist , loan “ modders ” , engineers , health care professionals , and other fields are still hiring .
But back to the topic , the paper is pretty damning and hopefully now that we are going with public floggings , the NAR should be up on the block as well .
Let us look at NAR membership over time :
The author goes on to say the following :
“ On Nov. 15 , 1972 , NAR orchestrated a price fixing conspiracy between all Realtor associations at its national convention in Honolulu .
This price fixing agreement – still active – is engraved into the bylaws of all 1,453 Realtor associations .
The agreement , called the DR formula works as follows : a broker decides to join the local Realtors association .
She will be told that dues are $ 427 a year for each agent , and she ’ll be called the Designated Realtor ( the DR ) .
Under the DR formula , she will be billed for all agents in her office .
If there are ten including her , she ’ll be billed $ 4,270 – ten times the amount for a single agent .
If she protests that only she wants to join the Realtors association , they will tell her , sorry , but that ’s the DR formula – that Designated Realtors are charged for every agent in the office .
Brokers always pass on Realtor association dues to their agents .
Before the DR price fix , NAR sold memberships to 31 % of real estate agents ; within a single year it shot to 95 % .
I accuse NAR of the crime of price fixing and urge public prosecutors to commence criminal proceedings against NAR and its affiliated Realtor associations . ”
Now that is a pretty strong statement .
Without a doubt however , membership in the NAR did spike up in the early 1970s .
Now having membership is important but what most do not know is that when you sign with an agent , you actually sign a non-solicitation rule .
It should actually be called a non-competition rule .
For example , if I have a car and I ’m selling it for $ 30,000 and you find a similar car for $ 22,000 , why should n’t you be able to break rank at the last minute ?
Sure I ’ll be miffed but that is my fault for not being competitive .
This is not the case in the real estate industry .
Say you sign on with an agent and find one that is willing to work for 2 % instead of 6 % .
Why should n’t you be able to move along ?
That is the nature of competition in a free market system .
Either way , I know the argument from the real estate industry but it matters very little , the fact that membership is declining and with new technologies it is a dinosaur of an industry and has actually weakened our economic prosperity in the world marketplace .
Really , do you think flipping houses to one another is the pinnacle of success ?
It was the height of our folly giving the corrupt crony capitalistic Wall Street the spoils of our nation .
Now we must pay the price .
It is time to punish these industries .
The people saying we should n’t look back are those that stand to have dirt under their rugs and crud in their nails .
Much of the power comes from the MLS or the Multiple Listing Service .
The reason they protect this so much is because they realize this is the last thing they have protecting them .
See , even if I wanted to go out there and build a plane , I would n’t be able to do so because I am not an aerospace engineer .
And neither can you without the proper training .
Buying and selling a home ?
If you have been a reader long enough on Dr. Housing Bubble you already know the process and you have learned this for free , no previous experience required .
That is the difference .
The MLS is n’t such a big deal anymore since places like Zillow make it irrelevant since sellers can now go around the service if they like .
Zillow now has sufficient traffic to justify this .
Yet the MLS in 2005 still had power over some regions :
Look at Southern California .
No MLS without membership purchase .
Sure did our market well !
You ’ll love this picture from the Great Depression of a Ripley ’s Believe it or Not cartoon :
Do we copyright the word doctor , lawyer , engineer , chemist , or musician ?
You would have to be pretty insecure to copyright your job title .
Do you really need any other reasons why the 6 % commission is gone and rightfully so ?

The title of this list could very well be “ Top 10 Overlooked Contemporary Movies That We Thought Up Off the Top of Our Heads That You Should See if You Have n’t . ”
I have the oldest movie on the list , and even it came out after I was born .
These are films that , one way or another , have stuck with us personally .
Meanwhile , it seems , they have received little attention from the mainstream media , and may lie on your local DVD rental shelf for months at a time without being rented .
Yes , these films do have some sort of personal connection with each of us , but they are not merely nostalgic .
We recommend any movie on our respective lists with a full rock fist way up , and believe that they all deserve a look and possibly a re-evaluation .
I hope you enjoy them … Note : Updated list of Overlooked Movies from 2005 - 2009 is here .
J.D. ’s runners - up : Tune in Tomorrow ( 1990 ) , Cradle Will Rock ( 1999 ) , Serenity ( 2005 ) , Fearless ( 1993 ) , Standing In the Shadows of Motown ( 2002 )
1. Real Genius ( 1985 )
Along with “ Say Anything , ” “ Real Genius ” epitimizes the best of the films that are often considered ’ 80s movies .
This did for me what “ Sixteen Candles ” or “ The Breakfast Club ” did for everybody else .
Val Kilmer is fantastic alongside William Atherton ( the jerk from “ Die Hard ” ) and Gabriel Jarrett who played Mitch – the youngest student admitted to a school of geniuses .
Jarrett ’s career did n’t take off after this breakout role , but he has been spotted in “ Apollo 13 ” and an episode of “ The West Wing . ” “ Real Genius ” is extraordinarily quotable and has a permanent spot on my must watch list .
2. Hard Eight ( aka : Sydney ) ( 1996 )
Director Paul Thomas Anderson has gone on to bring us “ Boogie Nights ” and “ Magnolia , ” but before we all knew his name he directed “ Hard Eight . ”
Originally titled “ Sydney ” , Phillip Baker Hall ( “ Magnolia ” ) played the then title role as a Las Vegas grifter who takes the struggling John C. Reilly under his wing without clear reason .
We later learn Sydney ’s motivations as Reilly and co-stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Samuel L. Jackson get involved in deep dark sin city trouble .
Anderson ’s talent was unmistakable even then and Phillip Baker Hall ’s performance rivals his work in “ Magnolia , ” both of which frankly , deserved Oscar nominations .
3. Highlander ( 1986 )
I saw this movie 17 times in the theatre .
There was a dollar theatre in town and as a seventh grader the combination of swords , immortality and a Queen soundtrack rocking the big - screen were more than enough to dominate my pliable little mind for the better part of the next year .
“ Highlander ” would go on to spawn more features and a moderately popular TV series , but none of it would do justice to the original film .
It was the “ Matrix ” of its time , furthering the science - fiction genre on film and telling a new story .
Director Russell Mulcahy ’s vision included some of the most memorable transitions I had ever seen , including a fade between star Christopher Lambert ’s face and the face of the Mona Lisa on a building mural and an aquarium water line becoming a Scottish lake in the highlands .
The movie grossed less than 6 million in the U.S. at the Box Office , and even though it ascended to cult status on video it has never enjoyed its rightful place as a groundbreaking , undeniably original classic .
4. Six Degrees of Seperation ( 1993 )
Two words : Will and Smith .
Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland co-star in this adaptation of a stage production that was the best vehicle imaginable to “ seperate ” Smith from his squeaky - clean “ Fresh Prince ” persona .
As a laser sharp con-man claiming to be the son of acting great Sidney Portier , Smith sweeps into the world of the social elite and swindles absolutely everyone .
This is definitely one of those little films with a bigger than life career changing performance .
After this one , Hollywood had no choice but to look at Smith differently , even if the ticket buying public had no idea what he was capable of just yet .
5. That Thing You Do! ( 1996 )
Tom Hanks ’ first and only feature film serving as the director , “ That Thing You Do ! ” is as well - executed as it is charming .
Featuring a cameo from Mrs. Hanks , Rita Wilson , the cast of “ That Thing You Do ! ” make it nearly impossible to dislike .
Liv Tyler , Tom Everett Scott and Steve Zahn are a sugary - sweet bunch of kids from Pennsylvania whose perfectly catchy song comes along at just the right moment to live a “ Beatlemania - like ” adventure before they become the “ one - hit Wonders . ”
What ’s not to like , it ’s so good I think I ’ll stay up and watch it tonight .
6. The Hudsucker Proxy ( 1994 )
Almost , but not quite a Coen Brothers movie , “ Hudsucker Proxy ” was directed by Joel Coen and Sam Raimi ( “ Spider - Man ” ) .
Easily one of Tim Robbins ’ ( “ Bull Durham ” ) finest moments , “ Proxy ” has extraordinary art direction and powerhouse performances from Paul Newman and Charles Durning and yes , even Jennifer Jason Leigh .
The scene with Leigh and Robbins as she fakes her way through a recital of an old school song , both of them cawing and whooping away , is enough on its own to recommend this movie .
It has the Coen vibe and then some … ” you know , for kids . ”
7. Everything Is Illuminated ( 2005 )
The most recent of my list of overlooked films , “ Everything Is Illuminated ” is the best small film of 2005 .
Directed by Liev Schreiber and starring Elijah Wood , Eugene Hutz , and Boris Leskin , “ Illuminated ” is an adaptation of the incredible novel of the same name by author Jonathan Safran Foer .
I saw the film and then read the book and believe both to be examples of the absolute best in film and literature of the last decade .
8. Gattaca ( 1997 )
“ Gattaca ” is a truly beautiful film .
Director Andrew Niccol ( “ Lord of War ” ) uses washes of color and exquisite art direction to create a spectacular vision of a future where genetic engineering has become common place and is central in determining a person ’s potential and opportunities in society .
“ Gattaca ” is dark , smart and captivating .
Ethan Hawke , Uma Thurman and a then unknown Jude Law are at their collective best and this is a must see for anyone who appreciates the kind of sci - fi that does n’t come complete with phasers and Klingons .
9 . The Music of Chance ( 1993 )
I have often said of the film “ The Music of Chance ” that the jury is still out .
It ’s the trick question I always ask other film nuts , desperate for someone else to tell me what their experience was since I ’m still not sure how I feel about it .
The cast is sensational and includes Mandy Patinkin , James Spader , Charles Durning and Joel Grey .
Patinkin picks up Spader in a ditch , they end up at Durning and Gray ’s place in a high - stakes poker game and it just keeps getting weirder from there .
I have been bothered by this film for years , it remains firmly stuck in my craw .
Try this one if the next time you ’re lining up your Netflix you find yourself thinking …
” I know !
I really want to watch something strange and totally unsettling ! ”
10 . Cadence ( 1991 )
I love a man , and his name is Martin Sheen – honestly , when has he ever not delivered – in my mind he is one of the real treasures of American cinema .
“ Cadence ” is Sheen ’s only directing credit and it features both Charlie Sheen and lesser known brother of Charlie and Emilio , Ramon Estevez .
There is a melancholy about this film that always affects me in a memorable way .
This is n’t to say the film is without some serious flaws , but Martin and Charlie give some pretty heavy and inspired performances and the ensemble led by Lawrence Fishburne is phenomenal .
It deals with fathers and sons and war and duty , sadly it was received quietly , but “ Cadence ” like the rest of these overlooked gems deserves it ’s day in the sun .
The Russian airline Aeroflot has apologised to passengers on a transatlantic flight after one of its pilots made such a slurred preflight announcement it created panic on the plane that he was drunk .
The garbled message from one of the plane 's two captains , Alexander Cheplevsky , prompted a passenger revolt that forced the airline to replace all three pilots on the Boeing 767 before it took off from Moscow to New York on 28 December last year .
Aeroflot today denied the 55 - year - old had been drinking , but they accepted he was in a poor physical state and said sorry to those on board .
Lev Koshlyakov , deputy director general of Aeroflot told the Guardian : " We accept that his physical condition was not good .
We acknowledge the mistake and apologise to passengers . "
Koshlyakov confirmed that Cheplevsky had celebrated his birthday the day before the incident , but said no trace of alcohol had been found in his body after a series of tests .
Aeroflot claimed the pilot may have suffered a stroke before making his incoherent preflight announcement to passengers .
" The first thought that occurred to me was , ' this guy is drunk ' , " one passenger , Khatuna Kobiashvili , told the Moscow Times .
" His speech was so slurred it was hard to tell what language he was speaking . "
When passengers , including the Russian TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak , began to ­protest , they were told to " stop making trouble " , according to the paper , whose reporter was also on board .
But the crew could not calm the panic , and after an hour of angry exchanges the pilots were replaced .
Koshlyakov said : " A couple of passengers started very aggressively crying out that the pilot was drunk .
In those circumstances passengers are easily subject to panic , and the crew was not able to pacify them . "
But he added : " I understand their concerns , the situation could have been dealt with differently . "
Cheplevsky is being treated in hospital .
" As soon as he is fit he will be interviewed as part of our internal investigation , " Koshlyakov said .
He added : " We have interrogated the crew members who said his condition deteriorated .
If he was unfit to fly that was very irresponsible .
Hypothetically the other pilots would have controlled the situation , but this is not an excuse . "
Koshlyakov said it was unlikely that Cheplevsky would be allowed to fly again .
WASHINGTON , D.C. - The Bush administration struck a parting shot to legitimate science today as the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) refused to end the unique government monopoly over the supply of marijuana available for Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) - approved research .
DEA 's final ruling rejected the formal recommendation of DEA Administrative Law Judge ( ALJ ) Mary Ellen Bittner , issued nearly two years ago following extensive legal hearings .
" With one foot out the door , the Bush administration has once again found time to undermine scientific freedom , " said Allen Hopper , litigation director of the American Civil Liberties Union Drug Law Reform Project .
" In stubbornly retaining the unique government monopoly over the supply of research marijuana over the objections of DEA 's own administrative law judge , the Bush administration has effectively blocked the proper regulatory channels that would allow the drug to become a wholly legitimate prescription medication . "
The DEA ruling constitutes a formal rejection of University of Massachusetts at Amherst Professor Lyle Craker 's petition , filed initially June 24 , 2001 , to cultivate research - grade marijuana for use by scientists in FDA - approved studies aimed at developing the drug as a legal , prescription medication .
[ ACLU ]
Marijuana is bad and we are powerful , so f**k you .
Furthermore … f**k you .
And in conclusion , based on the aforementioned facts …
f**k you .
After stalling for two years , the DEA has conveniently chosen the final days of the Bush Administration to act on the Craker petition : Marijuana , unlike LSD , MDMA , heroin and cocaine , is almost impossible to obtain for research purposes and the DEA will do everything in its virtually infinite unchecked power to keep it that way .
We all know why : they ’re afraid of what the research will show .
The really disgusting part of all this is that the drug warriors actually go around claiming that we need more research before we can allow patients to use medical marijuana , all the while doing everything in their power right before our eyes to prevent that research from happening .
There ’s nothing secret about any of this .
You can just watch them do it .
And the best part of all is that the DEA actually managed to churn out a 118 - page monstrosity explaining their position , which can be summed up as follows : I do n’t know why it took them over a hundred pages to flesh it out .
I guess they just love killing trees .

What with Bush leaving office and local ire having no direct target , layoffs continuing to abound , and the recession devolving into something worse , American Apparel setting up shop on Valencia Street created the perfect storm for a surprising amount of anger on both sides of the argument .
Check out some scene from yesterday 's Planning Commission meeting at City Hall .
It brought out quite the crowd .
Commissioner Mike Antonini said he'd never seen such a crowd or such a response to a freaking Planning item .
And SFist commenter / photog Manny Ortez tells us that never before has City Hall played " host to so many skinny jeans , staches , and American Apparel - wearers , " going on to say , " Do n't know if the irony was lost on them or not , but apparently you can be opposed to formula retail and still dig hideous leotards . "
Oh , and American Apparel will NOT go up in the Mission .
Ta-da .
Now let 's fix actual problems in the Mission like gang warfare , crime , and fixing the railroad track - ish one block barrier in the Mission that divides the lily white from the Latino community .
Editor 's note : Virg Bernero is the mayor of Lansing , Michigan and chairman of the Mayors and Municipalities Automotive Coalition ( MMAC ) .
He is one of the mayors of U.S. cities appearing on " American Morning " this week .
Mayor Virg Bernero says the American worker has been sold out by backers of free trade .
( CNN ) --
While America reels from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , it is time that we take a deeper look at the root causes of our current predicament .
The cold , hard truth is that the unholy alliance between Washington and Wall Street has sold out the American worker and exported our standard of living .
Driven by the insatiable greed of Wall Street profiteers and accelerated by the false promise of free trade , our manufacturing base has been chased out of this country and along with it the livelihood of millions of hard - working Americans .
It 's fashionable these days among the politicians , pundits and so - called experts to claim that free trade is actually good for us .
They say it enables us to buy cheaper goods made with cheap foreign labor and this , in turn , raises our standard of living .
With all due respect , the free traders need to ask themselves a more fundamental question : how will Americans buy those goods when they do n't even have a paycheck that covers their mortgage , much less the college tuition for their children ?
Watch Mayor Bernero speak to American Morning 's John Roberts »
Mayors on America 's economic woes Hear how cities in the US are coping with the recession all week on " American Morning "
Weekdays 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
More than one pundit has told me I need to take a broader view .
As the mayor of one of America 's countless manufacturing communities , the only view that matters is the one my citizens see every day : Record job losses , home foreclosures and , thanks to the Wall Street wizards , a credit crunch so severe that it is nearly impossible to finance a new car .
This is n't a predicament faced just by Michigan or the Midwest .
This is the story of America , told in thousands of desperate households from Connecticut to California .
The pundits claim our manufacturing sector is a relic of the old economy .
We 're told that we just can't compete anymore .
We 're told that our future is in the service economy , that jobs in health care and finance and knowledge - based industries will recreate the prosperity our nation once knew .
The truth is that our industrial heritage is an example of everything that was right with our nation 's economy .
Good jobs with good benefits created the middle class in this country , and now it is being systematically dismantled under the banner of free trade and globalism .
Those who continue to espouse free trade ominously warn that protectionism is the wrong path for our nation ; that challenging the holy doctrine of free trade invites a global trade war .
Yet we already face rampant protectionism across the globe .
Pursuing a free trade agenda in a protectionist world is tantamount to unilateral disarmament .
Our trading partners routinely employ taxes , tariffs and subsidies that underwrite their exports and restrict American products from entering their home markets .
They use currency manipulation to reduce the relative cost of their goods here in the USA .
The fact is we 're not competing against other companies ; we 're competing against other countries .
I 've toured the Hyundai plant in Asan , Korea .
The Koreans are wonderful people , but their technology is n't any better and they 're not working any harder than Americans .
The difference is that Hyundai does n't have to pay legacy costs .
The Korean government takes care of their retirees .
Hyundai does n't pay health care costs because they have national heath care .
If you do n't think that 's an unfair advantage , you 're kidding yourself .
Many Americans are unaware that China sold 10 million cars last year -- more than General Motors or Toyota .
I can assure you the Chinese government is part and parcel of that success .
They 're involved in their industry .
The Korean government is involved in their industry .
If we are going to have any chance to compete globally , our government must get involved in our industry and help us rebuild America 's industrial might before it is too late .
There 's no question that we need this stimulus package .
We need the reinvestment in America 's infrastructure and in the working people of this country .
We need tax cuts delivered directly to the American worker .
We need education and retraining for the " green collar " jobs of the future .
But we need more than a short term shot in the arm .
We need a long - term strategy to rebuild the American economy that provides jobs and economic security to the millions of hard - working American families who have been sold down the river by unfair trade policies .
We need fair trade agreements so that the most productive workers in the world -- American workers -- can put their skills to work and compete in the global economy .
We recently watched our athletes successfully compete in the Olympics against nations of the world .
When the playing field is level , Americans can compete against the best from any nation .
With fair trade instead of free trade , American workers can once again bring home the gold .

Get a load of these apples !
Blog !
NOBON is much like any other Apple Computer fan site , except for the fact that the owner makes his own Apple apples .
That is , he grows apples that proudly carry the familiar Apple logo and variations thereof , right on their peels .
No painting , no photoshopping , no trickery of any kind is used to create these distinctively marked apples - unless you 're an apple , in which case the trick 's being played on you !
Blog !NOBON has designed a series of sticker templates that feature the familiar Apple Computer logo , a variation with a bitten - into heart , and a stylized iPod .
A month or so before the apples in his backyard orchard ripen and turn red , he sticks the stickers on the apples - thus preventing sunlight from activating the pigment cells in the apple peels .
At harvest time , he removes the stickers to reveal pale green logos against the rosy red apple peels .
Not quite the Macintosh memory you were thinking of , and these apples have but a single core !
This type of " directed growth " , for want of a better phrase , is relatively common in Japan .
Watermelons are available in square and head - shaped styles and cucumbers are coaxed into shapes that are heart - shaped in cross section : perfect for slicing .
Blog !NOBON offers several custom wallpapers for download from his website , and they appear to be free .
One must assume that any attempt to sell anything - apples included - featuring the Apple Computer logo or its variations would be looked down upon by Steve Jobs ' legal eagles - though he'd probably appreciate them in a gift fruit basket as the ultimate geek gifts .

How I Built a Wind Generator in My Backyard for $ 150
By Kevin Harris
Originally published 6-15-2007
Lately I 've been spending a great deal of time working on ways to generate my own electricity .
It is n't a necessity for me yet , but someday being electrically self - sufficient could really come in handy .
My interest started a while back when I stumbled upon a how - to article on building wind generators from treadmill motors and PVC pipe .
It sounded easy enough , so I decided to try and design my own .
This particular design can be built for $ 100 - $ 150 if you are thrifty and can regularly generate 50 - 250 watts ( considerably cheaper than a solar panel of similar power output ) .
Here 's how I built it for those of you who are interested .
Additionally , please check out my new frequently asked questions page for more information not discussed in detail here .
Videos
Before we get into the details of how to build one of these , here are some videos of it in action .
Each one demonstrates the behavior of the generator in a different blade configuration .
How does my wind generator work ?
Every wind generator , whether they produce enough energy to power a city or to power a small radio , works on these same basic principles ...
1 . The wind blows
2 . The generator 's vane ( tail ) causes it to turn into the wind
3 . Blades attached to an alternator / generator experience the force of lift and begin to spin
4 . The spinning creates electricity for us to use directly or to charge batteries
Tools Required
Sounds pretty simple eh ?
Well , then how the heck do I build one ?
Read on ...
Surprisingly , building a simple wind generator only requires very basic hand tools , and if you are desperate you wo n't necessarily need all of them .
I used ...
Jigsaw ( or a hacksaw and a lot of determination )
Drill
(2) Drill Bits ( 1/2 " , 7/32 " )
Tape Measure
Crescent Wrench
Pipe Wrench
Protractor ( to measure angles for the hub )
Sandpaper ( various grits )
Parts Required
I wanted to be as minimal as possible with my design ( I 'm poor ) , so I took the already simple designs from around the web and made them even simpler .
All of the parts are available at any local home improvement or hardware store , and the entire setup can be constructed in as little as a weekend .
Many of the parts you may already have lying around , and lots of substitutions can be made ( instead of 1 " steel pipe for the tower , you could use an antenna pole for instance ) .
Here are the parts I used to build my generator ...
10 " x 14 " Steel Sheet
10 " x 1/4 " Steel Nipple
1 - 1/4 " Floor Flange
36 " x 1 " Square Tubing
1/2 " Bore Circular Sawblade ( for hub )
5/8 " x 1/2 " Arbor ( to attach sawblade to motor shaft )
(2) Hose Clamps
8 " x 4 " PVC Pipe
30 " x 8 " PVC Pipe ( 6 " pipe works well too )
A DC Permanent Magnet Motor ( preferably Ametek 30 V or 260V 5A treadmill motor )
(8) 1/4 " Bolts ( with washers and nuts )
(2) 1/4 " Sheet Metal Screws
10 - 40 Amp Diode ( the bigger the better )
Blade Construction
All of the above parts ( with the exception of the motor ) , can be picked up in a single stop to any large hardware or home improvement store .
For the motor , the most popular types are old tape drive motors manufactured by a company called Ametek .
The key is to finding a motor that puts out the highest voltage per RPM .
For instance , the Ametek I 'm using is rated for 30 V at 325 RPM , making it excellent as an electricity generator ( for a nice output comparison of the Ametek motors commonly found on eBay and other sites see TLG Windpower ) .
However , pretty much any permanent magnet motor with a good volt / RPM ratio will do .
Keep in mind that if you want to generate useful electricity , you will need to produce at least 12 V to charge deep cycle batteries or run an inverter .
My setup can easily achieve 300- 400 RPM in a pretty average wind ( for Oklahoma ) .
These instructions assume an Ametek motor with a 5/8 " shaft , but can easily be adapted to other motors ( search ebay for " wind generator " and you will get a listing of lots of good motors ) .
Arguably , the most important part of a wind generator are its blades .
A lot of people like to carve their own blades out of wood or composite materials .
However , for the rest of us , it 's quite easy to make a good set of generator blades from common PVC pipe ( and the efficiency is n't too bad either ) .
A 2 - 3 foot section of either 6 " or 8 " PVC pipe will do the trick .
Before we go any further , here are a few blade theory quickies ...
The longer your blades are the more " swept area " you have to gather energy from and easier your blades will spin in low winds , but the slower your rotation speed will be
The tips of the blades always spin faster than the base , therefore one needs to take into account the " tip speed ratio " ( TSR ) when designing blades ( there is a reason why old farm windmills will spin all year long at 40RPM )
The power that can be extracted from the wind increases by the cube of wind speed ( something like P=k * v^3 k=constant of wind generator , v=wind velocity )
According to the Betz Limit , only about 59.3 % of power can be extracted from the wind ( so in reality P=.593*k*v^3 , assuming k accounts for mechanical inefficiencies in the generator motor )
The higher you get the generator off of the ground , the more wind it will be exposed to ( the general recommendation seems to be 25 - 50 ft . , but I 've had decent results at just 12ft . )
Hub & Blade Assembly
Cutting the blades for this machine is very simple .
You will need to cut your PVC pipe into 3 sections , two 150 degree sections and one 60 degree section ( I 've attempted to illustrate thisin my favorite CAD program -- and by CAD program I really mean MS Paint ) .
The red lines are cut marks .
You will want to use a good tape measure and possibly some construction paper or newspaper to mark everything before you cut .
The 150 degree angles will result in wide blades that start up in lower wind speeds , however this will lower the shaft turning speeds .
In practice , you will find that the optimum angle could be anywhere from 75 - 150 degrees .
The best idea is start out with a wide set of blades that you can always thin out later if you need to .
Remember , measure twice and cut once !
After the blades are cut , I like to go ahead and smooth out all of the edges .
If you want to follow aerodynamic theory , you can round the angled ( leading ) edge and flatten the straight ( trailing ) edge , but in practice I have n't seen this make much difference with PVC blades .
So , you should end up with something roughly like these ...
The next obstacle is building a hub to attach the blades to .
There are many types of ways that this can be done .
I have used circular sawblades and scrap steel disks .
I recommend the sawblade approach , as they are readily available and easy to drill through .
You can pick up an arbor with a 5/8 " or 1/2 " shaft at any homestore that will attach directly to the sawblade .
Using the 1/4 " drill bit , you will want to drill 3 sets of 2 holes 1 " apart which each set 120 degrees from the next ( this is where the protractor comes in handy , unless of course you are a Euclidean purist in which case you probably do n't need a protractor ) .
Here is a picture to make it more clear ...
It 's a pretty simple idea , but circular sawblades have worked out very well for me as hubs .
Be sure and get some sort of rubber covering for the tooth edges and / or file down the edges as best you can , because the last thing you want is a hub of death flying at you if your generator decides to rip apart !
After our holes are cut out and we are confident of our safety procedures , we attach the blades to the hub ( note that the hub pictured was cut from scrap steel , more pictures to come later ) ...
Tail & Pivot Assembly
Now we need to build a spinning platform for our generator motor to rest on .
To achieve this , we will use some square tubing , a pipe nipple , flange , and small sheet of steel .
Here is my " CAD " draft of what I wanted my tail & pivot assembly to look like , and a real picture of some of the parts I used ...
Tower Assembly
First , I recommend cutting the sheet steel with a jigsaw into a nice design for the the tail ( Note : this step is quite unneccessary and ONLY for aesthethic reasons ) .
We then want to make a cut down the center of the square tubing .
The length of the cut is n't that important , but I recommend about a 9 " cut ( this will help make balancing easier later on ) .
We may then slide the tail metal into the hole and use the 1/4 " drill bit to drill and attach the tail to the square tubing .
We will then want to cut out a weather covering for our motor .
A piece of 4 " PVC slips perfectly over the Ametek 30 V motor that I use .
I cut it out like so ( note the side hole for the motor wires ) .
Then we go ahead and paint it all up to seal everything from the elements .
I would n't recommend painting on your front porch like I did though ... After everything is painted , we can now put it all together .
Take the floor flange and put it under the square tubing about 6 " - 7 " from the head .
Mark the holes and drill them out with the 7/32 " drill bit ( or any bit close to but smaller than 1/4 " ) .
Attach with the 1/4 " sheet metal screws .
Use the metal straps to secure the motor and cover assembly , screw on the pipe nipple and you should have something like this ...
Every wind generator needs a tower .
I built mine from some pipe fittings from my local hardware store .
If you already have an antenna pole or electrical conduit lying around , then you can skip this section .
Here is my recommended parts list for a small extensible tower ...
(2) 5 ' Sections 1 " Pipe
(1) 1 " Pipe Coupling
(3) 1 " Pipe Elbows
(4) 18 " Pipe Sections
(2) 12 " Pipe Sections
Finished Product
The tower base is pretty self - explanatory .
Just hook up the elbows and pipe sections to create a base similar to this ... From there we can attach the 2 5 ' sections of pipe together to form a nice strong mini - tower for our generator to sit atop ...
Now we are ready to attach the blades to the motor shaft with the arbor .
You will also want to go ahead and attach some wire to the motor and run it to a device to power or a bank of batteries etc ...
Here is a picture of the experimental design using six blades .
It would spin in practically no wind , but would never get past 100RPM .
At least it looked interesting !
Here is the battery bank I 'm feeding into in parallel with solar panels .
I am just using two 12V marine deep cycle batteries that can be found at any place that sells car batteries .
I keep them in a standard plastic tub with a hole cut in the sides for 12V fans I cannibalized from a couple of old Mac G4s ( not pictured ) .
Be sure and put a diode between the battery and the generator so that current does n't flow from the battery to the motor .
It turns out , cutting the blades a little thinner works better for my area .
So I used the large white blades from the previous picture and thinned them out a bit .
This resulted in the fastest shaft speeds as seen in first video at the top of this page .
Not too bad for a 22 year old kid from Oklahoma eh ( or at least 22 in 2007 ) ?

Nine Inch Nails ( NIN ) fans were caught by surprise this week when NIN mastermind Trent Reznor dropped by the band ’s web site to announce that 405 GB of HD live footage somehow found its way online .
The raw HD recordings , which document three of the band ’s latest concerts from multiple camera angles , are available as a free BitTorrent download .
Thousands of fans have started to download the footage , despite the fact that downloading 405 GB will literally take days , if not weeks , with an average consumer broadband connection .
This is not the first time Reznor has challenged traditional media distribution models .
NIN promoted its 2007 album Year Zero with the help of a complex alternate reality game .
The band also released its 2008 album Ghosts I - IV under a Creative Commons license and uploaded parts of the album to the Pirate Bay .
That did n’t seem to stop the success of the album , which recently topped Amazon ’s list of the best - selling MP3 albums of 2008 .
Could Reznor ’s massive video experiment lead to a similar success story ?
Reznor told his fans on Wednesday that “ a mysterious , shadowy group of subversives ” somehow was able to shoot the footage due to a lack of security at the shows in question .
“ I ’ll bet some enterprising fans could assemble something pretty cool ( with the footage ) ” , he wrote , continuing : “ Oh yeah , you did n’t hear this from me . ”
The reason for all this winking and nudging is obvious : NIN used to be under contract with Universal Music Group outlet Interscope for the last couple of years .
The band left the label in 2008 under less than amicable terms and has since published music online and on its own record label .
However , some of the songs played on stage on the most recent tour are still from NIN ’s corporate history , and the publishing rights for these songs remain with Universal Music Publishing .
Reznor complained publicly in December that NIN can’t legally release a DVD featuring complete gigs from the latest tour because of those copyright complications .
But that apparently did n’t stop the band from helping those shadowy subversives with some professional infrastructure in the hope that NIN ’s fans would end up making their own tour DVDs .
The P2P downloads of the raw concert footage are facilitated by NIN ’s official BitTorrent tracker , the links to the torrents were first posted by the band ’s art director , and the audio tracks of the recordings sound an awful lot like the clean sound you ’d get straight from a concert venue ’s mixing console .
Finally , each download comes with a text file that explains how to use the raw HD footage material for fan edits : “ ( T ) he included sequence has been prepared with all the camera angles in sync , ready for editing . ”
Fans using the Intenet to trade live recordings is n’t exactly a new phenomenon .
Sites like Etree have been offering live bootleg audio recordings for years , and many bands have turned a blind eye to this practice , if not actively encouraged it .
However , this is the first time that professional raw HD footage has been leaked on such a massive scale .
It ’s unclear yet what the overall impact of this leak will be on both NIN ’s online strategy and tour DVDs in general .
The band impressed the music world when it demonstrated that freely available music downloads can lead to huge revenues , but its unlikely that Reznor will see any direct revenue from video mashups created by his fans .
And do n’t hold your breath for other well - known acts to release similarly generous tour footage downloads either .
The risk of getting sued by giant music publishing companies is just too high .
However , there may be more HD torrents from NIN in the future .
Reznor has long planed to release a movie based on his music ’s narratives and things like the alternate reality game that promoted Year Zero .
One should n’t be too surprised to see video footage of such a movie find its way online , possibly leaked by shadowy subversives , which in turn could give DVD sales a huge bump .
Maybe he felt guilty .
Maybe it was a fraternity prank , a rite of passage , or maybe Arthur Henkel simply took a friend 's quip a bit too literally .
Police said the 20 - year - old Lehigh University student popped into the Bethlehem police department early this morning to turn himself in .
He did n't rob the markets on West Broad Street earlier this week .
He did n't assault anyone , or wreck his car .
Nope , he was just drunk , police said .
Henkel , local address unknown , slept off his haze in a city cell and hiked home about 6:20 a.m.
Lt. Joe Kimock said Henkel walked into the station at 1:39 a.m. and indicated that he was intoxicated .
Police agreed and charged him with public drunkenness and underage consumption .
Police are unsure where or what the student was imbibing , but were more than happy to house the penitent man for the night .
We all need to take responsibility .
And this includes executives at major financial firms who turned to the American people , hat in hand , when they were in trouble , even as they paid themselves their customary lavish bonuses .
As I said last week , that 's the height of irresponsibility .
That 's shameful .
And that 's exactly the kind of disregard for the costs and consequences of their actions that brought about this crisis : a culture of narrow self - interest and short - term gain at the expense of everything else .
This is America .
We do n't disparage wealth .
We do n't begrudge anybody for achieving success .
And we believe that success should be rewarded .
But what gets people upset – and rightfully so – are executives being rewarded for failure .
Especially when those rewards are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers .
For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst of this economic crisis is not only in bad taste – it's a bad strategy – and I will not tolerate it as President .
We 're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid – so that when firms seek new federal dollars , we wo n't find them up to the same old tricks .
As part of the reforms we are announcing today , top executives at firms receiving extraordinary help from U.S. taxpayers will have their compensation capped at $ 500,000 – a fraction of the salaries that have been reported recently .
And if these executives receive any additional compensation , it will come in the form of stock that can't be paid up until taxpayers are paid back for their assistance .
Companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks and luxuries bestowed upon senior executives and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and to shareholders as to why these expenses are justified .
And we 're putting a stop to these kinds of massive severance packages we 've all read about with disgust ; we 're taking the air out of the golden parachute .
We 're asking these firms to take responsibility , to recognize the nature of this crisis and their role in it .
We believe that what we 've laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basic common sense .
Finally , these guidelines we 're putting in place are only the beginning of a long - term effort .
We 're going to examine the ways in which the means and manner of executive compensation have contributed to a reckless culture and quarter - by - quarter mentality that in turn have wrought havoc in our financial system .
We 're going to be taking a look at broader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management and rewarded for growth measured over years , not just days or weeks .
Certainly , studying worm parasites is n't nearly as bad as playing host to them .
But here 's an essential distinction :
The medicos who go into this line —
God bless 'em — do it by choice .
Supported by the World Health Organization and various international charities , they travel to the tropics to eradicate diseases that afflict millions of people .
Yet although we 're regularly treated to tales of Ebola warriors , we rarely hear about the tribulations of the worm docs .
For instance . . . [ consider these ellipses a pause to enable the faint of stomach to flee the page ] . . .
Ascaris lumbricoides eggs hatch in the small intestine , then migrate to the lungs ; they 're coughed into the mouth and swallowed back to the gut , where each worm will grow as long as 16 inches and where each female will lay billions of eggs to be defecated forth so that a new cycle of life can begin .
( The adults can exit this way too , in a large bolus that resembles a tangle of spaghetti . )
The Wuchereria bancrofti worm sometimes settles in the scrotum , where it blocks the flow of lymph .
This can result in elephantiasis , a wretched condition that features scrotal swelling to jack - o'- lantern proportions and an infection that reeks of death .
Moving right along . . . [ see helpful ellipsis - related note , supra ] . . . the female Dracunculus medinensis migrates from the gut to a point just under the skin of , say , a leg , where she then commences growth to a length of as great as three feet , and where , ultimately , she lays her eggs .
When the thousands of babies make their joyous arrival , they blister the skin and pop through , leaving Mom behind .
The traditional way to get rid of her is to wrap her head around a stick and twist very slowly — one turn of the stick per day — for weeks or months , depending on how long she is .
( This treatment is so old that it inspired the ancient snake - and - pole aesculapius symbol of medicine . )
And so worm parasitologists are unsung heroes — and decorum dictates that unsung they shall remain .
" We can't show pictures or even really talk about these diseases , " says parasitologist Eric Ottesen of Emory University .
" Society just is n't ready for it . "

All About Domain Names
The domain name identifies your website to users .
Smashing Magazine ’s domain name is smashingmagazine.com .
The domain name should n’t be confused with the URL — domain names are a part of URLs .
To further our understanding , let ’s analyze a URL that has all components and see what ’s what .
http://www.blog.mywebsite.com:80/post/awesomeness.php?edit=false&view=true#comment-5
This URL has five distinct parts :
http:// is the protocol that tells browsers how to retrieve data .
Some well - known ones are http , https and ftp .

mywebsite.com is the domain name .
The www ( which comes before the subdomain , if any ) is optional ; you ’ll need to decide on that .
For the most part , it ’s a matter of preference , but it can have an impact on large websites .
The end of the domain name ( in this case , .com ) is called a top - level domain ( TLD ) .
Others are .net and .org , country - specific ones such as .co.uk , .hu and .me and brand new ones like .xyz , .news and .media .

# comment - 5 is an anchor that can be used to take the user to a specific place on the page right away .
If you visit the link above , you will be taken lower down on the page to a specific comment .
If you do n’t understand all of that , do n’t worry about it ; a lot of this is n’t relevant in everyday use .
The only part you ’ll need to focus on is the domain name because this is how users will refer to your website .
Choosing The Right Name
Choosing a domain name might be difficult , especially considering that the top tips for domains always include keeping it short and easy to type .
If you already have a brand consisting of proper English words — like “ Vintage Shoes ” — then the domain name will probably already be taken .
You can find all sorts of tips on choosing a domain name , but it almost always boils down to keeping it short and memorable .
This is definitely good advice , but always have a brand strategy in mind as well .
Smashing Magazine has a long - ish domain name , yet it is unlikely that much traffic is lost due to this — or that more could be gained by switching to smashingmag.com .
Branding is , ultimately , the most important factor .
A short and sweet domain name is great , but in the end , what you do with it is what counts .
One last note of caution :
Make sure not to infringe on any copyrights with your domain name .
Nolo has a good read on avoiding trademark infringement when choosing a domain .
Buying A Domain Name
Most of the places where you can buy a domain name also allow you to grab hosting .
As a rule of thumb for security , keep your domain and hosting separate .
I have to confess that I do n’t always do that , for convenience ’s sake , but the rationale is this :
If someone can get into your hosting account , then they can steal files and data .
If your domain is registered in the same place , then they could potentially transfer the domain away , leaving you with nothing .
If this is your first project , I suggest buying a domain name with the hosting provider you ’ll be using ( see further below for hosting tips ) .
It will make the process easier , and you can always transfer the domain to another company if needed .
Most hosts have an easy interface for buying domain names : Just search for something and follow the on -screen instructions .
When buying a domain , keep two things in mind .
If you ’re serious about branding and you have the funds , you might want to buy a number of TLDs with the same name .
That is , if you are registering mydomain.com , then you might want to buy the .net , .org , .info and the local version as well ( such as .co.uk ) .
You will also have the option to choose the length of your registration , the default being one year .
There has been some debate and uncertainty about how domain age and registration factor into search engine optimization ( SEO ) .
Matt Cutts , a Google engineer , has said , “ I would n’t worry too much about that , ” which probably means you really should n’t .
Again , if you have the funds , registering for five or six years is a lot more convenient .

The Difference Hosting and Domain Registration
Before moving on , I want to make the distinction between domain registration and hosting very clear .
They are two completely separate things ; many companies just happen to offer both as a service .
The situation is similar to city parking garages that also offer cars for sale .
You could buy a car from one of them and also store your car in their garage , but you could also store your car in another garage because the car is legally yours .
Hosting is essentially a place to put your website ’s files .
Registering a domain means you ’ve gained legal ownership of a piece of Internet real estate .
WordPress.com And WordPress.org
If you ’re new to this , you might be confused about the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org .
To clear this up , let ’s start with what WordPress is .
WordPress is an open - source software package and is free to everyone around the world .
WordPress.org is the central location for the WordPress software project .
You can download it , view the documentation , ask and answer questions in the forums and more .
WordPress.com is a service that offers websites that run on WordPress .
You can sign up for a free account and get a fully functioning website .
You will only be able to use a WordPress.com subdomain — such as mywebsite.wordpress.com — but for a first - time user , the restrictions are minimal .
The situation is somewhat similar to digging a water well .
In my country , it is fairly common to have water close to ground level , which is great for watering your garden for free and not stressing the municipal water system .
You could dig a well for yourself if you have the machinery and the know - how , but you could also get a professional to do it .
You ’re not actually paying for the water or the well itself — you ’re paying for the service of forming the well .
This is just like WordPress.com .
You ’re not paying to use WordPress the software .
You ’re paying for use of a subdomain , file hosting and management of the software ( which is kept up to date automatically ) .
If you want to test the waters and get started with WordPress with minimal fuss , then WordPress.com is a great way to go !
The free version gives you everything you need .
When you ’re ready to step into the realm of advanced customization , with your own domain name and other options , then you can go for the premium version or get your own hosting plan elsewhere .
Choosing A Hosting Package
Choosing a hosting package can be difficult , even for seasoned veterans of the ’net .
In this article , I ’ll omit options that are clearly for huge websites or ones with highly customized needs .
Switching hosts is easy enough , so you can change at any time .
There are three ways to go if you ’re looking for a good package :
Shared hosting ,
VPS hosting ,
managed WordPress hosting .
The one you pick will depend on your website ’s needs and your funds .
Let ’s look at what these are and their pros and cons .
Shared hosting
Shared hosting is an attractive option because of economies of scale .
A single server can house hundreds of websites , which translates to hundreds of users .
A single server is not that expensive to run , so the costs can be split between all users of the server .
Because of this , you will see shared plans for around $ 5 a month .
While this is a great price to get started , there are numerous downsides — the largest of which is the bad - neighbor effect .
Because hundreds of websites are running from the same hardware , what happens if there ’s a coding bug in one of them that causes it to use up to 80 % of available memory ?
The remaining websites ( which could be hundreds ) will grind to a halt and could become unavailable .
The same issue arises with security ; some attacks aim for a single website and end up affecting all of the other websites on the same server .
This boils down to decreased security and poorer uptime .
What ’s most frustrating is that these problems are unpredictable .
The only reason to use Shared hosting is if you are on a very tight budget and every dollar counts .
It can work just fine , and your website will probably not go down for hours or days on end .
Still , your website going down just as a potential client is viewing it could ruin a potential deal .
If you think Shared hosting is for you , then a number of companies are available to choose from .
I recommend testing the support services of these companies ; with shared hosts , these can be your most important asset .
We ’ve partnered with InMotion Hosting to bring you a great price on their fast and reliable hosting services .
InMotion Hosting provides WordPress for free and is easily installed on any of their plans .
Transferring an existing website is also easy !
Click here or anywhere that says shared hosting in this article to check out their plans and get started !
VPS Hosting
A virtual private server ( or VPS ) is similar to a shared environment , without the negative side effects .
The hardware is still shared , but usually among a few users only , and the hardware is partitioned equally .
Another account on the same server cannot use up to 80 % of the resources .
If four accounts are on the server , each one may use only 25 % of the assets .
This effectively takes care of the unpredictability issues .
Attackers also have much more trouble accessing other accounts on the server through a single website .
It is possible in very rare cases , but it is not something you should worry about .
Because you have your own corner of a server , you are free to do more with your account than you can with a shared host .
This includes more server administration options , installation of tools , SSH access and more .
While some VPS accounts cost $ 5 , you will generally pay around $ 15 to $ 20 per month .
If you have the money , then definitely do choose either managed WordPress hosting or a VPS over a shared environment .
VPS gives you the most flexibility out of the bunch .
If you plan on trying out other content management systems , such as Joomla , Drupal or Laravel , then managed WordPress hosting is out of the question because it supports only WordPress .
In a nutshell , if you ’d like to be able to meddle with your server , install other packages and learn about your server , then go for a VPS .
A bunch of VPS providers are out there .
Here are some of the best - reviewed ones :
Managed WordPress Hosting
Managed WordPress hosting is a bit different because it ’s not a different way of using server technology .
A managed WordPress package is actually very similar to getting a website from WordPress.com , which itself can be considered a managed WordPress host .
In this case , the server ’s entire architecture is tuned to work with WordPress as efficiently as possible .
From memory to processors to server software and server - level caching , everything is geared to a single software package : WordPress .
This makes your website a lot faster and more secure as well .
Automatic updates , server - level caching and truly professional WordPress - specific support are just some of the benefits of managed WordPress hosting .
The downside is a minor loss of flexibility .
You ca n’t install any other platforms on these systems , and some plugins might be disabled by the host , usually for reasons of security or optimization .
In short , you have less leg room than with a VPS .
Again , if you ’re new to websites , you need n’t worry much about this .
If you do n’t want to meddle with server settings and you just need a well - oiled WordPress website that is maintained for you , then this hosting solution is a great option .
You wo n’t need to muck about with installing WordPress and making sure it is safe , secure and fast ; all of that is built right in .
You can start creating content within minutes and focus on what really matters .
WordPress hosts are becoming increasingly popular .
The best - known and best - rated ones are these :
Setting Up A Domain
By now , you should have a hosting package and a domain name .
If you ’ve bought a domain through your hosting provider , then you can probably skip this step because it is taken care of automatically .
The domain needs to be pointed to the hosting provider so that when someone accesses it through their browser , they are directed to the appropriate server .
This is most often done using nameservers , sometimes referred to as account DNS .
You ’ll need to log into the website that you registered your domain with and change the nameservers for the domain .
With Media Temple , you can add nameservers using a simple form .

Your host will tell you what nameservers to specify .
My SiteGround account has the following information :
ns1.am20.siteground.biz ( 107.6.152.202 ) ns2.am20.siteground.biz ( 181.224.143.216 )
Whenever you change your nameservers , you will have to wait up to 72 hours for them to take effect .
The lag will also depend on where you are relative to the server .
I ’ve found that if the server is in the US and I ’m in Europe , the website will work fine within a couple of hours when viewed from within the US .
The changes usually take more time to propagate overseas .
Websites and Domains
Nowadays , especially with managed WordPress hosting , you might be a bit confused about how to add a website to your host .
You might be able to add multiple WordPress installations without ever seeing a screen asking “ What domain do you want ? ”
This can work in many ways .
Let ’s look at a specific way to understand the difference between websites and domains .
Let ’s assume you have a fresh managed WordPress account .
You can probably add multiple websites , and all you ’d be asked is the name of the WordPress installation and your user details .
Once this website is created , it can already be reached , usually through a subdomain , like wnub234.wpengine.com .
This allows you to fully set up the website without even owning a domain .
If you want to refer to the website with your own domain , like awesomesite.com instead of the ugly wnub234.wpengine.com , then you will need to add a domain and assign it to the website .
The last step is to make sure you set the nameservers of your domain to the nameservers of your host .
This way , users will be routed to the correct website when accessing the domain .
Installing WordPress
If you have a managed WordPress host , you ’ll be able to do this by filling out a simple form .
Depending on your account type , you might be able to add any number of WordPress installations to your account .
With Kinsta , you ’d fill out a quick form and then you ’d be done :

If you have a shared or a VPS account , then you have two choices : one - click installation or manual installation .
Many hosts offer WordPress installation tools to minimize the work in this step .
Apps available for automated installation .
( View large version )
If you need to take the manual root , do n’t worry :
It ’s not difficult !
All you ’ll need to do is download WordPress , upload all of the files to your domain ’s folder , create a database , point your browser to the domain and follow the on -screen instructions .
The WordPress Codex has a complete installation guide .
If you ’re stuck or need help creating a database , take a look at it and you ’ll be done in no time !

A Note About WordPress
It ’s time to get our hands dirty and start setting up our actual website from within WordPress .
First , I want to mention a couple of things about how WordPress works .
I ’m sure you ’ll notice that many people say they dislike WordPress for various reasons , such as bad security , a theme not working or their website becoming very slow .
In reality , WordPress is a great system — just like many other systems , no matter how small or large the website .
The problems you hear about , like poor security , pages grinding to a halt or a bad user interfaces on the front end , are almost exclusively due to poorly coded plugins and themes .
As a result , the theme and plugins you choose matter a lot .
You know how some people have really slow computers and complain about them all day ?
Then you take a look and see that they ’ve installed every single piece of shady software available ?
The situation is kind of like that .
Coming across a theme or a plugin with malicious intent is pretty rare .
More often than not , the problems one creates are caused by sloppiness or insufficient knowledge of coding standards .
What this all boils down to is this :
Look for a theme and plugins with good reviews , a sizeable user base and an active development team .
This will negate or minimize any negative impact on your website .
Choosing A Theme And Plugins
Choosing a theme is , in many ways , the most difficult task of all .
Plugins are usually more specific :
You install one to perform a single task .
While themes “ simply ” add the visuals for the front page , testing them can be more complex .
A theme has parts you might not think of testing , such as the 404 page , the search page , the archive and so on .
In addition , some themes boast a lot of features , like support for WooCommerce , bbPress and so on .
Code quality affects the speed of your website , which , along with the design , affects your users directly .
Depending on what type of website you have ( a personal blog , a store , a forum , etc. ) , you will also need some plugins .
These work in conjunction with your theme and WordPress ’ back end to provide specific functionality .
Let ’s go over a few common setups .
E-commerce
WooCommerce has become the standard plugin to use for e-commerce .
It contains everything you need to start an online business right out of the box .
WooCommerce is one of the most powerful e-commerce solutions .

Forums
bbPress is a powerful — if somewhat old - fashioned — plugin for forums .
Once it ’s installed , you and your users can create categories and threads and post replies .
Management is easy from within WordPress ’ administrative back end .

Social Network
WordPress even allows you to create your own social network with BuddyPress .
You get many of the same features you ’re used to on Facebook : profiles , groups , activity streams , notifications , friend connections , private messages and so on .

Selecting a Theme
Once you have your base plugins ( you can use any number of them together ) , I recommend adding some content in the back end .
This will make it much easier to gauge your theme .
If you ’re using bbPress , create some forums , threads and answers .
Create multiple users and answer different questions with each of them .
If you ’re using WooCommerce , add some products with nice images and fill out the details .
One limitation is that you wo n’t know the capabilities of these plugins .
This makes testing nearly impossible , especially if you ’re also trying to get to grips with a theme .
My recommendation is this .
If you are new to WordPress or a particular plugin , always test it using a default theme , such as Twenty Fifteen .
Twenty Fifteen is particularly good because it is a clean , minimal theme that is coded by the WordPress team and supports all plugins .
Not all features will look perfect , but functionality - wise you will be able to test everything .
Once you understand the theme and the plugin , you can choose a different theme and test the waters there .
You ’ll notice any missing functionality and any unstyled elements .
What I ’ve noticed during my 10 years of working with WordPress is that there is almost no such thing as a perfect theme , just as there is no such thing as a perfect line of clothing in a large apparel store .
You might like a coat better if it was an inch longer or like your shoes more if they had a subtly different curve .
The only way to get truly perfect clothes is to have them made specifically for you , which is extremely expensive .
The same with WordPress themes .
The reason they are usually not perfect is because they are made to serve a large user base .
If a theme is perfect for you , then it probably lacks features for other people .
You can get a perfect theme if you get a developer to make one for you , but that is expensive .
At the beginning , I suggest settling for a 90 % perfect theme .
In many cases , what a website owner perceives as being imperfect does not make much of a difference to users .
Website speed and easy navigation count for far more than visual perfection .
Get a theme that is close enough , and tweak it using settings and plugins .
Perhaps get a developer to make tiny modifications , but do n’t dwell on it too much .
You can always switch themes or get a theme made for you when you have the funds .
There are some guidelines for choosing a good theme , many of which you can tick off with some research .
The basics are these :
good design , including strong readability and easy navigation ;
solid , secure and speedy code ;
compatibility with the latest version of WordPress ;
active development ;
compatibility with popular plugins ;
support and documentation .
Premium and Free Themes
Contrary to popular belief , free themes are n’t of lower quality than premium themes .
You ’ll find amazing and horrible themes in both categories .
It comes down to the effort of the coding team behind the theme , not the price tag .
In many cases , assessing the quality of a premium theme is easier .
Because people have paid money for it , they will be much more likely to rate and comment on the theme than users of free themes .

Essential Plugins
In this section , I thought I ’d show you some great plugins that many WordPress users install without thinking .
Some of these are great for displaying content , some of them add social features , some of them secure your website , and some are just plain helpful .

Dropbox Backup and Restore
Backing up and restoring will be a large part of your efforts related to security .
Dropbox Backup & Restore automates this task for you .
It creates a full backup of all of your files and your database , either locally or to Dropbox .
Whatever backup solution you use , make sure to store your backups off the server .
If the hard drive of your server fails , then your backups will disappear as well , of course .

VaultPress
While not free , my favourite plugin for backing up is VaultPress .
It was created by the good people at Automattic , the company that manages WordPress , which means it integrates with the system completely .
It ties together with a backup service that takes care of everything automatically .
You do n’t even have to click “ Back up ” ; the task runs on schedule , and you can restore everything with a single click .
Plans start at $ 5 a month , which is a bargain if you rely on your website to make money .
In addition to the backup service , the plugin also keeps tabs on your website ’s security and visitor statistics .
Akismet
Akismet comes preinstalled with all WordPress installations .
It is a plugin tied to a service that ensures your website ’s comments section remains spam free .
The power of Akismet is that it is cloud - based .
It uses data gathered about spammers across millions of websites to provide more effective spam protection than anything you could do locally .
Using Akismet is free , but please consider going for the paid option if you rely on your website to make money .
Akismet is a great service and deserves some love , too !
W3 Total Cache
Caching can speed up a website considerably by serving static pages instead of dynamic ones .
A single post will generally not change , unless you update the post or someone posts a comment .
This kind of page can be saved as is , and WordPress will be able to serve the saved version much faster than by assembling the page using server - side code and database queries each time .
Whenever the page does change , the saved version is updated .
W3 Total Cache is a well - known and high - performance caching solution that brings the best out of your website .
Note that you can tweak a lot of settings , and in rare cases some of them could slow down your website .
If you look at the documentation and manipulate only a few things at a time , everything will be just fine .
The number of subpages shows how many options there are !

Jetpack
Jetpack is a monster plugin that has become so feature - rich that it actually takes up more space than WordPress itself .
This is not a problem because it provides some genuinely great functionality .
From contact forms to social - sharing buttons to improved galleries , Jetpack offers a huge range of features .
Ninja Forms
If you want to add a contact form or any sort of information - gathering form to your website , you have a number of options , one of which is Ninja Forms .
You can set up all of the fields you need , add CAPTCHAs and other security measures , and then wait for the responses to flow .
Best of all , responses are not only sent your way via email ; they are stored in WordPress for future reference !
The contact form on my website is powered by Ninja Forms .

i Themes Security
One aspect of security is backing up ; another is actively preventing threats .
This is where a plugin like iThemes Security comes in .
It monitors user logins , adds two - factor authentication , sets passwords to expire , monitors files for changes , obscures parts of the website to hide them from malicious code and much more !
Most features are set - and - forget , so you can set up the plugin once and be a lot safer as a result !
i Themes Security rates alerts according to priority .
( View large version )
The List Goes On
Thousands upon thousands of plugins are in the repository for any scenario you could think of .
Every plugin I ’ve mentioned has dozens of alternatives that you might like better .
It pays to try new things and keep your eyes open !
Look at reviews , the latest release date , the developer ’s website , documentation and the product itself to gauge whether one is right for you .
And do n’t forget :
You can change a plugin any time if you are n’t happy !
Keeping WordPress Secure
We ’ve covered many of the basics with the backup and security plugins mentioned above , but I want to dedicate a section to some simple rules to follow , because getting this right is so important .
Hackers always follow the path of least resistance .
They look for common flaws that are easy to exploit .
In fact , you can probably get by all right by following these two simple rules :
Always keep WordPress and all plugins and themes up to date .
Always use strong passwords , and change your passwords every couple of months .
If you follow these rules , you will bypass 99 % of all attempts on your website .
To circumvent the remaining 1 % , you can use a variety of tactics , some of them simple , some requiring a bit more work .
Smashing Magazine has a pretty extensive article on securing your WordPress website .
If you are worried about security or want to do more , take a look .
Essential Pages
Now that everything is set up , you can finally start adding content !
While what you add is up to you , there are some usual bits of content , even some that you may be forced to have by law .
Home Page
The home page is the most difficult to make .
WordPress allows you to create a static page or a dynamic page .
The default is a dynamic page that lists your ten most recent posts .
If you ’re creating an online resume or a corporate website , then you might prefer to present details about yourself or the company .
In this case , create a page in WordPress and set it as the home page in the “ Settings ” → “ Reading ” section .
About Page
An “ About ” page appears on almost all websites .
For a personal website or blog , it can be used to tell your story , allowing users to get to know you .
For a corporate website , it would contain more information about the company .
Do n’t underestimate the power of this page !
While you might not think that the information on there is fun , important or useful , your followers and fans might well think otherwise .
If you ’re applying for a job or working as a freelancer , your employer might just have a look .
If they are looking for someone detail - oriented , then they will look at every nook and cranny of your website to make sure it all holds up !
If you want people to reach you , then a contact page could well be the way to go .
You can use Ninja Forms to create a form and show your basic contact information .
Many pages use Google Maps to indicate a location .
This is available via a plugin such as Simple Google Maps Short Code , or you can use Google Maps ’ embedding functionality .
Required E- Commerce Pages
If you want to sell products online , you might be required by law or by your payment processor to publish certain pages .
These usually include the following :
terms of service ,
refund policy ,
privacy policy ,
contact details .
Some of this information can be added to a single page , but one thing ’s for sure :
Many payment providers will not approve your website unless they see this information somewhere .
In addition to appeasing payment processors , you should actually give this content a close read and make sure you can deliver on your promises .
Visitors will feel safer knowing they are protected by a privacy and refund policy .
Cookie Handling
In the European Union , a “ cookie law ” has been passed that requires websites to provide visitors with information about how cookies are used .
You could phrase it to convey that usage of the website implies consent , but an information page about cookies is a good idea .
If you need information about the cookie law , Optanon ’s page has everything you need to understand and comply with this law .
A bunch of plugins display a cookie information bar on your website without much hassle .
Take a look and implement one if you ’re based in the EU .
Website Analytics
Analytics for websites are a multi- pronged tool .
They can be used to approach potential advertisers , to increase the value of your website and to provide insight into your visitors ( which can lead to optimization ) — and they ’re fun !
Advanced tools such as Google Analytics track the number of visitors , where they come from , how long they stay , how many pages they visit and so on .
Location analytics in Google Analytics .
( View large version )
You can create an account with Google Analytics for free and use a plugin such as Google Analytics Dashboard for WP to add your tracking code and to display analytics data right there in the back end .
Using Analytics Data
Using analytics data and acting on it could be ( and is ) the subject of multiple books .
Instead , I just want to share some basic thoughts on how to start using it .
Once some data is coming in , you ’ll start to notice trends .
You ’ll see when your website tends to get the most visits and when it gets the least .
Use this data to your advantage .
Post new content when you get a lot of visitors , and schedule maintenance and downtime during off periods .
If you ’ve made a change to your website or published a particularly promising bit of content , keep track of your statistics to see the effect .
If visits go up , then you know you ’ve done something right ; if they go down , something might be wrong .
If you ’re interested in learning more , Smashing Magazine has a guide to Google Analytics ready for you !
Summary
Creating the perfect website is not an easy task , nor is it a done deal .
The perfect website requires time and continual work to keep it that way .
There ’s always something to optimize , trends to keep up with , security issues to worry about .
If you plan on being in business for years to come , prepare yourself .
Your website will go down at some point for some unknown reason ; the code and design will get old at some point ; and you will find bugs with time .
Perfecting a website entails putting services in place to handle such problems : a content and database backup , a maintenance theme , a good developer and designer , and so on .
Do n’t worry if you do n’t have everything in place to make your website perfect .
Start out as best as you can .
Above all else , a perfect website requires experience , which you can only get by giving things a go and sticking around .
Born in San Francisco and raised throughout northern California , Eastwood attended Los Angeles City College under the G. I. Bill and served as mayor of Carmel , California from 1986 to 1988 .
In the first place , I was taller than most kids in my classes .
In the second , we were always moving .
Redding .
Sacramento .
Pacific Palisades .
Back to Redding .
Back to Sacramento .
Over to Hayward .
Niles .
Oakland .
So we were constantly on the road , and I was always the new guy in school .
The bullies always thought , Here 's this big gangly guy .
We gotta take him on .
You know how kids are .
We gotta test him .
I was a shy kid .
But a lot of my childhood was spent punching the bullies out .
I kind of had a feeling " Make my day " would resonate , based upon " Do you feel lucky , punk ? " in the first movie .
I thought that Smith & Wesson line might hang in there , too .
But " Make my day " was just so simple .
I still get it a lot .
As you get older , you 're not afraid of doubt .
Doubt is n't running the show .
You take out all the self - agonizing .
What can they do to you after you get into your seventies ?
Even in grammar school they taught you to go with your first impression .
It 's like multiple - choice questions .
If you go back and start dwelling , you 'll talk yourself out of it and make the wrong pick .
That 's just a theory .
I 've never seen any studies on it .
But I believe it .
As Jerry Fielding used to say , " We 've come this far , let 's not ruin it by thinking . "
My father had a couple of kids at the beginning of the Depression .
There was not much employment .
Not much welfare .
People barely got by .
People were tougher then .
We live in more of a pussy generation now , where everybody 's become used to saying , " Well , how do we handle it psychologically ? "
In those days , you just punched the bully back and duked it out .
Even if the guy was older and could push you around , at least you were respected for fighting back , and you 'd be left alone from then on .
The band guys were looked down upon when I was a kid .
I remember playing the flügelhorn and everybody said , " What the ...? "
I do n't know if I can tell you exactly when the pussy generation started .
Maybe when people started asking about the meaning of life .
If I 'd had good discipline , I might have gone into music .
You wonder sometimes .
What will we do if something really big happens ?
Look how fast -- seven years -- people have been able to forget 9/11 .
Maybe you remember if you lost a relative or a loved one .
But the public can get pretty blasé about stuff like that .
Nobody got blasé about Pearl Harbor .
I remember buying a very old hotel in Carmel .
I went into an upper attic room and saw that all the windows were painted black .
" What was going on here ? " I asked the prior owners .
They said they thought the Japanese were off the coast during the war .
The Korean War was only a few years after World War II .
We all went .
But you could n't help but think , Shit .
What the hell ?
What have we gained ?
One minute you 're unleashing the tremendous power of nuclear fission , and then a few years later you 're jockeying back and forth on the 38th parallel .
It seemed so futile .
In Changeling , I tried to show something you 'd never see nowadays -- a kid sitting and looking at the radio .
Just sitting in front of the radio and listening .
Your mind does the rest .
I remember going to a huge waterfall on a glacier in Iceland .
People were there on a rock - platform overlook to see it .
They had their kids .
There was a place that was n't sealed off , but it had a cable that stopped anybody from going past a certain point .
I said to myself , You know , in the States they'd have that hurricane - fenced off , because they 're afraid somebody 's gonna fall and some lawyer 's going to appear .
There , the mentality was like it was in America in the old days :
If you fall , you 're stupid .
You can't stop everything from happening .
But we 've gotten to a point where we 're certainly trying .
If a car does n't have four hundred air bags in it , then it 's no good .
My father died very suddenly at sixty - three .
Just dropped dead .
For a long time afterward , I 'd ask myself , Why did n't I ask him to play golf more ?
Why did n't I spend more time with him ?
But when you 're off trying to get the brass ring , you forget and overlook those little things .
It gives you a certain amount of regret later on , but there 's nothing you can do about it .
So you just forge on .
Smaller details are less important .
Let 's get on with the important stuff .
I 've got a good crew that is very familiar with me .
I do n't have to say a lot to 'em .
We just set up the shot , and I depend on everybody to do their parts .
I just say , " Okay .... "
What happened is I was going to college in 1950 .
L. A. City College .
A guy I knew was going to an acting class on Thursday nights .
He started telling me about all the good - lookin ' chicks and said , " Why do n't you go with me ? "
So I probably had some motivation beyond thoughts of being an actor .
And sure enough , he was right .
There were a lot of girls and not many guys .
I said , " Yeah , they need me here . "
I wound up at Universal as a contract player .
People love westerns worldwide .
There 's something fantasylike about an individual fighting the elements .
Or even bad guys and the elements .
It 's a simpler time .
There 's no organized laws and stuff .
The last one I did was in ' 92 .
Unforgiven .
That was a wonderful script .
But it seemed like it was the end of the road for me with the genre , because it sort of summarized everything I felt about the western at that particular time .
I had an issue before the council .
I remember getting up , and there was a lady who sat and knitted the whole time , never looked up .
" No , no , no , " she said .
And I thought ,
This ca n't be .
When you 're elected , you have to at least pretend like you 're interested in what people are there for .
How do you have the chutzpah to just sit there , not pay attention , not interact at all ?
It needed to be corrected .
Winning the election is a good - news , bad - news kind of thing .
Okay , now you 're the mayor .
The bad news is , now you 're the mayor .
It 's making sure that the words " public servant " are not forgotten .
That 's why I did it .
' Cause I thought , I do n't need this .
The fact that I did n't need it made me think I could do more .
It 's the people who need it that I 'm suspect of .
Barack Obama was unimaginable back when I was a kid .
Count Basie and a lot of big bands would come through Seattle when I was young .
They could play at a club , but they could n't frequent the place .
When you listen to Ray Charles , there 's never any doubt whose voice that is .
You should really get to know somebody , really be a friend .
I mean , my wife is my closest friend .
Sure , I 'm attracted to her in every way possible , but that 's not the answer .
Because I 've been attracted to other people , and I could n't stand 'em after a while .
I 'm past doing one chin - up more than I did the day before .
I just kind of do what I feel like .
I have children by other women .
I gotta give Dina the credit for bringing everyone together .
She never had the ego thing of the second wife .
The natural instinct might have been to kill off everybody else .
You know , the cavewoman mentality .
But she brought everybody together .
She 's friendly with my first wife , friendly to former girlfriends .
She went out of her way to unite everybody .
She 's been extremely influential in my life .
I 'm not one of those guys who 's been terribly active in organized religion .
But I do n't disrespect it .
I 'd never try to impose any doubts that I might have on anyone else .
A good joke is a good joke whenever .
But my kids make me laugh now .
Children teach you that you can still be humbled by life , that you learn something new all the time .
That 's the secret to life , really -- never stop learning .
It 's the secret to career .
I 'm still working because I learn something new all the time .
It 's the secret to relationships .
Never think you 've got it all .
As you get older , you like kids a lot more .
The innocence of childhood is like the innocence of a lot of animals .
Kids piercing themselves , piercing their tongues -- what kind of masochism is that ?
Is it to show you can just take it ?
No , I do n't have to practice that grunt .
You just do it .
Once you 're in character , you 're in character .
You do n't sit there purposely thinking , Well , I 'll grunt here , or I 'll groan there .
That 's why I do n't rehearse a lot and why I shoot a lot immediately .
I have ideas of where I 'd like to take the character , but we both end up going together .
We were doing In the Line of Fire , and John Malkovich was on top of the building , and he has me in a real precarious situation .
My character is crazed and he pulls out a gun and sticks it into John 's face , and John puts his mouth over the end of the gun .
Now , I do n't know what kind of crazy symbol that was .
We certainly did n't rehearse anything like that .
I 'm sure he did n't think about it while we were practicing it .
It was just there .
Like Sir Edmund Hillary talking about why you do anything : Because it 's there .
That 's why you climb Everest .
It 's like a little moment in time , and as fast as it comes into your brain , you just throw it out and discard it .
Do it before you discard it , you know ?
It keeps coming back to " We 've come this far , let 's not ruin it by thinking . "
You look at Velázquez in his dark years and you wonder , How the hell did he get that way ?
I 'm sure he did n't say to himself , " I 'm in my dark period right now , so I 'm going to paint this way . "
He just did it .
That 's when real art gets a chance to come into play .
Million Dollar Baby won the Academy Award .
That was nice , that was great .
But you do n't dwell on it .
An awful lot of good pictures have n't won Academy Awards , so it does n't have much bearing .
Letters from Iwo Jima was nominated for an Academy Award .
We did n't win it , but that picture was still as good as I could do it .
Did it deserve it less than some other picture ?
No , not really .
But there are other aspects that come into it .
In the end , you 've just got to be happy with what you 've done .
There you are .

1 Introduction
This document describes all there is to know about Ada in Debian .
Most of it contains my personal thoughts and opinions , although I try to get the facts straight .
I would appreciate it if you could send me corrections or additions at ludovic@ludovic-brenta.org .
After posting the first draft , I received numerous comments to improve this document .
In particular , I would like to thank Dan Eilers of Irvine Compiler Corporation for providing me with details about GCC .
Other contributors include Simon Wright , Ed Falis , Georg Bauhaus , Bob Rogers , and Stephe Leake .
Each chapter and appendix in this Policy is either informative or normative .
Normative chapters contain binding rules that all packages compiled from Ada sources must follow ; informative chapters only contain useful information .
2 Background information
( This chapter is informative )
2.1 History of GNAT
GNAT started as the GNU New - York University Ada Translator in 1994 .
Under a contract with the US Department of Defense , a team at NYU started writing GNAT as a reference implementation of the then upcoming Ada 95 ISO standard .
The contract mandated the use of the GNU General Public Licence for the compiler .
After the Ada 95 standard was published , various corporations and DoD services started using GNAT in mission - critical projects , and asked for support .
The authors of GNAT formed AdaCore to meet these needs and further develop GNAT .
Today , AdaCore has offices in New York ( http://www.adacore.com) and Paris ( http://www.adacore.fr).
GNAT is still free software under the GPL .
AdaCore offers commercial support for it and continues development .
Over the years , several institutions contributed software to complement GNAT .
For example , the Ecole Nationale Superieure de Telecommunications in Paris contributed GLADE , an implementation of Annex E ( Distributed Systems ) for GNAT .
AdaCore commercially supports most of these contributions , and distributes them together with GNAT to supported customers .
As a result , at one point , the GNAT acronym stood for GNU Ada Technology .
Nowadays it is no longer considered an acronym .
2.2
The variants of GNAT
There are several places to get GNAT from , and different GNATs which , for lack of a better word , I call “ variants ” .
Each has a different binary interface from the others ; it is therefore not possible to link object files produced by different variants into an executable ; nor is it possible to link an executable produced by one variant with libraries produced by another .
The variants of GNAT are :
GNAT Pro , commercially supported and actively maintained by AdaCore ( http://www.adacore.com).
New releases are frequent but provided only to paying customers , under the GNAT - Modified GPL described below .
AdaCore runs a test suite comprising more than 10,000 tests against this compiler , every night , on every supported platform .
This test suite consists not only of the ACATS ( the official ISO standard test suite for validated Ada compilers ) but also of test cases for all bug reports ever submitted to AdaCore .
This test suite thus ensures that no bug is ever reintroduced .
GNAT
Pro is being enhanced to implement the Ada 2005 standard ; the new features are refined as the draft standard itself evolves .
If you require GNAT Pro for professional work , please contact AdaCore at sales@adacore.com .
The Public versions of GNAT ( “ p ” releases ) .
From time to time , AdaCore used to release a stable version of GNAT to the public at no cost and under the GNAT - Modified GPL .
These releases benefited from bug fixes sent to paying customers , and underwent the same extensive test suite as GNAT Pro but were not supported by AdaCore .
The last “ p ” release is GNAT 3.15 p in October 2002 .
This is the default Ada compiler in Debian 3.1 “ Sarge ” .
It is still possible to download gnat 3.15 p source and binaries for various platforms from mirrors such as Ada-Belgium and SourceForge .
The FSF variant of GNAT .
This is the Ada front - end which has been distributed as part of GCC since version 3.1 .
From GCC 3.1 to 4.3 , the license terms of the run-time library are the GNAT - Modified GPL .
For 4.4 and later , the licence terms are GPL version 3 with GCC Runtime Library Exception which is similar in spirit to the GMGPL .
The GNAT Academic Programme ( GAP ) allows registered academics ( i.e. university professors and their students ) to obtain a copy of GNAT Pro , with support , at no cost .
However , in newer ( 2005 and later ) releases , the license terms of the run-time library changed to pure GPL .
Thus , binaries produced with this variant can only be distributed under GPL .
The GNAT GPL Edition is similar to the GNAT Academic Programme but is available to the general public from AdaCore ’s Libre Software site .
This Edition replaces the former “ p ” releases and receives no support from AdaCore .
The GNAT - Modified GPL is the GPL version 2 with the following text added to each source file :
As a special exception , if other files instantiate generics from this unit or you link this unit with other files to produce an executable , this unit does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License .
This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU Public License .
Starting with GCC 4.4 , the library source files grant the GCC Run-time library exception by means of the following language :
As a special exception under Section 7 of GPL version 3 , you are granted additional permissions described in the GCC Runtime Library Exception , version 3.1 , as published by the Free Software Foundation .
Thus , the GNAT - Modified GPL permits the distribution of proprietary software linked with the GNAT run-time library , libgnat .
The pure GPL disallows this , as any binary linked with a GPL library must also be distributed under GPL or not at all .
This does not apply to your source text : your source program is not linked with libgnat , therefore you can distribute it under whichever licensing terms you choose , even non-disclosure agreements .
2.3 Timeline of GNAT releases
2.3.1 GNAT Pro releases
Announced Release Based on 2003-02-18 3.16a GCC 2.8.1 2003-07-01 3.16a1 GCC 2.8.1 2003-08-21 5.01a GCC 3.2.3 2004-02-26 5.02a GCC 3.2.3 2005-02-21 5.03a GCC 3.4.1 2006-01-30 5.04 GCC 3.4.4 2006-05-09 5.05 GCC 3.4.6 2007-03-07 6.0.1 GCC 4.1.3 2008-03-05 6.1.1 GCC 4.1.3 2009-02-11 6.2.1 GCC 4.3.3 2010-02-09 6.3.1 GCC 4.4.2 2011-02-16 6.4.1 GCC 4.5.3 2012-02-28 7.0.1 GCC 4.5.4 2013-04-23 7.1 GCC 4.7.3 2014-02-25 7.2 GCC 4.7.4
In addition to these full releases , supported customers sometimes receive a “ wavefront ” release , with “ w ” in their version number , e.g. 5.02w .
As the name suggests , the “ wavefront ” changes constantly as GNAT evolves .
Version 6.0.1 is the first to officially support the full Ada 2005 standard .
It also uses an almost conventional three - component version numbering scheme in which the micro number is 0 for a beta release , 1 for a first production release , and 2 or greater for a bug - fix release .
Version 7.0.1 is the first to officially support the full ( draft ) Ada 2012 standard .
Version 7.2 switches the default language to Ada 2012 and adds support for ARM Cortex processors running Android ( as a cross- compiler ) .
2.3.2 Public releases from AdaCore
The dates in this timeline are the timestamps of the source files for each release , as stored in the tar.gz archive .
These dates sometimes differ from the hardcoded “ release date ” which is visible with “ gnatgcc -v ” .

4.7.4
The GNAT GPL 2005 Edition changes the licensing terms of the run-time library to the pure GPL , thereby disallowing the distribution of non-GPL programs linked with this Edition ’s run-time library .
2.3.3 GNAT Academic Programme and GNAT GPL Edition
The GNAT Academic Programme started in 2004 .
Under this Programme , AdaCore made GNAT Pro available at no cost to registered academics .
On top of this , professors received support from AdaCore at no cost .
GAP versions 1.0 and 1.1 came with the full complement of tools and libraries then current for paying customers , all under GMGPL .
Subsequent releases are identical to the GNAT GPL releases starting with 2005 .
2.3.4 FSF releases
In October 2001 , AdaCore contributed their most recent GNAT Pro source code for the Ada 95 front - end and runtime library to the GCC source repository .
The first release of GCC that included GNAT was 3.1 in May 2002 .
After that , little activity took place on the Ada parts of GCC ; thus , GCC 3.1 , 3.2 and 3.3 contain essentially the same Ada front - end and library .
In October 2003 , after the second merge of GNAT Pro into GCC , AdaCore closed their own public CVS server , and started doing routine commits to the FSF ’s repository .
AdaCore only work on the main line of development ; this means that no , or very few changes take place in minor versions of GCC , and I do n’t show them in the table below .
This also means that AdaCore only merge from their internal repository during Stage 1 of the development cycle of each major release of GCC .
As a consequence , GNAT GPL , GNAT Pro and GCC all have different release cycles .
From the dates where Stage 1 ends , we can infer a rough correspondence between GNAT GPL and GCC releases but no GCC release is strictly equivalent to any GNAT GPL or GNAT Pro release .
Release date End of stage 1 Release Roughly equivalent to 2001 - 10 - 01 First merge into GCC - 2002-05-22 2001-10-15 3.1 - 2002-08 -14 ( see 3.1 ) 3.2 - 2003-05-13 2002-06-22 3.3 - 2004-04-18 3003-07-04 3.4 - 2003 -10 - 21 Second merge into GCC - 2005-04-20 2004-07-01 4.0 - 2006-02-28 2005-04-25 4.1 GNAT GPL 2005 2007-05-13 2006-01-18 4.2 GNAT GPL 2006 2008-03-05 2007-01-20 4.3 GNAT GPL 2007 2009-04-21 2008-09-01 4.4 GNAT GPL 2008 2010-04-14 2009-10-01 4.5 GNAT GPL 2009 2011-03-25 2010-11-03 4.6 GNAT GPL 2010 2012-03-22 2011-11-08 4.7 GNAT GPL 2011 2013-03-22 2012-11-06 4.8 GNAT GPL 2012 2014-04-22 2013-11-21 4.9 GNAT GPL 2014
GCC 3.4 has several new packages in the GNAT library , most notably a first version of the Ada 2005 container library , and also the “ limited with ” feature of Ada 2005 .
It also benefits from the new targets introduced in recent versions of GCC , such as AMD64 ( also known as x86 - 64 ) .
There are approximately 70 bug fixes relative to GCC 3.3 .
However , it also has a serious regression : it does not support tasking on powerpc -*- linux ( see ada /13897 ) .
A subset of ACATS 2.5 ( basically the executable tests but not the tests with intentional errors ) is included in GCC 3.4 and later .
GCC 3.4 passes all of these tests .
GCC 4.0 ’s Ada front - end restores tasking on powerpc , fixes about 100 bugs , and contains a newer version of the container library .
One very major change inside GCC 4.0 warranted the new major version number .
This change , called “ tree - SSA ” , is a new infrastructure for optimisers , and a new interface between front - ends and the back - end of the compiler .
This required updating all the language front - ends .
Unfortunately , these changes introduced some bugs too , including a few ACATS failures .
GCC 4.1 ’s Ada front - end contains a further 60 bug fixes , brings the Ada .
Containers library closer to the definitive Ada 2005 standard , and has a more mature interface to Tree - SSA .
The entire ACATS passes in this release .
This is the default Ada compiler in Debian 4.0 “ Etch ” .
In GCC 4.2 , the Ada run -time library provides many more packages from the new language standard , support AltiVec instructions on machines that support them , and a software emulation of AltiVec on machines that do n’t .
The compiler front - end supports more Ada 2005 features , in particular related to interfaces , tagged protected and tagged task types .
GCC 4.3 brings 110 bug fixes and several additional Ada 2005 packages ( e.g. Ada.Calendar .Formatting ) .
This is the default Ada compiler in Debian 5.0 “ Lenny ” .
GCC 4.4 has 40 more bug fixes and introduces support for multilib .
Multilib is the ability of the compiler to support more than one ABI on the same machine and to select from several corresponding versions of the run-time library .
Examples of machines supporting multilib include amd64 ( with i386 as secondary ) , sparc64 ( sparc32 as secondary ) , mips and mipsel ( with n64 , o32 and n32 ABIs ) .
Unfortunately , the Debian maintainers have not yet found the time and energy to add support for multilib in the Debian packages .
This is the default Ada compiler in Debian 6.0 “ Squeeze ” .
GCC 4.5 improves stack overflow detection ( enabled with - fstack - check ) , introduces a new version of the Partition Communications Subsystem of the Distributed Systems Annex and brings several more enhancements and bug fixes .
GCC 4.6 introduces preliminary support for Ada 2012 .
This is the default compiler in Debian 7.0 “ Wheezy ” .
GCC 4.8 adds several Ada 2012 packages like Ada.Containers .Synchronized_Queue_Interfaces and its various implementations .
GCC 4.9 completes the support for Ada 2012 and makes Ada 2012 the default mode of compilation ( i.e. one needs to specify - gnat05 explicitly to compile in Ada 2005 mode ) .
This will be the default compiler in Debian 8.0 “ Jessie ” .
2.4 ASIS , GLADE and Florist
ASIS is the Ada Semantic Interface Specification .
GNAT conforms to this Specification , and exposes the parse tree of programs , so that other programs can query and manipulate the parse tree .
The ASIS distribution comes with several such programs , for example “ gnatpp ” a pretty - printer or “ gnatelim ” which eliminates unused subprograms .
Third - party programs that take advantage of ASIS include the “ gch ” and “ adastyle ” style checkers , “ adabrowse ” the document generator , “ adasubst ” which does mass substitutions of identifier names , and “ adadep ” which manages dependencies between compilation units .
AdaCore make a source - only release of ASIS - for - GNAT as part of all GNAT Pro and GNAT GPL Editions but these releases are not coordinated with those of GCC .
Because of its nature , ASIS - for - GNAT is tightly integrated with the compiler , to the point that its source distribution contains parts of the compiler ’s internal run-time library .
Thus , building ASIS - for - GNAT with a release of GCC requires replacing this partial copy of GNAT GPL ’s run-time library with the corresponding parts of GCC .
To achieve this , Debian introduces packages ‘ libgnatvsn - dev ’ , ‘ libgnatvsnX.Y ’ and ‘ libgnatvsn - dbg ’ , licensed under GNAT - Modified GPL , which contain those parts of GCC required for ASIS .
These packages are built from the ‘ gnat - X.Y ’ source package .
GLADE is the Ecole Nationale de Telecommunications ’ implementation of the Distributed Systems annex ( Annex E ) of the Ada standard .
With GLADE , it is possible to write a set of programs that run on different machines and communicate by means of remote procedure calls and shared objects .
In Ada parlance , these programs are called “ partitions ” and the entire system is the “ program ” .
In 2008 , GLADE was superseded by PolyORB , a general middleware technology supporting not only Annex E but also CORBA , SOAP and several other specifications for distributed systems , all at the same time .
Florist is Florida State University ’s implementation of POSIX.5 standard , which allows Ada programs to use POSIX system services such as shared memory , pipes , and message queues .
All GNAT Pro , GAP , GPL and “ p ” releases of GNAT come with ASIS , GLADE or PolyORB , and Florist .
In contrast , FSF releases come with none of them .
Both GLADE and PolyORB rely on parts of GNAT ’s internal implementation , so porting them from a GPL Edition to GCC requires intimate knowledge of GNAT .
2.5 GDB , the GNU debugger
Because debugging information is in a standard format in object files , you can use GDB to debug programs written in any language .
However , special Ada support allows GDB to demangle names and to understand Ada syntax when displaying variables .
GNAT 3.15 p comes with a patched GDB 4.17 which understands Ada .
In 2003 , AdaCore released a similarly patched GDB 5.3 which understands Ada ; this is the gnat - gdb shipped as part of Debian 3.1 “ Sarge ” .
In GCC 3.4 , the default format for debugging information changed from STABS to DWARF2 .
This change breaks compatibility with GDB 5.3 ; it is possible to force GCC to use the old STABS format by compiling with the ‘ - gstabs + ’ option , like this :
‘ gnatmake - gstabs + my_program ’
As part of the GNAT GPL 2005 Edition ( 2005-09 - 15 ) , AdaCore released an updated patch to GDB 5.3 and also a new patch to GDB 6.3 , which understands DWARF2 natively and is the gnat - gdb in Debian 4.0 “ Etch ” .
AdaCore ’s patches were eventually merged into GDB .
Thus , GDB 6.7 can debug Ada programs out of the box .
As a consequence , starting with Debian 5.0 “ Lenny ” , there is no longer a need for a separate gnat - gdb package .
2.6 History of Ada standards
All Ada standards are freely available from http://www.adaic.org/ada-resources/standards/.
Ada , as an ISO standard , undergoes at least one review every 5 years .
The timeline of past standards is as follows :
1980 MIL - STD - 1815 1983 ANSI /MIL -STD -1815A 1987 Ada 83 : ISO / IEC 8652:1987 1995 Ada 95 : ISO / IEC 8652:1995 2001 Ada 95 Technical Corrigendum 1 2007 Ada 95 Amendment 1 aka Ada 2005 2012 Ada 2012 : ISO / IEC 8652:2012
MIL - STD - 1815 was numbered after the birth year of Lady Ada Lovelace , namesake of the language .
Ada 2012 became official on 2012 - 12 - 15 , five days after the 197th birthday of the Lady .
3 Ada and shared libraries
( This chapter is informative . )
This chapter discusses the general concept of shared libraries and shared object names ( “ sonames ” ) and binary compatibility .
Then it introduces the rules peculiar to the Ada programming language about source consistency and how these rules impact how to package Ada programs and libraries in Debian .
3.1 Package and shared object version numbers
This section explains the general concept of sonames , which apply to all programming languages ; if you are already familiar with it , you can skip to the next section which details the implications on Ada .
There are two version numbers associated with a library package ; the “ source ” version , and the “ shared object ” version .
They can be the same or they can be different .
The source version is what most users think of as “ the version ” ; it identifies the features of the package ; it is the same as the upstream ( non-Debian ) version , plus a Debian part ( the “ upload number ” ) .
The shared object version is part of the “ shared object name ” , or soname , of the library .
The soname mechanism first appeared in Unix System V Release 4 in 1990 and is designed to allow multiple incompatible versions of a shared library to be installed at the same time , for use by different binary programs .
By convention , the soname is of the form library_name .so. soversion ; the soversion part is the actual shared object version .
Note that applications ( as opposed to libraries ) do n’t need shared object versions ; they only have a source version .
The mechanism works in five steps :
1 . The linker creates the shared library and embeds the soname , as a string , in the header of the shared library file .
The soname is not necessarily the same as the name of the file ; for example :
$ gcc -o libfoo.so.1.2.3 $ ( object_files ) - Wl , -soname,libfoo.so.1
In this example , the name of the file contains the full shared object version number while the soname only contains the major part of it .
There is no requirement that this be the case .
2 . The package containing the shared library installs a symbolic link from the soname to the actual file name :
$ ln -s libfoo .
so.1.2.3 /usr/lib/libfoo.so.1
3 . The - dev package installs a second symlink to the shared library file ; this second symlink does not contain any version information :
$ ln -s libfoo .
so /usr/lib/libfoo.so.1
4 . When creating a binary application program , the linker follows the versionless symlink from step 3 to find the shared library , reads the soname , and encodes the soname in the binary program :
$ ld -o program - lfoo $ ldd program libfoo .
so.1 => /usr/lib/libfoo.so.1.2.3
5 . When the application program starts , the dynamic loader ( / lib/ld.so ) reads from the binary program the sonames of all libraries required and then looks for the shared libraries in its library path .
As explained above , the goal of this mechanism is to allow multiple versions of a library to coexist on a system .
To understand how this works , consider the following scenario .
3.1.1 Scenario : multiple versions of a library
Abe , a developer , installs the following packages on his machine :
libfoo - dev ( = 1.2.3 -1 ) libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3 -1 ) libfoo1 - dbg ( = 1.2.3-1 )
The shared object version of libfoo is 1 , while the source version is 1.2.3 - 1 .
Note that the development package name does not contain the shared object version .
Abe uses these packages to write an application program called books , which he packages as books ( = 1.0 - 1 ) .
Beth , a customer , installs the books package on her system , and the package manager also installs the required library libfoo1 :
libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3 - 1 ) books ( = 1.0 -1 )
When she runs the books program , the dynamic loader reads the file / usr / bin / books which says it depends on the shared library with the soname libfoo .
so.1 ; then it finds the symbolic link /usr / lib/ libfoo.so.1 , named after the soname , that points to the actual file containing the shared library , /usr/lib/libfoo.so.1.2.3 .
Much later , libfoo has been upgraded to shared object version 2 , source version 2.1 - 5 , and Charlie , another developer , installs these packages on his system :
libfoo - dev ( = 2.1 - 5 ) libfoo2 ( = 2.1 - 5 ) libfoo2 - dbg ( = 2.1 -5 )
Charlie then writes the program chaliesmusic which he packages .
Beth now installs the new package chaliesmusic which depends on libfoo2 ; she now has the following packages installed ( the Debian installer keeps all versions of binary libraries that are used by installed packages ) :
libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3 - 1 ) libfoo2 ( = 2.1 - 5 ) books ( = 1.0 - 1 ) chaliesmusic ( = 1.1 -3 )
All is well because the new version of the library coexists peacefully with the old one .
When books runs , it dynamically links with /usr/ lib/libfoo.so.1 ; when charliesmusic runs , it dynamically links with /usr/lib/libfoo.so.2 .
For this scenario to work , the two versions of the library must have different sonames , different package names and different file names ; these are all requirements of the Debian Policy for shared library packages ; see chapter 8 for full details .
3.1.2 Scenario : Upgrading a library
Suppose Beth has the following packages installed :
libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3 - 1 ) libfoo2 ( = 2.1 - 5 ) books ( = 1.0 - 1 ) chaliesmusic ( = 1.1 -3 )
Now the upstream developers of libfoo provide source version 2.2 and Abe , the developer of books , provides Beth with an updated version which requires libfoo2 ( = 2.2 - 1 ) .
The soname of this new version of libfoo is libfoo .
so. 2 ; it has not changed since version 2.1 ( more on this below ) .
Beth upgrades her system .
Because the package libfoo1 is no longer used , the package manager deletes it , so she ends up with :
libfoo2 ( = 2.2 - 1 ) books ( = 1.1 - 1 ) chaliesmusic ( = 1.1 -3 )
We know that books works well with the new version of libfoo2 because
Abe has tested it extensively ; however , will charliesmusic still work ?
For this the following conditions must hold :
The application programming interface ( API ) of libfoo must be stable between 2.1 - 5 and 2.2 - 1 .
That is , existing subprograms in the library may not change their semantics or parameter profile .
The new version may however add new subprograms without breaking its API .
If this is true , we say the new version is “ binary backward compatible ” with the old version .
The compiler that produced /usr/lib/libfoo.so.2.2 must assume the same ABI as the one that produced /usr / lib/libfoo.so.2.1 earlier .
The ABI includes the subprogram calling convention ( how parameters and return results are passed ) , name mangling scheme for overloaded subprogams , minimum alignment of objects ( 1 byte , 2 bytes , 4 bytes ) , exception propagation mechanism , object file format , etc .

The program charliesmusic may not rely on bugs in /usr / lib/libfoo.so.2.1 which are corrected in /usr /lib/libfoo.so.2.2 ( this is a particular case of a semantic change in the library ) .
3.2 Ada Library Information files
The Ada language definition ( RM 10.1.4 ( 5 ) ) requires that the compiler ensure consistency between all compilation units in a program in the sense that no out - of - date compilation unit can be part of the final binary executable .
A compilation unit becomes out of date when its source text changes or when it depends on a compilation unit that becomes out - of - date .
In Debian , the set of all compilation units in a program ( the “ closure ” ) consists of all the compilation units in the binary executable plus all those in the shared libraries used by the program .
Therefore , if a shared library changes , all shared libraries and binary executables depending on it become out of date in the Ada sense .
GNAT implements the requirement for consistency by means of Ada Library Information ( *.ali ) files containing text in a format and syntax particular to GNAT .
The format occasionally changes from one major version of GNAT to the next .
As part of the normal compilation process , GNAT creates one *.ali for each compilation unit .
This file contains 32 - bit checksums of the source files of the unit and of the entire closure of the unit , calculated over the entire source text of all units , ignoring white space and comments so that a comment - only source file change does not invalidate the corresponding compilation unit or units depending on it .
Note that upgrading the source for a shared library while preserving its soname and API breaks Ada ’s consistency rule ; the old application , which is consistent with the old source , is run with the new library , which is consistent with the new source .
However , this breakage is not detected by the binary program , since the dynamic linker is not aware of the Ada requirement .
We have seen above that this is not a problem for customers that use the binary files .
However , it is a problem for developers who compile , since they use the *.ali files .
Consider the following scenario .
3.2.1 Scenario : Indirectly causing a package to FTBFS
Abe , a developer , installs the following packages on his machine :
libconfig - dev ( = 1.0 - 1 ) libconfig1 ( = 1.0 - 1 ) libfoo - dev ( = 1.2.3 - 1 ) libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3-1 )
libfoo1 depends on libconfig1 .
Abe uses these packages to write an application program called books , which he packages as books ( = 1.0 - 1 ) .
Beth , a customer , installs the following packages on her system :
libconfig1 ( = 1.0 - 1 ) libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3 -1 ) books ( = 1.0 -1 )
Later , the package maintainer for libconfig - dev upgrades to source version 1.1 - 1 ; the *.ali files change .
The library API is the same , so the soname does not change .
However , the Debian maintainer of libfoo - dev has not yet upgraded it to use the latest libconfig sources .
Beth upgrades her system to :
libconfig1 ( = 1.1 - 1 ) libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3 -1 ) books ( = 1.0 -1 )
From Beth ’s point of view , all is well because books continues to run , even though the Ada rules say libconfig1 is not consistent with books .
Abe also upgrades his system and ends up with :
libconfig - dev ( = 1.1 - 1 ) libconfig1 ( = 1.1 - 1 ) libfoo - dev ( = 1.2.3 - 1 ) libfoo1 ( = 1.2.3-1 )
Now Abe has a problem when he rebuilds books and finds this error message :
gnatbind - shared - E - I- -x /tmp/books-1.0/obj/books.ali > error : " foo.adb " must be compiled > error : ( " /usr/lib/ada/adalib/config/config.ali " is obsolete and read - only )
This is because foo.adb , which is part of libfoo - dev , is now out of date at the source level .
This , in turn , is because the Ada package ‘ Foo ’ depends on ‘ Config ’ which changed when libconfig - dev changed source version .
Abe could decide that , because the source breakage does not affect Beth , the problem is minor .
However , Debian Policy disagrees with him .
It says that any package that fails to build from source has a serious ( release - critical ) bug .
Consequently , Daniel , who runs a daemon constantly rebuilding all packages in Debian , soon files such a bug against package books .
The problem , of course , is not in books ; it is that libfoo has not yet been rebuilt to incorporate the changes in libconfig .
The immediate fix for Abe ’s problem is to recompile libfoo , regenerating the libfoo *.ali files .
Note that this then requires recompiling any other libraries that depend on libfoo ; ultimately , all packages that depend directly or indirectly on libconfig must be recompiled , and their source version changed .
Because neither the API nor the ABI has changed , any libraries thus rebuilt can retain their sonames .
For the Debian repository , the updated packages should be uploaded in reverse dependency order , possibly by requesting binary - only non-maintainer uploads ( also known as “ binNMU ” in the Debian jargon ; see http://wiki.debian.org/binNMU).
The person who should request these binNMUs is the maintainer of libconfig , not Abe or Beth .
However , it is not generally possible for the maintainer of a library to discover all packages that build - depend on the library because some of these packages might not be in the Debian archive at all ; they may be in third - party archives or even hidden inside organizations that use their packages internally and do not publish them at all .
Consequently , changing the contents of a library ’s *.ali files has far - reaching consequences that are not all immediately obvious .
3.2.2 Avoiding the indirect FTBFS scenario
We will now discuss possible ways to avoid or mitigate the problem described in the previous subsection .
First we introduce the aliversion .
This is similar to the soversion ; it is a version number that changes when the *.ali files change .
The aliversion of a package must change when the *.ali files of the package change , possibly as a result of rebuilding against a changed library .
It must not change otherwise .
When the aliversion changes , all packages that depend on the changing package must be recompiled and re-uploaded ; we do n’t want to do that unless strictly necessary .
As with the soversion , there are choices about how the aliversion relates to the source version .
For the purposes of this discussion , there are five reasons a Debian package source version needs to change :
The upstream Ada source changes , changing the ali files .
The upstream non-Ada source changes , not changing the ali files .
The Debian maintainer patches Ada source files , changing the ali files .
A library the package depends on changes its *.ali files ; the Debian maintainer recompiles the package , changing the *.ali files of the package .
This includes the case of a GNAT compiler version change .
The Debian maintainer patches non-Ada source files ( this includes Debian packaging files , such as control and rules ) , not changing the *.ali files .
To handle all of these changes orthogonally , we could use a source version number that contains all of these parts , in some order :
upstream-ada
upstream - non-ada
library - ali
debian - ada - patch
debian - non - ada - patch
However , a source version that actually contains all of these parts is unwieldy , so we look for typical situations that let us simplify it .
If the package is overwhelmingly Ada ( lots of Ada source files , very few non-Ada source files ) , then it will be very unlikely that there will be a release that has only non-Ada changes in it .
So we can simply drop the non-Ada parts of the source version .
If the upstream distribution does not include any *.ali files ( it is a source only distribution ) , we can combine the library - ali and debian - ada - patch parts .
In this simplest case , the source version is upstream - ada - library - ali - and - debian - ada - patch , where library - ali - and - debian - ada - patch is the Debian upload number .
In this case , the aliversion can be either the full source version ( since that only changes when the Ada files do , which is when the *.ali files change ) , or just library - ali - and - debian - ada - patch .
However , we will see below that a policy of never doing a release without any non-Ada changes is not workable in the long run .
If the package has lots of non-Ada sources , so that a release with non-Ada only changes is likely , and the upstream distribution contains no *.ali files , the upstream maintainers are not likely to want to split the source version into Ada and non-Ada parts .
In this case the aliversion ca n’t be the source version ( since the source version changes when *.ali files do n’t ) ; so it can be a simple integer .
If the upstream distribution does contain *.ali files , it is likely that the upstream maintainers simply do n’t want to deal with the consistency issue ; without a known packaging system , it ’s not easy to deal with .
So this reduces to the other two cases .
The Debian package maintainer must regenerate the *.ali files , not use the upstream versions .
In both cases , the distinction between upstream - ada and upstream - non - ada is gone , as is the distinction between debian - ada - patch and debian - non - ada - patch .
Also , library - ali does not need to be distinct from the other Debian changes .
So we are left with this structure for the source version :
upstream - version - debian - upload - number
where debian - upload - number changes whenever the *.ali files do , and also for any other Debian patches .
In principle , there are two choices for how to incorporate the aliversion into Debian packages :
aliversion in package version
This choice is appropriate when every upload ( even binNMU ) is guaranteed to change the *.ali files .
The maintainer of libconfig produces the binary package libconfig - dev ( =aliversion ) .
The aliversion is the source version upstream - version - debian - upload - number .
The maintainer of libfoo specifies ‘ Build - Depends : libconfig - dev ( =aliversion ) ’ in debian / control .
This very tight build - dependency causes libfoo to FTBFS as soon as a later version of libconfig - dev reaches unstable .
For the purposes of the ‘ Build - Depends ’ clause , it is generally impossible to construct a meaningful range of values wider than this , because a change in any part of the source version means that the *.ali files have changed .
This method has the disadvantage that developers using the - dev package can forget to include a version restriction in their ‘ Build - Depends ’.
It is not possible to include a rule to enforce this in lintian ; there is no way to distinguish Ada packages ( that require the restriction ) from non-Ada packages ( that do n’t ) .
In addition , the policy of “ no releases without Ada changes ” is difficult to live with .
Most packages get into situations where there needs to be a packaging fix , or a documentation fix ; these are non-Ada changes .
aliversion in development package name
This choice is appropriate when there will be releases with only non-Ada changes .
The maintainer of libconfig produces the binary package libconfig < aliversion >- dev .
The aliversion cannot be the source version ( except in very special circumstances ) , because they change for different reasons ; it can be a simple integer .
The maintainer of libfoo specifies ‘ Build - Depends : libconfig < aliversion >- dev ’ in debian / control ; the version number , or range of version numbers , are optional ( they may be required for reasons not related to *.ali files ) .
One advantage of this method is that the maintainer of libfoo can no longer forget to specify the aliversion of libconfig in the ‘ Build - Depends ’ , since it is now part of the libconfig package name .
Another advantage is that the maintainer of libconfig can now upload new versions of the package that do not change the aliversion , without breaking build - dependencies of other packages .
For example , it is possible to upgrade libconfig1 - dev ( =1.0 - 1 ) to libconfig1 - dev ( =1.0 - 2 ) without breaking libfoo .
Similarly , simple binNMUs for packaging fixes do not change the aliversion .
The drawbacks mainly fall on the maintainer of libconfig and the Debian release managers , relieving the maintainers of libfoo and books .
First , it is necessary to detect any changes to the *.ali files ; such a change requires a change to the aliversion .
False positives should be avoided ; the cost of changing aliversion is the recompilation and re-release of all packages using libconfig , and we want to minimize that .
Second , every upload that changes the contents of the library ’s *.ali files needs to go through the NEW package queue ; the change in package names requires some work by the Debian release managers .
This is similar to the burden due to changing the soversion .
In summary , it is not likely that a package can maintain a policy of no non-Ada releases , and it is more likely that the aliversion in development package name policy will be implemented properly , so we forbid the aliversion in package version policy .
As a consequence , every change to the aliversion requires a new - dev package name .
This is because , unlike other languages , Ada has consistency rules that apply to the entire closure of a program at the source level ( OCaml has similar rules ) .
To fully avoid the FTBFS problem , multiple versions of a - dev package must coexist on a system .
However , that is quite complicated to achieve , so we allow both choices :
Coexistence Allowed If multiple libconfig < aliversion >- dev are to coexist on a system , they must avoid file conflicts ; we must be able to install and remove each package without affecting any other package ’s files .
This implies that they must install their files in different directories , the names of which should probably include the aliversion .
The corresponding run -time library packages must also coexist without conflict .
This means that the soname must be different for each package , even if the library API has not changed .
The soname must change whenever the aliversion changes , and any change in API will cause a change in aliversion .
So the soversion can be the aliversion .
Quite likely , the multiple libconfig < aliversion >- dev packages will be built from multiple source packages , so the source package should also have aliversion in its name , e.g. libconfig < aliversion > .
The maintainer of libconfig agrees to maintain the multiple versions of the source , development , and run-time packages in parallel .
Packages that depend directly or indirectly on libconfig1.0 still build when libconfig1.1 is released , avoiding the FTBFS problem .
They may all be upgraded gradually to the new version , as the maintainers have time for it .
They should all be upgraded eventually , and libconfig1.0 removed , to avoid a proliferation of package versions .
No coexistence allowed
If the maintainer of libconfig wants to disallow coexistence , it is necessary that the package libconfig < aliversion >- dev have ‘ Breaks ’ and ‘ Replaces ’ clauses in its debian / control that list all previous versions of the - dev package .
The ‘ Breaks ’/‘
Replaces ’ relationship can be indirect and implicit through gnat - X.Y .
If libconfig1 - dev depends on gnat - 4.1 and libconfig2 - dev depends on gnat - 4.3 , an explicit ‘ Breaks : ’ is unnecessary because gnat - 4.1 and gnat - 4.3 already conflict with each other , preventing coexistence of libconfig1 - dev and libconfig2 - dev as intended .
The soname of the shared library can change independently of the aliversion .
The maintainer of libconfig maintains only one version of the package at a time .
Installing a new libconfig < aliversion >- dev immediately removes any previous version from the system and causes packages build - depending on the old version to FTBFS .
There is no grace period for these packages ; they must be recompiled immediately .
However , Daniel ’s build daemon will report the correct problem .
This policy avoids the indirect FTBFS scenario , replacing it with a direct FTBFS scenario .
It is up to each library ’s maintainer to decide which method to choose .
The purpose of this policy is to have build failures report the correct problem and to force recompilation of all packages that directly or indirectly build - depend ( not merely depend ) on an upgraded package , or to avoid the build failures entirely .
The Ada run-time library follows the Coexistence allowed policy .
The development files ( *.ads , *.adb , *.ali , *.a and *. so ) are in a version - and target - specific directory , as specified by the GCC directory structure :
/usr/lib/gcc/VERSION/TARGET
.
Since gnat - 4.3 , in fact , two versions of the libgnat development files are provided : one using the default zero - cost exception handling mechanism , the other using setjump / longjump .
However , the Ada compiler driver , /usr / bin / gnatmake and its friends / usr / bin / gnatbind , /usr / bin / gnatlink , etc. are in a location that causes all gnat - x.y packages to conflict with each other .
The run -time packages , libgnat - x.y , can coexist on a system .
For the GNAT package the aliversion consists of the first two numbers in the source version , e.g. ‘ 4.3 ’ , ‘ 4.4 ’.
This works for GNAT because there are no Ada libraries that GNAT depends on ; this means the aliversion changes only when GNAT sources change .
3.2.3 Responsibilities of upstream authors and maintainers
Ada libraries have three version numbers ; source , shared object , and ali .
It should be clear by now that :
The upstream portion of the source version is a responsibility of the upstream authors .
The Debian upload number , which supplements the upstream source version , is a responsibility of the Debian package maintainer .
The soname ( which includes the soversion ) is a responsibility of the Debian package maintainer .
This follows from the fact that upstream provides sources , not binaries , while the Debian package maintainer provides the binaries .
If the upstream distribution does provide binaries , the Debian package does not use them , since they are almost certainly not built with other Debian packages .
( which includes the ) is a responsibility of the Debian package maintainer .
This follows from the fact that upstream provides sources , not binaries , while the Debian package maintainer provides the binaries .
If the upstream distribution does provide binaries , the Debian package does not use them , since they are almost certainly not built with other Debian packages .
The aliversion is also a responsibility of the Debian package maintainer .
The upgrade scenario illustrates precisely that the soname of a library must change whenever the new version of the library changes its API .
It also illustrates the importance of tight control on the soname .
The soname provided by the library package maintainer has an impact on both developers linking their applications against the library and on end users running the programs .
It is not always practical to determine with certainty whether a new version of a library breaks its API or not .
It is always safe to increment a library shared object version , if there is any doubt about backward compatibility .
However , there is a cost to this ; the Debian build system must accomodate the new package name , which requires manual labor by the Debian release managers .
In addition , users of the package must examine the changes , to see if their code needs to change .
The Debian package maintainer must , therefore , change the soname of libraries as often as necessary and as seldom as possible .
Similarly , the aliversion must change whenever the Ada sources of the package change or when a package it depends on changes its aliversion , and it should not change otherwise .
The Debian maintainer can use one of several policies for choosing the aliversion and soversion .
The simplest policy that always works is to make aliversion an integer that increases only when *.ali files change .
This integer is entirely artificial as it is not derived from the upstream source version number .
In the No coexistence allowed policy , soversion can similarly be an integer that changes only when the API changes .
In the Coexistence allowed policy , however , it must additionally change whenever the aliversion changes , so the simplest convention is to make it identical to aliversion .
The Debian maintainer is free to use another policy that meets all the requirements .
For example , it is sometimes ( not always ) possible to derive the aliversion and soversion from the source version number .
4 The Debian Ada compiler
( This chapter is normative . )
Rule : Package gnat is the default Ada compiler for Debian .
All packages containing Ada programs or libraries SHALL use this compiler and Build - Depend on it .
As a special exception , packages uploaded to experimental may omit this dependency .
Rationale :
This forces all programs and libraries to use the same ABI , so we can link them together .
Rationale : the special exception allows package maintainers to upload packages to experimental ahead of a transition of the gnat package to a newer gnat - X.Y .
Such packages must be re-uploaded to unstable , with a Build - Dependency on gnat , to complete the transition .
Remark : gnat -x.y also provides the gnatgcc command , which shall be used for C code instead of gcc when they differ .
Rule : Package gnat - X.Y provides a specific version of the Ada compiler .
Packages containing Ada libraries SHALL in addition Build - Depend on the specific gnat - X.Y used at build time .
Rationale : Specifying both the actual version and the intended global compatibility ensures an explicit build failure when both wishes are incompatible .
Additional information :
The default Ada compiler for Debian is as follows .
Some versions of Debian provide alternative versions of GNAT .
These alternative versions are for experimental purposes only ; they receive no support and Debian packages may not build - depend on any of them .
Debian release Default Ada compiler Alternatives Supported Platforms 2.0 Ham GNAT 3.07 i386 2.1 Slink GNAT 3.10 p i386 2.2 Potato GNAT 3.12 p i386 3.0 Woody GNAT 3.14 p i386 , powerpc , sparc 3.1 Sarge GNAT 3.15 p gnat - 3.3 , gnat - 3.4 i386 , powerpc , sparc 4.0 Etch GCC 4.1 +amd64 , hppa , hppa64 , ia64 , kfreebsd-i386 , ppc64 , sparc64 5.0 Lenny GCC 4.3 + alpha , mips , mipsel 6.0 Squeeze GCC 4.4 +arm , armel , kfreebsd - amd64 7.0 Wheezy GCC 4.6 +m68 k , hurd - i386 , multiarch 8.0 Jessie GCC 4.9 - s390 , +s390x , - sparc
5 Policy for Ada libraries
The Policy for Ada libraries is mostly interesting if you want to package libraries .
If you only want to use libraries , see Using shared libraries .
The goal of this policy is to make Debian a robust and complete development platform for Ada programmers .
This platform should appeal both to seasoned programmers and beginners .
The basic tenet is that it Just Works .
At the same time , the Policy makes Debian an equally attractive deployment platform for users of Ada programs .
Thanks to Debian ’s outstanding package management system , users simply ‘ apt - get install ’ watever package they want to use and apt - get installs all the required run-time libraries .
The Policy ensures there are no conflicts between libraries .
This policy is based on the GNU Ada Environment Specification as far as is reasonable .
This specification is an attempt by Florian Weimer to make all libraries install files in consistent places .
The GNAE is distribution - agnostic ; it mandates a mechanism ( similar to GNOME ’s pkg- config ) to retrieve compiler switches for each library in a uniform way .
However , thanks to GNAT project files , this is unnecessary ; and Debian ’s packaging system handles dependencies .
So , what follows is a stripped - down version of the GNAE suitable for Debian .
5.1 Building a library for reuse
( This section is informative . )
For some libraries , the upstream authors provide a Makefile that does not compile all of the source files of the library ; in particular , some upstream Makefile s do not compile all generic bodies .
These upstream authors assume one of the following :
The library user has permission to write into the library ’s directory structure and uses GNAT project files or gnatmake - i .
.
The library user compiles the library ’s source code into their application , using gnatmake - I .
.
The library user copies the sources of the library into their program ’s directory structure .
However , in Debian , none of the above applies .
If the Debian maintainer were to use such Makefile s and installed the *.ali files in / usr / lib / ada / adalib / LIBRARY , then some *.ali files would be missing .
This would be a problem for non -root users , because they are not allowed to write *.ali files in /usr / lib / ada / adalib / LIBRARY .
To prevent this , it is sometimes necessary for the Debian package maintainer to bypass upstream ’s Makefile with a scheme that ensures that all files are compiled .
Here is a sample from debian / build_library.gpr that demonstrates how to do this :
project LIBRARY is for Library_Name use " LIBRARY " ; for Library_Kind use External ( " LIBRARY_KIND " ) ; for Library_Version use External ( " SONAME " ) ; for Source_Dirs use ( " . " ) ; for Object_Dir use External ( " OBJ_DIR " ) ; package Compiler is for Default_Switches ( " Ada " ) use ( " - g " , " - O2 " , " - gnatafnoy " , " - gnatVa " , " - gnatwa " , " - fstack - check " ) ; end Compiler ; package Binder is for Default_Switches ( " Ada " ) use ( " - E " ) ; end Binder ; end LIBRARY ;
A Makefile would call this project file like so :
# change the soversion manually soversion :=1 soname:=libLIBRARY.so.$ ( soversion ) obj - shared/libLIBRARY.so : gnatmake -p - Pbuild_LIBRARY.gpr \ -XLIBRARY_KIND=dynamic - XOBJ_DIR=$ ( dir $ @@ ) - XSONAME =$ ( soname ) obj-static/libLIBRARY.a : gnatmake -p - Pbuild_LIBRARY.gpr \ -XLIBRARY_KIND=static - XOBJ_DIR=$ ( dir $ @@ )
This scheme effectively replaces upstream ’s Makefile altogether , modulo any configuration or preprocessing steps that may be necessary .
I would personally advise upstream library authors to consider using such a scheme in their Makefile s.
5.2 Library names and packaging structure
( This section is normative . )
Rule :
The package maintainer SHALL choose either of the Coexistence allowed or No coexistence allowed policies ; no other choices are allowed .
Rule :
The package maintainer SHALL change the aliversion if and only if the contents of the *.ali files change .
Additional information : *.ali files can change not only as a result of changes in the Ada source files but also as a result of recompiling the library against a new version of another library .
This includes recompiling with a new compiler against a new version of the Ada run -time library .
5.2.1 Coexistence allowed
Rule :
If the package maintainer chooses the Coexistence allowed policy , the soname of the shared library SHALL change if and only if the contents of the *.ali files change .
Additional information : the *.ali files will change when the API does , so this includes the normal reason for changing the soname .
The aliversion should be the soversion , e.g. soname libfoo .so.1 and development package libfoo1 - dev .
Additional information : if each version of the library is built by a different source package , the source package name should contain the aliversion as well .
5.2.2
No coexistence allowed
Rule :
If the package maintainer chooses the No coexistence allowed policy , the soname of the shared library SHALL change every time the API of the library changes in a backward - incompatible way , and not otherwise .
Additional information : the aliversion should not be the soversion .
Additional information : in this case , it is a good idea that the source package name not contain any version number .
5.2.3 Package names
Rule : Each Ada library SHALL consist of the following packages :
‘ libLIBRARY [-] V- dev ’ the development package containing the static libraries and development files , in section libdevel .
‘ libLIBRARY [-]
N ’ the run -time package containing the shared library , in section libs . ‘ libLIBRARY [[ -] V] - doc ’ the documentation ( optional ) , in section doc . ‘ libLIBRARY [[ -] N] - dbg ’ the separate debugging information for the shared library , in section debug .
where :
V is the aliversion .
It is present in the name of the documentation package if the Coexistence allowed policy is chosen .
N is the soversion .
It is present in the name of the debug package if the Coexistence allowed policy is chosen .
- is used when the library name ends in a number .
5.2.4 Inter - package dependencies
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL ‘ Depend : ’ on the packages gnat - X.Y and , if uploaded to unstable , gnat .
Rationale : depending on both packages ensures that only the default Ada compiler can be used to build programs depending on the library , pursuant to The Debian Ada compiler .
For example , during gnat transitions , all - dev packages will blocked in unstable until they are recompiled with the new compiler .
Additionnaly , this rule makes the - dev package visible in the list of packages that depend on gnat ; people looking for an Ada compiler in Debian will therefore find all - dev packages easily .
Rationale : during transitions , it may be desirable to upload packages to experimental before a new gnat package is available in unstable .
Rule :
If the package maintainer chooses the No coexistence allowed policy , the - dev package ’s debian / control file SHALL contain ‘ Breaks : ’ and ‘ Replaces : ’ lines listing all previous versions of the package , if any , that ever depended on the same gnat - X.Y package .
Rule : the - dbg package SHALL Depend : on the exact version of the corresponding shared library package .
Rationale : the - dbg package is useless without the shared library package .
Rule : the - doc , - dbg and any other packages produced from the same source package , SHALL Suggest : the package gnat .
Rationale : this makes all the packages visible in aptitude and other package managers ; the user can simply browse the “ Package which depend on ” gnat , look under Suggests and get a list of all Ada packages available in Debian .
5.3 Files provided by the - dev package
( This section is normative . )
5.3.1 General rules
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL NOT provide any other files than the ones described in this section .
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL be architecture - dependent ( i.e. Arch : any or a specific list of architectures ) .
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL depend on the gnat - x.y and on any other - dev packages with which it was built .
Rule :
If the package maintainer chooses the Coexistence allowed policy , for purposes of all the following rules in this section , the term LIBRARY SHALL include the same version number as the name of the - dev package .
Additional information : for example , if the development package name is libfoo1 - dev then the term LIBRARY shall stand for ‘ foo1 ’.
Rule :
If the package maintainer chooses the No coexistence allowed policy , the term LIBRARY shall not contain any version number .
Remark : Paths given from now on in this manual refer to the DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH value .
If the maintainer is interested in preparing the multiarch migration , DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH must be replaced with the value returned by a call to dpkg - buildflags - qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH or set by including the /usr / share / dpkg / default.mk makefile snippet , both from the dpkg - dev package .
Else , DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH
may be ignored .
5.3.2 Source files
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL provide all source files ( specs and bodies ) necessary for compilation of code that uses the library .
Rule : Source files SHALL reside in directory /usr / include / ada / adainclude / LIBRARY .
Recommendation :
There should not be any subdirectories under /usr / share / ada / adainclude / LIBRARY .
If the upstream authors split the sources into several subdirectories , merge all source files into one directory or else , provide several separate library packages .
If you insist on providing subdirectories , make sure your project file ( described below ) reflects this .
Rationale : Splitting the sources in several directories makes navigation in the library source code more difficult in some editors or debuggers .
Rule :
If the upstream sources require preprocessing the Ada source files before compilation , then the Ada files in /usr / share / ada / adainclude / LIBRARY SHALL be the preprocessed files corresponding to the shared library in /usr / lib / DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH .
Rule :
The directory with all Ada source files SHALL not contain any Makefile s or any other files that might be necessary to recompile the library .
Rationale :
The intention is not that the user can recompile the library from /usr / share / ada / adainclude / LIBRARY ; only that they can use it in their Ada programs .
They can always recompile the library from the source package .
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL , however , provide any source files in languages other than Ada ( e.g. C ) that are compiled into the library .
Rationale :
This allows programmers using GDB to trace the execution of their programs into the library .
See below The separate debugging information package .
5.3.3 Ada object files
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL NOT provide any *.o files .
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL provide a static library in /usr / lib / DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/libLIBRARY.a .
5.3.4 Ada Library Information files
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL provide Ada Library Information ( *.ali ) files that gnatgcc creates when compiling the shared ( not static ) library .
Rule :
The *.ali files SHALL have read - only permissions for all users ( i.e. r--r--r-- or 0444 ) .
Rationale : During compilation of a program against the library as described later in this document , object files are missing because they are lumped together into the shared and static libraries .
Gnatmake understands the Externally _Built attribute in library project files but with ADA_INCLUDE_PATH and - aI , it insists on recompiling every object whose ALI file has permissions different from r--r--r-- .
Rule :
The *.ali files SHALL reside in /usr / lib / DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/ada/adalib/LIBRARY .
Additional information : Starting with Etch , lintian , Linda and dh_fixperms are aware of these rules and enforce them .
5.3.5 Symbolic link to the shared library
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL provide a symbolic link to the shared library , as follows :
/usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/libLIBRARY.so -> library_file_name
where library_file_name is the full name of the shared library file .
For example :
/usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/libtexttools.so -> libtexttools.so.2.0.3
Additional information : the library_file_name is , in theory , independent from the soname .
However , traditionally it is either equal to the soname or is the soname followed by one or more minor version numbers .
If simplicity is a goal , the package maintainer can always use a library_file_name equal to the soname .
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL depend on the run-time package .
5.3.6 GNAT project file
Rule :
The - dev package for each library SHALL provide a GNAT project file named /usr / share / ada / adainclude / LIBRARY.gpr .
Rule :
The project file SHALL have
a Source_Dirs attribute containing at least /usr / share / ada / adainclude / LIBRARY .
attribute containing at least .
a Library_ALI_Dir equal to /usr / lib/ DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/ada/adalib/LIBRARY .
equal to .
a Library_Name attribute equal to the library name of the shared library .
attribute equal to the library name of the shared library .
a Library_Kind attribute equal to ‘ dynamic ’.
attribute equal to ‘ ’. a Library_Dir attribute equal to /usr / lib / DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH
.
attribute equal to .
an Externally _Built attribute equal to ‘ true ’.
Remark : the presence of Library_Name and Library_Dir makes the project file a “ library ” project file which gnatmake treats specially .
See the GNAT documentation for details .
Remark :
Since the - dev and library packages provide precompiled libraries , it is not necessary to provide ‘ package Compiler ’ or ‘ package Builder ’ in the project file .
However , if the library depends on another dynamic library , every program linked with the former also indirectly depends on the latter .
A ‘ package Linker ’ must then list the implied options .
Example :
project LIBRARY is for Library_Name use " LIBRARY " ; for Library_Dir use " /usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH " ; for Library_Kind use " dynamic " ; for Source_Dirs use ( " /usr/share/ada/adainclude /LIBRARY " ) ; for Library_ALI_Dir use " /usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/ada/adalib/LIBRARY " ; for Externally _Built use " true " ; package Linker is for Linker_Options use ( " - lindirectdependency " ) ; end Linker ; end LIBRARY ;
5.3.7 Documentation
Rule :
The - dev package SHALL have a README .
Debian that explains how to use the library in new programs .
Additional information :
This file is not mandatory per Debian Policy , but this Debian Ada Policy does require it .
See Using shared libraries for details .
5.4 Files provided by the run-time shared library package
Recommendation : If DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH
is used , the library package should be declared Multiarch : same and Pre-Depend : $ {misc : Pre-Depends} in debian / control .
Rule :
If the soname of the shared library is identical to its library_file_name , the run-time shared library package ( libLIBRARYN ) SHALL provide this file :
/usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/soname
Rule :
If soname and library_file_name are different , the run-time shared library package ( libLIBRARYN ) SHALL provide one file and one symbolic link :
/usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/library_file_name
/usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/soname -> library_file_name
Additional information : for example ,
/usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/libtexttools.so.2.0.3
/usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/libtexttools.so.2 -> libtexttools.so.2.0.3 $ objdump -p /usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/libtexttools.so.2.0.3 | grep SONAME SONAME libtexttools.so.2
Additional information : it is acceptable to provide several shared libraries in the same package if and only if these shared libraries depend on each other and are built from the same source package .
The package maintainer can do this if most , if not all , users of one shared library are likely to also need the other libraries .
This , of course , implies that changing the soname of one library requires changing the soname of all libraries .
5.5 Documentation
( this section is normative . )
Rule : Documentation other than the README .
Debian file SHALL be included either in the - doc package or in the - dev package .
Rationale :
If the amount of documentation is small or if the documentation consists mostly of comments in the Ada source files , it is preferable to place it in the - dev package .
The README .
Debian file must always be in the - dev package , as explained above .
Remark :
You may consider using adabrowse to generate HTML documentation from the source files .
5.5.1 Documents in the info format
Rule :
If the library provides Info files , then the Info files SHALL appear under “ GNU Ada tools ” in the top - level Info directory .
Additional information :
This usually requires adding a few lines near the top of the first Info file , before the first node .
Here is an example from package libaws - doc :
INFO -DIR -SECTION GNU Ada tools START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY * AWS : ( aws ) .
The Ada Web Server .
END -INFO-DIR -ENTRY
If you generate *.info files from *. texi files using makeinfo , the following lines achieve the desired effect :
@dircategory GNU Ada tools @direntry * AWS : ( aws ) .
The Ada Web Server . @end direntry
Based on this information , dh_installinfo takes care of updating the top - level Info directory .
5.5.2 Examples
Rule :
If the library provides example source files , they SHALL reside under /usr / share / doc / LIBRARY - doc / examples or , if there is no - doc package , in /usr / share / doc / LIBRARY - dev/ examples .
Rule : Neither the source files , nor any Makefile present in the examples , SHALL be compressed .
Additional information :
Be careful if you use dh_installexamples , as it compresses any files larger than 4 kiB by default — use - X.ads - X.adb - XMakefile as appropriate .
5.6
The separate debugging information package
( this section is normative . )
Rule : the package maintainer SHALL provide a package containing the debugging symbols for the shared library .
Rationale : Debian has a mechanism for producing and using - dbg packages containing debugging information .
For this to work , you must compile the shared library with ‘ - g ’ and the - dbg package must appear in debian / control .
Then , you call ‘ dh_strip - plibLIBRARYN --dbg-package=libLIBRARY -dbg ’ from within debian / rules .
Since that ’s all there is to it , package maintainers have little excuse not to provide a - dbg package .
Recommendation : If DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH
has been used , the - dbg package should be declared Multiarch : same .
6 Debian for Ada programmers
( This chapter is informative )
This Debian Policy for Ada makes Debian attractive to beginners , professionals and teachers alike .
This appendix is for people using Debian to develop software in Ada , as opposed to package maintainers .
6.1 Installing an Ada development environment
Packages that comply with this Policy leverage the renowned Debian package management tools to make it easy for a user to discover and install all Ada packages available .
Here is a simple recipe for people who wish to install a complete Ada development environment , consisting of many packages , on their Debian machine .
On a command line , launch aptitude which is the officially blessed tool to manage Debian packages .
which is the officially blessed tool to manage Debian packages .
Type / ^gnat$ to find the package gnat .

Press ENTER to display the details of the package .
Scroll down to Packages which depend on gnat .
Press [ on that line to expand all levels under it .
.
Press on that line to expand all levels under it .
Review the list of packages that Depend on gnat : these are the - dev packages for each library available .
The packages that Recommend or Suggest gnat are additional packages that complement the development environment .
on : these are the packages for each library available .
The packages that or are additional packages that complement the development environment .
As you scroll on that list , the status bar at the bottom of the screen displays a short description of each package .
Type + on each package that you wish to install .
on each package that you wish to install .
When you are done , press g .
You will get a list of all actions pending .
Press g to launch these actions , i.e. to download and install the packages you selected .
The aptitude GUI is based on ncurses .
If you are more comfortable with a Gtk interface , synaptic provides the same capabilities .
To search for packages that depend on gnat , click the " search " button , enter " gnat " , and choose " dependencies " from the " look in " list .
Click on the check box next to a package to select it for installation ; click on the " apply " button to perform the selected installations .
6.2 In - place upgrades
This Debian Policy for Ada respects the Ada language rule that any executable program can only contain object files that are consistent with their sources and with one another .
The section Library names and packaging structure mandates that , whenever any of the .ali files in a - dev package change , the name of the package must also change .
An unfortunate consequence of this rule is that upgrades are a little bit more problematic than for lesser languages that do not enforce consistency .
Here is a recipe for in - place system upgrades .
It assumes use of the aptitude ncurses GUI .
It is not a good idea to attempt this with synaptic ; however , command line aptitude is a viable alternative .
Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list to refer to a newer version of Debian .

Press to purge each of them .
Repeat the steps you performed when installing your Ada development environment , i.e. browse the list of packages that Depend on , Recommend or Suggest the package gnat .
on , or the package .
From one stable release of Debian to the next , chances are very high that the list of Ada packages available will grow .
New tools and libraries will appear .
Conversely , it is possible that some libraries disappear , being superseded by others .
For example , libcharles0 - dev which was present in Debian 3.1 " Sarge " was superseded by the standard Ada .
Containers library provided by gnat - 4.1 in Debian 4.0 " Etch " .
6.3 Using shared libraries
As a consequence of the Debian policy for Ada libraries , users of the - dev packages have three consistent ways of using libraries in their programs :
ADA_INCLUDE_PATH += :/usr/share/ada/adainclude/LIBRARY ADA_OBJECTS_PATH
+= :/usr/lib/TARGET/ada/adalib/LIBRARY gnatmake PROGRAM - largs - lLIBRARY
or
gnatmake - aI/usr / share / ada/ adainclude /LIBRARY
\ -aO/usr/lib/ TARGET/ada/adalib/LIBRARY
\ PROGRAM \ - largs - lLIBRARY
or
write their own project file and :
with " LIBRARY " ; project PROGRAM is for Source_Dirs use ( " . " ) ; for Object_Dir use " obj " ; for Exec_ Dir use " . " ; for Main use ( " PROGRAM " ) ; end ;
Depending on the state of the multiarch migration , TARGET may be ignored , or replaced with the multiarch triplet describing the binary architecture the user is compiling for .
In most cases , the multiarch triplet may be found with :
gnatgcc -v 2>&1 | awk '/ Target :/ { print $ 2 ; } '
Starting with Debian 4.0 Etch , GNAT looks for project files in /usr / share / ada / adainclude by default .
In 3.1 Sarge , it was necessary to specify the full path to the project file in the ‘ with ’ clause or set ‘ ADA_PROJECT_PATH ’ to /usr / share / ada / adainclude in the environment .
Also , the ‘ .gpr ’ filename extension is optional in the ‘ with ’ clause .
Some upstream library authors provide scripts ( e.g. ‘ /usr / bin/gtkada-config ’ for GtkAda ) but they tend not to work well when using several libraries simultaneously because the order of the switches is important .
The recommended way to use libraries is the project files , especially when using several libraries at the same time :
with " LIBRARY_ONE " ; with " LIBRARY_TWO " ; project PROGRAM is for Source_Dirs use ( " . " ) ; for Object_Dir use " obj " ; for Exec_ Dir use " . " ; for Main use ( " PROGRAM " ) ; end ;
The user may also wish to use the static library .
Doing this is straightforward :
with " LIBRARY " ; project PROGRAM is Target := " TARGET " ; for Source_Dirs use ( " . " ) ; for Object_Dir use " obj " ; for Exec_ Dir use " . " ; for Main use ( " PROGRAM " ) ; package Linker is for Default_Switches ( " Ada " ) use ( " /usr/lib / " & Target & " / libLIBRARY.a " ) ; end Linker ; end ;
The user may also wish to recompile parts of the library into their program , possibly with different compile - time options .
This is also possible with GNAT project files but without the library - supplied project file :
project PROGRAM is for Source_Dirs use ( " . " , " /usr/share/ada/adainclude /LIBRARY " ) ; for Object_Dir use " obj " ; for Main use ( " PROGRAM " ) ; package Compiler is for Default_Switches ( " Ada " ) use ( " - gnatafoy " , " - O3 " , " - fno-unroll - loops " , " - gnatVa " , " - gnatwa " ) ; end Compiler ; end PROGRAM ;
The above examples can be mixed to suit the user ’s requirements .
For example , one library can be linked statically , another can be compiled - in and a third can be linked dynamically .
6.4 Debugging programs that use shared libraries
If the package maintainer provides a - dbg package , you simply ‘ apt - get install ’ it and launch gdb on your program ( preferably inside an integrated development environment ) .
gdb automagically looks for the debugging symbols for the library in the proper place and will see them with no further help .
However , it may not see the source files automatically .
If gdb fails to find the source files , you need to say :
( gdb ) dir /usr / share / ada/ adainclude / LIBRARY
6.5
Where to ask for help
The Ada community and its Debian sub -community are both very active and friendly .
They welcome newcomers and often provide expert advice to those who can formulate their questions precisely .
If your question is about the Ada language in general , the best place is the Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.ada and its French - speaking counterpart , fr.comp.lang.ada .
Experienced users and even compiler writers lurk there , so there is no better place for help short of a support contract with a vendor .
If your question is more specific to Ada in Debian or a particular Debian package , the best place is the mailing list debian-ada@lists.debian.org , where all Debian Ada package maintainers lurk as well as many of your fellow Debian Ada programmers .
You can browse the archives of this list at http://lists.debian.org/debian-ada.
7 Help wanted
( This chapter is informative )
Help is wanted to further Ada , Debian and Ada in Debian .
There are several areas where you can help : as an upstream author or as a packager .
If you would like to help or are simply interested in discussions , the first thing you should do is browse the archives of the debian - ada mailing list and announce your intentions in a mail to debian-ada@lists.debian.org .
As an upstream author , you can contribute to any of the packages already in Debian .
You can also write new Ada libraries and programs .
As a packager , you can select existing libraries or software programs , and package them for Debian .
You should follow the Debian policy for Ada if you do this .
If you are looking for a project to which you can contribute or for something to package for Debian , here are a few web sites where you can look :
Appendix A Bugs in GNAT
( This appendix is informative )
Since I started maitaining GNAT , I have received over a hundred bug reports against the compiler .
In most of these bugs , GNAT is too lax ; it does not complain when presented with an illegal program .
There are some quite subtle cases involved ; processing these bugs has been a very good learning experience for me .
You may be interested in perusing these bugs for your own benefit .
My processing of these bug reports has been , I believe , quite thorough .
For each bug :
I wrote a small test case that demonstrates the bug ( most bug reports came with a test case already ; this was not much work ) .
I ran the test case against GNAT 3.15 p and 3.4 .
When GNAT 3.15 p had the bug , I reported it to the Debian bug tracking system .
When GCC 3.4 had the bug , I reported it to the GCC Bugzilla database .
When both versions had the bug , I linked the Debian bug to the GCC bug .
As it turns out , GCC 3.4 has approximately 80 % of the bugs of GNAT 3.15 p .
It fixes some bugs but also adds a few new ones .
When possible , I try to track the changes that fix bugs in GCC and backport them to GNAT 3.15 p .
Thus , GNAT 3.15 p is under active maintenance in Debian .
If you would like to contribute , feel free to send me patches , I will accept them gratefully .
AdaCore also fix bugs that I report in each major release of GCC .
The test suite is available in the GNAT source package ; to get the test suite , just apt - get source gnat and look in the testsuite directory .
You can search the Debian bug tracking system on the web here : http://bugs.debian.org
You can search the GCC bug database here : http://gcc.gnu.org.
Appendix B
A note about GNAT ’s shared libraries
( This appendix is informative )
I ’ve done some extensive research on several GNU / Linux distributions , and even FreeBSD , to see how they handled libgnat ’s soname .
Most distros never included the AdaCore public version of GNAT and started shipping Ada only after GCC 3.2 went out .

The ellipsis ( ... ) stands for < target >/< version >/ adalib , for example i486 - linux - gnu/4.1.0/adalib .
All GNU / Linux distributions have historically ignored the AdaCore default soname and used one consistent pattern , libgnat-x.xxp.so.1 .
This includes Debian Woody .
For Sarge and Etch , I have chosen to continue this tradition .
This allows , by the way , installing both Debian ’s and AdaCore ’s binary distributions on the same system .
Appendix C Ada transition in Debian 4.0 Etch
( This appendix is informative )
The compiler and all Ada packages transitioned from gnat 3.15 p in Sarge to gnat - 4.1 in Etch .
This appendix is here for historical purposes .
C.1 How the Ada compiler for Etch was chosen
In 2004 , even before Sarge was released I had laid out a plan for Etch and published it in the First Edition of this Policy .
The plan was to choose a new Ada compiler for Etch and transition all packages to it .
The new Ada compiler would be either the next “ p ” release from AdaCore , which was the preferred solution or the latest release of GCC available roughly 3 months before the freeze of Etch .
These 3 months would be used to actually perform the transition .
When AdaCore released GNAT GPL 2005 Edition , my nice plans for Etch fell apart , because the license change for libgnat meant that some users would be unhappy about this compiler .
While I have no objection to this license change , I felt that my duty as a distribution maintainer was to ask what users wanted and so I did .
I asked for all interested people to vote on one of GNAT GPL 2005 Edition , gnat - 3.4 , gnat - 4.0 or gnat - 3.4 with patches backported from GNAT GPL , 4.0 and 4.1 .
Each voter could give one negative vote to express utter rejection , two positive votes for a strong preference or one vote for a normal preference .
Here are the results of the vote :
Variant Votes GNAT GPL 2005 Edition - 11 gnat-3.4 7 gnat-4.0 16 gnat-3.4 + patches 0
C.2 Transition plan for Etch
June 2005 - Sarge released .
gcc-4.0 enters testing .
Several major transitions start simultaneously : g++ from 3.3 to 4.0 ( with ABI change ) , XFree86 4.3 to X.org 6.8 , GNOME from 2.8 to 2.10 .
Other transitions are planned , as well .
September 2005 - Java , Treelang , libffi and several other binary packages are no longer built from gcc - 3.3 or gcc - 3.4 but only from the gcc - 4.0 source package .
November 2005 - Release branch for GCC 4.1 created .
gcc -4.1 reaches experimental .
December 2005 - gnat -3.3 removed from Etch .
February 2006 - GCC 4.1.0 released .
March 2006 - gnat - 3.4 removed from Etch .
Ground work starts on gnat - 4.1 in experimental :
Link the GNAT tools ( gnatmake , gnatkr , gnatprep , etc. ) dynamically against libgnat - 4.1.so , instead of statically .
( Done : 2006 -03 - 17 )
Port the support for symbolic tracebacks from gnat 3.15
p
Port libgnatvsn and libgnatprj from gnat 3.15
p
Build ASIS with gnat - 4.1 .
This will probably be the latest GPL version of ASIS , because all the packages that depend on ASIS are GPL , and ASIS allows manipulation of programs and so is not just an execution library .
Build GLADE with gnat - 4.1 .
This will be the GLADE from AdaCore ’s CVS repository , under GNAT - Modified GPL .
July 2006 - gnat - 4.1 reaches unstable .
ghdl transitions to gnat - 4.1 .
August 2006 - gnat - 4.1 reaches testing and becomes the default Ada compiler .
All Ada libraries must change their sonames and all packages require recompilation .
September 2006 - toolchain freeze
October 2006 - general freeze
December 2006 - Etch released 18 months after Sarge .
Appendix D libgnat under GPL - for or against
Here is a summary of the arguments that were expressed by various people on comp.lang .
ada while debating on the Ada compiler for Etch .
The arguments are in no particular order and the summaries are mine .
The anarchist argument : it is immoral for AdaCore to dictate how libgnat should be used ; everyone should be free to use libgnat however they see fit and the GPL uses violent but lawful means to make this impossible .
Therefore , everyone should reject the GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
The Free Software argument : it is immoral to write non-free software ; it is even more immoral to use a free software library such as libgnat in non-free software .
It is appropriate to make this illegal by releasing libgnat under the GPL .
Therefore , everyone should embrace GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
The Other Free Software argument : we make Free Software under a license which is incompatible in some ways with the GPL ( e.g. the BSD license ) .
The GPL prohibits linking libgnat with our software and distributing our binaries .
Therefore , we reject the GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
The selfish argument : we make commercial proprietary software with GNAT but we cannot or will not pay for GNAT Pro .
If libgnat is under GPL , we can no longer distribute our proprietary software .
Therefore , we reject GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
The interoperability argument : our software has to link with non-free software which is outside our control and the license of which prohibits use of GPLed libraries ( variant : we link with other Free libraries which are under licenses not compatible with the GPL ) ; therefore we are forced to reject GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
The betrayed author ’s argument : I made contributions to the software that is now supported commercially by AdaCore , with the understanding that the license was the GMGPL .
AdaCore revoked the special permission without consulting me .
While this is specifically allowed by the GPL , I feel betrayed .
Therefore , I reject the GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
The technical quality argument : GNAT GPL 2005 Edition is the best available Ada compiler .
GCC 3.4 is not as up - to - date with respect to Ada 2006 and GCC 4.0 is less stable .
Therefore , we should embrace GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
The marketing argument : licensing libgnat under the GPL hinders promotion of Ada , especially to small businesses ( per the selfish argument ) .
The move tries to promote Free Software at the expense of Ada .
Free Software does not need much promotion while Ada does .
Therefore , we should reject GNAT GPL 2005 Edition .
A coming episode of the acclaimed FX drama “ Rescue Me ” will tackle what may sound like a far - fetched plot line : that the attacks of Sept. 11 were an “ inside job . ”
The actor who espouses the theories on camera , it turns out , also subscribes to them in real life .
Claims that Al Qaeda terrorists were not solely responsible for the attacks have a lively following on the Internet , including on YouTube , but the second episode of “ Rescue Me ’s ” fifth season , starting in April , may represent the first fictional presentation of 9/11 conspiracy theories by a mainstream media company ( FX is operated by the News Corporation ) .
“ They ’re not discussed a lot in the press , ” Daniel Sunjata , the actor who plays Franco Rivera on “ Rescue Me , ” told reporters at a television press tour last month .
He predicted that the episode would be “ socio- politically provocative . ”
I wanted to present a proof of Lagrange ’s four square theorem that I had seen a few years ago that I really like .
I think there ’s also some approaches using analytic number theory and algebraic number theory , but this one uses convex geometry (!)
First , let me state the theorem ( my convention here is that denotes the nonnegative integers ) :
Theorem ( Lagrange ) .
Every nonnegative integer can be written as a sum of four squares , i.e. , the function given by is surjective .
In order to make this ( reasonably ) self - contained , let ’s give some definitions we ’ll use .
A lattice is a discrete subgroup of which spans in the sense of vector spaces .
Basically , a lattice will be some subgroup of which is isomorphic to .
If is a basis for , define to be the determinant of .
Define the fundamental parallelepiped of to be the set .
Now we just need some convex geometry .
The main tool will be Minkowski ’s theorem .
The proof is short , so I ’ll include it .
Lemma ( Blichfeldt ) .
Let be a lattice and be a measurable set .
If , then there exist distinct such that .
Proof .
Let be the fundamental parallelepiped of .
Then ( disjoint union ) , and hence .
Define .
Then
.
Since each , there must exist distinct such that .
Take and set and .
Lemma ( Minkowski ) .
Let be a lattice and be a centrally symmetric ( i.e. , implies ) convex set such that .
Then contains a nonzero element of .
Proof .
Set , so .
Then there exist distinct such that .
Since , we have .
Now we can write down a proof of Lagrange ’s four square theorem .
Proof .
Pick .
We break the proof up into three steps .
Step 1 : Reduce to the case that is prime .
The sum of four squares is the square of the norm of a quaternion .
Since norm is multiplicative , the product of two sums of four squares is itself a sum of four squares .
This can be checked directly , but it ’s not really that interesting .
Step 2 : Find such that .
If , take , .
Otherwise , assume is odd .
Define
.
Choose with .
Then , and since , which implies that , and hence .
So has elements .
Similarly , define .
Pick such that .
Then as before , , so also has elements .
Hence cannot be empty by the pigeonhole principle , so we can find and such that .
Step 3 : Construct a suitable lattice and centrally symmetric convex body such that a lattice point in will correspond to an expression of as a sum of four squares .
Define .
Being a subgroup of , it is clear that is discrete .
Also , the set surjects onto under the projection , so has finite index in , and hence has full rank and .
Define .
Since
,
we can apply Minkowski ’s theorem to find such that .
Now implies , and hence is a multiple of .
From , this multiple must be 1 .
And there you have it !

Jacob Zuma is favourite to become South African president next year South Africa 's ruling party leader Jacob Zuma is suing a cartoonist for $ 712,300 ( £ 464,200 ) for a controversial drawing of him published in September .
In the Sunday Times newspaper cartoon , Jonathan Shapiro draws Mr Zuma about to rape the " justice system " .
It appeared at a time when Mr Zuma was facing a corruption trial , which was later dismissed on a technicality .
He was acquitted of rape in 2006 .
Mr Shapiro , known as " Zapiro " , says the cartoon is derogatory but defendable .
Mr Zuma and Mr Shapiro confronted one another live on radio on Thursday morning .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Zuma said the current libel action was before the courts , but he was only responding in a limited way and was suing Mr Shapiro because : " Even in places where I 've been found not guilty , he continues to find me guilty .
He can't be right .
He 's totally out of order , " he told South Africa 's Talk Radio 702 .
But Mr Shapiro called up the station to defend himself and said Mr Zuma was paying " lip - service to freedom of expression " .
" I am a columnist , a visual columnist .
I comment on what you do and what you say .
And you are a public figure .
You are the one with the power , not me , " he said .
" And you just turn it on its head and act the victim , " he said .
Mr Zuma , favourite to become president after general elections next year , has denied charges of graft , money - laundering and racketeering .
In October , prosecutors were given leave to appeal against the trial 's dismissal .
Damage to dignity
The controversial cartoon shows a woman , wearing a sash with the words  Justice System , being pinned down by four figures .

" Go for it , Boss ! " they say to Mr Zuma , shown unbuckling his belt .
Mr Zuma is suing for damage to his reputation and damage to his dignity , the South African Press Association reports .
The demand was dated a week after the cartoon appeared but only served this week .
It gives the cartoonist 14 days to pay up or face court , the agency says .
In an interview with the BBC in September , Mr Shapiro said he drew the " shocking image " of Mr Zuma as a " metaphor for what he 's doing to the justice system " .
He said that Mr Zuma had attempted to undermine the independence of the judiciary in order to get corruption charges " wiped off the slate " .
" The aspect of Mr Zuma 's own personal history of having been acquitted of a charge of rape is a secondary issue in this cartoon , " he said .
" The primary issue is there 's a figure about to rape the justice system with the help of his political allies , " he said .
The shadow of corruption has been hanging over Mr Zuma for several years but his supporters have always maintained he is the victim of a political conspiracy .
In 2005 Mr Zuma was sacked as South Africa 's deputy president when his financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , was found guilty of soliciting a bribe on behalf of Mr Zuma and jailed for 15 years in connection with an arms deal .
Mr Zuma then went on trial , but the case collapsed in 2006 when the prosecution said it was not ready to proceed .
In February 2006 , Mr Zuma was acquitted of rape in a separate case , though he was widely criticised for comments about sex and HIV / Aids .
He was charged again last December shortly after winning a bitter campaign against then President Thabo Mbeki to become ANC leader .
When dismissing the corruption charges , the judge said there was evidence of political interference in the case - a statement which led President Mbeki to resign .

Working at Notam during the covid-19 - crisis
Fired up , again
Obama , at a Democratic caucus retreat , brings some passion and partisanship .
A grassroots supporter emails :
Obama 's supporters are again " fired up " and " ready to go " like I have n't seen since early November .
He 's really back to campaigning , and his speeches tonight were perhaps stronger than his Inaugural Address .
He may not have named names , but we all know who he 's laying the hammer down on .
While I do n't know if Organizing for America is going to blast out the video from the Dem - retreat tonight , I know that they certainly should .
What few people saw the remarks at the Dem - retreat are literally ready to go door to door again .
The Politico writeup .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Consumers may have had an easier time getting car loans last month , but do n't look for that to fuel a rebound in battered auto sales when automakers report their January sales Tuesday .
Auto finance units GMAC and Chrysler Financial received $ 7.5 billion in federal loans between them since the waning days of December .
That allowed them to make more attractive financing offers to a wider range of potential clients .
But forecasts of a modest pickup in sales to consumers are being more than offset by a sharp plunge in purchases by rental car companies , which in a typical year can buy close to 3 million vehicles a year .
That means that the outlook for auto sales in January and through the first half of 2009 is likely to be even weaker than the industry was forecasting just a month ago .
In fact , the big decline in rental car company purchases could lead to the worst month for auto sales since 1982 , even worse than any of the months reported in the disastrous fourth quarter .
Sales tracker Edmunds.com is forecasting that industrywide U.S. sales fell 30 % in January .
January is typically the start of the car buying season for rental car companies as they start gearing up for their busy summer months .
But the rental car companies , hit by a sharp drop in demand and a weak market for selling their older vehicles , are in the process of pulling back on purchases .
Pat Farrell , a vice president at Enterprise Rental Car , said the company started trimming its purchases last summer as the slowdown in the economy became evident .
The company , which also owns the National and Alamo brands , is the world 's largest purchaser of cars -- it buys about 800,000 vehicles bought in a typical year .
When Enterprise experienced an even sharper drop in demand in October , it further cut back on its orders , a pullback that took three months to implement and will be felt in its January sales numbers .
Farrell would not disclose how much purchases were cut at the privately - held company , but he said it would be more than 10 % .
He said the company is holding onto vehicles about two months longer than normal to make up for the reduced purchases .
Richard Broome , senior vice president at Hertz ( HTZ , Fortune 500 ) , also pointed to a double - digit percentage drop in demand for its cars and the weak resale market as the reasons it is pulling back on new car purchases .
" The million dollar question is what will demand be during the summer .
At this point it 's impossible to forecast that , " said Broome .
" We want to remain in the market and remain one of the U.S. automakers ' biggest customers .
But the market dynamics now are not favorable . "
Rebound in consumer sales wo n't be enough to end Detroit 's pain
So far this year , General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) have both trimmed their forecasts for 2009 sales from the depressed levels they were projecting in December when they submitted turnaround plans to Congress .
GM executives specifically cited weak fleet sales and rental car company purchases when they discussed GM 's lowered January sales forecast .
GM chief sales analyst Mike DiGiovanni told analysts late last month that a sharp drop in fleet sales could take the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate , or SAAR , below 10 million in January .
The industry SAAR , which was at 15.3 million a year ago even as the recession started , has n't fallen short of the 10 million benchmark since 1982 .
The only bright spot for the industry is that there could be a modest uptick in the sales of cars and trucks to consumers .
" We 're clearly seeing stabilization in the retail [ sales ] rate in the U.S. market , " DiGiovanni said last month .
But this slight uptick is not nearly enough to lead to a significant rebound in total sales any time soon , other experts say .
" As a rule right now , people are holding onto cars longer , whether it 's consumers or rental car companies , " said Jessica Caldwell , industry analyst .
Edmunds.com
The easier financing probably wo n't woo consumers back into dealerships either -- not as long as there 's so much uncertainty about the economy and the job market .
" You still have the economy crushing the consumer , " said Bob Schnorbus , chief economist for J.D. Power & Associates .
" If you have some easing of credit , maybe you 're preventing a month - by - month spiraling downward .
But at best we 're looking for retail sales to be relatively flat . "

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan —
Two missiles fired from American drone aircraft killed more than 30 people , including Qaeda and Taliban fighters , near the Pakistani border with Afghanistan on Saturday , according to a Pakistani intelligence official and residents of the area .
The missiles struck three compounds , including one where the leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Baitullah Mehsud , and foreign and local fighters loyal to him sometimes gather , the official and residents said .
Mr. Mehsud , one of the most feared leaders in Pakistan ’s lawless tribal areas , was not among those killed , according to the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press .
Mr. Mehsud , a Pakistani , has fought the government openly in the past , and government and intelligence officials say forces loyal to him continue to attack Pakistani troops in the Swat Valley and the Bajaur and Mohmand tribal areas .
The previous government , led by Pervez Musharraf , accused Mr. Mehsud in the killing of Benazir Bhutto , a former Pakistani prime minister .
Last August , we went to Estragon , the fabulous tapas restaurant in Boston 's South End .
They had pig 's head on the menu .
I vowed to return and eat it
for my birthday .
But when I checked the menu on
Estragon 's website
" Of course , " they said .
" We love to make the pig 's head ! "
So last night , The Boy and I headed over for dinner with Tim and Peter .
First , there were cocktails .
Mine was a light , refreshing sidecar ; Tim and The Boy went for absinthe .
For snacking , the desperately addictive deep - fried garbanzos , aka " chickpea crack " :
Next , lima beans sauteed with ham and garlic , known as judias salteadas :
And then the pig 's head arrived .
Note :
If you 're likely to be grossed out by photos of porcine cranial carnage , you might want to stop reading now .
I like to be prepared for unusual situations , so I 'd done some research into the best way to approach the task of eating this delicacy .
But while I 'd discovered plenty of advice on how to , the pig was missing .
I called up and asked if there was any possibility that I could special - order it .
" Of course , " they said .

And now here one was , eyeing me expectantly .
We started by tearing off the ears ; the skin was fantastic , salty and crunchy , but not worthy of too much attention when the rest of the head was sitting there , full of secrets .
Some quick work with steak knives revealed the tender cheeks .
And then The Boy flipped Babe on his head and started in on the sweetbreads .
At least , we assume they were sweetbreads : they were where we expected sweetbreads to be .
They were chewy and dense , a little like gizzards , with a deep , dark flavor .
Somewhere around here , Peter excused himself : the destruction was too much for him .
And then Tim found the tongue , which we split and sliced thinly .
It was similar in texture to the ( possible ) sweetbreads , with the same kidney - esque pungency .
The Boy and Tim were doing most of the work , and I was happy to let them .
It was a pleasantly quasi - primitive scenario : two men hacking at meat with sharp knives , sharing their discoveries , grunting with delight , offering me the most succulent selections .
Thankfully , the presence of a very good 2000 Rioja saved us from a descent into full - fledged Neanderthal debauchery .
It seemed to be a lot of effort for minimal payoff in terms of quantity .
But everything that came off that piggy 's head was fabulous : rich and sweet , salty and fatty , warm and melty .
said object , there was precious little information on how to eat a pig 's head .

Our waiter had compared the head to pork shoulder , but it was much more than that .
It was like having all the best bits of the whole pig collected together in a single , magical place .
One was like pork belly ; another was like ham ; another , braised trotters .
And then , yes , the eyes .
I 'm not sure what I was expecting : something like enormous fish eggs , perhaps , that would explode unpleasantly in the mouth .
But of course they were as roasted as the rest of the head , and were basically delicate lumps of fat , not even as chewy as snails .
We worked over the head a little longer , occasionally uncovering pockets of sweet , fatty treasure , finding cavities still sealed , the meat hot to the touch even after we'd been eating for an hour .
Eventually , we called it quits .
Peter came back just in time for an unexpected gift from the chef : a pot of milk chocolate crème topped with toffee and nuts .
So , was it worth it ?
As an exercise in efficiency , no .
But that was n't the goal .
We enjoyed a long , langorous , relaxed , four - hour dinner , at least half of which was focused on how to eat a pig 's head .
It ws n't just food consumed in the presence of friends ; it was meat shared , a communal feast , an act of celebratory participation .
Or , as The Boy put it : " Pig fat is awesome .
And this was a lot of pig fat . "
There was a small motherlode of deliciousness at the temple , a couple of inches up behind the eye : it was similar to the oysters on a chicken , except juicier and more tender .

" Nettn?ytralitet " is coming to Norway .
Several ISPs , the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority , the Nowegian Cable TV Association , and consumer groups have all signed on today to a new document ( PDF ) outlining network neutrality principles .
Internet users are entitled to a connection with " predefined capacity and quality , " and they can access content without discrimination based on the sending or receiving address .
But there are some terrific caveats .
Thomas Nortvedt heads the Norwegian Consumer Council .
Although outright Internet discrimination has been largely unknown in Norway , Nortvedt says that it 's important to act anyway as ISPs increasingly become content providers , and conflicts of interest loom .
Thomas Nortvedt
" With Internet service providers offering their own content and services in competition with other content providers , it is very important to have a set of basic rules that ensure equal access and quality of service , " he said in a statement supporting the new principles .
" We cannot risk getting into a situation where Internet service providers give priority to their own IP telephony or IPTV services , say , making it difficult for other content providers to offer an equivalent , high quality service . "
The new rules lay out three guidelines .
First , Internet users must be given complete and accurate information about the service they are buying , including capacity and quality .
Second , users are allowed to send and receive content of their choice , use services and applications of their choice .
and connect any hardware and software that does n't harm the network .
Finally , the connection cannot be discriminated against based on application , service , content , sender , or receiver .
Within those guidelines , though , ISPs still retain tremendous freedom to act as they choose .
The second principle , for instance sounds more than a bit like the FCC 's current Internet policy statement , and it should — it was adapted from the FCC principles .
Like the FCC principles , the right to freely use a connection is limited to legal uses , so it does not preclude ISPs from blocking access some P2P file - sharing or all child pornography .
In the US , this has already lead ISPs to suggest that even intrusive deep packet inspection of user traffic would be acceptable , so long as the goal was rooting out such illegal uses .
Principle three prohibits traffic discrimination in general , but does allow " traffic management efforts on an operator ’s own network to block activities that harm the network , comply with orders from the authorities , ensure the quality of service for specific applications that require this , deal with special situations of temporary network overload or prioritize traffic on an individual user ’s connection according to the user ’s wishes . "
That 's a pretty tremendous list of exceptions , though it comes with safeguards .
While traffic like VoIP and streaming video can be prioritized , it does not appear that other traffic such as legal P2P downloads can actively be slowed ( prioritizing other traffic may have this effect , however ) .
The guidelines also say that when network management due to congestion is necessary , it should be done without regard to users of the services they are currently accessing .
The guiding idea here is that , as Nortvedt puts it , " It must be up to individual broadband customers to decide how to use their bandwidth . "
Willy Jensen , the Director General of the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority , noted that ISPs were supportive of this basic principle .
" Everyone who endorses these guidelines has made it clear that they support an open Internet on which different providers can compete freely to offer content and services , " he said .
" Internet users need to be assured that the Internet service provider they have chosen will not act as a gatekeeper for their Internet use . "
" He had a bit of an attack earlier , and seemed to calm down , but then he told his dad he was going to faint .
He then died in his arms . "
What 's In A Name
The name stands for the Thomas A Swift Electric Rifle , an allusion to the weapon carried by the hero of early 20th century science fiction young adult novels .
Tasers fire two barbs ( with quarter - inch fishhooks on the end ) capable of producing 50,000 - volt pulses into the targets ' central nervous system .
The shock frazzles the body 's electric signals , contracting muscles and incapacitating the target .
Each individual shock lasts up to five seconds , at the discretion of the shooter , allowing police to gain control of chaotic situations .
Aimed by a laser sight , the two probes have a range of 21 feet and are tethered to the gun by lightly insulated wire .
Both need to strike skin or clothing to be effective .
Fabric two inches thick or more , though , can render the jolt ineffective .
Tasers can also be used without the probes , by placing the guns end directly onto a suspect 's skin , and firing .
The weapons also have small microprocessors inside them that record every time an office shoots them , and how long the shocks lasted .
California ’s problems are well - known .
They have been in the making for sometime .
When I predicted a U.S. state would go bust this year , California was very much on my mind .
But , frankly , Kansas was nowhere on my radar screen .
Now both states have gotten my attention .
First Kansas ( hat tip Marshall ) :
State tax refunds , Medicaid reimbursements and payments to local schools are all on hold because of a political showdown between Kansas legislative leaders and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius .
The Kansas Finance Council was to meet at 1 p.m. today to vote on whether to borrow $ 225 million from healthy state funds to cover expected payments to schools , state workers and taxpayers .
The state did the same thing last December when it ran into a cash - flow problem .
But Republican leaders said they would n’t authorize the new loans until Sebelius , a Democrat , signs legislation designed to erase the state ’s current year budget deficit .
That bill , passed Thursday , cuts statewide school funding by $ 32 million and makes millions more in cuts to other state agencies .
If you recall , Kathleen Sebelius gave the Democratic rebuttal to the 2008 State of the Union Address .
She was tipped as a potential running mate for Obama .
And her name had surfaced after Tom Daschle withdrew his name for the post at Health and Human Services .
Her ambitions for national office are not looking very good .
Update : Sebelius got the deal done and is decamping to DC as head of HHS .
President Obama has faith in her skills .
This is a great outcome .
But , then there is California .
If they do n’t get revenue up or spending down , bankruptcy is certain .
They are looking to raise taxes in the teeth of a downturn to prevent a bad outcome — not exactly a good way to jump - start the economy .
Note the highlighted section below .
California ’s legislature adjourned from a marathon budget debate after falling one vote short of a $ 40 billion package of tax increases , spending cuts and borrowing aimed at reducing a record deficit .
Lawmakers went home at 9 p.m. yesterday after spending 28 hours in session while Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Senate leaders worked to secure an additional Republican vote for the package of 27 bills .
Schwarzenegger made rare appearances at closed - door party caucuses and urged a quick solution to the impasse .
“ We are just searching for that one more vote that we need in order to get that budget done , ” Schwarzenegger told reporters after the meeting .
Failure of the package would prolong a four - month stalemate over how to counter a record $ 42 billion deficit that drained California of cash , left it with the lowest credit rating among U.S. states , forced officials to delay paying bills totaling $ 3.7 billion and halted $ 3.8 billion of bond - financed construction on schools , roads and other public works .
The draft bills include plans to raise the state sales - tax rate to 8.25 percent from 7.25 percent ; boost vehicle license fees to 1.15 percent from 0.65 percent of the value of an automobile ; add 12 cents to the per -gallon gasoline tax ; reduce the dependant - care tax credit to $ 100 from $ 300 and impose a surcharge on income taxes of up to 5 percent .
If you are investing in municipal bonds , you might want to do some serious due diligence on the creditworthiness of the issuers .
The state and local bankruptcies are coming .

Let ’s start at the end of one story , the story of the dump , with the view from way up on top of it .
Let ’s start at the peak of what was once a steaming , stinking , seagull - infested mountain of trash , a peak that is now green , or greenish , or maybe more like a green - hued brown , the tall grasses having been recently mown by the sanitation workers still operating at Fresh Kills , on the western shore of Staten Island .
Today the sun dries the once slime - covered slopes , as a few hawks circle in big , slow swoops and a jet makes a lazy approach to Newark , just across the Arthur Kill .
The sky , when viewed from atop a twenty - story heap of slowly decomposing garbage — the so - called South Mound , a Tribeca - size drumlin surrounded by other trash mounds , some as long as a mile — is the kind of big blue that you expect to see somewhere else , like the middle of Missouri .
It ’s a great wide - open bowl , fringed with green hills ( some real , some garbage - filled ) that are some of the highest points on the Atlantic seaboard south of Maine .
Meanwhile , at your feet , hook - shaped white plastic tubes vent methane , the gas that builds up naturally in a landfill , a by - product of refuse being slowly digested by underground bacteria .
The hissing of landfill gas is soft and gentle , like the sound of a far - off mountain stream or the stove left on in your apartment .
But as you look a little longer , it ’s definitely not a Missouri view , and the unmistakable landmarks come into focus : a tower on the Verrazano - Narrows Bridge , a span of the Outerbridge Crossing , and , on Coney Island , the very top of the parachute jump .
In the foreground , trucks enter the landfill , climbing the mounds and dumping clean soil over not - so - clean soil .
It ’s all part of a radical plan to turn Fresh Kills landfill into Fresh Kills Park , with mountain bikers and kayakers and ballplayers sharing 2,315 acres of open space with restored maritime forests , with chestnut trees dotting dry prairies , with new or revived sweet - gum swamps , maybe a fox scooting through persimmon copses or a deer through a new birch thicket .
The composer of this massive reclamation project is James Corner , the landscape architect best known in New York as the designer of the High Line .
When that abandoned elevated railway turned inner-city park opens its first section this winter , its industrially influenced meadows , interstitial urban prairies , and sundecks will bring Corner ’s firm , Field Operations , a new round of international attention .
But as celebrated as the High Line will probably be , it is Field Operations ’ other New York park — the one that ’s bigger than lower Manhattan , and currently about the height of Mexico ’s Great Pyramid of Cholula — that may change people ’s ideas of what a park is all about .
In the late 1840s , Frederick Law Olmsted had an experimental farm on Staten Island , but by the time he and Calvert Vaux designed Central Park , he was less a farmer than an artist .
The environment they created looked like a landscape painting into which New Yorkers would stroll and recreate , like Mary Poppins jumping into the sidewalk sketches by Bert the chimney sweep .
The immigrant shantytowns and African - American villages that sat in the swampy land were all cleared away , and Olmsted built hills and streams by dragging in dirt and blasting outcroppings with more gunpowder than had been used at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Nature was n’t natural in today ’s locavore , native - plant sense ; it was a collection of natures , pastoral and picturesque , local but mostly exotic , with birds from Europe and trees from China .
The bushes in the Ramble , designed with the Adirondacks in mind , were chosen for their shade of green , as painterly effects .
The medieval castle was placed on a hilltop as a reference to Europe , as well as for fun .
Central Park was Platonic in theory and Barnumesque in practice .
“ It was designed as a natural Disneyland , ” says New York City Parks commissioner Adrian Benepe .
This idea of a park — a green , pastoral place to sport and play — has n’t evolved much since Central Park was finished .
Olmsted took his success to Brooklyn ( at the more ambitious Prospect Park ) and around the nation , working romantic landscape design into parks and greenbelts in Boston , Buffalo , Chicago , and Montreal .
Even Robert Moses , the most powerful Parks commissioner in the history of Parks commissioners , played along the Olmsted lines — a little nature here , a little recreation there , all of it looking very park , and not much like the land that was there before ( Jones Beach , for instance , had been a barrier island ) .
But now Corner is among the handful of landscape designers who are taking the idea of an urban park into un -parklike territory .

Corner acts uncomfortable talking about design , as if the aesthetic differences between the English countryside and the Tuileries are n’t particularly meaningful .
He ’d rather discuss concepts and processes , such as how a planner should approach an enormous trashed landscape .
“ Parks all start to look the same , ” he says , “ and that sameness is either the pastoral model or the modernist formal model , and this is my problem with style .
We try not to have a style . ”
When Corner and his team began to think about Fresh Kills , they knew that the site was so large and technically demanding that it would be distracting to think in terms of design the way Olmsted did .
So they have opted instead to “ grow ” the park .
“ Rather than choose between French and English landscaping — rather than designing a grand composition — we designed a method . ”
This was , in fact , a very American idea — think Jefferson ’s grid — and with this conceptual centerpiece , Field Operations settled on a philosophy that has guided all of their planning for the site :
They would not build a new park on top of an old dump .
Instead , they would make the old dump a part of the new park , by acknowledging it , reclaiming it , recycling it on behalf of a modern metropolis .
Corner did not see Fresh Kills as a painting , in other words ; he saw it as a palimpsest , a collaboration between a landscape architect and his landfill .
For a lot of people , it is as if a lot of conceptual deadwood had finally been cleared away .
“ I think Fresh Kills could be a model , ” says Steven Handel , a professor of ecology at Rutgers University who specializes in the ecology and restoration of beat - up places and has worked at Fresh Kills over the years .
“ It ’s a new paradigm for a park . ”
If landscape architects were birds , Corner would be a hawk , with his gray bristled crown , intense sharp - eyed grin , and reputation for circling old dumps , abandoned military facilities , closed industrial plants , and other large urban sites often referred to as disturbed .
In addition to Fresh Kills and the High Line , his firm is at work on a 950 - acre site on the lakefront of Toronto ; the Great Falls , which ran the mills in Paterson , New Jersey ( and was the first planned industrial site in the U.S. ) ; and Shelby Farms Park , which until the sixties was a penal farm .
“ There are all these postindustrial sites , and no one knows what to do with them , ” says Corner .
“ It ’s a big heyday now . ”
Corner founded Field Operations in 1998 , in Philadelphia , where he chairs the landscape - architecture department at the University of Pennsylvania .
He arrived at Penn fourteen years earlier , from England , where he grew up outside of Manchester , a hiker and climber who did n’t know he wanted to be a landscape architect until the British education system recommended it to him .
At Penn , he studied under Ian McHarg , a seminal figure in landscape architecture , the reinventor who started people using ecological systems as a design starting point .
Corner took McHarg to another level — putting people and history into the ecological studies of his predecessor .
After a few years mostly theorizing on landscape , he acquired a few projects , such as Fresh Kills and the High Line , that repositioned landscape architecture for a lot of people , and suddenly he was winning awards that normally go to architects .
Sometimes Corner is mistakenly called Olmsted but more overgrown , a park - maker with a penchant for less - manicured plantings .
In fact , he ’s more like Olmsted as modern - literature professor , a designer who sees the landscape as text , a place where stories are written and rewritten , one on top of the next , sometimes getting all smudged up .
At Field Operations , he is attempting to expand the idea of ecology to include not just rivers and streams but also subway lines , movements of capital , and weekend traffic .
“ To me , a city is an ecology — it ’s an ecology of money , an ecology of infrastructure , an ecology of people , ” he says .
“ Everyone thinks ecology is about nature , and it is , but there are so many other systems . ”
The ecology of city real - estate construction is such that the last open spaces in cities are the ones nobody wants , and often they are the biggest ones .
Corner has said he wants the public to dream big about Fresh Kills , but that ’s not too tough ; it ’s big already .
How do you reappropriate what was once a salt marsh and is now filled with roughly 150 million tons of waste ?
How do you manage all the leaking chemicals — the 312 gallons of liquid dump excretions processed by the Sanitation Department every minute ?
You do n’t just get rid of a landfill :
The garbage still decays , the hills still descend a few feet every year , as gas leaks and pollutants drain .
The Sanitation Department wo n’t be leaving the site for at least another three decades .
Thus , Fresh Kills is no -man ’s - land , or no -corporate - man ’s - land anyway , and the way we design a park there says a lot about how we confront land we have screwed up and how cities might be designed in the future .

The view from the mounds exists precisely because it was once a low - down , muddy , tidal place .
Before it was settled in the seventeenth century by French Huguenots , Walloons , and freed slaves , Fresh Kills was host to a large Native American population and was sometimes referred to by native people as Aquehonga Manacknong , or “ haunted woods . ”
Henry David Thoreau , living in Staten Island while trying to get freelance writing work in Manhattan , used to walk onto the marsh island in Fresh Kills to dig arrowheads , “ the surest crop . ”
Beginning in the late - nineteenth century , brickmakers dug out clay deposits , creating holes in the meadows that would later attract sanitation experts looking for places to dump .
Meanwhile , Staten Island was serving as a kind of spawning ground for naturalists in New York .
William T. Davis , the island ’s John Muir , rolled up his suit pants to explore the kills , so named for the old Dutch word for stream .
Landscape artists painted bundles of salt - marsh hay .
Men in hats rowed in Fresh Kills , while developers thought it was a shame it was n’t all developed .
Around 1947 , Robert Moses showed up with a plan to create new housing and parks on the site .
STATEN ISLAND BOG GIVES WAY TO PARK ran a Times headline at the time , and streets were laid out in anticipation .
But first the marshes would need to be filled in , a problem Moses solved by proposing first three and then twenty years of dumping .
Within a year , a fleet of scows began ferrying trash to the 3,000 - acre site .
The New York Audubon Society protested that at least some of the clay ponds should remain untouched by garbage .
“ Once it is destroyed , ” they warned , “ it can never be restored . ”
Moses initially consented , but he soon changed his mind :
By filling in the ponds , he argued , he was preventing possible drownings .
Not that the dumpings succeeded in keeping everyone out of the ponds .
As a kid in the fifties , Sanitation Commissioner Doherty used to camp along the kills with friends ; they ’d swing on a rope out into the murky water .
“ And we are all still relatively healthy , ” he says .
“ I said , ‘ Look , whatever we do , we ’ve got to keep the big and green .
These are views most people would have to drive hours to see . ’ ”
Fresh Kills was slowly filled in — the idea , of course , being simply to level off the meadows .
A mile - and - a - half - long lake was displaced , and the marshes absorbed the junk and jetsam and little lost notes of city history : a million dollars ’ worth of cocaine and heroin accidentally lost in a garbage scow ( 1948 ) ; eight capsules of radium accidentally taken from a doctor ’s office ( 1949 ) ; a leg , possibly from a gangland - style hit ( 1974 ) .
There were plans for airports , in 1966 , and , in 1970 , for “ a huge city within a city ” that Mayor Lindsay never built .
Moses ’s promised parks never arrived , either , and by the seventies , one could identify the elevated beginnings of what would eventually become four trash mountains .
“ Mounding , ” the city euphemistically called it , and officials imagined no more than 50 to 100 feet .
A city report tried to put a good face on mounding , calling it a “ superior land resource suitable for park and community development . ”
But the city knew it had a problem :
In 1972 , the Sanitation commissioner and the Environmental Protection administrator climbed a 55 - foot - tall , 30,000 - ton pile of garbage at Fresh Kills , as a teaching moment , to illustrate how much New York trashed every day ( at the time reportedly more than London and Tokyo combined ) .
As expanding environmental regulations increased the expenses attendant on landfill maintenance , the cash - strapped city consolidated , piling more garbage into fewer landfills — one can read the four giant mounds as past fiscal crises written into the landscape .
By the eighties , the city was down to four large dumps : one in the Bronx , one in Brooklyn , and two on Staten Island .
Regulations changed again , and the city was sued to make safer dumps , the result being the city agreed to close all but Fresh Kills .
This required upgrading on a military order .
“ When you have a place that ’s as big as all of below 23rd Street in Manhattan , ” says Phil Gleason , the engineer at the Sanitation Department in charge of the landfill for more than two decades , “ you do n’t just fix the place in a year . ”
Fresh Kills excretes two substances : natural gas and leachate .
Gas is dangerous — it can seep into utility lines and cause houses and neighborhoods to explode , a phenomenon not unheard of around landfills — but it is also valuable .
Today , Fresh Kills is mined for 10,000 square cubic feet of gas a day , and the city receives $ 10 million annually from a gas company called National Grid .
Leachate is more problematic .
All dumps perspire leachate , which forms when rainwater combines with trash to make a kind of polluted tea , or garbage juice .
New landfills are pre-lined with essentially clay and plastic .
An estuary is perhaps the worst possible location for a landfill from the perspective of sustainable ecological practices , but the clay found in the marshes of Fresh Kills might , in fact , be sealing in some leachate ( though despite all the engineering assurances in the world , some leachate is surely leaking out the bottom ) .
The leachate captured by the Sanitation Department is mostly composed of ammonia , which is not the worst toxic chemical as far as incredibly toxic chemicals go , but not good , either .

In 1999 , bowing to political pressure from Staten Island , Rudolph Giuliani announced that he would be closing Fresh Kills landfill and that the city would ship its trash to South Carolina .
In 2003 , Mayor Bloomberg , then at his lowest popularity levels , courted votes on Staten Island by proposing a park at Fresh Kills .
The Municipal Arts Society had been exploring post - landfill uses for the site , and sponsored a contest with the City Planning department for landscape architects .
In September 2003 , Mayor Bloomberg announced Field Operations the winner , with Staten Island borough president James Molinaro calling the plan “ the final nail in the heart of Dracula , ” meaning the landfill was finally closed for good .
The closing caught the engineers of the mound by surprise ; the tallest mound had suddenly stopped at a 220 - foot plateau .
You do n’t want plateaus on landfills ; to channel rainwater in a controlled fashion , the mound would have to be regraded .
The landfill was temporarily reopened to accommodate material from the World Trade Center , just as a design competition for the park had begun .
( Some material with human remains in it was mixed in with other debris , so that relatives of 9/11 victims have sued the city unsuccessfully to sort through all the rubble again , and a 9/11 memorial is part of the park plan . )
Today , if you go on one of the tours of the site given by the Parks Department , you can see trucks finishing off the East Mound with so - called “ clean - fill ” from construction sites and channel dredging as well as soil — topping it off like a cup of coffee in a diner .
Even closed , the landfill needs feeding .
The first time Corner saw the view from the East Mound was summer 2001 , when he toured the site in a van with other landscape architects competing for the commission .
Every contestant ended up emphasizing so - called green ideas like recycling , native planting , and the use of sustainable - energy sources .
Hargraves Associates featured Olmsted - sounding names like “ The Meadows ” and “ The Preserve ” ; John M. Caslan and Partners proposed “ ecospheres , ” or giant domes that housed various American climates ; and Rios ’s plan featured an intrapark amphibious shuttle bus .
But none of the competitors addressed the trash hills as explicitly as Corner .
Linda Pollak , reviewing the competition in Praxis in 2002 , noted the enormous opportunity for the “ conceptual reengineering of these constructed mountains . ”
“ Yet for the most part , ” she noted , “ these competition entries maintain a silence around their vast presence . ”
Corner , in contrast , recognized that these Wall - E-esque trash heaps were the most significant feature of the land .
“ I was just blown away by the scope and beauty of the place , ” he recalls .
Embracing the hills was as counterintuitive to most city - park design as it was consistent with Corner ’s philosophy of landscape , which was to take chances with what he called “ the tough , machinic , strange quality of these sites ” to reinvent a city dweller ’s recreational landscape .
The takeaway point : Keep the views , which he knew would blow away every New Yorker who will , 40 years from now , take a hybrid bus or solar - powered ferry to the place .
“ I said , ‘ Look , whatever we do we ’ve got to keep the big and green .
These are views and vistas that most people in a city would have to drive three or four hours to see . ’ ”
Just traveling through a landfill gets the average landscape architect pretty hyped up ; geologic forces alone would never have created mounds like these .
“ I ’m really excited about the structural aspects , ” says Ellen Neises , Field Operations ’ project designer for the park ’s master plan .
She and her husband cruised Staten Island on weekends when Field Operations was developing the competition entry , meeting with plant specialists , comparing every other park in the borough , and now in her mind ’s eye she can see the transition from Fresh Kills landfill to Fresh Kills Park .
She points to an old playground , Schmul Park , and asks you to imagine a strip of small trees near an entry parking area .
This tree farm , run by the Greenbelt Native Plant Center , will be a staging ground for native plants — trees like eastern red cedar , black tupelo , and sweet gum — that will later be transplanted to the mounds and the lowlands around South Park .
This first patch of Fresh Kills Park , in other words , will contain the ingredients for the rest .
In the nineties , Steven Handel , the ecologist from Rutgers , showed that small communities of native flora could be planted and , with some human help , could steal sunlight from invasive plant species and eventually beat them out .
“ We were having birds bring in seeds , not contractors , ” Handel says .
Field Operations adopted the idea in parts of the park , taking advantage of the mounds ’ different moisture zones to seed forests and propagate plants .

Corner relates the architecture of the place to something more along the lines of forest and landscape management than typical park development .
“ You start with nothing , and you grow , through management , a more diverse ecology , ” he says .
“ You take a very sterile or inert foundation and move something in .
It ’s like lichen .
They quickly grow and die , grow and die , creating a rich soil that something else can grow onto .
And that ’s how ecosystems grow . ”
The only way to come close to seeing a fully grown Fresh Kills , at least for the moment , is to visit Corner ’s studio on the far West Side of Manhattan , where , after seven years of narrating the development with a laptop and a projector , he still manages to show a lot of excitement for the vision .
( Field Operations is known for its excellent , if abstract , graphics — a partly defensive strategy , perhaps , as a certain amount of obscurity makes a target more difficult to kill . )
To fast - forward to a view of Fresh Kills , say , 40 years from now , we hover over the site , looking down on the four centerpiece mounds .
Bands of green and brown indicate trees that have bridged to the woods and neighborhood off - site .
Sedges and spartina grass have returned to the tidal estuary , and we see muddy tidal flats , lowland swamps , and drier , prairielike fields .
We see bogs , birch thicket , maple swamp forests , and Pine Barren–like woodlands .
Some kayakers can be spotted in the Richmond Creek , one of the main channels , and there are hikers visible off in the woods .
At the base of some mounds , we see people playing sports .
Each of the five sections of the park will have a distinctive feel .
The North Park will be treated like wilderness — in fact , more than half of the park will be open land .
At 233 acres , North Park will be small , about the size of the park on Randalls Island .
The 425 - acre South Park , near the Arden Heights neighborhood , is a smaller mound surrounded by more recreational activities — soccer fields , horse and mountain - bike trails , and , at the peak of the trash mound , views of the watery valley of the garbage dumps , now lush and green and dotted with kayaks .
In the East Park , which will be a little more than half the size of Central Park , large vegetated spaces are planned , and along Richmond Avenue , which runs north - south and is parallel to the Staten Island Mall , Corner talks about nature - education stations — with boardwalks , educational wetlands , public art exhibits , and places for explicitly recreational activities like golf .
Landscape should be edifying , but it does n’t have to be apocalyptic .
West Park , centered on the westernmost mound , will be home to the 9/11 memorial , an earthwork monument the same size and scale as the World Trade Center but laid flat in a wildflower meadow .
Little streams will feed out of the park ’s wild areas , and people will congregate at the so - called Confluence , where the two main creeks meet .
Five times the size of Battery Park , the Confluence will attract visitors with restaurants , arcades , and parking .
It will be decorated with the artifacts of the landfill operation , like cranes and trash barges converted into floating gardens .
Of course , a lot of the what - will - be questions are too specific for Corner , as they distract from his view of the place as a story unfolding , a process being modulated by elected officials not yet in office and parkgoers just graduating preschool .
There are no firm dates , he emphasizes .
Field Operations has built the park ’s growth strategy around four very rough time periods — or park - building concepts — that together make up a “ Lifescape . ”
First comes Moundscape , which begins immediately , thanks to the mounds .
It ’s the least work - intensive stage , highlighting the beauty of the place as it is : a faraway , view - rich open space where the trash is still compacting , the Sanitation Department is still processing fluids and gases , and garbage trucks are still covering the mounds .
The time between the raw beginning of the long - term plan and sensorial payoff wo n’t be so bad .
“ You do n’t have to wait 30 years , ” says Corner .
Instead , he refers to it as a “ very early landscape . ”
In this early stage , visitors will be able to enter Schmul Park , where they will find a few roads and trails as well as a sprinkling of more - traditional parklike amenities , such as playgrounds and picnic areas in North Park , and a visit will be like going for a walk in the country , except the hills will be garbage hills .
Within a few years , the site will have grown into the Fieldscape stage .
Translation :
The mounds will have settled , and park employees will begin planting grass and young shrubs and trees on them ; soil production will have commenced .
This will brighten the park ’s color palette , as the hill slopes start to look like grainfields in western Washington State .
“ At this scale , it could be land art , ” Corner points out , “ because as you are driving the expressway , you see these big bands of color . ”
By the time of Openscape , more and more pixeled people are entering the imagery , walking among remnants of the mining equipment used by the Sanitation Department to sculpt the mounds .
Kayakers skirt wildlife areas , where presumably there will be more deer than there already are in Staten Island .
The finish line , Eventscape , heightens the ecological complexity of the site , adding more amenities , restaurants , and gatherings .

It ’s conceptual , of course — the park looks cool in the renderings , a little like Mount Desert Island , if it were on the Jersey shore .
But it ’s not clear to anyone exactly how much it ’ll cost , or whether Fresh Kills will ride out the fiscal crises in permanent Moundscape .
So far , the city has budgeted $ 8.8 million for park design , which will go to Field Operations and its subcontractors .
The first North Park step is planned to cost $ 21 million , or nearly $ 1 million an acre .
“ It ’s much more than a normal park would cost , ” says Eloise Hirsh , the park administrator for Fresh Kills .
Imported clean soil goes for up to $ 80 a cubic foot , for instance , and plans will need to be made to keep the landfill infrastructure vandalproof .
But given the financial climate , it may be that the super - long - term trajectory of Corner ’s plan shields it from the cyclical strains on city coffers .
Flush budgets will come and go , he seems to be saying , and the Lifescape is designed to absorb that .
Some landscape architects complain that the Field Operations plan camouflages the landfill too much , which makes his critics sound , in a way , more Corner than Corner .
Why should forests and wildflower fields mask the postindustrial mess we New Yorkers created ?
Why should we not see the trash , or at least the remediation process , more clearly ?
The ultimate in contemporary disturbed - site projects is Landschaftspark Duisburg - Nord , a 500 - acre park in the Ruhr Valley of northwestern Germany , where Thyssen produced steel for 100 years .
About twenty years ago , the government called for plans for adaptive reuse of the brownfield site , and landscape architect Peter Latz came forward with a design that created a playground , literally , within the industrial wasteland — underwater diving in the old gas tanks , rock climbing in the disused sewage channels .
As much as Corner admired Latz ’s achievement , Fresh Kills does n’t offer him the same opportunities for romantic decrepitude .
For starters , most ecologists argue that we ca n’t just leave a place like Fresh Kills a broken dump .
“ If you left it alone , ” says Handel , “ it would change , but it would change in a depauperate way . ”
And Corner can’t imagine exposing , say , leachate streams for teaching - moment purposes , especially in a city where parents sue if their children ’s feet burn on hot playgrounds .
“ I think landscape should be edifying , but there are joyous and optimistic ways .
It does n’t have to be so apocalyptic . ”
When you are walking around Fresh Kills today , the hills look at once magnificent and strange , a little bit solemn and prehistoric , a little eerie — a cross between the Cahokia Mounds in Illinois , which mark the site of an ancient Native American city that thrived between 700 and 1,400 A.D. , and the mounds of the Teletubbies .
Big , long trucks crawl across the top of the East Mound , bulldozers scratching , laying down loads of clean - fill to close up the top of the dump , a decadelong process .
The long drumlin - shaped mound features long lines , parallel to the ground , giving the appearance of fallow farm fields .
Phragmites reeds are everywhere , along with ailanthus trees and mugwort — it ’s an Eden of the small number of species that thrive in poor soils and beat - up ecologies .
You feel free , as people so often do in old industrial sites , as if the rules are a little bit off .
The rules are not off , of course , and the Sanitation Department is still a little nervous seeing people out here , especially if they ’re carrying cameras .
Not too long ago , a young , hip designer , new to Field Operations , was wandering on the site , and the sanitation worker in charge of security looked at him as if he had wandered in from some nightclub .
And if you have any history at the site , if you remember it when it was covered with stinking trash , if you remember the day the very last municipal trash barge came in , as I do ( I happened to be there ) , then it feels like a ghost town , so many workers gone , no more municipal garbage rattling out the backs of trucks , with fences everywhere trying to contain the garbage , booms out on the water holding back the trash as it tries to make a break for it and float away to Jersey .
You can walk the little land bridges crossing creeks that were once fresh and then polluted and now dead and dry .
There are patches of what you might call natural landscapes : Near the South Mound , there are little beachheads of spartina , the same indigenous salt - marsh grass that once covered most of the area .
You can see groves of trees planted by people like Steven Handel and also Richard Lynch , a longtime Staten Island naturalist who has single - handedly put in mini-forests in the area .
But mostly the place feels one - note , beaten - down , and tired .
The machines that were used to move around trash were originally designed for the mining industry : huge monsterlike diggers , one of which , courtesy of the Sanitation Department , is being dismantled so that it can be moved beneath the West Shore Expressway and stationed along the road .
From the jaws of the old tool will dangle the first sign to announce the new park ; it will be Field Operations –style graphically cool .
It will also announce the beginning of the work of reimagining that the public has to do .
“ One of the biggest things about Fresh Kills , ” says Corner , “ is that there are so many bureaucracies and entities involved .
And there ’s no king , there ’s no mayor , there ’s no one individual .
Whatever happens is going to be a collective .
You ’ve got to continually mediate conflicting interests . ”
The most complicated part of the design is the idea that it is designed to change .
“ Large parks will always exceed singular narratives , ” Corner wrote in a recent essay .
“ They are larger than the designer ’s will for authorship . ”
He added , “ The trick is to design a large park framework that is sufficiently robust to lend structure and identity while also having sufficient pliancy and ‘ give ’ to adapt to changing demands and ecologies over time . ”
Early on , people were saying there should not be a park there .
There were the health and safety issues that people thought were insurmountable .
Now it appears to be a given that there will be a park there , and that it will be different somehow .
“ I think people get it , ” says Eloise Hirsh , the park administrator .
Very few urban parks compare to Fresh Kills in terms of size .
The smaller Bois de Boulogne comes to mind , as does Amsterdamse Bos , the man -made woods adjacent to Amsterdam .
In St. Louis , Forest Park is bigger than Central Park but about half the size of what Fresh Kills is slated to be .
What it will be is as significant as what it was in the past , so that there is some kind of a moral , a teaching moment , buried in the new Fresh Kills idea , even if Corner does n’t want to say so :
If we learn how to make a dump into something else , something that ’s still somehow related to a dump , then we might make better dumpers in the future , and we will think differently or just think about how and when we fill the land .
Fresh Kills is like forest succession on a simultaneously human and industrial basis , like a nurse log in the woods , where one plant moves in on the back of another , where one use is superseded by another , one layer of ideas on top of the last .
Walking around , you can think about these things , and feel a kind of excitement , and then all of the sudden get freaked out by a feral cat and wonder where the hell it came from .
We asked readers for help understanding the bonus situation at AOL .
Here 's some of the feedback we 've received so far ( thanks ! ) .
More as we get it .
We had a group all - hands meeting last week , and here are the notes I jotted down .
In talking with other employees in different groups , we all got basically the same speech from our Directors / VPs .
- no merit increases ( as communicated )
- was n't in the memo , did n't want to get posted to the blogs , instead communicated verbally from mgmt :
- no 2008 bonus across the board ( did n't make numbers )
- 2 bonuses in 2009
- Jan-June , paid in July ( individual perf )
- July - Dec , paid in Jan 2010 ( company numbers )
and there was some other , * yawn * boring stuff about how 700 layoffs was probably on the high end ( yeah , right ) , and we all did great work so we should n't be too worried ( heard that one before ) , and how we need to change our strategies to monetize anything and everything we can ( because cramming more obnoxious ads on a page is really going to save the company ) .
Nothing specific was mentioned about Randy and Ron getting / not getting their bonuses , but since they 're all tied to the company 's numbers ... if they get one cent , you can bet there 's going to be a lynch mob waiting outside the NYC HQ ( or whatever luxury office complex they hide in these days ) .
During the last Platform - A All Hands call with Lynda it was announced there would be no merit increases for 2009 and the 2008 bonuses would not be paid .
This is only true for those on the AIP bonus plan .
Those who are on a sales plan will still recieve bonuses / comission should they meet their set sales goals .

Last week , I had lunch with my friend , Hugh Spencer , a writer and designer of museum and public educational exhibitions .
He told me an amazing story about his son and games , and I asked him to write it up for Boing Boing :
This is a picture of my amazing youngest son Evan .
He 's 13 , he's
holding a game controller and looking at a glowing screen and he's
doing what he does a lot of — diving into digital realms of
adventure .
His latest favourite game is Call of Duty – which he plays on - line
with his friends .
Evan 's wanting to play C of D was something of a
challenge for us .
It 's rated T and he 's only just a teenager and
point and shoot first person games worry me some .
Evan is
relentlessly reasonable sometimes — he outlined why he wanted to play
the game and he was pretty upfront why he knew my " parent - sense " would
start tingling .
So I had to be reasonable too .
I looked at the game .
I 've done a lot of research for military museums so I could tell that
the content was accurate — but there was lots of shooting and blowing
things up .
But there was a fair bit of that during World War II .
So
it was undeniable that Evan was experiencing history and there was
this teamwork factor …
So we compromised .
Well , sort of .
I asked Evan to google the Geneva Convention .
Then he had to read it
and then we had to discuss it .
This we did .
So the deal is that Evan
has to fight according to the rules of the Geneva Convention .
If his
team - mates violate the Convention then play stops and Call of Duty
goes away for a while .
We 'll see how it goes , but Evan keeps his word .
Especially about his games .

Intel is feeling pretty confident about the ramp of its 32nm processors , set for production in late 2009 .
In fact , the company says it's " accelerating " the process shrink by skipping 45 nm chips that were going to arrive later this year .
The upcoming Westmere launch will " de- emphasise * " 45 nm Auburndale chips that Intel planned on letting co-exist with its new 32nm line in 2009 .
Instead , those Auburndale wafers will be used to increase production of Westmere desktop and notebook chips .
Intel detailed its revised roadmap at a press event in San Francisco today .
Westmere mobile and desktop chips are still on schedule for production in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
But Intel would n't comment on when OEMs could be expected to introduce products using the chips .
The initial ramp will focus on the mainstream market , rather than chips for high - end PCs and servers .
Intel said it decided on its volume ramp platforms well ahead of time .
So , according to the company , it 's just a happy coincidence that there 's a lot more focus on getting cheaper kit during this recession year .
Westmere will launch with two cores and four threads for mainstream desktops and the mobile market .
The desktop chip is code - named ' Clarkdale ' and the mobile chip , ' Arrandale . '
Intel said both Clarkdale and Arrandale offerings in 2009 will have clock speeds at a similar range to what the company has today .
But what will give them a boost in performance is hyperthreading and an ability to switch between on - die graphics and discrete graphics .
This is the first Intel chip to offer switchable on - die / discrete graphics .
The on - die graphics will host a 2 - channel DDR3 memory controller .
Westmere will scale to a six - core / 12 - thread processor called ' Gulftown ' later in 2010 .
According to the company 's roadmap , it does n't plan on having a 32nm chip in production without integrated graphics this year .
The graphics core inside Westmere will be 45 nm tech .
Westmere processors also include Intel 's new AES instruction set , which Intel said will be a similar upgrade to adding SSE4.1 in 45 nm Penryn chips .
The CPUs will be compatible with Intel 's 5 - series chipsets .
Intel said it will be baking Westmere chips at its D1D fab in Oregon , followed by the D1C fab in Oregon in the fourth quarter .
Production will also begin at Intel 's fabs in Arizona and New Mexico in 2010 . ®

This post first ran on January 29th on my mortgage blog .
It got some traction there and a few mentions in the press so , lazy bastard that I am , I ’m reproducing it here in a slightly improved form that corrects my own math error .
Take a look at this chart that someone sent to me a couple days ago .
I ’m making it big so you can see as much detail as possible .
Have a look and then come back , okay ?
Pretty scary , eh ?
It ’s a chart showing the deterioration of major bank market caps since 2007 .
Prepared by someone at JP Morgan based on data from Bloomberg , this chart flashed across Wall Street and the financial world a few days ago , filling thousands of e-mail in boxes .
Putting a face on the current banking crisis it really brought home to many people on Wall Street the critical position the financial industry finds itself in .
Too bad the chart is wrong .
It ’s a simple error , really .
The bubbles are two - dimensional so they imply that the way to see change is by comparing AREAS of the bubbles .
But if you look at the numbers themselves you can see that ’s not the case .
Take CitiGroup , for example .
The CITI market cap dropped from $ 255 billion to $ 19 billion — a difference of 13.4X .
If we ’re really comparing the areas of the bubbles , that means 13.4 of those tiny CitiGroup - of - today bubbles should precisely fill the big CitiGroup - of - the - good - old - days bubble .
Only they wo n’t .
As a matter of fact it would take about 13.4 times as many little bubbles to fill the big bubble as the chart preparer thought or 179.64 little bubbles .
Pi r squared , remember ?
This is because the intended comparison was n’t two - dimensional but one - dimensional — the chart maker was intending we compare the DIAMETERS of the bubbles , not their areas .
So it ’s a typo : no big deal , right ?
Yeah , but what a typo !
It got past Bloomberg and JP Morgan and pretty much all of Wall Street before someone said , “ Hey , this makes no sense ! ”
And who was that someone ?
Me !
A nobody .
Or at least someone unimportant enough not to be asking for a Federal bailout .
How could this be ?
It ’s because Wall Street does n’t work the way we think it does — the way we are led to believe it does .
Wall Street is a marketplace , a selling ground where everything from ideas to stocks and bonds are on sale every day .
And there is nobody easier to sell to than a salesman .
Come up with a good chart that ’s ALMOST within an order of magnitude of reality , put a disclaimer on the bottom , and let ‘er rip .
No wonder we ’re in a global financial crisis .
The people we count on to understand what ’s going on ca n’t even read a chart .

Bailout hearings
Man says , " Mr. Dogbert , did you fly here in a corporate jet ? "
Dogbert says , " Yes , the same jet that took you on a fact - finding trip to Aruba , you wool - coated glob of fat . "
Dogbert says , " Bring it on !
I can do this all day . "
Man says , " I yield my time to the hypocrite from another state . "
Anheuser - Busch gave him six figures , Colgate - Palmolive shelled out $ 50,000 and Macy ’s and Pfizer have contributed thousands to the Rev. Al Sharpton ’s charity .
Almost 50 companies – including PepsiCo , General Motors , Wal - Mart , FedEx , Continental Airlines , Johnson & Johnson and Chase – and some labor unions sponsored Sharpton ’s National Action Network annual conference in April .
Terrified of negative publicity , fearful of a consumer boycott or eager to make nice with the civil - rights activist , CEOs write checks , critics say , to NAN and Sharpton – who brandishes the buying power of African - American consumers .
In some cases , they hire him as a consultant .
The cash flows even as the US Attorney ’s Office in Brooklyn has been conducting a grand - jury investigation of NAN ’s finances .
A General Motors spokesman told The Post that NAN had repeatedly – and unsuccessfully – asked for contributions for six years , beginning in August 2000 .
Then , in December 2006 , Sharpton threatened to call a boycott of the carmaker over the closing of an African - American - owned GM dealership in The Bronx , and he picketed outside GM headquarters on Fifth Avenue .
Last year , General Motors gave NAN a $ 5,000 donation .
It gave $ 5,000 more this year , a spokesman said , calling NAN a “ worthy ” organization .
In November 2003 , Sharpton picketed DaimlerChrysler ’s Chicago car show and threatened a boycott over alleged racial bias in car loans .
“ This is institutional racism , ” he bellowed .
In May 2004 , Chrysler began supporting NAN ’s conferences , which include panels on corporate responsibility and civil rights and a black - tie awards dinner to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Last year , Sharpton gave Chrysler an award for corporate excellence .
In 2003 , Sharpton targeted American Honda for not hiring enough African - Americans in management .
“ We support those that support us , ” wrote Sharpton and the Rev. Horace Sheffield III , president of NAN ’s Michigan chapter , in a letter to American Honda .
“ We cannot be silent while African - Americans spend hard - earned dollars with a company that does not hire , promote or do business with us in a statistically significant manner . ”
Two months after American Honda execs met with Sharpton , the carmaker began to sponsor NAN ’s events – and continues to pay “ a modest amount ” each year , a spokesman said .
“ I think this is quite clearly a shakedown operation , ” said Peter Flaherty , president of the National Legal and Policy Center in Virginia , a conservative corporate watchdog .
“ He ’s good at harassing people and making noise .
CEOs give him his way because it is a lot easier than confronting him . ”
Sharpton denies his organization pressures corporations for cash .
“ That ’s the old shakedown theory that the anti-civil - rights forces have used against us forever , ” he told The Post yesterday .
“ Why ca n’t they come up with one company that says that ?
No one has criticized me . ”
A businessman who hired Sharpton as a consultant says the flamboyant leader skillfully persuades CEOs by wielding the statistic that African - Americans spend $ 738 billion a year .
“ His way of doing things was , ‘ If we ’re going to support you and you ’re not going to support us , then we have to focus on telling the African - American community not to spend their money , ’ ” said La -Van Hawkins , a partner in Hawkins Food Group , which owns and operates fast - food franchises nationwide .
Hawkins spoke from the Yankton Federal Prison in South Dakota , where he ’s serving time for attempted bribery .
After Hawkins lost an attempt to sue Burger King in 2000 for denying him franchises , he sent Sharpton , attorney Johnnie Cochran and a Miami lawyer to meet with the company ’s top execs .
“ They ended up settling with me for $ 31 million , ” Hawkins said .
Sharpton did not get a cut , but Hawkins Food Group paid him an annual $ 25,000 fee , Hawkins said .
He said he has donated “ over $ 1 million ” to NAN .
Sharpton has snagged other gigs as a consultant .
Less than a year after he threatened to call for a consumer boycott of Pepsi in June 1998 because the company ’s ads did not portray African - Americans , the company hired him as a $ 25,000 - a- year adviser until 2007 .
Sharpton made the same complaint against Macy ’s in 1998 .
The company appointed Sharpton an unpaid adviser on diversity , but also funds NAN ’s annual conference .
Last week , Macy ’s Senior Vice President Ed Goldberg praised Sharpton as “ the kind of guy you can sit down and talk to . ”
In a dramatic flip - flop , Sharpton in 2000 blasted New York developer Bruce Ratner for paying low wages to workers at his Atlantic Mall in Brooklyn .
“ We will not allow you to enslave our communities , Mr. Ratner , ” Sharpton told a rally .
“ You must meet with us – you must come to terms with the poverty you are creating using public dollars . ”
By 2004 , the developer ’s company , Forest City Ratner , had begun to fork over thousands of dollars to NAN .
Sharpton now strongly supports Ratner ’s proposed Atlantic Yards project , which includes a new arena for the New Jersey Nets .
“ Just because Pepsi and other companies had me on their board advising them did n’t mean that I was n’t blasting them all the time , ” said Sharpton .
“ Look at Forest City Ratner .
I blasted them and they came up with one of the best community agreements for blacks and Latinos . ”
NAN , which began humbly in Harlem in 1991 with Saturday - morning rallies at PS 175 , now boasts 45 chapters across the country .
The group lobbies for African - American rights and raises awareness of issues such as police brutality and racial profiling .
“ Sharpton went national just like a franchise , ” said Flaherty .
“ Each of these local chapters can now hit up businesses for support in their communities . ”
In 2002 , NAN launched a Las Vegas chapter that solicits corporate and individual donations of up to $ 5,000 on its Web site .
NAN spokesman Charlie King said all donations go through the New York office .
It ’s unclear how much the chapter has raised , because Nevada does not require charities to report their revenues .
King would not give numbers .
Sharpton vowed to call a national boycott against MGM Mirage in 2001 and 2002 if it refused to meet with him to discuss alleged racism in hiring and employment at the company ’s Detroit casino .
In 2003 , MGM named NAN one of its diversity “ partners ” in Detroit .
Sharpton sticks up for his corporate patrons .
Since 2005 , Wal - Mart has given yearly support to NAN , including sponsorship of last April ’s conference , without disclosing the amounts .
In 2006 , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , a Sharpton rival , accused the retailer of buying silence from critics of its employment practices by trying to “ throw money at us . ”
At the time , Sharpton rushed to the company ’s defense .
“ Wal - Mart has in no way tried to persuade me with money , ” he declared .
NAN , a tax - exempt nonprofit , closely guards its corporate largesse .
Most companies also keep the sums secret , and some would not divulge them .
The corporations interviewed by The Post viewed their relationships with NAN as friendly and beneficial .
Anheuser - Busch states on its
Web site that it gave the group “ between $ 100,000 and $ 499,000 ” last year .
Last year , Attorney General Andrew Cuomo found NAN had failed to file years ’ worth of financial reports .
The group has filed more records , but the AG ’s office said it wo n’t release them pending the US attorney ’s probe .
In its 2006 IRS filing , the latest available , NAN reported about $ 1 million in contributions and $ 1.1 million in expenses and programs .
It owes the IRS $ 1.9 million in payroll taxes , The Post has learned .
A NAN spokesman said the group is cooperating with authorities “ to pay whatever obligations it owes and continues to do so . ”

Lackluster spending on clothes , cars , legal services and most everything else has left California ’s economy listless , just about guaranteeing that the state ’s 10.1 % unemployment in January will march upward until at least the end of the year , economists predicted .
The Golden State lost 79,300 payroll jobs in January , pushing the monthly unemployment rate to its highest level since June 1983 , when the country was starting to recover from a deep recession .
Job losses in January escalated across all industries -- including , notably , motion picture and sound recording -- with the state ’s unemployment rate jumping 1.4 percentage points from a revised 8.7 % for December .
Unfortunately , California still is falling into what appears to be a crippling downturn , said Howard Roth , chief economist at the state Department of Finance .

“ There ’s very little demand out there , ” he said .
“ Certainly consumers are depressed , and businesses are n’t going to buy as long as consumers are n’t buying . ”
The stagnation was even more pervasive in Los Angeles County , where unemployment rose from 9.2 % in December to 10.5 % , almost twice the rate recorded in January 2008 .
All areas of the local economy declined in January compared with the previous month , with motion picture and sound recording losing 22,300 jobs , retail trade 15,100 , educational and health services 7,000 and leisure and hospitality 4,100 .
Layoffs by large California employers , which must be reported to government agencies , accounted for nearly 1 out of every 4 so - called mass layoffs nationwide , the U.S. Department of Labor said this week .
Advertisement
According to state filings , the layoffs affected all areas of the economy .
Financial giant JPMorgan Chase listed more than 1,000 at locations in both Northern and Southern California .
No one is safe , said Esther Surjanto , who last month lost her job as an order clerk at a Los Angeles garment plant .
“ We have no time to pity party , ” she said .
“ Even the big , dream companies where you ’d like to work are laying people off . ”
“ California is hemorrhaging faster than the U.S. economy , ” said Sung Won Sohn , an economist at Cal State Channel Islands .
California consistently has ranked among a handful of states with the country ’s highest unemployment .
Advertisement
The jobs picture here is likely to keep deteriorating because the state no longer can assume that education and health services will generate new jobs , Sohn warned .
“ Given the budget crisis we ’re having , I do n’t think we can count on government to prop up the economy either , ”
New data on the national economy ’s performance , also released Friday , affirmed Sohn ’s grim assessment .
The Commerce Department reported that the economy contracted at an annualized rate of 6.2 % in the last quarter of 2008 , the most severe slowdown in 26 years .
“ The road to full economic recovery will not be short , ” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger cautioned .
He said the state was counting on President Obama ’s stimulus package and more modest efforts on the state level to set the stage for new job growth .
But at least some of the positive effect of the $ 787 - billion stimulus program could be lost to California now that the state has raised taxes by $ 12.5 billion as part of a deal to close a $ 441 - billion budget deficit , economist Esmael Adibi of Chapman University in Orange said .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t expect as much stimulus as there could have been , ” he said .
“ After the budget passed , I became more pessimistic about the outlook for job creation here . ”
Although stimulus spending on highways , levees and other public works could eventually lead to more hiring , the economy here wo n’t begin to turn around until “ housing finds its bottom , ” said Russ DeVol , director of regional economics for the Milken Institute in Santa Monica .
The odds of that happening this year diminish with each onslaught of bad news , he said .
The state ’s economic decline is sweeping , making the recession the “ worst in the postwar period , ” DeVol said .

The New Orleans Secular Humanist Association recently got approval for their own contribution to the unofficial atheism marketing campaign :
An atheist sign on a streetcar !
It ’s one ad .
It costs $ 550 .
And it ’ll be up through Mardi Gras .
Association President Harry Greenberger said his 100 - member group , like others across the nation , is looking for like - minded individuals who support their statement of principles : “ To reject efforts to denigrate human intelligence , to seek to explain the world in supernatural terms and to look outside nature for salvation . ”
“ We do n’t proselytize , ” Greenberger said .
“ Our problem from the beginning has been : How do we let people know we are here ? ”
The phone number listed on the ad will put callers in touch with Greenberger , who said prospective secular humanists will be invited to attend their monthly gatherings .
I know what you ’re thinking :
How will this ad reach any atheists during Mardi Gras ?!
I do n’t know .
We ’ll just have to pray that they do …
Congratulations to NOSHA for making an unoffensive ad that speaks to the atheists in the area .
I hope their membership rises and makes other non-religious people aware that they ’re not alone in their thinking .
( Thanks to Doug for the link ! )

CARACAS , Jan 6 ( Reuters ) - Venezuela has expelled the ambassador to Israel in protest over the offensive in the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 500 Palestinians , Venezuela 's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday .

Early whales gave birth on land , fossil find reveals
Two newly described fossil whales --- a pregnant female and a male of the same species -- reveal how primitive whales gave birth and provide new insights into how whales made the transition from land to sea .
The 47.5 million - year - old fossils , discovered in Pakistan in 2000 and 2004 and studied at the University of Michigan , are described in a paper published Feb. 4 in the online journal PLoS .
U -M paleontologist Philip Gingerich , who led the team that made the discoveries , was at first perplexed by the assortment of adult female and fetal bones found together .
" When I first saw the small teeth in the field , I thought we were dealing with a small adult whale , but then we continued to expose the specimen and found ribs that seemed too large to go with those teeth , " he said .
" By the end of the day , I realized we had found a female whale with a fetus . "
In fact , it is the first discovery of a fetal skeleton of an extinct whale in the group known as Archaeoceti , and the find represents a new species dubbed Maiacetus inuus .
( Maiacetus means " mother whale , " and Inuus was a Roman fertility god . )
The fetus is positioned for head - first delivery , like land mammals but unlike modern whales , indicating that these whales still gave birth on land .
Another clue to the whales ' lifestyle is the well - developed set of teeth in the fetus , suggesting that Maiacetus newborns were equipped to fend for themselves , rather than being helpless in early life .
The 8.5 - foot - long male specimen , collected four years later from the same fossil beds , shares characteristic anatomical features with the female of the species , but its virtually complete skeleton is 12 percent larger overall , and its canine teeth or fangs 20 percent larger .
Such size discrepancies are not uncommon among whales and their kin ; in some species the females are larger , while in others the males are slightly to considerably bigger .
The size difference of male and female Maiacetus is only moderate , hinting that the males did n't control territories or command harems of females .
The whales ' big teeth , well - suited for catching and eating fish , suggest the animals made their livings in the sea , probably coming onto land only to rest , mate and give birth , said Gingerich , who is the Ermine Cowles Case Collegiate Professor of Paleontology and director of the U - M Museum of Paleontology .
Like other primitive archaeocetes , Maiacetus had four legs modified for foot - powered swimming , and although these whales could support their weight on their flipper - like limbs , they probably could n't travel far on land .
" They clearly were tied to the shore , " Gingerich said .
" They were living at the land - sea interface and going back and forth . "
Compared with previous fossil whale finds , Maiacetus occupies an intermediate position on the evolutionary path that whales traversed as they made the transition from full - time land dwellers to dedicated denizens of the deep .
As such , it offers invaluable , new information on structural and behavioral changes that accompanied that transition .
" Specimens this complete are virtual ' Rosetta stones ' , " Gingerich said , " providing insight into functional capabilities and life history of extinct animals that cannot be gained any other way . "
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli warplanes struck a number of sites in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday , causing some damage but no casualties , Palestinian residents and Hamas security officials said .
Residents said one air strike targeted tunnels which run under the Egyptian border at the town of Rafah that militants use to smuggle arms into the Hamas - run Gaza Strip .
Another hit an already bombed security compound in the town of Khan Younis .
An Israeli army spokesman said the warplanes had hit seven tunnels and one other target in Gaza .
The strikes followed the firing of a mortar round into Israel by Gaza militants on Tuesday .
Since Israel ’s 22 - day offensive in the Gaza Strip that ended last month in a cease - fire , Israeli leaders have said they would respond very harshly to any firing of rockets or mortar bombs into the Jewish state .
Officials from the Islamist Hamas group and Israel are trying to cement an Egyptian - brokered deal for an extended cease - fire , the opening of Gaza ’s border crossings and a prisoner swap between the two sides .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is due to convene his security cabinet later on Wednesday to discuss the outline of such a deal and possibly vote on it .
A college principal , who may be a danger to others after receiving intensive radiation treatment , is believed to be on the run in Ireland after failing to appear in Britain on child pornography charges .
A court in London was told that Thomas Leopold ( 42 ) could harm anyone he comes into contact with because he was given large doses of radiation for a thyroid condition and his levels of radioactivity could be dangerous to others .
The lecturer jumped bail to board an overnight ferry to Ireland under the noses of British police earlier this month .
" This is not a joke , " Judge John Price said as he issued an arrest warrant .
" Please warn officers that when he is arrested , he might be radioactive . "
Mr Leopold is thought to have been given radioactive liquid iodine to treat his ailment .
The radiation eventually fades but patients can still pass it on through urine , saliva and sweat .
Mr Leopold , who is head of a tutorial college in Harrow , Middlesex , is accused of downloading indecent images of children in 2006 .
His trial had been listed for hearing on February 9 but only four days earlier he was questioned by a Special Branch officer as he attempted to board a ferry in Fishguard in Wales .
" He told the officer his bail condition had been varied , enabling him to make the journey to visit his mother , " prosecuting attorney Nick Mather told Southwark Crown Court .
Mr Leopold was then waved on to the ferry bound for Rosslare and has not been seen since .
It is understood that when he showed his radiation card , he was permitted to stay in his own car as the ferry travelled across the Irish sea .
" He is in chronic poor health , " defending attorney Jeannie Mackie told the court .
" His doctor confirmed that he is dangerous , in terms of radioactivity , for a period of six weeks after treatment and he had treatment on February 3 .
Mr Leopold , from Hammersmith in west London , denies five counts of making indecent images of children and one of possessing 87 such images on or before April 2006 .
When he failed to turn up at a previous hearing , he told authorities he was in Ireland looking after his sick mother .

I 've just started playing with Linux again for the upteenth time , and I think this time it might stick .
One of my favourite things is the powerful bash shell and the ease with which you can manipulate data using it .
It 's really easy to make scripts to manipulate data using pipes and whatnot , here are a few of mine :
pyline
Take a statement as a parameter ( enclosed in quotes ) , and execute it for each line on STDIN .
Can use this for basic text manipulation .
Could be extended to create additional context for processing .
I know there we have awk and sed for this kind of thing but eh , I know python
#!/usr /bin/python import sys i = 0 for line in sys.stdin : line = line [ : - 1 ] exec sys.argv [ 1 ]
i += 1
eg print every third line :
cat txtfile | pyline " if i%3 : print line "
try
Try a command until it executes successfully .
Optionally takes the number of times to try until it is successful .
#!/bin/bash COUNT=-1 if [ [ $ 1 =~ ^ [ 0 - 9 ] +$ ] ] ; then COUNT =$ 1 shift fi STATUS=0 while [ " $ COUNT " - ne 0 ] ; do let COUNT - =1 $ * STATUS =$ ? if [ $ STATUS - eq 0 ] ; then exit $ STATUS fi done exit $ STATUS

MOSCOW -- Attempts to find justice for murdered Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya hit a brick wall Thursday when a Moscow jury acquitted all three defendants in the case .
The defendants , two Chechen brothers and a former police officer , were accused of being accomplices in the contract assassination .
Critics have been crying foul since the trial opened last November , since neither the actual killer nor the alleged mastermind who ordered Ms. Politkovskaya 's death have ever been caught or even named by authorities .
Politkovskaya , a sharp critic of the Kremlin and tireless chronicler of Russian human rights abuses in Chechnya , was gunned down in the entrance to her Moscow apartment building in October 2006 .
Lawyers representing Politkovskaya's relatives and her former employer , the crusading Moscow weekly Novaya Gazeta , said they were not deterred by the verdict and would seek a fresh investigation .
" We want to see the real killer in the dock , and we will succeed , " lawyer Karina Moskalenko told journalists .
The official investigation into Politkovskaya 's murder has been dogged by allegations of bias , foot - dragging , and outright incompetence on the part of the prosecutors , chronicled here in a Monitor story .
Key suspects thought to be involved in the planning of the murder , including a former officer of the FSB security service , Lt. Col .
Pavel Ryaguzov , were released without explanation .
Critics complained that authorities had already made up their minds that the assassination was carried out by anti-Kremlin exiles abroad , and were not following up any other leads .
But pro-Kremlin commentators slammed back , arguing that anti-Russian prejudice was behind the widespread insistence in the West that then - Russian President Vladimir Putin should be held accountable .
Many critics saw Politkovskaya 's murder as possibly linked with the suspicious deaths of several other Kremlin foes , including the bizarre polonium poisoning of ex-FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in November 2006 .
( For details of that case , click here . )
Human rights organizations have been quick to blame Russian authorities for Thursday 's verdict , which they say only highlights the ongoing threat to dissenting journalists in Russia , where 20 have been killed in the past nine years .
" This verdict is the result of an incomplete investigation that was brought to trial prematurely , " the Paris - based Reporters Without Borders said in a statement .
" Until the trigger man and the masterminds are identified , it will be impossible to know who ordered this murder and why .
. ..
The case can not be regarded as over . "
Do You Switch “ Frugal Mode ” On When You Come Back from Vacation ?
Have you ever came back from vacation and felt a different side of you take over ?
How about when you go on vacation ?
I believe it ’s quite normal for us to feel and act a little different during days where we are away from home , but how dramatic are the differences ?
Yesterday , I came back from my trip to see my parents and I was n’t even home yet when all of a sudden a rush of money saving thoughts hit me .
Should I grab a bunch of biscuits on the plane so I do n’t need to get dinner at the food court ?
What about the taxi ride home ?
I could theoretically walk home and drive the car back to pickup Emma and all the luggage .
It might take me about 30 minutes to get home and another 5 to drive back , but it will save me $ 12 on the taxi ride .
We are tired and it ’s 11 o’clock at night ( more like 2 am if you factor in timezone differences ) but hey , $ 12 saved is $ 24 earned .
Luckily , I came to my senses and we got a cab in the end ( a decision that I ’m sure my wife applauded with hint of relief ) .
I ’m not even sure why ( or for that matter , how ) those thoughts got into my head .
If I was still in Canada , there was no way I could even think of something like this .
Do I have a “ vacation mode ” where I shut off part of my frugal senses ?
Or do I have a “ frugal mode ” where I can completely turn things off ?
I ’m sure most people ’s spending habits change when they are on vacation , especially when it ’s coupled with the happiness that typically surround the end of the year ( less stress at work , more gatherings ) .
So perhaps when discussing something like this , it ’s not the answers , but the questions themselves .
For those of us who are out and about , have a great trip .
For the rest of us , Good Morning and cheers for another ( going - to - be ) great day .

GARDAI are hunting two men who " used a pony as a getaway car " after failing to hotwire a tractor .
Farmer Joe McGlinchey arrived to check on his small holding at Mill Brae , Stranorlar , Co Donegal , on Monday morning and noticed the gate of the field was lying open .
He discovered one of his eight Connemara ponies was missing and that an unsuccessful attempt had been made to hotwire his Ford tractor .
When the culprits failed to take the tractor they stole ' Snowy ' , a white Connemara Gelding , from the stables .
" They vandalised the whole place and wrecked the tractor when they pulled the ignition out .
A local man spotted two men heading up the road on Snowy at about 6 am , " he said .
" I know we are in the middle of a recession , but things must be really bad when someone uses a pony as a getaway car . "
Discovered
The four - year - old pony was discovered in a rural area about two miles away at 2 pm that afternoon .
He was down a laneway off a back road that leads to the border with Tyrone .
Mr McGlinchey keeps a brood of hens beside the stables and they produce free - range eggs which he packs and sells under the ' Country Farm Eggs ' brand .
He said he initially feared that professional horse thieves had struck , as € 10,000 worth of horse riding equipment was stolen from the same stable in November .
" I thought at first that these people knew what they were doing .
I did n't realise it was a getaway car they wanted instead of a pony , " he said .
" There were eight ponies in the field , including a stallion which belonged to a man from Galway .
I had to send the stallion away as I feared we were dealing with horse thieves .
" We went through hell and back but , thankfully , we got Snowy back safe and well , " he added .
[ Audio ] George Kenney asks James Petras about the \’ Israel Lobby , \’ what \’s behind it , what makes it different than the tobacco lobby , the NRA , or the AARP .
Total runtime fifty six minutes .
In the UK press one frequently finds tough criticism of Israel .
See , for example , this recent essay by Mark Steel in the Independent , a thoroughly mainstream UK paper [ proving me wrong the paper pulled the article sometime in the last 24 hours , but you can still find it at Mark ’s site ] .
One cannot imagine a similar essay appearing in the New York Times , or the Washington Post , or the Los Angeles Times , or the Wall Street Journal , or USA Today , or indeed any other major American newspaper .
Why not ?
Perhaps more taboo than mentioning the ‘ Israel Lobby , ’ is asking what ’s behind it , what makes it different than the tobacco lobby , the NRA , or the AARP ?
To get at this vexing issue I turned to an extraordinarily distinguished leftist academic , Dr. James Petras .
Jim is one of the very , very few people that I know of who reasons sensibly about the problem of Zionist influence and who is n’t afraid to speak out .
And he ’s an amazing conversationalist .
It was kind of Jim to talk with me and I ’ll try to live up to his example .

How did we geeks become experts on ( macro ) economics ?
Posted by Louis Brandy on 09 February 2009
There are certain topics that are certain to incite the internet .
Emacs vs vi .
Programming language holy wars .
When it comes to programming geeks , though , I 've got one that will get them to break out the flamethrowers .
All you have to do is bring up topics like fiat currency , the gold standard , money creation , the Federal Reserve and inflation .
It 's like walking into a southern church and bringing up evolution .
( It 's not often I get to compare you guys to creationists . )
Let me let you , dear reader , in on a little secret : you do n't know jack about macroeconomics .
Seriously .
You do n't ....
No , you do n't .
Stop arguing with me .
There are three camps of people .
One of them already understands they do n't know much ( or enough ) about macroeconomics .
This is n't for you guys .
The other two are the people who have strong opinions on topics like the minimum wage 's effect on inflation .
99.9997 % of those who remain have absolutely no idea what they are talking about and who are absolutely certain they are well - read on the subject .
The last 0.0003 % actually do know what they are talking about but are impossible to discern from the rest .
Since their occurrence rate is so far below the noise threshold , it 's safe to assume they do n't really exist .
To those of you who think you are part of that fraction of a percent :
No you are n't !
I told you to stop arguing with me !
Ignorance and Competence
The more interesting aspect is absolute certainty that nerds talk about things like the Federal Reserve .
It 's not like other topics .
In , for example , discussions about finer points of the x86 architecture , you 'll find a bunch of nerds happily discussing what they know and happily learning from others .
But in a discussion of economics ?
Oh , no .
Every , single , person in the discussion is an expert .
Except , of course , they are n't .
None of them are .
I 've done a fair bit of reading on topics like the Federal Reserve and money creation , like any good amateur , and the only thing I know for certain is that it 's insanely complex .
Now , I know what you are thinking , you 've done the research .
You know what you are talking about .
You 've read Ayn Rand .
You 've watched dozens of YouTube videos !
Dozens !
The rest of those simpletons do n't know what they are talking about , but you do .
I 'm not not trying to be a dick here , but , well ... you do n't .
That 's just basic probability .
Still think you do ?
You know that the the more ignorant you are on a topic , the more sure you are of your own competence ?
Still confident ?
Did you know 80 % of people think they are above average drivers ?
Ugh .
Amateurs !
Why ?
The more interesting question is why ?
Why the false expertise ?
Why the air of authority ?
Why the certainty ?
The conversations tend to be extremely emotional and defensive .
This does n't happen in other fields .
Programmers love to talk about quantum physics , the speed of light , and black holes .
But you wo n't find geeks getting all authoritative on the finer points of the event horizon ?
Why ?
Because that shit is complicated , beyond their knowledge , and they know it .
This does n't happen with macroeconomics .
Do n't kid yourself .
It 's complicated , too .
And it 's beyond your knowledge .
So what 's the difference ?
Here 's my theory .
Macro-economics is :
Easy to grasp ( the basic principles , anyway )
Experiments are pretty much impossible ( making being disproven relatively rare )
The first makes you think you are an expert , and the second removes any fear you have of being wrong .
The theory of evolution , by the way , has very similar properties .
Physics , on the other hand , is terrifyingly complex .
It 's obvious to an amateur that they are an amateur .
And if you try talking out your wazoo , someone might come along who can literally disprove you .
This is why creationists have chosen evolution and geeks have chosen macroeconomics .
They are tricked into a false sense of expertise .
Unlike the evolutionists , though , economists do n't have a mini-community of people making youtube videos and evangelizing their points of view to the general public .
It 's hard to find solid argument from real experts debunking various crackpot internet theories ( mostly from youtube videos ) .
That 's probably because they do n't have a " real " threat from the crackpots like the scientists do .
The net effect , however , is that youtube is filled with trashy amateur pseudo - economics videos ( I take no responsibility for any brain melting that occurs ) that get spread around this huge internet sub-culture of people that range from the rational to the conspiratorial .
In Summary
Fiat currency is superior to the gold standard .
Bankers are not evil .
The Federal Reserve does a half decent job .
Money is not debt .
Debt is n't even bad -- the vast majority of it can be healthy .
If you disagree with me , you are wrong , and a nutjob .
note for those who skipped to the summary : this paragraph is an imitation of the exact behavior I 'm criticizing .
I do n't necessarily hold any of these opinions ( except the one about you being a nutjob ) .
‘s coming - of - age survival tale “ ” was a huge bestseller in 2000 and the film rights were snapped up almost immediately .
Eight years after its publication and six years after it was optioned by the specialty film division of Twentieth Century Fox , “ Life of Pi ” has a new prospective director : , the Chinese - born auteur who won an Oscar for his direction of “ . ”
Previous directors attached to the project includeand
The story revolves around a youth who is the lone survivor of a sunken freighter and winds up sharing a lifeboat with a hyena , an injured zebra , an orangutan and a hungry Bengal tiger .
The novel was published in 2001 and won the prestigiousthe following year .
Ang Lee is currently finishing his “ ” film , which was based on ‘s book .
The film is expected to arrive in theaters in August from Focus Features .
He will reportedly supervise a new script after the studio hires a writer .
The UK - based Sunday Times has a potential bombshell on their site ; they claim Dr. Andrew Wakefield , who started the whole " vaccines cause autism " garbage , faked his data to make that claim .
About 10 years ago , Wakefield published a study dealing with children who were autistic , developing symptoms shortly after getting their shots , and linked this with irritated intestinal tracts .
This study came under a lot of fire , and eventually most of the authors retracted the conclusion that autism was associated with " environmental factors " , that is , vaccinations .
By then , though , it was too late , and the modern antivaccination movement was born .
The Sunday Times investigated Wakefield 's original research , and alleges that the symptoms Wakefield reports in his research do not match hospital records of the 12 children studied at the time .
In only one case were there symptoms that arose after the injection ; in many of the other cases symptoms started before the children had been vaccinated ( in fact , there have been allegations for some time that neurological issues occurred in the children before they had actually been vaccinated , casting doubt on Wakefield 's work ) .
Also , hospital pathologists reported that the bowels of many of the children were normal , but Wakefield reported them as having inflammatory disease in his journal paper .
If these allegations are true , then it means that Wakefield out - and - out lied in his original work .
He has denied this , according to the Sunday Times , but wo n't make further comments .
This may cause a firestorm in the antivax community , but there are two things I will guarantee : the first is that in the end antivaxxers will stick to their beliefs that vaccines cause health problems like autism , because this is not and never has been , for them , about the facts and evidence .
It 's a belief system , and like most other belief systems , it is impenetrable to evidence .
If you have any doubts , I suggest you read the comments to the post I made the other day about measles being on the rise in the UK .
One commenter on that post is saying all manners of outrageous things , and ignores the evidence that I ( and a pediatrician ) have left in the comments to him .
Second , and somewhat related , this hardly matters .
Many , many independent tests have shown that vaccines are unrelated to the onset of autism .
There is vast evidence that vaccines are very safe , and what small risk they pose is massively outweighed by the good they do .
Whether Wakefield faked his results or not , he 's still wrong .
The good news is that if this pans out , then perhaps there will be a net loss of people from the antivax side of the argument .
The ones who are true believers wo n't waver in their faith , of course , but anyone with doubts may finally see reality for the way it is .
I will be very interested indeed on following this story .
If anyone finds more information , please send it along .

A transient who was washing car windows outside a gas station in
Salinas died after on Friday being knocked down by a man buying gas ,
according to police .
Santa Clara resident Orion Moore , 29 , and a female companion
stopped at the Pilot Truck Stop , located at 951 Work St. , to buy gas .
When Moore exited the car , a transient , who was about 60 years
old , said he wanted to wash Moore 's windshield for money .
Moore declined the
offer , according to police .
The transient loitered around the car and a while later began
washing the window .
The female passenger exited the car to tell the transient
to leave .
Moore allegedly ran out of the Pilot and knocked the transient to
the ground .
The man struck his head on the pavement and was transported to a
nearby hospital , where he died , according to police .
Officers arrested Moore at the gas station .
Back when I used Planner for Emacs , I coded some shortcuts to make it easier to write about the people I met and the conversations I had .
I used the hippie - expand module to complete names from my Big Brother Database addressbook , and I wrote a function that converted those names into links to people ’s blogs or websites whenever I published my blog posts as HTML .
I switched to WordPress for my blog because I got tired of trying to figure out a way to enable comments without getting mired in spam - fighting .
That meant I could explore other Emacs personal information managers like Org , which I turned into my main task manager .
I often used the WordPress interface to write blog posts .
I sometimes used Windows Live Writer to write posts about books ( there ’s a good book review plugin that makes this easy ) .
I also sometimes used Emacs and Org to draft blog posts using Org ’s friendlier markup , exporting snippets to HTML that I then pasted into my blog posts .
Reading the posts on Planet Emacsen reminded me that my customized configuration was pretty darn sweet .
That and the conversation notes I ’ve been blogging lately encouraged me to dust off my configuration files and get them to work under Org .
So here ’s the code :
( defun sacha / org - bbdb - get ( path ) " Return BBDB record for PATH . " ( car ( bbdb - search ( bbdb - records ) path path path ) ) ) ( defun sacha / org - bbdb - export ( path desc format ) " Create the export version of a BBDB link specified by PATH or DESC .
If exporting to HTML , it will be linked to the person 's blog , www , or web address .
If exporting to LaTeX FORMAT the link will be italicised .
In all other cases , it is left unchanged . " ( cond ( ( eq format ' html ) ( let* ( ( record ( sacha / org - bbdb - get path ) ) url ) ( setq url ( and record ( or ( bbdb - record - getprop record ' blog ) ( bbdb - record - getprop record ' www ) ( bbdb - record - getprop record ' web ) ) ) ) ( if url ( format " < a href= \ " %s\ " > %s </a > " url ( or desc path ) ) ( format " < em > %s < / em > " ( or desc path ) ) ) ) ) ( ( eq format ' latex ) ( format " \\textit{ %s} " ( or desc path ) ) ) (t ( or desc path ) ) ) ) ( defadvice org - bbdb - export ( around sacha activate ) " Override org - bbdb - export . " ( setq ad - return - value ( sacha / org - bbdb - export path desc format ) ) ) ;;;_+
Hippie expansion for BBDB ; map M-/ to hippie - expand for most fun ( add - to - list ' hippie-expand-try- functions - list ' sacha/try-expand-bbdb-annotation ) ( defun sacha / try - expand - bbdb-annotation ( old ) " Expand from BBDB .
If OLD is non-nil , cycle through other possibilities . " ( unless old ;;
First time , so search through BBDB records for the name ( he - init - string ( he - dabbrev-beg ) ( point ) ) ( when (> ( length he - search - string ) 0 ) ( setq he - expand - list nil ) ( mapcar ( lambda ( item ) ( let ( ( name ( bbdb - record - name item ) ) ) ( when name ( setq he - expand - list ( cons ( org - make - link - string ( org - make - link " bbdb : " name ) name ) he - expand - list ) ) ) ) ) ( bbdb - search ( bbdb - records ) he - search - string he - search - string he - search - string nil nil ) ) ) ) ( while ( and he - expand - list ( or ( not ( car he - expand - list ) ) ( he - string - member ( car he - expand - list ) he - tried - table t ) ) ) ( setq he - expand - list ( cdr he - expand - list ) ) ) ( if ( null he - expand - list ) ( progn ( if old ( he - reset - string ) ) nil ) ( progn ( he - substitute - string ( car he - expand - list ) t) ( setq he - expand - list ( cdr he - expand - list ) ) t ) ) )
If you ’ve got Org and BBDB , drop this into your ~/.emacs and fiddle with it . =)

Barack Obama ’s website , Change.gov , opened a public forum in which 10,000 people asked questions about the future of America .
The top question was not about the environment .
It was not about the budget or the bailout .
It was not even about the war in Iraq or terrorism .
It was this :
“ Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it , tax it , put age limits on it , and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S. ? ”
Apparently , a lot of Americans are fed up with the disastrous and ineffective Drug War .
Have we learned nothing from the failure that was alcohol Prohibition in the 1920s ?
Whether or not you believe in recreational marijuana use , a bit of digging around will lead you to studies proving cannabis ’ effectiveness as a safe and natural medicine , an excellent superfood in the form of hempseed and a viable fiber for clothing , paper , biofuel and more .
As an ecologically - aware , socially - conscious American , I firmly support changing our nation ’s view of marijuana from that of a “ menacing drug ” to that of a highly useful plant .
Growing and processing legal cannabis for medicine and hemp would stimulate our economy , put struggling farmers back to work , and requires virtually no chemical pesticides or fertilizers .
Such a bold move would provide thousands of jobs right here in the country – no outsourcing necessary .
Here ’s some cannabis trivia : the suffix “ sativa , ” of marijuana ’s scientific name Cannabis sativa , comes from the Latin root meaning “ cultivated , ” shared by so many other common plants such as oats ( Avena sativa ) , garlic ( Allium sativa ) and alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ) .
Ca n’t be all that bad , now can it ?
Although naysayers may come up with many arguments against legalizing cannabis , many of those arguments fall flat when further analyzed .
Myth :
Wo n’t people just be able to go to hemp fields and gather plants for getting high ?
The fact is , hemp is so low in THC that you ’d have to smoke a ridiculously , nauseatingly large amount of it to get high .
No one would even bother .
Trust me .
Myth : Farming hemp for fiber could turn into a coverup for growing potent marijuana .
Anyone trying to hide their potent strains of marijuana amidst the fields of hemp would be wasting their time : the plants cross-pollinate and always result in weaker strains .
Any experienced marijuana grower would keep their plants far , far away from a hemp field .
Myth : Legalizing marijuana would create a druggie free - for - all .
Not so .
The Netherlands legalized marijuana for recreational purposes in the 1970s and statistically they have less marijuana use and abuse than the United States .
Marijuana is sold in coffee shops and the “ thrill ” of doing something illegal has been taken out of it .
Also , cannabis smokers never have to do business with a “ drug dealer , ” which means they ’re not exposed to other , potentially harder drugs .
Myth :
There ’s no market for hemp products in the United States .
The biggest thing keeping hemp on the fringes is the price .
Because hemp has to be imported into the U.S. from other countries , prices stay high .
But if hemp were grown Stateside , prices would be competitive and hemp - based food , clothing and paper could enter the mainstream market and its superior quality would simply prove itself .
And all those new hemp farms and hemp - related businesses would need managers and employees , thus creating a great many jobs literally overnight .
Myth :
It ’s unacceptable to use marijuana as a medicine because it makes the patient high .
Many legal and acceptable medicines make patients high .
Have you ever been prescribed Vicodin by your dentist ?
Or Codeine for severe pain ?
The nice thing about marijuana is that it is not addictive and much easier on the body and the liver .
Besides , much of medical marijuana advocacy has focused on providing cannabis to AIDS and cancer patients , to aid them with severe nausea .
Considering the severity of their disease and the harsh treatments most of these patients go through , inhaling some smoke and “ feeling high ” is a small price to pay for relief .
Myth : Legalizing marijuana would increase crime .
The biggest crime committed by most marijuana smokers is simply buying and using the plant itself .
Marijuana does not make people violent or cause them to lose control of their senses , leading them into unconscious criminal rampage .
Nope .
Take away the criminality of growing or possessing marijuana and a large number of “ criminals ” would simply be the normal , productive citizens they already are .
According to a PBS interview with Eric Schlosser , 1 in 6 Americans in prison are there on marijuana - related charges ( including simple possession ) , wasting taxpayer money and taking up prison space .
Myth : Marijuana prohibition keeps it out of the hands of our youth .
Wrong again .
Despite the War On Drugs , marijuana has remained easily available to high schoolers for decades , usually because it is sold to them by their own fellow students .
If marijuana were legalized , it would be regulated in much the same way as alcohol , sold only in certain types of shops and require an age limit to purchase .
This would certainly make it more difficult for young people to acquire .
Any other questions or concerns ?
Feel free to start a discussion !
We ’d love to hear what you have to say .

Internet Safety Technical Task Force Report i’m baaaaaack ! » Taken
Out of Context — my PhD dissertation Without further ado … my PhD dissertation : Taken Out of Context : American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics Abstract :
As social network sites like MySpace and Facebook emerged , American teenagers began adopting them as spaces to mark identity and socialize with peers .
Teens leveraged these sites for a wide array of everyday social practices – gossiping , flirting , joking around , sharing information , and simply hanging out .
While social network sites were predominantly used by teens as a peer - based social outlet , the unchartered nature of these sites generated fear among adults .
This dissertation documents my 2.5 - year ethnographic study of American teens ’ engagement with social network sites and the ways in which their participation supported and complicated three practices – self - presentation , peer sociality , and negotiating adult society .
My analysis centers on how social network sites can be understood as networked publics which are simultaneously ( 1 ) the space constructed through networked technologies and ( 2 ) the imagined community that emerges as a result of the intersection of people , technology , and practice .
Networked publics support many of the same practices as unmediated publics , but their structural differences often inflect practices in unique ways .
Four properties – persistence , searchability , replicability , and scalability – and three dynamics – invisible audiences , collapsed contexts , and the blurring of public and private – are examined and woven throughout the discussion .
While teenagers primarily leverage social network sites to engage in common practices , the properties of these sites configured their practices and teens were forced to contend with the resultant dynamics .
Often , in doing so , they reworked the technology for their purposes .
As teenagers learned to navigate social network sites , they developed potent strategies for managing the complexities of and social awkwardness incurred by these sites .
Their strategies reveal how new forms of social media are incorporated into everyday life , complicating some practices and reinforcing others .
New technologies reshape public life , but teens ’ engagement also reconfigures the technology itself .
Knowing that I would share my dissertation publicly , I desperately wanted to create a perfect dissertation .
Anyone who has been through this process knows how impossible that is .
Everyone kept trying to reassure me by promising that no one ever reads a dissertation .
( Often this was followed with a snarky remark of “ not even your committee . ” )
Unfortunately , those folks have n’t met the blogosphere .
( Or my committee . )
There was a huge part of me that wanted to hole up and not share this document with you , for fear of your criticism .
This is not a perfect document .
Not even close .
There are holes in my argument structure , problems with my description , and loads of places where I can’t help but smack my forehead at my simplicity and lack of depth .
With all of its imperfections , there is one very important thing about this document : it is done .
And by the end of the process , I accepted the age - old PhD mantra : the only good dissertation is a done dissertation .
I do n’t expect you to read this , but I know that for some sick and twisted reason , many of you have an urge to do so .
That makes you very weird .
Still , I have a favor to ask … if you ’re going to take the time to read this beast – or even a single chapter of it – could you share your thoughts ?
I really want to push this further and deeper .
Parts of it will turn into journal articles .
Other parts will emerge in a book .
The more feedback I get now , the better I can make those future document .
So , pretty please , with a cherry on top , could you share your reflections , critiques , concerns ?
I promise I wo n’t be mad .
In fact , the opposite .
I would be most delighted !

Upstate New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter is at the forefront of a controversial sex ed movement .
She wants trollops like you to have medically accurate information about sex , contraception and disease .
Bitch .
No , for real , Slaughter 's Prevention First
Act which may actually see the President 's desk this year is utterly shocking for what it proposes in this area :
(a) In General - The Secretary of Health and Human Services may make grants to eligible States to conduct sex education programs , including programs that provide education on both abstinence and contraception for the prevention of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS .
( b) Requirements for Sex Education Programs -
For purposes of this title , a sex education program is a program that —
(1 ) is age - appropriate and medically accurate ;
( 2 ) stresses the value of abstinence while not ignoring those young people who have had or are having sexual intercourse ;
( 3 ) provides information about the health benefits and side effects of all contraceptive and barrier methods used —
( A ) as a means to prevent pregnancy ; and
( B ) to reduce the risk of contracting sexually transmitted disease , including HIV / AIDS ;
( 4 ) encourages family communication between parent and child about sexuality ;
( 5 ) teaches young people the skills to make responsible decisions about sexuality , including how to avoid unwanted verbal , physical , and sexual advances and how to avoid making verbal , physical , and sexual advances that are not wanted by the other party ;
( 6 ) teaches young people how alcohol and drug use can affect responsible decision making ; and
( 7 ) does not teach or promote religion ;
( c) Additional Activities -
In carrying out a program of sex education , a State may expend a grant under subsection ( a ) to carry out educational and motivational activities that help young people —
( 1 ) gain knowledge about the physical , emotional , biological , and hormonal changes of adolescence and subsequent stages of human maturation ;
( 2 ) develop the knowledge and skills necessary to ensure and protect their sexual and reproductive health from unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease , including HIV / AIDS throughout their lifespan ;
( 3 ) gain knowledge about the specific involvement and responsibility of males in sexual decision making ;
( 4 ) develop healthy attitudes and values about adolescent growth and development , body image , racial and ethnic diversity , and other related subjects ;
( 5 ) develop and practice healthy life skills , including goal - setting , decision making , negotiation , communication , and stress management ;
( 6 ) develop healthy relationships , including skills to prevent dating and sexual violence ;
( 7 ) promote self - esteem and positive interpersonal skills focusing on relationship dynamics , including friendships , dating , romantic involvement , marriage and family interactions ; and
( 8 ) prepare for the adult world by focusing on educational and career success , including developing skills for employment , job seeking , independent living , financial self - sufficiency , and workplace productivity .
CouchFoo : Like ActiveRecord , but for CouchDB
By Peter Cooper
Apache CouchDB is a " distributed , fault - tolerant and schema - free document - oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP / JSON API " that has received quite a bit of publicity in developer circles in the past year .
It 's written in Erlang , so has all of the scalability and flexibility the Erlang environment brings to the table , but as a RESTful service , you can use it from pretty much anywhere .
George Palmer , a UK - based Rails developer , wanted to use CouchDB but found the existing libraries ( such as RelaxDB , CouchREST , ActiveCouch and CouchPotato ) lacking - not that they are , as such , but they did n't fit George 's needs .
George wanted something that was as ActiveRecord - like as possible , so he developed CouchFoo ( a.k.a. couch_foo ) - an ActiveRecord - style interface to CouchDB .
Basic operations ( creating records , finding , and even dynamic finders ) are much the same as with ActiveRecord , but there have been some additions to deal with the differences in CouchDB ( such as defining properties to get typing or view definitions ) .
Associations ( has_many , etc ) also work as expected .
This is a clever bit of work on George 's part and I know that based on the strong feedback he's had , he 's decided to submit a RailsConf proposal on CouchFoo .
After taking a look at it , I can only hope his talk gets accepted as I 'd love to hear more from someone in the know .
As an aside , back in September 2008 , PeepCode released a CouchDB with Rails screencast .
This chapter is the final integration of all the prior chapters and attempts to provide clarity around the question of , “ What should I do ? ”
Let me rephrase that .
What should WE do ?
Because the changes that are potentially coming are not solvable alone .
Chapter 20 is not going to be a simple list of things to do .
Instead , it will reflect my goal of each person assuming responsibility for their own actions .
Chapter 20 is going to provide a framework for action .
This is a way of structuring all the myriad things you COULD do , into the prioritized list of things you WILL do .
Consider it your personal risk - mitigation plan .
I ’m already drawing up plans for a new follow - on series of videos that will lay out my proposed solutions for the nation and globe in more detail .
Okay , so you ’ve seen the entire Crash Course , showing how the Economy , Energy , and the Environment are interlinked .
Specifically , you ’ve seen that there is a substantial mismatch between an economic model that must grow and a physical world of peaking oil and depleting resources .
We cannot possibly solve any one of these main issues in isolation , because doing so will simply create new problems in one of the other “ E ” s .
Truly non -status - quo solutions are called for .
Which means there is a very real chance that our collective path will not be a linear extrapolation of the present .
Our individual challenge is to accept the possibility that the future may be quite a departure from the present .
I believe that the future is not some purely random roll of the dice , and that we can minimize future disruptions in our lives by taking actions today .
In one way I am glad to have waited to produce this final chapter , because we have had the great financial panic of the Fall of 2008 , and we can more precisely map where this is all headed .
The multi-trillion - dollar bailout packages offered to banks by various governments across the globe are nearly 100 % dedicated towards preserving the status quo .
But at the same time , none of these challenges or trends are going to be helped in the slightest by bailing out the banking system , and some will be made worse .
The fact that our national leaders have chosen to go several trillion dollars further into debt in a desperate bid to preserve " what was " simply indicates that it is now even more probable that the burden of meeting these challenges has shifted a bit further towards private citizens and small communities .
Part of the complication with developing a “ what should we do ” chapter is that I have no idea where your beliefs lie .
Everybody exists somewhere along this spectrum of belief , ranging from expecting a rather ordinary , if not slight , interruption in economic growth , all the way on up to a big breakdown .
Everybody exists along here somewhere .
And depending on where you happen to sit , both the number of things you could do , and their urgency , increase dramatically .
Given this , where do we start ?
How do we get started , when there are so many variables and things that need doing ?
This is why we need a framework for action .
There are four sequential steps to this framework .
First , you have to decide that you are going to take action .
Without this commitment , there ’s not much point in continuing .
Second , you need to take stock of where you are , and here I propose a self - assessment that will unearth your strengths , weakness , opportunities , and threats .
Third , you ’ve got to sort among the infinite list of things you could do , and then fourth , you ’ve got to prioritize this list , because you ca n’t do everything .
Together , these create the framework for action .
So let ’s begin with Step 1 – the case for action .
First , let ’s add some detail to the spectrum I laid out before .
Here we might assess the potential for disruption as beginning with “ status quo , ” meaning that all the key risks dissipate relatively rapidly .
Next on the spectrum would be a prolonged recession and all that that entails .
Next we might place a collapse of the financial system on here , and finally we might envisage a collapse of government services at all levels
I am pretty certain that our future lies somewhere along this spectrum ; the problem is , I do n’t know where .
The key here is that I cannot entirely rule out any particular outcome .
I ca n’t place a probability of zero next to any of these , so I need to weigh them all .
So let ’s play a little thought game with one of them and see how it might lead to making a case for action .
Let ’s use # 3 – Financial System Collapse .
Without worrying about how likely or probable a financial crisis might be , let ’s simply say it is either true or it is false .
That is , it either happens or it does n’t .
Hopefully we can all agree that “ true or false ” pretty much covers the total range of possible outcomes .
And down on this axis , we ’ll say that you either prepared for this crisis in advance or you did not .
Again , it is either true or false that you chose to take steps to mitigate the impact of a financial crisis .
So what happens if it ’s both true that the crisis happened and that you did prepare as best you could ?
Congratulations – give yourself a smiley face ; you did the best you could .
And what about the case where the crisis did not happen and you did not prepare ?
Again , congratulations – you did the best you could .
It turns out that these are essentially equivalent outcomes , and we can therefore remove them from our decision framework .
In each case , we got the best outcome we could , so there ’s not much to be gained from weighing and comparing them .
But what about this case , where the crisis did not happen but you did prepare ?
How bad could that be ?
What ’s the worst that you could put in this box ?
Well , you probably wasted some money ( maybe the opportunity to participate in capital gains in the stock market ) and some wasted time , but perhaps worst of all , you ended up feeling foolish .
That ’s awful .
Now let ’s compare this box to this other box , where the financial crisis happened but you did not prepare .
What can we put in this box ?
Here it ’s possible that you suffered a massive loss of wealth , had to make sudden , massive adjustments under the pressure of little time and scarce resources , and live with a sense of recrimination for having been “ right ” in your concerns but unprepared nonetheless .
You can probably put a bunch more things in each of these boxes , and you should .
But for our purposes , we ’re done .
Now all we have to do is compare these two boxes .
That ’s it .
In the scheme of things , which is worse ?
Where would you rather be ?
We are all built differently , but I am the sort that could never forgive myself for being right but unprepared .
I can more easily forgive myself for being wrong and prepared .
But that ’s just me .
Only you know which of these two boxes carries more weight for you .
But if you picked the upper right box , then I need to ask , “ What ’s preventing you from taking action ? ”
Here ’s a slight refinement of this thinking that allows for more subtlety than “ true or false . ”
Suppose that we revisit our spectrum for a financial crisis that spans from “ it ’s not too bad ” all the way to “ everything breaks down and stops working for awhile . ”
Let ’s assume that everyone has a different assessment of how likely any particular outcome is .
We might find that one person assesses the chance as very low that anything too bad will happen , while another person holds a nearly opposite view .
In one important respect , they hold the same view ; they both hold the possibility of a bad outcome as being greater than zero .
When an outcome has a potentially huge impact , a prudent adult may decide to react to that risk , even though it is not very probable .
As long as some risk exists in your mind , and as long as the potential costs of not taking action are outweighed by the costs of taking action , then it makes sense to take action .
That ’s the case for action .
Okay , assuming you ’ve decided that taking action makes sense , the hard part is where ?
We ’ve been talking about some very big changes in the Crash Course , so where does one begin in this enormous universe of potential actions ?
Here ’s where I would recommend that you spend an hour and perform a self - assessment .
There is an outline for this that you can download in the ACT section of ChrisMartenson.com .
It consists of three main areas .
Your financial self - assessment should include your current & future needs , your current & future income , taking stock of all forms of wealth , and any issues concerning accessing your wealth that apply .
There are similar sorts of areas to cover that I am calling foundational that are equally as important , if not more , than the financial areas .
Lastly , there are all of your physical needs to consider .
A typical result of conducting a self - assessment is discovering that our lives are very much dependent on a lot of things we take for granted .
Once you ’ve got your self - assessment complete , you have a pretty good idea of where you are strong and where you are not .
The self - assessment , then , is your starting point – it represents your position in relation to the outside world .
Now we need to go to the outside world and rank all of the possible risks and challenges that exist , that we will then match against our self - assessment .
The three dimensions that we will use to begin bucketing the various events and risks are time ( that is , how near or urgent is the risk or event ) , impact ( is this a big deal or a little deal ? ) , and likelihood ( which is the same as the probability of the event ) .
To get a handle on time , consider grouping events on a timeline .
In the first Horizon , which I see as running from zero to two years out , I place the housing bust , a credit bubble burst , and the possibility of a systemic banking failure .
A bit further out , I foresee petroleum demand and supply crossing , issues with boomer retirement , and the possible emergence of very high inflation .
Even further out , I see really big , hairy challenges like national insolvency , perhaps the end of fiat money , and the emergence of a new economic model .
Since I ca n’t respond to all of these at once , I mainly focus on those that are within the immediate Horizon .
Again , you could place very different things in each of these Horizons , and those would be the ones you would use .
These happen to be mine .
For illustrative purposes , we ’ll run through an example based on the possibility of a systemic banking failure .
Next , I segment things by Impact and Likelihood .
If you understand insurance , you already understand this next process .
Think of fire insurance on a house .
We do n’t carry it because such an event is especially likely ( it is not ) , but because the impact is so catastrophic .
That is , a prudent person will combine impact and likelihood to come to the decision that purchasing fire insurance makes sense .
So here ’s a way to do that for the other areas in your life .
Suppose we construct a simple 2 ×2 chart , and on this axis we break the likelihood of the event into “ High ” and “ Low ” buckets , while on the other axis we split the impact into “ High ” and “ Low ” buckets .
So something that is both low impact and low likelihood is something that we should not ever spend any of our precious time or resources on .
Things that fall here are just not worth worrying about .
Anything that is high impact and high likelihood is a slam - dunk .
We always attend to these , and we do them first .
Things that are of high impact but low likelihood require more thought , but generally we would usually attend to most of the things in this box next .
After that , we ’d sometimes attend to things that are low impact but high likelihood , especially if they happen to have easy or quick remedies .
So this becomes the area where events fall that I attend to .
How you happen to fill this in will depend on your age , financial means , family situation , and a host of other factors
Because I consider there to be a 50 % chance of a systemic financial collapse over the next 2 years , I place this as a high impact / high probability event , meaning that this is a risk that deserved and got a lot of my attention .
So let ’s continue with the example .
With this two - by - two grid in our minds , we might flesh out the risks associated with financial system collapse using a table that looks like this .
First , we might assess the likelihood of widespread bank closures to be “ high , ” the impact to be “ high , ” and therefore the rank of this event as “ high . ”
Then we might come to the same conclusions about our own personal banks .
But we might assess the overall rank of a disruption in the food distribution network as “ medium , ” and dollar destruction as “ medium ” because it has both a high and a low which average out to medium .
We might assess cuts to government spending as “ low . ”
These are a few examples .
Other things can and should be added to the list .
The point here is to assess the likelihood and impact of each event that we think applies to the scenario we are studying .
When you ’ve completed this , we ’ll have a ranked list of events .
My recommendation is that when you do these exercises , that you do them with like - minded friends … they will think of things you will miss , it ’s more fun , and will go faster .
Now you ’ve got to generate a list .
You do this by filtering those events that are imminent , likely , and of high impact , through your self - assessment .
I guarantee when you do this , you will end up with an entirely too long list of things that you could possibly do .
It ’s time to prioritize .
First , the list can quickly be broken into things that you can or will do , and things that you ca n’t or wo n’t do .
One person might feel completely empowered to move their wealth around ; another might have their wealth locked in an irrevocable trust .
Of the things that you can or will do , we will break those into three tiers of action , such that Tier 1 is always started and completed before beginning Tier 2 , which will always precede Tier 3 .
This makes it much easier to get started , because the lists are much more manageable .
Of the things that you ca n’t or wo n’t do , your options include finding someone else who can do them ( and this is where community comes in ) , or letting them go and not worrying about them anymore .
Back to our example , let ’s suppose that after filtering your ranked events through your self - assessment you came up with a nice long list of actions that you ’d like to undertake .
Almost certainly , there are too many to do all at once , and it is time to use the three - tier system to identify and tackle the easiest , lowest cost , highest bang - for - the - buck stuff first .
So what is Tier 1 ?
It consists of the easiest , quickest , and cheapest items that require minimal outside assistance and no substantive changes to lifestyle .
In this example , then , we might decide that taking a bit of hard cash out of the bank would provide a reasonable buffer against the risk of being without purchasing power , should the banks and ATMs go “ on holiday ” for a while .
This is easy and very do - able .
Our major risk would be feeling a bit foolish later , after nothing happens and we go to redeposit that money in a bank .
We might also decide to spread our bets around , just in case the bank holiday was not universal and only applied to some banks .
Lastly , we might decide to hedge against the vast loss of purchasing power that the people of Argentina experienced while their banks were shuttered .
Gold represents one of the few ways to hold a money - like asset entirely outside of the banking system .
And we ’d do all of these things before even thinking about starting the Tier 2 list .
And so we proceed to Tier 2 , which consists of those Items that plug the biggest gaps in your self - assessment and require a significant investment of time , money , and energy .
For instance , implementing a saving program so that you can afford needed items , or thinking about ways to create a food buffer for your community , or getting involved with your neighbors and local scene to a greater extent .
After these items have been gone through , it is time to consider the Tier 3 items – the hard stuff .
These are the biggest changes or life decisions on your list , such as changing where you live , or acquiring new skills , or maybe changing your job .
The point is that you should resist the urge to spend any time or energy mulling these over until you ’ve made serious progress on the Tier 1 and Tier 2 actions .
If all of this seems like too much work , and you were hoping Chapter 20 would be a more directive and simplified “ here ’s what you do ” shopping list , I can only say that there are no easy answers for the magnitude of the challenges we face .
This chapter could easily be an entire course itself , and future videos on my site will explore these questions in greater detail .
What I have been consistently trying to prepare people for , the whole way along , is that the next twenty years are going to be unlike the last twenty years .
Specifically , I think we each need to be prepared for a financial catastrophe – not because we are 100 % sure it will happen , but because we ca n’t be 100 % sure it wo n’t happen .
Prudent adults identify and manage risks .
And I think we each need to be prepared for the possibility , the possibility , that a disruption in our basic support systems could happen .
The things that surface in this line of thinking are considered very “ out there ” in today ’s society , but barely 100 years ago our complete dependence on the just - in - time delivery of the basics of life would have been considered mad .
Lastly , I think the future is going to be about moving from an “ I ” to a “ we ” culture … back to a bygone era , where neighbors were n’t just nice to each other , but relied on each other .
As an informed person , it is now your responsibility to help others as best you can .
Perhaps this will be with their knowledge and consent ; perhaps you will have to be more indirect if they are not yet ready to confront the changes .
And so I close with a personal call to action .
Now that you ’ve completed the Crash Course , I hope you ’ll agree that the challenges we face are not being adequately addressed at the national or international levels .
I created the Crash Course specifically to reach people , one at a time , because I hold the belief that some of the risks we face are moving much , much faster than the political process .
I created the Crash Course so that you would understand what is going on and to do my very best to help you appreciate that the future could be quite different than the past .
I need your help spreading the word .
The Crash Course has been seen by hundreds of thousands of people all across the globe , without any advertising on my part .
This is because people like you have taken the time to pass it along to their friends , relatives , and coworkers .
But I want it to be seen by millions .
We need to create a tipping point of awareness around these issues .
And so I need your financial help , because I have dedicated four years , and much of my bank account , towards creating this body of work and then making it freely available to all .
If you have gotten something from this , if this has touched you or even changed your thinking in an important way , then I hope you ’ll consider “ paying it forward ” by making a financial contribution so that somebody else down the line gets to see it .
How much ?
I would suggest an amount that is neither a stretch for you nor embarrassing .
The Crash Course needs to be seen in the halls of power , I need to train others to deliver the message , I need to travel to take the show to venues both large and small , I need to support the development of multiple language translations , and I need to expand the content , shrink it , add new material , and keep the whole effort moving forward .
In whatever way you can contribute to that , even if that ’s sending the link along to one other person , I need your help .
I will do my part if you will do yours .
That is my promise to you .
Because after all , the future will be defined by what WE do .
Thank you for listening .
