For the first time since the advent of manned space exploration , the U.S. appears ready to outsource to private companies everything from transporting astronauts to ferrying cargo into orbit .
Proposals gaining momentum in Washington call for contractors to build and run competing systems under commercial contracts , according to federal officials , aerospace - industry officials and others familiar with the discussions .

Air pollution in China ’s industrial east appears to have significantly reduced light rainfall over the last 50 years , raising the possibility that cutting pollution could ease a severe drought in the region , according to a study released Saturday .
Light rain -- anything from a drizzle to 0.4 of an inch in a day -- is also crucial for agriculture , as opposed to heavy rain , which triggers floods that can wash away crops .
Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that the number of days of light rainfall in eastern China decreased by 23 % from 1956 to 2005 because of air pollution .
“ Besides the health effects , acid rain and other problems that pollution creates , this work suggests that reducing air pollution might help ease the drought in north China , ” lead researcher Yun Qian said .

China suffers from an uneven distribution of its water resources .
Weather patterns create an arid north and flood - prone south , costing the government tens of millions of dollars in lost productivity each year .
Parts of China ’s wheat - growing northern regions are currently suffering their worst drought in five decades .
The study could also help further the understanding of how aerosols -- tiny air particles caused naturally and by human activities such as burning fossil fuels -- affect the formation of rain clouds , researchers said .
The study was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research .

Images in popular culture have been blamed for contributing to the stereotype that Australia is a racist country , amid claims that racism motivated a spate of attacks on Indian students in Melbourne this year .
Monash University academic Waleed
Aly told ABC 1's Lateline that Australia is often seen overseas as an unrefined country .
" What occurs , I think , is this idea of a young country that 's a bit rough and irreverent , and in some aspects of course that 's true , " he said .
" But even if you look at the popular culture references that seem to define us abroad , they sort of capture that image of something that 's unrefined , it 's Crocodile Dundee or it 's Steve Irwin and so on . "
He also says overseas media outlets treat stories about Australia through the prism of race .
" We make news internationally when there 's some issue to do with race , whether it 's Hansonism , or it's the apology to the Indigenous or the Cronulla riots , " he said .
" The inherent racism of Australia is more or less assumed , and that becomes a difficult thing to erode , a very difficult perception to shift .
It 's kind of a stereotype that Australia as a nation suffers from , which I think is unfair . "
Tanveer Ahmed , a fellow at the Centre For Independent Studies and columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald , told Lateline there is no evidence to suggest institutional racism exists in Australia .
He said migrants are often attacked by other migrant groups rather than locals .
" I think that we have been very successful in integrating migrants , and in my experience of racial issues its often been more common within immigrants , " he said .
" The Indian student example probably is testament to that , if you look in Sydney , where some of the attacks against Indian students were often by Lebanese immigrants here . "
' Low - level ' racism
Dr Aly says he experienced some racism while growing up in Australia , but it was of a low level .
" I was n't getting bashed up daily because I looked different , " he said .
" What we tend to have in Australia is kind of a fairly high level of low level racism ... so little day to day things , socially discriminatory practices , things like that that kind of operate almost below the surface , and lead to certain inequalities , but they 're not major .
" When we have an event like Cronulla it shocks us , because it's in a way uncharacteristic of daily life in Australia , which is different I think to a lot of other countries where racial tensions are institutionalised . "
Dr Ahmed also criticised the Indian media for being quick to seize on claims of Australian racism .
" After they lost the fifth Test at the SCG there were huge cries of racism relating to the umpiring decision , " he said .
" I think it 's often a defensive move as well within India , and that I think goes for many other ethnic groups as well , where rather than examine the more complex causes of an event , they can be quick to cry racism . "
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Fox has declined to air a “ Family Guy ” episode featuring a graphic depiction of an abortion , but it will come out on DVD .

The episode , set to run next season , features matriarch Lois Griffin acting as a surrogate mother for an infertile couple .
The couple is then killed in a car crash , leaving Lois with a tough decision .
The episode ( titled “ Partial Terms of Endearment ” ) is “ very graphic , very morbid , ” sources say , particularly about the abortion process .
It was originally supposed to conclude on a vague note , with Lois ’ verdict left unclear .
But creator Seth MacFarlane added a coda , with Lois ’ husband Peter poking his head into the frame to tell viewers , “ She had the abortion . ”
Fox entertainment president Kevin Reilly told TV critics on Thursday that the decision not to air the episode was driven by potential advertiser concerns .
“ We do n’t censor Seth , ” Reilly said .
“ It was a business decision .
It was fragile subject matter at a sensitive time . ”
Asked what specifically was problematic about the episode , Reilly said there were a couple scenes that Fox suggested doing one way and MacFarlane opted for another .
“ At that moment in time , there was a tough conversation going on with clients , and we did n’t need the headache , ” he said .
MacFarlane said Reilly ’s decision was fine with him .
“ I ’m in a position with Fox where I ’m having sort of a golden age , ” he said , “ I trust ( Reilly ’s ) decision implicitly . ”
The episode will appear on the DVD for the show ’s eighth season , which will likely reach stores next summer or fall .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A federal judge refused Monday to sign off on Bank of America 's $ 33 million settlement of a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit , saying neither side convinced him that the settlement was fair to the public .
U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff gave both Bank of America and the SEC until Aug. 24 to make their arguments that the settlement should be approved or change the terms of the deal .
" I would be less than candid if I did n't express my continued misgivings about this settlement , " Rakoff said .
" No court can make a ruling without the facts , without the truth .
I need to know more before I can approve the settlement . "
Rakoff said he will rule on the matter by Sept. 9 .
The SEC reached the agreement last week after it filed charges against the bank for allegedly misleading investors about billions of dollars in bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch employees .
Regulators claimed that BofA had said in its proxy statement that it would not pay out bonuses to Merrill employees in fiscal year 2008 , when , in fact , the bank authorized bonus payments of as much as $ 5.8 billion .
Of that allowance , $ 3.6 billion was paid out in 2008 to more than 39,000 Merrill employees , averaging $ 91,000 per bonus .
Rakoff said he understood BofA 's actions to mean the company " effectively lied to their shareholders . "
As a result , the judge said it did not appear that the settlement 's " punishment " fit the crime .
" Is there not something strangely askew in a fine of $ 33 million ? , " Rakoff asked an attorney representing the SEC .
" This is a tiny , tiny fraction [ of the bonuses ] .
Why is n't this a grossly unfair amount ? "
" If you 're correct , then it 's very difficult for me to see -- even with the appropriate deference given to the SEC in these situations -- how the [ $ 33 million ] is remotely reasonable ? " he added .
Rakoff also said he was concerned that the fine would come out of the $ 20 billion bailout the bank received from the TARP program in January .
Fair or not ?
Attorneys for both the SEC and Bank of America argued that the settlement was fair .
The SEC representatives said there was some precedent for the fine , noting the government regulator reached a $ 37 million settlement with Wachovia for a failure to disclose a $ 500 million stock repurchase program in 2001 .
An attorney representing Bank of America argued that taxpayer money would not be included in the payment of the settlement .
Merrill 's decision to pay big bonuses first came to light in February , after New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo accused the firm of " secretly " rewarding executives before its merger with BofA closed .
Who is to blame ?
Rakoff also said he was concerned that the SEC complaint did not allege that anyone at Bank of America knowingly or intentionally did anything wrong .
When the SEC alleged that the decision lay with corporate merger officials at the two companies , Rakoff questioned how Bank of America Chief Executive Ken Lewis and former Merrill CEO John
Thain could be unaware of the misdirection when they themselves signed off on the proxy statement .
" If you are correct that this proxy statement was materially misleading , then at a minimum Mr. Thain and Mr. Lewis would seem to be responsible for that , yes ? "
But the SEC argued that Lewis and Thain likely did not know about the bonuses , as they were relying on the advice of their lawyers when they signed the company 's proxy statement .
In the end , Rakoff labeled the SEC 's filing " a rather uninformative complaint , " and said that the two sides had " rather diametric views about that the facts are . "
" In a case involving such public interest ... it seems to me that I need a lot more material before I can reach the conclusion that this settlement meets my approval , " he said .
Though BofA maintained that the settlement was fair , it said it would cooperate with the judge 's order .
" Bank of America continues to believe that the settlement is a constructive conclusion to this issue , " a spokesman for the company said in an e-mailed statement .
" We intend to provide the judge with the additional information he requested . "
The SEC could not be reached for comment .
Unusual settlement .
Legal experts say that Rakoff likely wanted to hold up the deal because of peculiarities in the settlement .
" The SEC must have wanted a quick settlement , " said John Coffee , professor of law at Columbia University .
" Judge Rakoff has done exactly the right thing . "
" This was a very unusual settlement , because the SEC usually does n't allege there are material wrongdoings at a corporation without trying to identify who the culprits were , " added Coffee .
" Corporations do n't tell lies , offices and employees do .
We should penalize those people , not the shareholders . "
Rakoff has been down this road before .
In 2003 , he refused to sign off on a $ 500 million settlement between the SEC and bankrupt telecom giant WorldCom .
After the parties were forced to renegotiate the settlement , Rakoff later signed off on a $ 750 million fine and stock set aside for former investors in the company for when WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy .
Just how impressive are the graphics in Monster Hunter 3 ?
Well , apparently they stunned Nintendo designers and members of the Zelda team .
In an Iwata Asks interview , Nintendo ’s boss stated that the Zelda devs were under intense pressure after seeing how the game looked .
Perhaps this is an indication that the visuals in Link ’s next outing will be a top priority .
Members from the Monster Hunter 3 team also noted that they understood Nintendo ’s console has n’t been known for featuring the most excellent graphics , but that they are imperative to the Monster Hunter experience .
Therefore , the team was striving to make Monster Hunter 3 the best - looking title on the platform .
There were a number of other details from the interview , some of which you can check out below .
– Motion control was considered at one point but was cut because it would be too tiring for gamers playing for long hours
– The game almost did n’t make an appearance at TGS last year because they had just finished mapping the controls –
There was relief when good feedback for the Wiimote was relayed
– Nintendo approached the team regarding the Classic Controller Pro –
This marks the first time Nintendo has worked with a third - party company to create new Wii hardware

Turnout was slightly lower than in 2005 , officials said Polls have closed in Japan in a general election that looks set to end more than 50 years of almost unbroken rule by the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) .
Japanese media are expected to announce exit polls shortly .
Opinion polls predict a substantial victory for the Democratic Party of Japan , which has promised to boost social security and help workers .
Japan is suffering record unemployment and its economy is struggling to emerge from a bruising recession .
At 1800 ( 0900 GMT ) , two hours before polls were due to close , 48.4 % of people had voted on Sunday , the internal affairs ministry said - down from 50 % in 2005 when elections saw the charismatic Junichiro Koizumi's LDP elected with a significant majority .
Voting conditions were not ideal , with typhoon - triggered rainfall fell heavily around Tokyo and a government warning that a swine flu epidemic was under way .
Change now ?
The conservative LDP , currently led by Prime Minister Taro Aso , has governed Japan for all but 11 months since 1955 .
AT THE SCENE Roland Buerk , BBC News , Tokyo
Well voting in this polling station set up at the Kyobashi Tsukiji Elementary School has been pretty brisk all day .
Turnout is expected to be high - the reason is the significance of this poll for Japan .
If , as the opinion polls suggest , the opposition Democratic Party of Japan wins , it will only the second time in more than half a century that the governing Liberal Democratic party has lost an election to the more powerful lower house of parliament .
The Democratic Party of Japan say they want to change the direction of this country - to shift it to the left .
They want to offer more social security .
But several media polls predict that the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) will win more than 300 seats in the 480 - seat lower house of parliament , reversing the election result of 2005 .
Analysts say voters blame the LDP for the current economic malaise - and are angry enough to opt for change .
" I think we need a change now , " 68 - year - old Tokyo pensioner Toshihiro Nakamura was quoted as saying by AFP news agency .
" It 's too long for a single party to dominate national politics .
Haruko Kurakata , who said she had voted for an opposition candidate , criticised the frequent changes in Japan 's leadership since Mr Koizumi stepped down in 2006 .
" It 's nonsense to see four prime ministers in four years without asking for the people 's opinion , " he said .
' Fed up '
As campaigning drew to a close , DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama said that voters were about to change history .
Japan election : Voters ' views Profile : Yukio Hatoyama Profile : Taro Aso
" This is an election to choose whether voters can muster the courage to do away with the old politics , " he told crowds in Sakai in the west of Japan on Saturday .
The centrist DPJ says it will shift the focus of government from supporting corporations to helping consumers and workers - challenging the status quo that has existed since the end of World War II .
It has promised to cut waste within the bureaucracy and use the funds to increase welfare spending .
But Mr Aso questioned whether the DPJ had enough experience to govern .
" Can you trust these people ?
It 's a problem if you feel uneasy whether they can really run this country , " he told a rally outside Tokyo .
The DPJ already controls Japan 's upper house with the support of smaller parties including the Social Democrats .

It won control of the house in July 2007 , amid voters ' anger at a series of scandals and the loss of millions of pension payment records .
Correspondents say voters ' desire for change after so many years under the LDP could be a crucial factor .
Tokyo University political science professor Takashi Mikuriya told Japanese media that the election " is more about emotions than policies " .
" Most voters are making the decision not about policies but about whether they are fed up with the ruling party , " he said .

On his radio show today Glenn Beck proclaimed that the 2008 election was really a Marxist coup .
He said , “ There is a coup going on .
There is a stealing of America , and the way it is done , it has been done through the , the guise of an election , but they lied to us the entire time . ”
If Obama ’s election was a coup , what was the 2000 election ?
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Beck said , “ They think they — and they — they — you know what ?
At this point , gang , I ’m not sure , they may be able to because they are so far ahead of us .
They know what they ’re dealing against ; most of America does not yet .
Most of America does n’t have a clue as to what ’s going on .
There is a coup going on .
There is a stealing of America , and the way it is done , it has been done through the — the guise of an election , but they lied to us the entire time . ”
He continued , “ Some of us knew !
Some of us we ’re shouting out , you were : “ this guy ’s a Marxist ! ” “ No , no , no , no , no , no . ”
And they ’re gonna say , “ We did it democratically , ” and they are going to grab power every way they can .
And God help us in an emergency . ”
( Because the Bush was so effective during emergencies like 9/11 and Katrina ) .
If the Obama ’s unquestioned democratic election was a coup , what was George W. Bush ’s election in 2000 ?
Was that a Republican coup ?
I love it when people like Beck lament that their America is being stolen .
What rights have they lost since Obama was elected ?
They have lost the right to tax cuts that only benefit them .
They have lost an administration that only cared about multi-millionaires like Beck .
By the way , Beck needs to learn that Marxism and Socialism are not interchangeable terms .
He should understand the difference .
There is nothing Marxist about Barack Obama ’s policies .
In fact , some liberals are disappointed that Obama has not moved more to the left .
Beck is offering nothing more than rhetorical comfort food for Republicans who are still bitter about the 2008 election .
It seems to me that the process and the product are Trent 's precious gifts to himself and therefore to us .
Mr. Reznor is as textured and multi-layered as the music he assembles .
Musically , I am aware of his relentlessness in terms of getting to the underbelly of an experience or feeling and digesting it fully - even if it poisons him .
This is a slightly edited version of a conversation we had one night in April , just before Nine Inch Nails hit the road to bring you The Downward Spiral .
Do n't read on if you want to hold on to illusion .
Trent hums ...M : Oh , you 're gonna hum for me .
This is good .
So , tell me , what kind of gum are you chewing ?
T : It 's my favorite , uh , Extra ... blue ... whatever flavor that is .
M : Is it sugar free ?
T : It 's sugar free and the flavor does last .
M : Please tell us where we are .
T : Physical location would be the Record Plant , cool cool LA studio where all the women that they hire have gigantic breasts .
Observation .
M : It 's not something you requested ?
T : No .
I mean , you notice , though , 'cause when you 're in the studio it 's kinda like being out at sea for five horny guys sitting around looking at computers .
You notice those things .
M : Can you please describe for our audience what you 're wearing ?
T : Well , these pants , there was a time for about a year , these were kind of like a brown .
At one time , they were more brown than they are now .
Brown hides the dirt well .
I think I wore them every single day during the recording of the album .
Kind of a thing .
And when the record got done , I kinda put 'em away , and then today for some reason , they just happened to be the only thing that was n't moving on it's own , ' cause I 'm kind of in a laundry crisis situation right now .
M : What are you working on here ?
T : Uh , what are we doing ?
We 're just getting some studio stuff out of the way , some re-mixes for Nine Inch Nails , and , uh , gearing up for a video .
We were supposed to be in Australia , but about a week ago we realized that there was n't enough time to get everything done we needed to get done , and we 're making the excuse that our drummer has a hernia so we can't go , which he does , but ...
M : Taking advantage of his hernia ...
T : Exactly .
Plus , we figure it's a good way for him to meet girls , too .
Sympathy thing [ laughs ] .
I better get more in the death mode or I 'm gonna blow my whole career ..
M : [ laughing ]
What is your never list ?
T : Never ...
M : Yeah , it could be for other humans .
T : Never ...hmmmm... can't think of any good , witty things to say to that , uh ...
M : [ laughing ]
I 'm trying to stump you , Trent .
T : You did .
You 're supposed to ask , you know , what was it like living in the Sharon Tate house and I just start talking , the same answer I 've told everybody .
And then where 'd the name Nine Inch Nails come from ?
Are you really depressed ?
Boy , you 're record 's sad !
What was it like working with Adrian Belew ?
M : I 'm sorry , but none of those questions are here on any of these cards ...
T : I do n't know the answers to any other ones , so you 'll get a lot of umm ...uhh ...
M : Well , would you like to answer any of those questions or should we -
T : No , I do n't really want to .
M : You do n't have things you always say yes or no to ?
T : I probably do .
I had n't really thought about that , though .
M : What will you never turn down ?
T : What will I never turn down ?
M : Yeah .
T : [ shooting a dead - pan look ]
Um , well , I mean , it was nice living there .
I did n't realize that Sharon Tate , that it was the " Tate " house , when we chose it .
It was a cool place ...
M : [ laughing ]
Do you meditate ?
T : No .
M : What 's your favorite home remedy ?
T : I got this one off my doctor friend .
Uh , it applies to a lot of things , but in the context it was described to me was ... I have a problem with my ears when I fly , something ' bout my I 've got Eustachian tube trouble , you know ?
I dont ' brag about that to a lot of people , but I do , and I said , " What can I do so that my head does n't explode when I go in an airplane . "
He said , " Well , the best thing to do would be to put your thumb up your butt , and then blow . "
I found that it works for lots of things , like I was having trouble getting a good kick drum sound the other day ...[ the " look " ]
M : How much money did you pay for that advice ?
T : Uh , I think that was free .
The best advice always is .
[ laughs ]
M : How did you choose the director for the " March of the Pigs " video and what was the process like ?
T : Well , we did two videos for that song .
The first one failed miserably and we spent a lot of money on it , and the second one was just a desperate ...uh ... we've got no money left , so let 's just use one camera .
We did do the video the first time with Peter Christopherson , who directed a couple of videos we 'd done in the past , and I like Peter and we came up with this idea , filmed it and a few things did n't quite turn out the way we wanted to .
At the end of the day , when we looked at the footage , it looked kind of average .
I was having a heart - to - heart talk with Rick Rubin one night and he said , " How 's your new video ? "
I said , " Uh , it 's pretty good . "
" It 's not great ? " I said , " Well , it 's not great ; you would n't see it and say it 's great . "
" Throw it out and do another one . "
" Well , we just spent a lot of money and ... "
" Nah , I mean , you would n't put music out that you felt was just pretty good , right ? "
I said , " No " " Well , a lot more people are gonna see your video than are gonna buy your record , so ...
" It got me thinking about the twisted state of music today .
How many homes does MTV go into , and by chance , the few that might be up at 4:30 in the morning on a Sunday night and catch the Nine Inch Nails video is gonna outnumber the amount of people that are gonna buy the record .
We tried re-editing - I thought that the performance that we did in the original video was good , but it was so much bullshit going on with cuts and stuff , that it could 've been any band in there .
So we just decided to do it live with live audio and just try one camera shot .
We played the song about 15 times and picked the one that was the least embarrassing , just to make a kind of an anti-video statement .
I thought this will either be cool or it'll suck , you know , and I 'm not really sure yet .
M : You do n't know ?
T : Someone told me it was cool , once .
" Yeah , yeah it is cool ... "
M : A reliable source ?
T : Well ... I... I... I mean , I trust my mom 's judgement .
M : I agree with your mother .
I like it .
I think it 's funny .
I especially like your sideways ...
T : It 's not supposed to be funny .
[ laughs ]
M : I 'm sorry .
T : [ laughs ]
It 's supposed to be , you know , scary and intense .
M : Yeah , it was ...
T : You like my what , my thing where I 'm tripping and I try to make it look like I meant to do that ?
M : No , your sideways crotch grabbing or scratching dance .
That thing .
T : Oh , that thing , yeah .
Well , you know , Axl 's got his shuffle and ...
M : I have n't seen you live , so I did n't know if that was your signature move or ...
T : Something just came over me that day .
I do n't think it is .
M : Now , I noticed that the look that you guys put together is very interesting .
Is that intentional ?
Or is that sort of like everyone 's personality ?
It seems that the Pearl Jams of the universe do n't really care about what they 're saying with their wardrobe .
T : I think it relies on their confidence .
I like to be entertained , and I lean towards more theatrical type things , as long as there 's an amount of sincerity and it's not totally cheesy .
I think when the grunge scene took over , which to me was a kind of culmination of all the bad , not necessarily bad , but jangly college rock bands who just look like normal guys that I guess the statement was , " Look , this is honest ; we do n't need to pretend we 're rock stars and all this shit . "
I think that mindset is a good one , and it brought a breath of fresh air ; it killed off the Bon Jovis and those type of bands with our new earnest attitude .
But that 's become contrived now .
It all made sense one day when I was drug out to the ... what 's that shitty bar on Sunset that has a bunch of local bands play all the time ?
Linger is it ?
Lingerie ?
M : Yeah , Club Lingerie .
T : Some reason I ended up there and it's local band night , and this band comes on stage , singer 's got a flannel shirt on , bass player no shirt on , someone else with a gas station attendant one - piece blue Sears thing with someone else 's name patch on it , and I listened to a couple songs , and , uh , sounds kinda like Nirvana , not bad .
Have a beer , turn around , next band 's on stage , this singer does n't have his shirt on , and the bass player 's got the flannel shirt , you know ?
On the fifth band , they 're all interchangeable , this one a little more Pearl Jam .
I mean , when I see a show , I want to be entertained .
I 'd rather see David Bowie / Ziggy Stardust on stage than that guy that just pumped gas for me down the street .
That in itself is a fairly unfashionable thing to say , but I 'm bored with all that shit .
In the past , I think Nine Inch Nails would just be kind of afraid of that element of things because you do walk that line .
You 're setting yourself up to be ridiculed if you do n't look safe .
M : Who is your audience ?
T : At one time , I could 've maybe told you , but now I do n't know .
M : What kind of relationship do you want to have with your audience ?
T : I 'm appreciative and I try to treat people cool if they get to me somewhere .
I realize very much that if it was n't for them , I would n't be doing this , but it 's too weird to try to understand what they think you are , like in the media .
I think the way most media tries to portray me is not entirely accurate as to who I think I am , if I know that anymore , but I do n't .
I realize it 's just a game .
I 'm not gonna know any of these peole that are reading about me , and if I can amplify that into something that 's more entertaining to them , I do n't care .
I read some shit that pisses me off about me that I know is n't true , but who cares , you know ?
I say you know a lot .
Normally , I do n't say that .
You know ?
M : I can edit those out , but I think I do know .
T : I 'm gonna try and answer the next question all in a belch .
M : How did you know that you had a voice ?
T : An artistic voice , you mean ?
M : Both .
T : Well , I could talk and sound came out , you know ?
[ laughs ]
No , I was good at playing an instrument and I was good at ... music was something that came easier to me than other things , so I knew that 's what I wanted to do and wanted to be at the position I am now , but I did n't know how to get there , and , uh ... I did know how to get there , but I was afraid to try it in case I failed miserably .
It 's easier to talk about what you want to do and then not do it than to try it and possibly be awful at it and then have to face the reality .
I did n't want to just pretend .
I was objected to know if I suck .
I 'm not going to pretend I 'm good and just suck .
You know what I mean ?
It was n't until I was like 23 before I ever wrote a song .
It sounds stupid , but the first songs I wrote were my first album because I was afraid of sucking .
So I 'd play in other people 's bands and arrange music and be the keyboard player and stuff , but I came to a point where I realized I was just a fuck - up and , okay , I 'm a college drop - out , I could have a drug problem if I let myself to it , I 'm working in a fucking studio cleaning toilets , I 've got a bright future ahead of me [ we both laugh ] .
So I just stopped my life and decided I " m going to try this 100 percent and see what happens .
M : What do you hear when you are listening to music ?
T : I think the thing I like about music is that it can communicate on a bunch of different levels , to me anyway .
When I hear , not all music , but a good portion of it , instantly it brings visuals to mind of where I was when I heard it , or some mood .
It is not totally literal , it 's not like , um , what am I trying to say ?
It 's almost like snapshots , but it 's not just places and times , it 's feelings and moods .
I think it 's a cool way to communicate , and I know when I was growing up there 's certain things that totally affected me and things I could relate to , and if I was bummed out , certain records that can be a very personal cool soundtrack to life .
That 's a pretty pretentious thing to say , but ...
M : Then do you choose your moods ?
Do you choose music to try to put yourself in a particular mood ?
T : I should consciously do that more , but usually it 's ... to change the CD , I have to go in the trunk , so whatever 's stocked .
I 've been in the same mood for three months .
M : On this album , it 's a concept album , as I understand , correct ?
Theese are not personal experiences , or are they ?
T : No , it is personal experiences , but it 's wrapped up in the highly pretentious idea of a record with some sort of theme or flow to 'em , and it was meant to be .
I just tried to make a record as a big hourlong chunk of music rather than a bunch of three minute popsongs that just happened to be on the same record .
I do n't think many people are doing them that much these days .
It 's become a kind of a dated Seventies concept , but some of the records that influenced me a lot on this album , like Low and even The Wall - I 'm sure I 'm ripping off Pink Floyd , in fact , I know I am ripping them off .
There 's records , although they may appear dated today , that try to do things that are more exciting to me than , " Here 's my video track and here 's my dance song and here 's my power ballad . "
All that kind of disposability .
It was just me bored , trying to come up with something that I kind of wanted to set the pararmeters to work within , to focus more ...
This flash cards idea is kind of nice .
M : Actually , you can interview yourself .
I can leave and you can just flip through these , say the questions and than answer them .
So , do you believe in God ?
T : Um , I believe in , you know , some sort of a God .
I do n't really know what I believe in right now .
It 's been something that 's been plaguing me for , I wo n't say plaguing me , but there 's a desire for me to get myself this spiritually .
I wanna start by learning more about some Eastern mentalities that I do n't know that much about .
I know what I do n't believe in and just through , I think , the inevitable process of maturity and trying to keep and open mind , and trying to analyze why I feel a certain way , sorta , in things , make sense to me , like karma .
Certain things don' tmake that much sense to me , like organized western religion .
I understand why people need religion and do n't think it 's wrong for people that are into it at all , but it did n't work for me .
I do n't want to sit and pretend that it did because I 'm afraid that I might get punished for not believing in some fairy tale .
I have concepts I feel pretty strongly about , but I have n't done my disertation on it and created my own religion .
Certain things make sense to me - I innately feel them versus being taught them .
You know what I mean ?
I believe that there is a connection between everybody and nature in partiuclar and that rather than overly concern yourself , " Why are we here ?
What is our purpose ?
What are we supposed to do ? "
I do n't think we 're meant to know that , you know ?
Every philosopher in the history of time 's come to the same conclusion .
At the end of the day , I 've proven that that 's a bottle of beer , and that I 'm going to die and , you know , that 's it .
M : What do you wish for other humans ?
T : Well , I mean , for my own perspective , I 'm just searching for some amount of enlightenment , or self - examination to figure out why I feel the way I do about things .
And I find that I 'm not there yet , but I think that would be the key for me - being fulfilled as a person or as a human being .
If I do n't reach a point later in my life where I go , " Well there 's a lot of elements in my life I 've never really considered .
I do n't really know who I am . "
I have n't really explored the options and dared to ask myself things that I 'm not comfortable with that are not pleasant to examine .
And what would I wish upon people ?
That 's what I 'm wishing for myself , is that some day I 'll come to some point where I feel a degree of contentment , you know , " contentment , " and whatever it is in me that 's making me want to do what I 'm doing .
I feel like I 've done something , you know ?
If not for anybody else , for myself .
But I 'm generally not happy .
I 'm glad I 'm doing these things .
I feel like I mad a decision a few years ago to really try to work at something , and it 's paying off , but , um , it'd be nice to be able to live in the same place for more than three days .
I do n't have an address right now .
I 'm looking , which is another long story , but my home is the tour bus till we get off .
I do n't have anyplace I can go home to right now .
It 'd be nice to have a relationship with somebody where you 're not constantly somewhere else and to have some degree of normality .
That I had , and hated , now I do n't have .
I just want to rent a movie someday .
M : What would you rent ?
T : What would I rent ?
If it was today , right now , I would rent Steve Martin 's The Jerk .
I 'm in that kind of mood right now .
Normally , real depressing , sad , violent kind of movies , you know ?
M : Do you like David Lean 's films ?
Do you know who he is ?
T : Um ...
M : He did Lawrence of Arabia , Dr. Zhivago ...
T : Not very well versed in that ...
M : You would like his work , I think .
That 'd be my recommendation , but you know , I do n't work in a video store .
What was your favorite toy as a child ?
T : Um ... dont ' know that it was my favorite , but do you remember ... how old are you ?
M: 26 .
T : You 're old , so you know .
Do you remember whirly birds ?
M : Are they those things where you go like this [ rubs palms together ] ?
T : No .
M : Oh .
T : An amazing helicopter toy that , there 's two little controls , it was on an arm , so it would fly around in circles .
M : Oh , yeah , sure .
T : You could make it pick up shit , little houses and stuff .
That was up there .
That was one of my favoirites .
And the Six Million Dollar Man doll .
I had the fucking spaceship and the control center and I would daydream about being bionic and kicking people 's ass at school , you know ?
[ whispers ]
" I 'll show them , I 'm bionic " That was pretty fancy , but I was a little concerned about potentially developing into being a homosexual because it was a doll .
Back then , guys with dolls , it was a new thing .
Parents were n't sure what was gonna happen , you know ?
M : You questioned your sexuality that early on ?
T : Nah , nah , yeah , it 's a doll , but it 's like Planet of the Apes .
Man , it 's cool , uh , that 's really cool , G.I. Joe , but if you had a Ken , that was your first step .
M : Were you a Monopoly person or a Clue person ?
T : I think I would have been a Clue person , but we always had Monopoly around , so I became the master of cheating that game .
And my grandpa would always let me play ...
M : So you were the banker ?
T : He knew I was cheating and let me in my own home .
[ grandpa voice ]
" Did someone take that 0 , " accidentally scooping hotels on to Boardwalk , that kind of thing .
But I got into Clue late .
The problem with Clue were there was never enough people around to play it , ' cause it was just me and my grandparents where I grew up , and they learned quickly the art of not getting board games so that they did n't have to play !
M : Do you have any regrets ?
T : Oh , I " ve got tons of regrets , you know ?
M : Really ?
T : I mean , various degrees of regrets , some professional , many personal .
I went through an ego phase , treating people shitty phase , and I 'm not proud of those times .
People start to get power , they go in with noble aspirations , but start to abuse it , realizing they can abuse it , and I had done that .
There 's times when I , not willingly , but have probably , um , treated people differently that I would now becaue of some scenario , some trip I was caught up in at the time .
I 'm not proud of that .
I 'm not making excuses , except that it was a total , it still is , total lifestyle changes .
I do n't have to worry about paying the gas bill anymore .
It seems silly to even think that way , but to never have thought about those things , and suddenly it was like , " I can buy a bed . "
I 've never even had a bed , you know ?
M : What 's been your greatest artistic accomplishment ?
T : Well , at the end of this record , there 's one last song that 'd been kinda floatin ' around that I ended up recording , kinda not knowing if it was too naked to go on that record .
It 's the last song , this sounds totally cheesy , but it was so fucking heavy when we were in the studio doing it that , it was intense .
[ tough - guy voice ]
I 'm not gonna say I was crying , but it was , I was there .
I knew it meant a lot to me to write that ' cause I was sorta excited and I had goose bumps .
So I just put it on the record and I thought it made a nice ending to a gloomy little song before I kill myself , so I figured , " Well , this 'll be my kind of regret song . "
When it got done , I really was proud of it - it 's probably one that I 'm most proud of on that record .
Last week , here 's where the artistic achievement comes in , I 'm supposed to meet this friend of mine who 's an engineer , he works for A & M studios all the time , to talk about doing a remix for something .
It was about midnight , and he 's like , " Do me a favor , just meet me across the street , the bar across the street , okay ? "
My engineer and I drive there and park and the bar across the street is , of course , a strip club .
So I walk in there and I 'm sitting down talkin ' to the guy , and I 'm not really paying attention to anything that 's going on - it's not typically where I go to hang out - and what comes on the PA system for the girl to dance to but that song [ laughs ] !
I just ... just ... my jaw dropped open to see like a woman in her underpants , dancing to this fucking song that was totally out of place anyway in that kind of environment .
It 's just a dirge , it has no drums , no beat or anything , and I just started laughing .
" Fuck , this is , uh ... I can't believe how out of context ... this is not supposed to be here ! "
So that 's when I knew I had made it .
Now , that 's not a very good answer .
No , I 'll give you a good answer .
It was kind of funny in a sad way , to be honest with that question , when I finished this record , I was afraid because I try to look at it like I 'm making art .
The bottom line is , it is a product for sale in a store and I thought , " I 've made something that I really feel I 'm proud of , but I do n't think it 's a very commercial type record . "
But I was and am still proud of this record , for me , it 's the best thing I 've done .
I did some things I did n't know if I could do or not , and I do n't mean for that to sound egotistical , but I think you have to believe in your own stuff if you 're gonna put it out .
Ask me after my next record and I 'll probably , I hope , say the same thing .
M : What part of yourself did you kill off with this album ?
T : On one level , I was afraid of the studio and I was afraid of the creative process .
I was afraid of interacting with other people in that process .
I got over that , I 'm not as apprehensive to be around people .
I used to just be mortally afraid of other respected musicians .
M : What is beauty to you ?
T : Where did you get these questions ?
Um , no , it 's a good question , actually .
I think things that are beautiful , to me , are less obvious .
I think , uh , Joel Peter Witkin 's photographs are beautiful , although probably most people would say they 're grotesquely ugly , but to me that 's what makes it more interesting .
The music that I like abstractly applies to beauty , generally , like the best stuff , when you hear it at first , I do n't know if I like that or not , you know .
But you wanna maybe hear it again .
By the fifth listen , you understand it and see through , you see into it 's beauty .
By the tenth listen , its still revealing itself to you , rather than ... um , um , somthing that on the surface is very obvious and then lacking .
That could apply physically in people , what I find , might find beauty , you know ?
Very few traditional beautiful types that I think , you know , they are n't beautiful , but I think my idea of what I find beautiful is slightly off - kilter from you average , from what we 're told to say is .
It 's weird when you get asked questions that require you to be eloquent and have something intelligent to say , but you do n't really .
You 're thinking while you 're talking .
M : The lightning round .
T : Exactly .
( dunce voice ) Yeah , uh , uh ... it's not just , " Hi . "
And it's in the context of , it 's not , you know , we 're not like out on a date just talking , you know ?
I 'm talking to the people who are trying to read the font of Ray Gun ...
" What the fuck does that say ?!!! "
M : Evil ?
T : What do I find evil ?
M : Yeah .
T : Um , I think LA is evil .
I think LA brings out an uglines and evil in people that moved here to be a part of what LA supposedly is .
And I 'm saying that from just being here a year and a half , realizing I do n't really like it here that much , without really trying to fit in .
I 'm here to work , so that 's what I try to do , but I have been around the people that , generally , this is a very general statement , that LA attitude of insincerity and " what can you do for me , " that sickening career cutthroat bullshit .
M : What 's right in the world ?
What 's good ?
T : Now , there 's a tough one .
There are things that are intersting things to think about .
Um , I do n't have a totally pessimistic view of people and humanity in general , then you start thinking and turn the news on and people are still blowing each other up in Bosnia and South Africa 's killing everybody and 500 people died in the last couple days .
I can't understand that perspective - I'm not saying it 's wrong - I can't imagine , being from a cushioned American upbringing , being so worked up about that guy who believes in a different god than I do that I 've gotta fucking kill im and blow up his house so that I can claim that land seem so silly to me .
But you see that and then you see the abuse of ecology and the whole thing really lessens my faith .
I do n't think we 're ever gonna blow ourselves up and do n't think that anybody , when it rightly comes down to pushing that button , I have faith that that would n't happen .
At the same time , I firmly believe that we 'll destroy the ozone layer and pollute the world to where we 'll kill ourselves anyway because some fucking company does n't want to lose money by admitting that their chemical pollutes or they 'll lose money if they have to switch over to some other fucking thing or thinking that 'll happen in 300 years when I "m gone .
That kind of shit .
M : Um , how is that what 's good in the world ?
T : Oh , yeah .
I think the ability to love somebody is a good thing .
M : You 're rolling your eyes when you say that .
T : Yeah , I just realized that 's one of those really stupid things , but I do think that as ridiculous as things can be as a human being , that 's what the fuck I am saying .
I mean , I feel this way , but I sound , no matter how you say that , it sounds stupid ...um , I think being able to care about somebody else and have some sort of camaraderie is , uh , that 's good .
And puppies , I like puppies a lot .
I do like animals .
I love animals ...
M : That 's good .
T : Generally more than people .
M : Are you a cat person or a dog per -
T : Dog .
I know that means I 'm insecure about -
M : Oh , I 've never heard that .
T : Some fucking cat lover said something about that .
Cat people are secure , you know , dog people need ...
M : Oh , gosh !
My interpretation is that dog people do n't mind being licked , which I have a problem with .
I 'm not familiar with that , that cat manual that your friend has ...
T : Well , that 's anti-dog propaganda .
M : Have you ever been in love ?
T : [ quiet ]
Yeah .
M : How'd you know ?
T : Have you ?
M : No ... I do n't think so .
T : You'd know [ laughs ] , I think .
M : Okay , I guess the last thing I want to ask you is , um , are you planning on immersing anything in hot beans ?
T : [ laughs ]
Is that what he asked you to ask me ?
M : He 's laughing , Dweezil .
T : [ still laughing ]
That was good .
That was good .
After reading how I come across in this interview , I might want to whip up a batch .

Malaysian police fired tear gas and water cannons at more than 15,000 demonstrators who took to the streets to protest against controversial internal security laws .
In chaotic scenes in downtown Kuala Lumpur , some 5,000 police including riot squads arrested scores of protesters as they gathered at rallying points across the city , including two mosques and a shopping complex .
Deputy police chief Ismail Omar said that 175 people were arrested for taking part in the protest , aimed at pressuring the Government to abolish laws that allow for detention without trial .
" We just wanted to disperse them , so we used water cannon and tear gas to do that , " he said , insisting the police action was not heavy - handed .
Among the detained were top opposition figures including R Sivarasa , vice - president of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim 's party .
Demonstrators played a cat - and - mouse game with police who attempted to prevent them from massing at the rallying points , darting into side streets before regrouping and marching through the streets .
At least 75 rounds of tear gas were fired and water cannons were unleashed at the Sogo shopping complex where the main crowd of some 10,000 people had gathered , intending to march on the royal palace .
As they began proceeding down a main thoroughfare , the police launched their sustained offensive which forced many to flee , coughing and choking from the effects of the gas .
Organisers said they wanted to present a 10 - point memo to the king including demands for the abolition of the Internal Security Act , the closure of a camp where detainees are held , and an inquiry into all deaths in police custody .
At the national mosque , where an AFP reporter saw at least 50 detained , opposition legislator Siti Mariah Mahmud , from the Islamic party PAS , criticised the arrests of protesters as they attempted to enter the mosque .
" This is not reasonable .
It 's prayer time and this action is a breach of our religious freedom and duty , " she said .
When prayers were completed , those who had managed to enter the mosque streamed out , joining a crowd of at least 5,000 which began marching before also being confronted by tear gas and water cannons .
There was traffic chaos in Kuala Lumpur , as trains stopped at affected stations and police roadblocks caused snarls that left many shoppers stuck in the city .
Prime Minister Najib Razak denounced the protest plans on Friday , saying it was unnecessary because he had agreed to review the ISA after coming to power earlier this year .
The legislation , a hangover from colonial days , has been used against Government opponents as well as suspected Islamist terrorists .
" We are here to fight for the ISA to be abolished , " said Yati Ali , 45 , one of some 100 women and children standing in a group outside the Sogo complex .
" We do n't fear arrest .
ISA is a cruel act , we are fighting for justice , " she said .

In 1981 von Brunn attempted to place the treasonous Federal Reserve Board of Governors under legal , non-violent , citizens arrest .
He was tried in a Washington , D.C. Superior Court ; convicted by a Negro jury , Jew / Negro attorneys , and sentenced to prison for eleven years by a Jew judge .
A Jew / Negro / White Court of Appeals denied his appeal .
He served 6.5 years in federal prison .
He is now an artist and author and lives on Maryland 's Eastern Shore . "
When I first read his biography , I realized James Von Brunn had taken direct action to deal with the banking cartel that controls and destroys so much of our lives and somehow I had never heard of his heroic deed .
How could that be ?
How could such an amazing deed go unremarked by the journals and books that deal with monetary systems and how we are controlled by them ?
After speaking with James , I must conclude many who were in a position to shine light on the situation were afraid to do so .
James Von Brunn endured having his house burned down in retaliation for publishing books that the Jews viewed as hostile to their financial interests .
James endured jail and personal sorrows as a consequence of his refusal to submit to tyranny .
My nomination for White Racialist Treasure : James Von Brunn .
Please feel free to add your nominations for White Racialist Treasures to this thread .
Thank you .
Blessed Be the Pro-White Activists ,

The colourful private equity tycoon Stephen Schwarzman was America 's best - paid corporate boss with a staggering package of $ 702 m ( £ 424 m ) last year as he received a huge chunk of stock negotiated at the time of the flotation of his Blackstone empire in 2007 .
Despite a dismal economic backdrop of soaring unemployment , failing high - street businesses and plunging stockmarkets , Schwarzman , 62 , easily outshone America 's second - best - paid boardroom leader , the Oracle software boss Larry Ellison , who earned $ 557m .
Schwarzman hit the headlines at the height of a private equity boom two years ago by throwing a lavish $ 3 m birthday party for himself in a historic Manhattan armoury decorated to resemble his Park Avenue apartment .
His Blackstone group has a $ 92bn investment portfolio including the Hilton hotel chain , United Biscuits , CenterParcs , and Cineworld cinemas .
Almost all of Schwarzman 's remuneration came in the form of shares .
At the time of Blackstone 's public offering , Schwarzman and his co-founders agreed to swap their partnerships for stock ownership whereby equity vested gradually over a four - year period .
A Blackstone spokesman contended that this did not count as remuneration in the conventional sense , and that Schwarzman should not be at top of the rankings compiled by the Corporate Library , an independent research organisation : " It 's absurd and it 's a fundamental misunderstanding of accounting and of compensation . "
The top echelons of high - rolling chief executives were dominated by the bosses of energy companies , which prospered as commodity prices soared last summer .
Seven of the top 10 earning US bosses ran petroleum , mining or fuel corporations .
Occidental Petroleum 's chief , Ray Irani , received $ 222 m , boosted by $ 184 m of gains on stock options and a $ 900,000 bonus for cutting costs .
His company has agreed to adopt a ' say on pay ' resolution which will allow investors an annual vote on executive remuneration from 2010 .
Elsewhere in the energy field , Hess Corporation 's boss , John Hess , took home $ 159 m , Ultra Petroleum 's chief , Michael Watford , got $ 116 m and Chesapeake Energy 's chief executive , Aubrey McClendon , scooped $ 114m .
Tenth in the table was Michael Jeffries , the head of the fashion retailer Abercrombie & Fitch , who got $ 71 m .
Known for their thumping music and scantily clad staff , Abercrombie 's clothes stores have proven relatively robust in the recession . , although the chain made news in Britain this week when a disabled student won a wrongful dismissal tribunal .
Riam Dean , 22 , argued that Abercrombie bosses banished her to a stockroom because her wish to wear a cardigan to cover her prosthetic arm did not fit with a London store 's ' look policy ' .
The remuneration rankings came out at the height of a row over rewards in the US .
The Obama administration has appointed a ' pay czar ' to rule on pay packages at Wall Street banks bailed out by the government .
The House of Representatives recently backed the introduction of British - style shareholder votes on pay at companies across the US business landscape .
An Ethical Code for Intelligence Officers
August ’s Communications of the ACM has an interesting article : “ An Ethics Code for U.S. Intelligence Officers , ” by former NSAers Brian Snow and Clint Brooks .
The article is behind a paywall , but here ’s the code :
Draft Statement of Ethics for the Intelligence Community Preamble : Intelligence work may present exceptional or unusual ethical dilemmas beyond those of ordinary life .
Ethical thinking and review should be a part of our day to day efforts ; it can protect our nation ’s and our agency ’s integrity , improve the chances of mission success , protect us from the consequences of bad choices , and preserve our alliances .
Therefore , we adhere to the following standards of professional ethics and behavior : First , do no harm to U.S. citizens or their rights under the Constitution .
We uphold the Constitution and the Rule of Law ; we are constrained by both the spirit and the letter of the laws of the United States .
We will comply with all international human rights agreements that our nation has ratified .
We will insist on clarification of ambiguities that arise between directives or law and the principles of this code .
We will protect those within our institutions who call reasonable attention to wrongdoing .
Expediency is not an excuse for misconduct .
We are accountable for our decisions and actions .
We support timely , rigorous processes that fix accountability to the responsible person .
Statements we make to our clients , colleagues , overseers and the U.S. public will be true , and structured not to unnecessarily mislead or conceal .
We will resolve difficult ethical choices in favor of constitutional requirements , the truth , and our fellow citizens .
We will address the potential consequences of our actions in advance , especially the consequences of failure , discovery , and unintended or collateral consequences of success .
We will not impose unnecessary risk on innocents .
Although we may work in secrecy , we will work so that when our efforts become known , our fellow citizens will be proud of us and of our efforts .
It ’s supposed to be for U.S. intelligence officers , but with one inconsequential modification it could be made international .

Not everyone owns a pool table .
And going to a pool hall to practice every day can get both inconvenient and expensive .
So how do you get better without practicing ?
I recently wrote about the Kaizen way – how small one minute tasks can make a big difference .
I wanted to find an easy way to practice pool for a minute every day .
What I decided on was the bottle drill .
Place an empty bottle on a level surface ( I use an ironing board ) .
Place your hand about a foot away from the mouth of the bottle and stroke the cue into the bottle without touching the sides .
I do this for just about 30 seconds to a minute , after which I switch hands and repeat the exercise .
This drill is perfect for the subconscious mind to learn quickly because it provides the brain with a simple goal and immediate feedback for auto - correction .
The first two days I did this drill , I touched the bottle a lot while stroking .
However by the third day my subconscious had already realized what I was trying to achieve and had started “ fixing ” anything that was causing me to touch the sides .
I started loosening my back arm muscles , softening my grip .
I also discovered exactly where I need to keep the cue below my eye so that I can aim perfectly .
Over a period of two weeks , I can now go 20 – 30 strokes without touching the sides ( and 3 - 4 with my left hand ) .
This exercise is improving my concentration and ability to hit the cue ball exactly where I need to .
It is also making it a habit for me to stay down on the shot ( since getting up makes the cue tip hit the bottle ) .
The improvements on the pool table have been phenomenal .
I had no idea my stroke needed so much correction .
I thought I shot well before , but over the last couple of weeks my shooting has been getting better .
Last night , I hit full table length , straight in , stop shots perfectly and consistently .
Even my table length draw shots are getting consistent .
I had been going through a losing streak the last couple of months , and this one little exercise has got me shooting better than I have ever shot before .
It has me feeling excited about shooting and playing pool again .
The cool thing is , because it is only one minute a day , I find this drill both easy and convenient to do .
I have n’t skipped this exercise even one day since I started .
For people who would like to improve their shooting and need a convenient way to practice and improve their game , this is probably the answer you are looking for .
If you are in a slump or plateau , the reason for it is usually a defect in the pool stroke .
This simple , almost silly , little practice exercise will change your game for ever .
If Rupert Murdoch is to make a success of charging for all his papers ' content online , expect more attacks on the BBC
Who made the rule that everything on the internet should be free ?
It 's the question that beleaguered media executives around the world are have been muttering to themselves for months now .
The only certain answer is that it was none of them , because when the decisions about internet strategy were being made in their organisations , none of the most senior bosses were particularly interested .
Now , hit by the double whammy of a cyclical advertising downturn and huge structural change , the news business is going through the same pain that afflicted the music industry .
After years of hoping the problem would go away , news organisations are desperately reaching for the same strategy adopted by the music bosses : shutting the paid - for door after the free horse has long since bolted .
It 's not the first time that news organisations have flirted with charging for online content .
The New York Times hoisted a pay wall around its columnists , only to find that everyone stopped reading them .
After their precious journo - stars started to complain , the Times abandoned the strategy , but it led directly to the birth of the Huffington Post , a free comment website that provides a far more wide - ranging daily analysis of the US political scene .
The ( Murdoch - owned ) Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have had limited success in charging for specialist financial news and comment .
But the proliferation of free online sources , aggregated by the search giant Google , has doomed to failure any attempt by others to extend such charges to general news content .
Rupert Murdoch 's announcement that all News Corp 's newspaper websites – including the Sun , News of the World , Times and Sunday Times in the UK – will charge by next year is therefore a sign that the news industry is running out of options .
The old business model – cover price plus ad revenue – is bust : blown apart by the loss of classified to online networks and collapse of cover - price revenue due to falling sales .
The hoped - for cash from online advertising has not materialised , at least not on the scale that would support the kind of journalism practised by the likes of Murdoch 's papers , or for that matter the Guardian .
The elephant in the ( British ) room is the BBC – which is , in effect , the biggest free news website in the world .
In a world where everyone is taking a gamble , one thing is certain : a new round of Murdoch - led lobbying to clip the BBC 's online wings .

Breaking : Anchorage mayor makes horrible decision
by Jeremy Hooper
OH .
MY .
OFFENSIVE :
[ Republican ]
Mayor Dan Sullivan today vetoed an ordinance that would ban discrimination against gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transgendered people in Anchorage .
In a statement e-mailed minutes ago , Sullivan said he sees no need for the measure .
" My review shows that there is clearly a lack of quantifiable evidence necessitating this ordinance , " the mayor said .
" My review also shows that the vast majority of those who communicated their position on the ordinance are in opposition . "
Sullivan vetoes gay rights ordinance [ Anchorage Daily News ]
Score another one for majority tyranny being used to make a minority population more vulnerable .
Oh and remember , Anchorage gays : Start recording every slight you face as you go about your day to day existence , so that the easily discernible problem of anti-LGBT bias might be " quantifiable " enough in the future .
Ugh .
So disgusting !
** UPDATE : Do n't forget the sort of rhetoric that the opposition used to oppose this measure : ' Gays do n't face discrimination , ' says she who represents gay - discriminatory group [ G - A - Y ]
** MORE : Even worse rhetoric can be found at link .
This is the kind of fringe extremism with which Mayor Sullivan sided : Sexual Orientation Summarized
**** MORE , MORE : If one of the four opposing members of the Assembly changes their vote in the next 21 days , they can override the mayor 's veto .
So reminding them of the kinds of lies and affronts contained in the above links could be handy .
The four " no " voters ( Debbie Ossiander , Chris Birch , Bill Starr and Dan Coffey ) can be reached at : [ email protected ] ; [ email protected ] ; [ email protected ] ; [ email protected ]
Your thoughts
Maybe one of the 4 no votes in the assembly hates the mayor enough to switch to a yes vote .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Aug 17 , 2009 7:30:14 PM
OF COURSE he vetoed it ; he 's a Republican ( the Party of NO ) .
Are we surprised ?
No , but still are sad about the decision .
In Iowa , 7 are currently considering running for Governor next year on the Republican ticket ; all but one keep bringing up " you know what " ...
Disgusting .

I just emailed them all a personal message about my childhood in Anchorage and how much freedom to be myself was born in my years spent there , and that I hoped they would consider that taking the leap to protect sexual minorities - whether or not they " agree " with them - was one of the strongest , most patriotic things they could do to bring pride to Anchorage and Alaska .
I 'll let you know if I hear back .

The worst psychological state , economist Jagdish Bhagwati has remarked , is a superiority complex coupled with an inferior status .
For Indians , few things induce this state more than their own passports .
The front part of the booklet shows an ancient regal statue of four lions , but the pages inside must be filled with costly foreign visas before Indians may travel — an inconvenience that Americans , Britons , and Frenchmen seldom have to put up with .
This troublesome dynamic exploded again into the Indian consciousness when Shah Rukh Khan , a Bollywood superstar , was held for a two - hour detention and interrogation session at Newark ’s Liberty International Airport .
That he was held on the 63rd anniversary of India ’s independence did n’t help matters .
Even better , the actor , who is Muslim , had just signed a deal to publicize his latest film , My Name Is Khan , which is billed as “ a story of a Muslim man mistaken for a terrorist in post - 9/11 America . ”
No doubt the airport incident will be milked for marketing purposes .
Khan says he feels “ angry and humiliated ” and finds the incident “ absolutely uncalled for , ” given his previous visits to the U.S.
He has even leveled the more serious charge of racial profiling .
Authorities both Indian and American are anxious to tamp such accusations down .
The new U.S. ambassador to India has said that Khan is always welcome in America .
And in response to Khan ’s statement that he “ was really being hassled , perhaps because of my name being Khan , ” Ambika Soni , the Indian information minister , has said that any such hassling was likely not conducted with a “ religious bias in mind . ”
But Khan ’s suspicions are closer to the truth than Soni ’s assurances .
The Department of Homeland Security , despite substantial criticism , maintains a program that profiles foreign travelers by their religion and nationality , and has done so since 9/11 in an open , institutionalized manner .
It ’s not an aberration when someone named Khan gets stopped by airport security .
Under the National Security Entry / Exit Registration System ( NSEERS ) , men aged 16 – 45 from two dozen countries — all majority - Muslim , from Morocco to Indonesia — face heightened scrutiny and have their information entered into a database .
The program also often extends to Muslim men from non-majority - Muslim countries , like India .
So far , the NSEERS database includes men from about 140 nations , many Indian Muslims among them .
Khan says that this was n’t his first time being detained and questioned at U.S. immigration , which means that he was likely registered in the NSEERS database during a previous visit .
What does NSEERS entail , beyond the initial registration ?
Certainly a “ secondary inspection , ” one beyond the usual immigration checkpoint .
This would involve detention and possibly questioning in a separate room — what Khan faced — upon entering the U.S. People in the database must also “ check out ” when they leave the United States , unlike other visitors .
And NSEERS further requires registrants to keep authorities abreast of their whereabouts .
Address changes or , for foreign students , changes in enrollment status must be sent to DHS within ten days .
If a registrant violates any notification rules , the government puts his photographs and biometric data into a national crime database , which local police routinely check when they stop people for traffic offenses , for example .
Putting aside questions of the system ’s merit , one can at least say that Khan ’s experience was utterly predictable .
Americans have decided that they want to keep a tight watch on potential terrorists and are doing so partly by monitoring Muslim travelers .
Muslims , for their part , find this humiliating , because it suggests that they are a heightened security risk ( which is certainly true statistically ) .
Neither reaction should come as a surprise .
The Khan affair is not an unfortunate cultural misunderstanding , but rather a case of cultures understanding one another perfectly — and not liking what they see .

The game of life .
In his book , " Betting on Yourself " , Dr Robert Anthony said that , if you ’re determined to create a rewarding Network Marketing Business , to succeed on your relationships and to enjoy a sense of emotional well - being , keep reading so you can learn how to become a Winner in all these areas .
The path to winning is reasonably straight .
There are however a number of obstacles that need to be overcome along the way .
Winning is an Attitude .
To understand what it takes to beat the odds against losing , you must first understand what it takes to be a winner .
Contrary to popular belief , winning is not a matter of luck .
Winning is an Attitude .
For the purpose of this study , Dr. Robert Anthony divided the general population into 3 specific categories :
1. Winners
2. Losers
3. Non-Winners
Winner -
This is a person who has what he wants .
He achieves whatever he sets out to accomplish .
Loser -
This one is someone who does n’t have all he wants but has good “ reasons ” why he does n’t have it .
He feels he ’s a victim of people , circumstances and conditions .
He blames everyone and everything for his current situation in life .
Non-Winner -
This is a person who is willing to do whatever it takes to be a Winner but who lacks the necessary knowledge and skills to go from where he is to where he wants to be .
He does n’t blame family , friends and some historical event in his life , nor does he blame himself .
He realizes that through great knowledge and desire he can make some significant changes .
Recognizing his present situation as a temporary one , he ’s willing to do whatever is necessary to get on the path that leads to winning .
It you ’re not presently a Winner , you are either a Loser or a Non-Winner .
As a Loser , you cannot have what you want until you are willing to take the First Step .
This requires giving up all excuses or “ reasons ” for not having what you want .
It also means no longer identifying with or attempting to justify your “ victim ” status .
Once a Loser is able to do this , he will automatically move up into a Non-Winner category .
As a Non-Winner , it now becomes possible to practice and eventually master the necessary skills to become a Winner .
In my next post I ’ll give you the starting point to becoming a Winner .
To your Success , Cristiana Martinez

Fox is trying to slow the arrival of its DVDs in low - cost rental kiosks run by Redbox , the studio said Wednesday .
Redbox , a unit of Coinstar Inc. , rents DVDs for just $ 1 a night , which some studios believe is contributing to the slumping DVD sales market .
Studio revenue from disc sales to retailers and rental outlets is due to fall by about $ 850 million to $ 12.9 billion this year , according to Adams Media Research .

If you have n't been lucky enough to preview the upcoming Xbox Live dashboard update like we did , there 's a good chance you 're eagerly awaiting its August 11 release so that you can finally modify your Netflix queue straight from the box .
If so , prepare to be disappointed ... or , uh , thrilled when you find out that the new experience is n't quite as comprehensive as you might have expected .
It restricts users to perusing the Top 50 films in any of a handful of categories , meaning no searching by title and no browsing alphabetically .
Why ?
According to Microsoft's Ben Smith , Director of Program Management for Xbox Live , that 's how you want it .
He says : " I think when people come to Xbox they 're not really looking so much for functional , they really want to have fun , they want to be wowed . "
We 're saying " wow , " all right , but for entirely different reasons .
There is a morsel of good news , though : if enough people indicate they actually like function and want an honest - to - goodness , full - featured Netflix experience Microsoft is fully prepared to upgrade the service .
Again .
Eventually .
The stereotype , of course , is a dog walker .
This is the person we expect to stumble across a dead body , to check its pulse and report the discovery to the police .
They appear in the story – be it fictional or real – for a fleeting moment ; we rarely get to know their name or face .
Their feelings flit past unexplored .
By the time they exit the narrative , we have moved on to details of the victim , to interviews with loved ones , rumours of prime suspects .
We rarely consider the impact of finding a body .
As criminal profiler David Canter says , this usually depends on the condition of the body and whether it has any relevance to its finder : " Many dead bodies that are not mutilated look quite waxwork - like , so are not especially disturbing , but if body parts are found , that can be more traumatic . "
The condition of the face is important , too , as is whether or not the genitalia is exposed .
" I think for everyone it is a dead child that is the most disturbing . "
Hanna Green , coordinator of Victim Support in Lambeth , a London borough with one of the highest murder rates in the capital , says the person who stumbles on a body is as likely to need support as the family of a murder victim .
" They are more likely to experience shock as a result of their discovery , " she says .
And this takes many different forms .
While , for some , the horror lasts a few seconds , others are haunted for years .
Trevor Saunders : Discovered Gemma Adams , the first victim of the Ipswich Serial Killer to be found
It was an unusually sunny morning in December 2006 and I was on my rounds as a volunteer fisheries warden .
I was checking for blockages in Belstead Brook , a gully that runs into the river Orwell , and remember thinking how pleasant it was to hear the birds singing after days of rain .
Then I noticed something alien protruding from the water .
Moving closer , I brushed some dirt away and thought it may be a mannequin .
I touched the shape ; it was freezing cold .
I wondered if it was a human being , but I could n't see a head because it was covered with debris .
When I shifted it , I realised I had found a dead body .
I now think of her as Gemma [ Adams , the first victim of Ipswich serial killer Steve Wright to be discovered ] .
The body was face down , with the arms outstretched and bent at the elbows .
It had been in the water for at least two weeks , which had slowed down decomposition , and I am grateful for that .
Her face was on its side , her eyes were half open .
She just looked like a normal person .
Having read about the missing women in the papers , I wondered if this was one of them .
When I lifted away the debris , a small globule of dried blood drifted past .
That really stuck in my mind .
I dialled 999 and then called my boss .
The police came in 15 minutes .
I pointed to where I had found the body and they asked me to stay away while they got up to their knees in mud to reach her .
Then the circus started .
There must have been at least half a dozen police cars , plus motorbikes and the press .
They set up a portable toilet and a catering van .
I was there all day .
I was the only member of the public allowed at the spot , because I had to show people around the lakes and the area .
They used my caravan as an office .
It was comforting to be part of the investigation , and it was night - time before they took Gemma away .
It was a relief to me that she was now safe and dry .
I am glad I found her because it kick - started the police to finding the other women .
And also I feel that from that moment Gemma was at peace .
The following night I had a dream .
I was at the brook and Gemma was there .
She turned to me and said , " Thank you . "
In fact , for the first few nights afterwards I could n't sleep without having a flashback to the moment I 'd found her .
I 'm a very emotional person , even more so since this happened .
I could n't help thinking over and over , " What makes a person do something like that ? "
The police put me in touch with Victim Support , and it was enough for me just to talk to them on the phone .
I am normally chirpy , but those who knew me saw I was depressed .
No one can understand what it feels like unless it has happened to them .
When it came close to the first anniversary , I bought Gemma a buddleia and planted it in her name by the brook .
I visit every day .
I feel like I know her ; she 's part of my life .
It 's as though she is a friend , a very strong bond .
As soon as a photo of Gemma comes on the TV , I find myself crying .
Ken Jiggins : Discovered the bodies in the ' Essex Boys ' murders
It was a freezing cold morning in December 1995 and I had gone to help my friend Pete feed the birds at his farm in Essex .
We were driving along a track when we saw a parked Range Rover , and .
I went to see if it could be moved because it was blocking access to the fields .
As I came closer , I saw two men in the front and thought , " Bloody hell , they are n't half big . "
The driver had one hand on the wheel and one on the gear lever , and the passenger was looking out the front with a mobile phone in his hand .
From the nose up they looked normal .
But the lower halves of their faces were shot off , flesh and blood hanging down like beards .
I banged on the window and got no response , and I thought , " Oh Christ ! " I said to Pete , " They 've both been shot and they 're both dead . "
Pete came over , looked and said , " There 's one in the back as well . "
There was no blood on the windscreen , the upholstery or anywhere else in that motor , which seemed strange .
I called the police and they arrived shortly afterwards .
I said to one , " I hope you have a strong stomach , because you 're going to need it . "
While they were examining the scene , we went to feed the pheasants .
We were n't in shock .
I did n't even feel a rush of adrenaline .
We had done our duty , having stumbled across something that had nothing to do with us .
At the time the IRA were quite lively , and we did n't know if it was a contract killing , but I was n't going to get my fingerprints on the motor .
We could have been in the frame for it because we were there and we owned shotguns .
The dead men turned out to be drug dealers named Tony Tucker , Craig Rolfe and Patrick Tate .
Two men were convicted of all three murders .
It 's strange because the experience lasts only a few seconds .
The police offered me counselling , but I 'd seen pictures of dead bodies in the paper – I would rather it was me who found them than one of these old dears who walk their dogs down that lane .
Although I would n't want to experience that again , it 's not like finding a child or a woman .
That would have affected me , as it would anyone .
But it looked like a contract killing .
Clinical – the doors had been shut afterwards .
They did n't deserve it , nobody does , but it happens .
All I could think was , " Somebody is going to have a very bad Christmas . "
John Tucker : Discovered a drowned woman 's body in a river
It was 7 am , a crisp , autumnal day in 2008 , and I was walking my dogs about two miles from Carmarthen .
I was heading along an old railway line that runs parallel to a river , and the water was flowing swiftly .
Then I saw it : the body of a woman in shallow water , partially clothed .
I could n't see if she had been injured , because I did n't want to get too close – I was afraid of contaminating the area .
Initially I felt a sense of inquisitiveness and excitement .
I walked this same route every day , and was very familiar with the surroundings , so I was not quite sure what I was looking at .
I did n't feel any real panic when I realised I was in the company of a dead body , but I did feel an adrenaline rush .
I had a couple of minutes to weigh up exactly what I had discovered , and how she might have got there , before I called the police .
While waiting for them to arrive , I had time to reflect .
I had no sense of fear , but felt sorrow for the individual and her family , and for the futility of it all .
After I had dealt with the police , I felt undertones of guilt , but I do n't know why .
I do n't think I suffered any post - incident stress .
I gave evidence at the inquest , and that brought back memories of discovering her , but perhaps the formality of the day suppressed the emotional aspects .
The woman died as a result of drowning , and the coroner recorded an open verdict , saying there was not enough evidence to suggest suicide .
The police offered me support , and their handling of my involvement in the case was exemplary .
I realise that I have been through something most people will never experience , but it touched me for less than an hour .
What 's awful is that the family of the deceased will live with it for ever .
Abigail Stepnitz : found a head in a bin in San Francisco
Abigail Stepnitz : ‘ I was terrified that the murderer might be around . ’
Photograph : Kalpesh Lathigra
I was a social worker in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco , an area notorious for its high numbers of homeless people and drug users .
One sunny day in March 2005 I was asked to accompany some colleagues on a trip to the park with a group of pre-school kids .
The children were playing happily when I heard a commotion on a street corner near a large trash can .
As I approached , a small group of homeless men ran away .
It was a day when everyone had just got their general assistance cheque [ the equivalent of a benefits payment ] and was spending it on their poison of choice .
I thought they must be high or drunk .
I heard rattling noises coming from the trash can and decided to look inside in case a person was trapped in there .
It was probably just rats , I thought .
But as I peered in I saw a severed head perched on a pile of rotting food .
My first thought was , " We ca n't let the kids walk back this way . "
I was terrified at the thought that the rest of the body – or , indeed , the murderer – might be around somewhere .
I do n't think the head had been in there for long .
It was a man 's face , lying on its side , its long blond hair mingling with the rotting chicken , sour milk and nappies .
I could n't tell if he had been beaten to death because , like him , most homeless people in that area have cuts and bruises on their faces , and teeth that are falling out .
I said something like , " Jesus fucking Christ " and put the lid down .
I was just a couple of steps from the sidewalk and I ran on to it .
I panicked .
I called the police , and warned the childcare centre not to take the kids anywhere near the area .
These cops do n't care – they police a park where the popular way of getting rid of homeless people is to douse them in gasoline and set them on fire .
I searched the local papers for any mention of the murder , but found nothing .
I followed it up with the police , but did n't hear back .
I was worried we might have a body - hacking serial killer on the loose .
They did n't seem to care .
I never found out who he was , and if I were to make a list of my 10 worst experiences , this probably would n't be on it .
In some ways , it is actually more distressing to step over the people still suffering on those streets , the ones you see lying in their own blood .
THE ABSENCE OF TRUST
Good evening and thank you for having me here tonight .
Thanks also to Tim for those kind words of welcome .
I think this is the first time that someone who has delivered the alternative MacTaggart has graduated - if that ’s the right word - to the real thing .
So I am both proud and honoured to be paving the way for Ant and Dec , who should be standing here tonight in 2018 if this trend continues .
Of course I ’m flattered to be asked , but I am also a little worried .
Does this finally mark my invitation to join the British broadcasting establishment ?
While that thought does terrify me , I am comforted in the knowledge that after my remarks my membership will have been a brief one …
And it also occurred to me that I qualified for the invitation only after I gave up my executive role at Sky .
I now spend most of my time engaged in other parts of the world and other parts of the media industry .
Perhaps that means I am regarded as being safely at a bit of a distance .
But I do welcome the opportunity to talk to you all about the media in the UK - and a slight distancing might help .
You can be the judges of that .
When we gather as an industry , it ’s natural for us to talk about the future .
I ’d like to do something different tonight : to turn our focus firmly to the present .
Because the path we are already on is a dangerous one .
In particular , what I want to discuss is our digital present that is right here - it has been here for a while , in fact .
A digital present that ought to compel us to make some urgent choices about where we want to go as an industry and as a society : choices which , I will argue tonight , we are currently either avoiding or mishandling .
It ’s easy to lose sight of how digital we already are .
The inescapable thing about the present is that everything in it is already digital .
Even if part of the consumption of media remains in the analogue world - opening a newspaper or a book , going to see a film in a cinema - the production of those creative works is already wholly digital , and the proportion that is consumed by digital means is growing all the time .
So talking about a coming digital future , or a digital transformation , is to ignore the evidence that it has already happened .
Why do I think we are getting this wrong ?
Why do I believe we need to change direction as a matter of urgency ?
It ’s quite simple .
Because we have analogue attitudes in a digital age .
We have business models and a policy framework based on spectrum scarcity .
We have limited choice , and we have central planning .
The result is lost opportunities for enterprise , free choice and commercial investment .
If we recognise that truth and change in the right way , the opportunities and benefits for all of us and - more importantly - for consumers and society are powerful and attractive .
We know we have to change : the digital present is forcing us to make urgent choices .
First , the velocity of the transformation of our industry has radically increased .
You know this and I do n’t need to dwell on it .
Second , in this rapidly changing world the boundaries between media have broken down .
People consume content in a very fluid way , and that is reflected in the way we provide it .
What were once separate forms of communication , or separate media , are now increasingly interconnected and exchangeable .
So we no longer have a TV market , a newspaper market , a publishing market .
We have , indisputably , an all - media market .
Third , the boundaries of what we mean by media are themselves expanding .
In Japan , you can now buy your granny a mobile phone called a ‘ raku raku ’ - which means ‘ easy easy ’ - designed specifically for the elderly .
It has a built - in pedometer to track how many steps she is taking each day .
And you can set that so that it sends a daily e-mail to your inbox , letting you know your granny is still up and about and getting the right amount of exercise .
There might be an advertisement attached .
Is that media ?
Or health - care provision ?
Or is it both ?
This all sounds like a dynamic , exciting , thriving sector to be part of .
Moving faster , being more interconnected , expanding its scope .
And in some ways it is .
But the present is not as great as we tell ourselves .
You do n’t need to scratch the surface very hard to see that opportunities for media businesses are limited , investment and innovation are constrained , and creativity is reduced .
This is bad for customers and society .
This year is the 150th anniversary of Darwin ’s The Origin of Species .
It argued that the most dramatic evolutionary changes can occur through an entirely natural process .
Darwin proved that evolution is unmanaged .
These views were an enormous challenge to Victorian religious orthodoxy .
They remain a provocation to many people today .
The number who reject Darwin and cling to the concept of creationism is substantial .
And it crops up in some surprising places .
For example , right here in the broadcasting sector in the UK .
The consensus appears to be that creationism - the belief in a managed process with an omniscient authority - is the only way to achieve successful outcomes .
There is general agreement that the natural operation of the market is inadequate , and that a better outcome can be achieved through the wisdom and activity of governments and regulators .
This creationist approach is similar to the industrial planning which went out of fashion in other sectors in the 1970s .
It failed then .
It ’s failing now .
When I say this I feel like a crazy relative who everyone is a little embarrassed by and for sure is not to be taken too seriously .
But tonight you have invited me to join the party and I am going to have a crack at persuading you that we ca n’t go on like this .
Tonight I will argue that while creationism may provide a comfortable illusion of certainty in the short - term , its harmful effects are real and they are significant .
Creationism penalises the poorest in our society with regressive taxes and policies - like the licence fee and digital switchover ;
It promotes inefficient infrastructure in the shape of digital terrestrial television ;
It creates unaccountable institutions - like the BBC Trust , Channel 4 and Ofcom ;
And now , in the all - media marketplace , it threatens significant damage to important spheres of human enterprise and endeavour - the provision of independent news , investment in professional journalism , and the innovation and growth of the creative industries .
We are on the wrong path - but we can find the right one .
The right path is all about trusting and empowering consumers .
It is about embracing private enterprise and profit as a driver of investment , innovation and independence .
And the dramatic reduction of the activities of the state in our sector .
If we do take that better way , then we - all of us in this room and in our wider industry - will make a genuine contribution to a better - informed society ; one in which trust in people and their freedom to choose is central to the way we behave .
Often the unique position that the business of ideas enjoys in a free society is used as a justification for greater intrusion and control .
On the contrary , its very specialness demands an unusual and vigorous… stillness .
Let ’s explore the role of creationism in our sector by asking a few basic questions .
First question .
How do the authorities currently approach intervening in and regulating the media industries ?
With relish , is the answer .
In the past five years Ofcom launched nearly 450 consultations - nearly two every week .
It has produced three Public Service Broadcasting annual reports , and two Public Service Broadcasting reviews in five phases .
These alone have in total - including appendices , special reports and other related material - amounted to over five thousand pages and spawned another 18,000 pages of responses .
And those reports have been only a small proportion of the total activity by the regulator .
For any of you who missed them this has included science fiction - a report on ‘ Entertainment in the UK in 2028 ’ , and the no doubt vital guide on ‘ How to Download ’ , which teenagers across the land could barely have survived without .
Second question .
Is it rational for the authorities to try to manage the media industry in this way ?
Not at all .
The study of evolution reminds us that it is very difficult to predict the outcomes of events .
Interventions can have unforeseen consequences , even when dealing with organisations or marketplaces which seem very easy to understand .
Witness the international banana market .
In the 1950s the banana export industry faced a problem : the then dominant Gros Michel - or ‘ Big Mike ’ - variety was being wiped out by a fungus called Panama Disease .
The industry took the decision to replace the entire world export crop with a supposedly disease - resistant variety called the Cavendish banana - the one we eat today .
Unfortunately it now appears that these bananas may themselves be vulnerable to a different kind of Panama Disease .
Since Cavendish bananas are genetically identical sterile clones , they cannot build up any resistance .
There are important lessons here : attempts to manage natural diversity have unpredictable consequences and are more likely than not to fail over the long - term .
Talking of bananas brings me neatly to our own authorities and their interventions in the all - media marketplace .
Some of these looked , even without the benefit of hindsight , pretty difficult to justify at the time .
To use an example I am familiar with , take the decision of the European Commission to require the broadcasting rights to Premier League football to be divided up so that no one company could buy all the rights .
The consequences of that move were predictable enough : customers having to pay more for the same thing because they ’d need two subscriptions .
However , in defiance of common sense , the Commission apparently believed that prices would instead fall .
Here , the repeated assertion by Ofcom of its bias against intervention is becoming impossible to believe in the face of so much evidence of the exact opposite .
A radical reorientation of the regulatory approach is necessary if dynamism and innovation is going to be central to the UK media industry .
The discipline required is to contemplate intervention only on the evidence of actual and serious harm to the interests of consumers : not merely because a regulator armed with a set of prejudices and a spreadsheet believes that a bit of tinkering here and there could make the world a better place .
Third question .
What do the results of these interventions actually look like ?
Let ’s judge by results .
According to the authorities - and I paraphrase - we should have a diverse broadcasting ecology with many PSB providers ; a BBC that is not too dominant ; growing investment in content of high quality ; and high levels of UK production .
Now I invite you to take a look around you .
Decades of ever - increasing planning and intervention have produced very different outcomes .
The BBC is dominant .
Other organisations might rise and fall but the BBC ’s income is guaranteed and growing .
In stark contrast , the other terrestrial networks are struggling .
Channel 4 has cut its programme budget by 10 % , Five by 25 % .
Spending on original British children ’s programming has fallen by nearly 40 % since 2004 , including , inexplicably , a 21 % fall at the BBC at a time when the Corporation has been able to spend £ 100 m a year out - bidding commercial channels for US programming - a figure which has increased by a quarter in the past two years .
The problems of the terrestrial broadcasters are not about the economic downturn , although it has thrown the issue into sharp relief .
It is not a coincidence that Google has a higher percentage of advertising spending in the UK than anywhere else in the world : it is a consequence of a tightly restricted commercial television sector .
That money will not come back .
It is not that ad - funded television is dead : it is just a permanently smaller fish in a bigger pond .
Fourth question .
Is this creationism good for investment ?
No .
A heavily regulated environment with a large public sector crowds out the opportunity for profit , hinders the creation of new jobs , and dampens innovation in our sector .
We do n’t even have the basics in place to protect creative work .
Whether it ’s shoplifting at HMV or pirating the same movie online , theft is theft .
They are both crimes and should be treated accordingly .
The government dithers - dimly aware of what it has to do but afraid to do it .
The investment climate in media in the UK reminds me of Tolstoy ’s dictum that all happy families resemble one another , while each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way .
True , none of the markets I have experience of is completely happy , but there are things to welcome - the regulatory professionalism of Germany , the growth opportunities of India - even France outdoes us in its robust defence of intellectual property .
The problem with the UK is that it is unhappy in every way : it ’s the Addams family of world media .
If such determined efforts to manage the marketplace are failing , it might be useful to look at alternative approaches .
One such approach might be to trust people .
Consider Dutch traffic engineer Hans Monderman - who discovered that reducing the amount of signs and traffic markings in towns and villages does not make roads more dangerous , as you might imagine .
On the contrary , people drive more safely and there are fewer accidents .
As Monderman said : “ If you treat drivers like idiots , they act as idiots .
Never treat anyone in the public realm as an idiot , always assume they have intelligence . ”
In contrast , the authorities in the UK and their clients : those dependent agencies , entities and enterprises , which one way or the other have been made to rely on the largesse of the state - have refused to trust the people who matter - the people who pay the bills as customers and as tax - payers .
Indeed , the defining characteristic of the UK broadcasting consensus is the absence of trust .
Yet there is an example right on our doorstep of the positive developments that come about when we encourage a world of trust and free choice .
Within the next few months , the number of homes in the UK that enjoy some form of television that they freely choose to pay for will top fifty percent .
This steady growth of choice - driven television has nothing to do with public policy .
In fact , the authorities have consistently favoured so called free - to - air broadcasting .
Yet , as you might expect , people who are used to paying for films , books , internet access and other quality content , do not see anything strange in paying for quality television too .
When pay - television began in this country , it did so largely by providing programmes in genres which public service broadcasting served inadequately : such as 24 - hour news , and a broad choice of sport and the latest films .
As originally with news and sport , so now with the arts and drama .
Sky now offers four dedicated arts channels .
Original commissioning by channels that customers choose to pay for is expanding and will continue to do so , not just from Sky but from the likes of National Geographic , History , MTV and the Disney Channel , to name a few .
Sky alone now invests over £ 1 billion a year in UK content .
And it is this sector which has delivered so many innovations : from multichannel television in the first place , to the launch of digital , personal video recorders , high definition and soon 3D TV in the home .
All this - despite the dampening effect of a massive state - funded intervention which reduces the scope for programme investment and commissioning from independent production companies by private broadcasters .
That is a major missed opportunity for the creative industries .
And yet the authorities in the UK continue to seek more control and greater intervention .
There are many examples .
First , the amount of detailed content regulation in UK broadcasting is astonishing .
Two or three times a month , Ofcom publishes a Broadcasting Bulletin - a recent version weighed in at 119 pages .
Adjudications included judgments on whether it is fair to describe Middlesbrough as the worst place to live in the UK ; and 20 pages on whether a BBC documentary on climate change was fair to two of the participants .
Every year , roughly half - a- million words are being devoted to telling broadcasters what they can and cannot say .
Next , the UK and EU regulatory system also tightly controls advertising : the amount of advertising per hour , the availability of product placement , the distinction between advertising and editorial and so forth .
These rules often seem to have little connection with protecting people from real harm .
As an example , Star Plus - one of News Corp ’s Hindi language entertainment channels - has been unable to show in the UK the Indian version of ‘ Are you smarter than a ten - year old ? ’ because the logo of an Indian mobile phone company , which does not even operate in this country , appears on the set .
What exactly are they afraid of ?
Excessive regulation can also have more serious consequences .
The latest EU - inspired rules on scheduling of advertising restrict the number of ad breaks permitted in news programming .
Television news is already a tough enough business .
If implemented , these proposals could undermine the commercial viability of news broadcasting even further .
In addition , the system is concerned with imposing what it calls impartiality in broadcast news .
It should hardly be necessary to point out that the mere selection of stories and their place in the running order is itself a process full of unacknowledged partiality .
The effect of the system is not to curb bias - bias is present in all news media - but simply to disguise it .
We should be honest about this : it is an impingement on freedom of speech and on the right of people to choose what kind of news to watch .
How in an all - media marketplace can we justify this degree of control in one place and not in others ?
Content control , advertising regulation and restrictions on freedom of speech .
We have been brought up in this system .
It probably seems as natural and inevitable as rainfall .
But is it really necessary ?
Is there no alternative ?
Other areas of the media have been able to get by without it .
There is a strong alternative tradition with at least four centuries behind it - first of pamphlets and books , later of magazines and newspapers .
From the broadsides of the Levellers , to the thundering 19th century Times , to The Sun fighting for the rights of veterans today - it is a tradition of free comment , of investigative reporting , of satirizing and exposing the behaviour of one ’s betters .
Yes , the free press is fairly near the knuckle on occasion - it is noisy , disrespectful , raucous and quite capable of affronting people - it is frequently the despair of judges and it gets up the noses of politicians on a regular basis .
But it is driven by the daily demand and choices of millions of people .
It has had the profits to enable it to be fearless and independent .
Great journalism does not get enough credit in our society , but it holds the powerful to account and plays a vital part in a functioning democracy .
Would we welcome a world in which The Times was told by the government how much religious coverage it had to carry ?
In which there were a state newspaper with more money than the rest of the sector put together and 50 % of the market ?
In which cinemas were instructed how many ads they were allowed to put before the main feature ?
In which Bloomsbury had to publish an equal number of pro-capitalist and pro-socialist books ?
And , of course , we had to pay for an Ofpress to make sure all these rules were observed ?
No , of course we would not .
So why do we continue to assume that this approach is appropriate for broadcasting : especially as one communications medium is now barely distinguishable from another ?
There is a word for this .
It ’s not one that the system likes to hear , but let ’s be honest : the right word is authoritarianism and it has always been part of our system .
It is hardly a secret that the early years of British broadcasting were dominated by concern about the potential of the new technology for creating social disruption .
To deal with that perceived threat , there were two responses : to nationalise broadcasting through the BBC , and to ensure that any other provider was closely controlled and appropriately incentivised .
The greatest divergence between the rest of the media and broadcasting is the unspoken approach to the customer .
In the regulated world of Public Service Broadcasting the customer does not exist : he or she is a passive creature - a viewer - in need of protection .
In other parts of the media world - including pay television and newspapers - the customer is just that : someone whose very freedom to choose makes them important .
And because they have power they are treated with great seriousness and respect , as people who are perfectly capable of making informed judgements about what to buy , read , and go and see .
The all - media world offers great opportunities for our society .
We could take the approach of trust and freedom and apply it through the whole of the media , broadcasting included .
But we are doing the opposite .
We are using the interconnectedness of the media as a way of opening the door to the expansion of control .
This is already happening .
There is a land - grab , pure and simple , going on - and in the interests of a free society it should be sternly resisted .
The land grab is spear - headed by the BBC .
The scale and scope of its current activities and future ambitions is chilling .
Being funded by a universal hypothecated tax , the BBC feels empowered and obliged to try and offer something for everyone , even in areas well served by the market .
This whole approach is based on a mistaken view of the rationale behind state intervention and it produces bizarre and perverse outcomes .
Rather than concentrating on areas where the market is not delivering , the BBC seeks to compete head - on for audiences with commercial providers to try and shore up support - or more accurately dampen opposition - to a compulsory licence fee .
Take Radio 2 as an example .
A few years back , the BBC observed that it was losing share of listening among the 25 - 45 age - group , who were well served by commercial stations .
Instead of stepping back and allowing the market to do its job , the BBC decided to reposition Radio 2 to go after this same group .
Performers like Jonathan Ross were recruited on salaries no commercial competitor could afford , and audiences for Radio 2 have grown steadily as a result .
No doubt the BBC celebrates the fact that it now has well over half of all radio listening .
But the consequent impoverishment of the once - successful commercial sector is testament to the Corporation ’s inability to distinguish between what is good for it , and what is good for the country .
Of course , this problem is compounded by the fact that there is no real oversight of this £ 4.6 billion intervention in the market , as the abysmal record of the BBC Trust demonstrates .
So the breadth of intervention is striking and it is continuing to expand unchecked .
The negative consequences of this expansion for innovation and development in the creative industries are serious .
The nationalisation of the Lonely Planet travel guide business was a particularly egregious example of the expansion of the state into providing magazines and websites on a commercial basis .
It stood out for its overt recklessness and for the total failure of the BBC Trust to ask tough questions about what management was up to .
Others in other sectors can tell similar stories : and they observe that if the BBC suffers any setback in expansion , it is merely temporary : there will soon be another initiative requiring yet more management time to fight off .
As new entrants like Joost discovered , operating alongside the BBC , without access to its content or cross-promotional power , is not a task for the faint hearted .
You need deep pockets , sheer bloody - mindedness and an army of lawyers just to make the BBC Trust sit up and pay attention .
Most importantly , in this all - media marketplace , the expansion of state - sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision , which are so important for our democracy .
Dumping free , state - sponsored news on the market makes it incredibly difficult for journalism to flourish on the internet .
Yet it is essential for the future of independent digital journalism that a fair price can be charged for news to people who value it .
We seem to have decided as a society to let independence and plurality wither .
To let the BBC throttle the news market and then get bigger to compensate .
Most policy - making is however pre-occupied with the supposed malign intervention of capitalists focused on profit , and is blind to the growth of the state .
Nearly all local authorities already publish their own newspapers with flattering accounts of their doings .
Over 60 % of these pocket - Pravdas carry advertising , weakening the local presence of more critical voices .
I saw recently an article in which the editor of the Guardian suggested that the government should fund local news coverage of court proceedings and council meetings , a profoundly undemocratic and ruinous idea .
Just ask yourself whether Camilla Cavendish ’s award - winning campaign to open up the family courts would have occurred in a state - funded newspaper ?
The investigation would never have been allowed to take place .
For hundreds of years people have fought for the right to publish what they think .
Yet today the threat to independent news provision is serious and imminent .
More broadly , it must serve as a warning of what happens when state intervention and regulatory micro-management are allowed to go unchecked in the all - media marketplace .
For the future health of our industry and our society , we must not allow these creationist tendencies to go on limiting the opportunities for independent commercial businesses , whether in journalism or any other form of content .
The private sector is a source of investment , talent , creativity and innovation in UK media .
But it will never fulfil its full potential unless we adopt a policy framework that recognises the centrality of commercial incentives .
This means accepting the simple truth that the ability to generate a profitable return is fundamental to the continuation of the quality , plurality and independence that we value so highly .
For that to happen our politicians and regulators need to have the courage to leave behind their analogue attitudes and choose a path for the digital present .
So far , they have shown little inclination to do so .
Thanks to Darwin we understand that the evolution of a successful species is an unmanaged process .
I have tried to show tonight that interventionist management of what is sometimes called the broadcasting ecology is not helping it - it is exhausting it .
Broadcasting is now part of a single all - media market .
It brings two very different stories to that bigger market .
On the one hand authoritarianism : endless intervention , regulation and control .
On the other , the free part of the market where success has been achieved by a determined resistance to the constant efforts of the authorities to interfere .
I have argued tonight that this success is based on a very simple principle : trust people .
People are very good at making choices : choices about what media to consume ; whether to pay for it and how much ; what they think is acceptable to watch , read and hear ; and the result of their billions of choices is that good companies survive , prosper , and proliferate .
That is a great story and it has been powerfully positive for our society .
But we are not learning from that .
Governments and regulators are wonderfully crafted machines for mission creep .
For them , the abolition of media boundaries is a trumpet call to expansion : to do more , regulate more , control more .
Sixty years ago George Orwell published 1984 .
Its message is more relevant now than ever .
As Orwell foretold , to let the state enjoy a near - monopoly of information is to guarantee manipulation and distortion .
We must have a plurality of voices and they must be independent .
Yet we have a system in which state - sponsored media - the BBC in particular - grow ever more dominant .
That process has to be reversed .
If we are to have that state sponsorship at all , then it is fundamental to the health of the creative industries , independent production , and professional journalism that it exists on a far , far smaller scale .
Above all we must have genuine independence in news media .
Genuine independence is a rare thing .
No amount of governance in the form of committees , regulators , trusts or advisory bodies is truly sufficient as a guarantor of independence .
In fact , they curb speech .
On the contrary , independence is characterised by the absence of the apparatus of supervision and dependency .
Independence of faction , industrial or political .
Independence of subsidy , gift and patronage .
Independence is sustained by true accountability - the accountability owed to customers .
People who buy the newspapers , open the application , decide to take out the television subscription - people who deliberately and willingly choose a service which they value .
And people value honest , fearless , and above all independent news coverage that challenges the consensus .
There is an inescapable conclusion that we must reach if we are to have a better society .
The only reliable , durable , and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit .
I hope Patrick felt as good as his expression suggests … his wound looks awful in this vivid image .
He was painted propped up in a bed at Mount Pleasant Hospital in Washington DC in January 1863 shortly before his discharge from Army service .
It had been about 4 months since he ’d been shot through the head at the Battle of Antietam .
There , a Confederate minie ball had bored through the top of his skull and exited from the back , leaving gruesome - looking wounds , but surprisingly little long - term damage .
Private Hughes ’ story offers some small insight into Civil War medicine and gives me a chance to give the soldier and his unit a little air time .
I found two Patrick Hughes in the Federal Census of 1860 for New York City , both laborers born in Ireland , so it seems reasonable to expect that was our soldier ’s background .
I do n’t know when he enlisted in Company K of the 4th New York Infantry , but do know he and the Regiment joined General French ’s Third Division of Edwin Sumner ’s Second Army Corps , Army of the Potomac immediately before the battle of Antietam .
They had previously seen only non-combat duty .
So Patrick and his mates were still combat rookies when they crested the rise overlooking the sunken road at the far side of the Roulette Farm at about 9 in the morning of 17 September .
The 4th New York were at the left front of the Division in line of battle , and were among the first to run into the concentrated fire of the North Carolina regiments of Anderson ’s Brigade , hunkered down in the natural trench of that road .
It was probably there that Patrick Hughes was shot .
Although dazed and in shock , bleeding heavily from the scalp , he dragged himself to the rear and received first aid from the regiment ’s surgeon , Dr. George W Lovejoy , who reported his “ patient was conscious and answered questions rationally . ”
He was then carried to a barn in Keedysville .
He lay there until 20 September , when he was moved to a hospital in Hagerstown .
Otherwise very detailed , his medical history mentions no treatment in those first few days after the battle .
Few men survived a serious head wound like his , so he may simply have been expected to die , and not been due any special treatment .
But he was still alive and recovering on 25 September when he was again moved , this time to the Mount Pleasant Hospital in Washington DC .
On arrival , Assistant Surgeon Thomas Carroll , in charge of his case , reported :
The general condition of the patient was good ; suppuration had commenced ; no febrile action existed , the pulse was regular , sleep not materially disturbed , mind clear and manifesting no signs of compression of the brain , or inflammation of its membranes .
Little , if any , change was perceptible for several days , when the swelling of the scalp and tissues subsided , leaving a prominence nearly , if not altogether , one inch in height , and two and a half or three inches in length of brain substance , in which the pulsation of the arteries could be distinctly observed …
By December , hospital director C. A. McCall , ( Assistant Surgeon , USA ) noted Private Hughes
… was able to sit up and walk about the ward , and was never afterwards much confined to bed .
This protuberance now began to subside , and was soon reduced nearly to a level with the skull ; numerous pieces of bone were removed as they became detached from the tissues , leaving a complete channel in the cranium from the point where the ball entered to where it emerged .
He was discharged from the army on 26 January 1863 and went to Newcastle , Delaware on a disability pension of four dollars a month .
In 1869 it was doubled to $ 8 , when the examining physician , Dr Maull declared him totally disabled , though Hughes later worked as a “ paddler ” in an iron foundry , a physically demanding occupation .
We have some fine follow - up information from a pair of Philadelphia doctors who examined Patrick in December 1870 , just over 8 years after Antietam , They observed that
His memory is quite good , but by no means so good as before the injury .
He is rather easily bothered and confused , and more irritable than formerly .
The sight of his right eye , he thinks , is poor .
Whisky affects him as usual .
Sexual power undiminished .
He has no paralysis .
The wound of entrance is marked by a slight depression in the bone , the wound of exit by a hollow two and a half by two inches , and one inch deep .
No bone has closed this opening , but the scalp and hair dip down into the hollow .
The arterial pulsations are barely perceptible .
Remarkably , they had a photograph made of the back of their patient ’s head .
It ’s been preserved in this etching which clearly shows the permanent damage to his skull .
____________
Private Patrick ’s Hughes ’ unit was the Fourth Regiment , New York State Volunteers .
One of the first units organized at the outset of the Civil War , most of the men were recruited in New York City proper , except for Company E , from Brooklyn .
The 4th were nicknamed the First Scott Life Guard in honor of hero - General Winfield Scott , and began their Federal service in early May 1861 for a term of two years .
The regiment was on rear - echelon duty at Newport News ( Va – June and July 1861 ) , around Baltimore ( Md – to June 1862 ) , and at Suffolk ( Va – to September ) before seeing their first action on the Maryland Campaign .
They were in combat again at Fredericksburg in December , and were present , though not engaged , at Chancellorsville in May 1863 .
The troops mustered out and were honorably discharged May 25 , 1863 at New York City at the end of their agreed - upon term of service .
Phisterer ’s chart shows the regiment ’s losses in action :
Not as fortunate as Private Hughes , two officers of the Fourth were killed at Antietam .
These are research subjects for a future project , surely , but here ’s what I have on them as a first look :
CAPTAIN JOHN S. DOWNS , killed September 17 , 1862 , in action at Antietam ,
Md. Age 32 years ; enrolled April 22 , 1861 , at New York city to serve two years ; appointed First Lieutenant , Company G , April 25 , 1861 ; mustered in as such , May 7 , 1861 ; as Captain , Company B , May 26 , 1861 ( vice Captain May , resigned ) .
SECOND LIEUTENANT HENRY K. CHAPMAN , died September 17 , 1862 , of wounds received in action at Antietam , Md. Age 32 years ; enrolled April 22 , 1861 , at New York City to serve two years ; mustered in as First Sergeant , Company B , May 9 , 1861 ; as Second Lieutenant , December 7 , 1861 ( vice Lieutenant Thornton , promoted ) ; transferred to Company C , August 15 , 1862 .
Another person of further research interest , the Regimental Surgeon at Antietam , was
GEORGE W. LOVEJOY , age ?
years ; enrolled May 27 , 1861 , at New York City
to serve two years ; mustered in as Assistant Surgeon , May 27 , 1861 ; promoted
Surgeon , June 14 , 1862 ( vice Surgeon Wainwright , discharged ) ; mustered out with regiment , May 25 , 1863 , at New York City ;

Shortly before the patient 's discharge from Mount Pleasant , an excellent picture of the aspect of the injury at that time was made in water color , under the direction of Surgeon J. H. Brinton , U. S. V. , who was then in charge of the Division of Surgical Records of the Surgeon General 's Office , and had secured the services of an artist , Mr. Stanch [ sic ] , whose admirable drawing and coloring have furnished some of the best illustrations of this book .
The figure on the right of the chrome - lithograph opposite [ second image from top of this post ] is a good copy of Mr. Stanch 's water - color drawing [ opening painting ] .

Enlarge By Danny Johnston , AP National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare chief Barbara Kennelly talks with Larry McFarlin of Fort Smith , Ark. , after a town hall meeting on Social Security in Little Rock in 2005 .
WASHINGTON  Millions of older people face shrinking Social Security checks next year , the first time in a generation that payments would not rise .
The trustees who oversee Social Security are projecting there wo n't be a cost of living adjustment ( COLA ) for the next two years .
That has n't happened since automatic increases were adopted in 1975 .
By law , Social Security benefits can not go down .
Nevertheless , monthly payments would drop for millions of people in the Medicare prescription drug program because the premiums , which often are deducted from Social Security payments , are scheduled to go up slightly .
" I will promise you , they count on that COLA , " said Barbara Kennelly , a former Democratic congresswoman from Connecticut who now heads the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare .
" To some people , it might not be a big deal .
But to seniors , especially with their health care costs , it is a big deal . "
Cost of living adjustments are pegged to inflation , which has been negative this year , largely because energy prices are below 2008 levels .
Advocates say older people still face higher prices because they spend a disproportionate amount of their income on health care , where costs rise faster than inflation .
Many also have suffered from declining home values and shrinking stock portfolios just as they are relying on those assets for income .
" For many elderly , they do n't feel that inflation is low because their expenses are still going up , " said David Certner , legislative policy director for AARP .
" Anyone who has savings and investments has seen some serious losses . "
About 50 million retired and disabled Americans receive Social Security benefits .
The average monthly benefit for retirees is $ 1,153 this year .
All beneficiaries received a 5.8 % increase in January , the largest since 1982 .
More than 32 million people are in the Medicare prescription drug program .
Average monthly premiums are set to go from $ 28 this year to $ 30 next year , though they vary by plan .
About 6 million people in the program have premiums deducted from their monthly Social Security payments , according to the Social Security Administration .
Millions of people with Medicare Part B coverage for doctors ' visits also have their premiums deducted from Social Security payments .
Part B premiums are expected to rise as well .
But under the law , the increase cannot be larger than the increase in Social Security benefits for most recipients .
There is no such hold - harmless provision for drug premiums .
Kennelly 's group wants Congress to increase Social Security benefits next year , even though the formula does n't call for it .
She would like to see either a 1 % increase in monthly payments or a one - time payment of $ 150 .
The cost of a one - time payment , a little less than $ 8 billion , could be covered by increasing the amount of income subjected to Social Security taxes , Kennelly said .
Workers only pay Social Security taxes on the first $ 106,800 of income , a limit that rises each year with the average national wage .
But the limit only increases if monthly benefits increase .
Critics argue that Social Security recipients should n't get an increase when inflation is negative .
They note that recipients got a big increase in January — after energy prices had started to fall .
They also note that Social Security recipients received one - time $ 250 payments in the spring as part of the government 's economic stimulus package .
Consumer prices are down from 2008 levels , giving Social Security recipients more purchasing power , even if their benefits stay the same , said Andrew G. Biggs , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington think tank .
" Seniors may perceive that they are being hurt because there is no COLA , but they are in fact not getting hurt , " Biggs said .
" Congress has to be able to tell people they are not getting everything they want . "
Social Security is also facing long - term financial problems .
The retirement program is projected to start paying out more money than it receives in 2016 .
Without changes , the retirement fund will be depleted in 2037 , according to the Social Security trustees ' annual report this year .
President Obama has said he would like tackle Social Security next year , after Congress finishes work on health care , climate change and new financial regulations .
Lawmakers are preoccupied by health care , making it difficult to address other tough issues .
Advocates for older people hope their efforts will get a boost in October , when the Social Security Administration officially announces that there will not be an increase in benefits next year .
" I think a lot of seniors do not know what 's coming down the pike , and I believe that when they hear that , they 're going to be upset , " said Sen.
Bernie Sanders , an independent from Vermont who is working on a proposal for one - time payments for Social Security recipients .
" It is my view that seniors are going to need help this year , and it would not be acceptable for Congress to simply turn its back , " he said .

New Zealanders are being laid off in growing numbers by Australian employers , new figures suggest .
Nearly 21,000 Kiwis have lost their jobs over the ditch in the past 12 months , research by The Australian newspaper shows .
The figures indicate that English - speaking migrants , mainly from New Zealand , are most likely to lose their jobs even though Australia is not officially in a recession .
The newspaper said its research had found employers were laying off workers on a last - on , first - off basis .
Migrants who claimed most of the jobs at the top of the boom when there were acute skills shortages were now in the firing line suggesting skilled New Zealand workers who arrived recently might now be out of a job .
The number of New Zealanders moving to Australia has also slowed .
Latest figures show about 1000 fewer long - term migrants arrived from New Zealand each month than they did a year ago .
As of June 30 , 2008 , there were an estimated 521,200 New Zealand citizens in Australia .
The Australian said the number of New Zealanders employed in Australia 's workforce had dropped by 20,800 to 304,100 in the year to May .
Full - time New Zealand - born workers across the Tasman dropped by 11,000 to 236,700 , while part - time workers dropped by 9800 to 67,400 .
However , there are some discrepancies in the newspaper 's unsourced data when compared with figures provided by the Australian Immigration Department .
The department did not have figures beyond 2008 for New Zealanders in the labour market and said comparisons were difficult .
But on its website it said New Zealanders working in Australia had an unemployment rate of 4 per cent in June last year , slightly less than the rate for Australian workers .
The Australian said New Zealanders ' unemployment rate had jumped to 7 per cent .
It did not break down in what areas of the workforce New Zealanders had been hardest hit .
An Australian Immigration Department spokeswoman said she did not know the basis of calculations but that , where New Zealand was concerned , it was hard to assess data because its citizens were not counted as part of Australia 's annual migration programme .
They are instead included in settler arrival and net overseas migration figures when arriving or leaving for more than 12 months .
In the 2007 - 08 financial year , 49,200 New Zealand citizens moved to Australia as permanent and long - term arrivals , an increase of 19.4 per cent on the previous year .
The spokeswoman said 6600 of those were professionals or associate professionals ; 4600 were advanced or intermediate clerks , sales people , personal service workers or production and transport workers ; 2300 were tradespeople ; and 2100 managers or administrators .
The rest included students , children and retirees .
LADDER TOPPLES
Zoheb Azvi's career as a corporate lawyer in Australia was just starting to take off .
After finishing law school and working in Wellington for 18 months he moved to Sydney in 2007 to be with his girlfriend .
The job market was " booming " and he nailed a position with one of the city 's top law firms within a few weeks .
Life was good for the 27 - year - old .
He was climbing the career ladder and , this year , married his girlfriend .
Then it all started to unravel .
Work at the law firm began to dry up and rumours began circulating that job cuts were on the way .
" Even though the job cuts were expected , it still comes as a shock when it happens to you , " he said of his redundancy in May .
And it was not a case of last on , first off a senior associate with 15 years ' experience was also given the boot .
Mr Razvi had since applied for about 15 jobs in Sydney without luck and , with help from his wife and his redundancy package , has given himself another two months before it is crunch time .
Then he will start applying for jobs in other parts of Australia and overseas .
" It is frustrating , but you 've got to understand the reality there are so many applicants out there .
It 's survival of the fittest .
I am a confident guy so it 's just a matter of being patient . "

On his FNC show The O’Reilly Factor last night , host Bill O’Reilly went after Jon Stewart when The Daily Show host used a segment Wednesday night to illustrate FNC ’s ever changing opinion of protesters to make the claim that FNC has gone liberal .
This joke set O’Reilly on the attack as he went on to claim that Stewart was playing to his liberal audience .
Here is the original The Daily Show video :
Here is the video from O’Reilly :
Advertisements
O’Reilly said , “ I like Jon Stewart .
He ’s a clever guy usually not mean spirited , and puts on an entertaining program , but last night Stewart went off the rails , deriding Fox News for its coverage of the healthcare controversy , so I your humble correspondent , feel it necessary this evening to set Stewart straight .
Let ’s begin with the set up , Stewart told his viewers that Fox News has become liberal because we defend legitimate protesters on the heathcare front . ”
O’Reilly claimed that he was taken out of context by Stewart .
He continued , “ But to be fair Jon , you ’re a satirist , you have the license to distort , but everyone should know what you are doing and why , 45 % of The Daily Show audience is liberal , according to a Pew Research study .
The biggest liberal percentage on TV in that study , so in order to retain his viewers Stewart has to play to them . ”
O’Reilly then went on to take Stewart out of context on The Daily Show saying that he gets paid to cheap shot people .
O’Reilly summed up his view of Stewart , “ He continues to dance down the liberal yellow brick road , mocking folks who might call out far left orthodoxy , and actually protest a liberal president ’s policy .
Again , I like Stewart , but some young people actually believe he ’s presenting an accurate picture of the country on his program , and that is frightening . ”
It is ironic that Bill O’Reilly would complain about being taken out of context when he makes his living showing edited clips that take people out of context .
I guess Bill - O only defends legitimate protesters , which he considers to be anyone who protests against Obama .
It is no big secret that Stewart ’s audience is young , and younger people tend to be more liberal , so O’Reilly is exactly breaking any news about Stewart ’s audience .
Notice how O’Reilly goes back to the standard argument against Stewart that his audience is young and misinformed .
If they would only watch networks like FNC , or listen to Rush , they would really know what is going on in America .
What really ticked O’Reilly off is that Stewart showed what a hypocrite he really is , and Bill O’Reilly can’t stand being confronted with his own hypocrisy .
The ISS , seen here after the recent STS - 127 shuttle mission , is nearing completion : what have gotten , and what will we get , from the investment into it ?
( credit : NASA )
The ISS : a very expensive education Within the space industry few projects have be the subject of more scorn and derision than the International Space Station .
It has been accused of what may be the greatest cost overruns in the history of US government contracting , from an original estimate of $ 8 billion in 1984 to over $ 100 billion today .
The benefits in science and medicine that were supposed to flow down to Earth have been slow in coming — to put it charitably — and there is no sign that the station has played the role in earth science that some of its supporters claimed it would have .
Thanks to the Marshall Institute ’s National Security Space Project ’s publication of Presidential Decisions : NSC Documents , we now have , in one convenient book , all of the most significant unclassified papers on US executive branch space policy .
So it ’s fairly easy to compare what was written in the high - level planning documents with what actually happened .
Seen for the perspective of 2009 the station is just barely beginning to fulfill some of the goals laid out 15 years ago .
In August 1984 the Reagan White House team wrote , “ NASA will develop a permanently manned Space Station within a decade .
The development of a civil space station will further the goals of space leadership and the peaceful exploration and use of space for the benefit of all mankind .
The Space Station will enhance the development of the commercial potential of space .
It will facilitate scientific research in space .
It will also , in the longer term , serve as the basis for future major civil and commercial activities to explore and exploit space . ”
Seen for the perspective of 2009 the station is just barely beginning to fulfill some of these goals .
There is no plan and little hope that it will serve as a base for future trips beyond low Earth orbit ( LEO ) ; the decision to put it in an orbit that could be reached from Russia ’s launch facilities in Kazakhstan effectively killed that possibility .
By serving as a destination for the first “ space tourists ” it has helped create a new industrial sector that was undreamt of by 1984 ’s officialdom .
It has slowly begun to serve as a world - class laboratory and as long as it can maintain a six - person full - time crew , the scientific information derived from work done on the station will only grow in importance .
It has also certainly given the US the lead role in building and funding a major international space project .
In 1993 the station came within a single vote of being cancelled along with the Superconducting Supercollider .
As Senator Barbara Milulski ( quoted in Donald Beattie ’s book “ ISScapades ” ) wrote at time , “ The mood of the Congress with respect to space is tenuous .
With respect to the space station it is downright cranky . ”
Yet the station survived , justified in part by the Clinton administration ’s desire to reach out to Russia .
When the first element was launched by Russia in November 1998 , the program was still deeply troubled , but it was at least underway .
By the standards of most space programs the five years between the ’ 93 decision to go ahead with the program and the arrival on orbit of the first elements was lightning fast .
NASA had done more than $ 11 billion worth of preparatory work under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , but it was Bill Clinton who made the final decision and who got to see “ his ” station put into orbit .
His successor , George W. Bush , saw no reason to make any major changes , though budget cuts forced the cancellation of the US Crew Rescue Vehicle ( CRV ) and the US hab module .
Other elements , such as Node 3 and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer , were once threatened but are now going to be part of the complex .
Was this worth it ?
The ISS was unlike any construction project ever attempted .
The only thing comparable was the ill - fated Soviet Mir Space Station .
So far building the station has required 130 spacewalks and hundreds , maybe thousands , of hours of robotic work .
It may be that never again will anyone build a large structure in space using so much human labor .
On the other hand , there are limits to what robots can do by themselves .
This will depend largely on what one wants to build .
The experience gained with the ISS will influence decisions on space construction projects for many decades to come .
If the US and its partners do decide to go ahead and build the Lunar Outpost , the expertise gained building the ISS will influence what mix of robotic and human activity will be needed , as well as how to handle the mission control side of things .
Of course private space facilities , such as those planned by Bigelow Aerospace will benefit from this body of knowledge .
There is no question that the debate over the wisdom of the whole space station project will go on for years , well beyond the lifetime of the actual existing station .
As part of the Vision for Space Exploration the station ’s use by NASA was going to limited to helping to future trips to the Moon and eventually Mars .
The 2005 decision to designate the US part a “ National Laboratory ” changed this .
It opened the way for the ISS to be used for research by non-NASA parts of the federal government and by private industry .
It is too early to see any results , but there is at least a glimmer of optimism within the space industry that this may lead to something resembling true commercialization .
There is no question that the debate over the wisdom of the whole space station project will go on for years , well beyond the lifetime of the actual existing station .
This is perfectly normal : argument is one of those things that makes us human .
No one should be surprised when space industry people , who are in truth , no different from any other crowd of homo sapiens , indulge themselves in it .
Meanwhile , the ISS orbits overhead and we on Earth can occasionally get a glimpse of it .
The thing is the only one in existence for at least the next few years , until Bigelow or perhaps the Chinese get the ones they are working on up there .
If all goes well the station will be more of less complete in January or February next year when STS - 130 delivers Node 3 and the Cupola ; the missions after that will be essentially devoted to moving the last bits of furniture into place .
It has cost at least $ 100 billion , enough to run a small war for a few weeks .
The value of the program , like any government project that costs this much , will only be known a long time in the future .
Even then the historians will be going at each other since they are , after all , far better at quarreling than even NASA and its critics .

Father : Henderson cop had relationship with teen sister - in - law Luke Morrison , who fatally shot an ice cream truck driver , is on paid leave
Henderson Police Press Conference On Thursday , Feb. 21 , 2008 , Chief Richard Perkins of the Henderson police department , held a press conference to address the shooting of 42 - year - old Deshira Selimaj by police officer Luke Morrison .
A Henderson police officer is being accused of carrying on an inappropriate relationship with his sister - in - law since she was 15 , according to court documents filed by the girl ’s father .
The officer , Luke Morrison , 24 , is the same officer who shot and killed an ice cream truck driver in 2008 after a traffic stop .
Morrison and other officers said the woman driving the truck threatened them and one of her children with a knife , and though some witnesses disputed aspects of their account , a Clark County coroner ’s jury ruled the shooting was justified .
Morrison has been on paid administrative leave for four weeks , pending the outcome of a Henderson Police Internal Affairs investigation .
Officials with the department and the city declined to discuss the nature of the investigation .
Acting Human Resources Director Fred Horvath said today there has been no change in Morrison 's employment status and that a review scheduled for this week has been postponed .
Clark County Family
Court records show that Morrison ’s father - in - law applied for a temporary protective order in April , asking the court to keep Morrison away from his daughter , then 17 and now 18 .
A judge declined to issue the order , ruling that there was no evidence of domestic violence to justify doing so .
Neither Morrison nor his father - in - law could be reached for comment .
In the application for the temporary restraining order , the woman ’s father wrote that he became suspicious after he said his daughter skipped a day of school in March and then lied about her whereabouts .
In talking with family members , the father wrote that he learned his daughter had been observed leaving the house with Morrison in his vehicle or being dropped off at a friend ’s house , only to leave with Morrison moments later .
He said he began checking his daughter ’s cell phone records and discovered calls and texts between her and Morrison that dated back to 2007 , when his daughter was 15 or 16 years old .
Additionally , he said another family member found a text message on his daughter ’s phone after she left it at the family member ’s house , which came from Morrison ’s phone number and read : “ Good night , I love you . ”
Though his daughter ’s cell phone records stopped showing calls and messages with Morrison last year , the father wrote that another family member witnessed her using a second cell phone at school .
The father wrote that the situation made him “ sick to my stomach ” and that Henderson Police began investigating his claims after he brought them to the department ’s attention .

I 'm moved into Halifax but the moving company wo n't give me my things until next week !
So I have no scanner , here is a comic I made a couple weeks ago about Billy Bishop .
I find WWI / WWII air combat really interesting , because it was brand new and revolutionary , like how the longbow in the Hundred Years War is interesting .
If you look up how the designs of planes rapidly grew stronger during the war ( mostly because opposite sides would steal each other 's designs and improve on them ) , you wo n't be disappointed .
As interesting as it is to read , however , you really will find it hard not to be struck by how many lives this new weapon could take , with every ' victory ' meaning another plane down .
Small numbers compared to ground units , but still .
One of my favorite stories that I 've told many times has to do with WWII air combat .
I used to work in an aviation museum , and one day I was browsing the library when I read about the Soldier , which I wish I had .
Flying aces were a big thing at one time , long before Top Gun ruined everything .
They were a new kind of hero and they were daring and exciting .
We all know who the Red Baron is , every Canadian knows who Billy Bishop is .
So if you were a hero , that 's great .
Heck , it 's glamorous .
But if you were n't , it could be a totally different story .
War had been around since forever by this point , of course .
Injured soldiers were n't rare .
If you lost an arm or a leg or an eye , people had seen that before .
But if you were a pilot who went down , and you lived , your face might have been burnt off .
People were n't ready for that .
So on one hand you have the glamorous Ace , and on the other , a man who decides that his family should be informed that he died because he figures , it is just as well , he can't bear to let them see him .
The surgeon Archibald McIndoe is responsible for a lot of the pioneering treatments for rehabilitating burn injuries , beginning with the injured air crews of the RAF and other Allied forces .
His patients at his unit in East Grinstead gave themselves the nickname ' the Guinea Pig Club , ' because of the experimental nature of the procedures .
But it was a big step , because before this , there was almost nothing for an injury like that .
I cannot imagine what it is like to be given your face back .
The town of East Grinstead made the wounded pilots welcome , did n't stare , and let them feel like themselves again .
The Guinea Pig Club still meets every year , and like the War Amps , they still work with burn victims .
I think the story is a wonderful one , because too often - in this case and in many others - history only pays attention to the Aces .

Updates to Team Fortress 2 and Day of Defeat : Source have been released .
The updates will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted .
The specific changes include :
IT IS high season for a sliver of sand in Portage , Indiana .
A pretty visitors ' centre sells ice cream .
Lake Michigan shimmers in the sun .
And beside the beach is a roaring steel mill .
Swimmers enter the water at their own risk .
The Great Lakes — Michigan , Huron , Erie , Ontario and Longfellow 's “ shining Big- Sea - Water ” , Lake Superior — comprise one - fifth of the world 's surface fresh water .
They have also endured centuries of abuse .
But advocates are cheerful these days .
Barack Obama 's budget proposes $ 475 m for restoration .
In June he appointed a Great Lakes tsar , Cameron Davis , to begin work in July .
There is much to do .
Exploitation began in the 17th century .
In 1634 a Frenchman arrived on a lake 's shore wearing a mandarin robe , hoping to find Cathay .
He found Wisconsin .
Despite such disappointments , the lakes drove fast growth .
They sped the shipment of furs , then timber , iron , grain and coal .
For decades industrial plants have lined the shores , using water as a coolant .
All this activity has taken a toll : 40 years ago this month the Cuyahoga river , which empties into Lake Erie , caught fire .
The 1970s brought reform , such as the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that sought to restore the lakes ' “ chemical , physical and biological integrity ” .
But problems remain .
Sewage systems continue to overflow , forcing many beaches to close .
Levels of some toxins in fish have declined , but others pose new risks .
Atlantic freighters still bring in foreign species — there are now 185 .
Regulations are tangled .
In 2007 a refinery in Indiana received a permit to increase discharges into Lake Michigan .
Only public uproar prevented it .
Better co-ordination would help .
The Great Lakes region includes two Canadian provinces ( Ontario and Quebec ) and eight American states — Minnesota , Wisconsin , Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania and New York .
A report in 2003 counted 148 federal and 51 state programmes to restore the lakes .
The region 's many swing states ensure periodic attention .
In 2004 George Bush ordered a broad restoration plan to be drawn up .
Implementing it would cost more than $ 20 billion .
Little money , however , has been provided .
It is still unclear who is in charge .
This may begin to change .
On June 13th the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , announced that a treaty governing the waters between America and Canada would be updated .
Mr Obama's $ 475 m would be the largest single investment of any president yet .
Mr Davis , a respected advocate , may bring order to disjointed programmes .
Just as promising , restoration is increasingly seen as an economic boon , not a drain .
The Brookings Institution , a think - tank , found that spending $ 26 billion to clean the lakes would bring benefits of at least $ 80 billion .
As manufacturing dwindles , the lakes may attract new firms and workers .
Chicago 's twinkling lakefront has been an important draw , a taste of the Mediterranean in the Midwest .
Indiana 's shore is still lined with steel plants and refineries .
But Portage 's beach , which opened last year , is the first step in an effort to reclaim the lakefront .
The new plans are a nudge in the right direction .
Critics of President Obama ’s push for health care reform have been whipping up fear that proposed changes will destroy our “ world ’s best ” medical system and make it like supposedly inferior systems elsewhere .
The emptiness of those claims became apparent recently when researchers from the Urban Institute released a report analyzing studies that have compared the clinical effectiveness and quality of care in the United States with the care dispensed in other advanced nations .
They found a mixed bag , with the United States doing better in some areas , like cancer care , and worse in others , like preventing deaths from treatable and preventable conditions .
The bottom line was unmistakable .
The analysts found no support for the claim routinely made by politicians that American health care is the best in the world and no hard evidence of any particular area in which American health care is truly exceptional .
The American health care system puts patients at greater risk of harm from medical or surgical errors than patients elsewhere and ranks behind the top countries in extending the lives of the elderly .
It has a mixed record on preventive care  above average in vaccinating seniors against the flu , below average in vaccinating children  and a mixed record of caring for chronic and acute conditions .

Kauna -Â MR Baldwin Umunna , a retired NIPOST staff is currently battling to save the life of his son , Kenneth , who was allegedly tortured to a state of coma by the Special Police Squad in Kaduna .
An eyewitness , who pleaded anonymity , said Kenneth allegedly fought with his co-tenant , Mr Monday Igwe on August 16 , over an undisclosed issue .
It was learnt that the landlord , one Alhaji Ahmadu Gari , invited the Police after efforts to separate his two tenants failed .
â€ œIgwe and Umunna carried dangerous weapons but they never used such on themselves , â€ the eyewitness said .
When contacted , the landlord said that he had to invite the police because of the dangerous weapons his tenants were brandishing .
â€ œAll I did was to invite the police because Umunna threatened to burn down my house and he had earlier threatened my life but that case is already in court .
I never asked the police to beat Umunna .
I was only trying to protect my property , â€ Gari said .
In his own account , Igwe said that he never used any dangerous weapon on Umanna , yet the police came and picked them to Gabasawa Police Station in the city .
According to Igwe , â€ œthis is not the first time Kenneth and I have engaged in a fight , but no one was wounded because we never used weapons on each other .
We were invited by the Police and when we got there , they asked me to make a statement .
I did that and later I bailed my self with N2,000 and I left for church .
â€ œI never knew what happened to Umunna until now that you people came to tell me , â€  Igwe added .

" This is a real photo of a soap bubble bursting .
I 've made slight edits to raise colour and light , but this is just to add some punch .
This is not a Photoshop creation , " he said .
I work with Ruby every single day , and over time have come to really enjoy using it .
Here 's a list of some specific things that I really like about Ruby .
Some of them are obvious , and some are shared with other languages .
The purpose is to share things I like about Ruby , not to compare and contrast with any specific language .
1. Dynamic Typing
There are very good things about statically typed languages , such as compile - time verifiability and IDE support .
However , in my experience , dynamic typing really helps get projects bootstrapped and smooths along changes , especially in the early to middle stages of a project .
I 'm very happy that I do n't need to create a formal interface for my new objects to implement simply to enable me to easily swap out that class for another later on .
2. Duck Typing
This is effectively just an extension of Dynamic Typing .
In Ruby , methods that expect to be able to operate on String objects do n't do checks for is_a ? ( String ) .
They check whether the object respond_to ? ( : to_str ) and then calls to_str on the Object if it does .
Similarly , objects that represent Paths in Ruby can implement a to_path method to provide the path representation .
In Rails , we use this technique for objects that have " model " characteristics by expecting them to respond_to ? ( : to_model ) .
This allows us to support any object in relevant contexts , provided those objects can supply us with a " model " representation of themselves .
3. Awesome Modules
Ruby provides a language feature similar to " traits " in Scala , Squeak , and Perl .
Effectively , Ruby modules allow the dynamic addition of new elements of the class hierarchy at runtime .
The use of super is dynamically evaluated at runtime to take into consideration any modules that might have been added , making it easy to extend functionality on a superclass as many times as desired , without being forced to decide where super will land at class declaration time .
Additionally , Ruby modules provide the lifecycle hooks append_features and included , which make it possible to use modules robustly to isolate extensions from one another and to dynamically extend classes on the basis of feature inclusion .
4. Class Bodies Are n't Special
In Ruby , class bodies are n't a special context .
They 're simply a context where self points at the class object .
If you 've used Rails , you 've probably seen code like this :
class Comment < ActiveRecord :: Base validates_presence_of : post_id end
It may look like validates_presence_of is a language feature , but it 's actually a method being called on Comment that is provided by ActiveRecord : : Base .
That method can execute arbitrary code , also in the context of the class , including creating new methods , executing other pieces of code , or updating a class instance variable .
Unlike Java annotations , which must be run at compile - time , Ruby class bodies can take runtime information into consideration , such as dynamically supplied options or the results of evaluating other code .
5. String Eval
This is likely a heresy .
I 'm not referring to arbitrary runtime String eval here , but rather String eval that is used to create methods early in the boot process of a Ruby application .
This can make it possible to take Ruby - defined structures , like Rails routes or AOP - definitions , and compile them into Ruby methods .
Of course , it is possible to implement these things as add - ons to other languages , but Ruby makes it possible to implement these sorts of things in pure Ruby .
It is , to a large degree , a self - hosting language .
6. Blocks and Lambdas
I 've said this a few times and I 'll repeat myself : I do n't consider languages without anonymous lambdas to be powerful enough for me to use day - to - day .
These constructs are actually extremely common , and found in languages as diverse as Ruby , JavaScript , Scala , Clojure , and of course Lisp .
They make it possible to implement block - scoped constructs that look like language features .
The most common example usage is for File operations .
In languages without lambdas , users are forced to use an inline " ensure " block every in the same lexical scope that they originally opened the file in , to ensure that the resource is closed .
In Java :
static void run( String in ) throws FileNotFoundException { File input = new File ( in ) ; String line ; Scanner reader = null ; try { reader = new Scanner ( input ) ; while ( reader.hasNextLine ( ) ) { System.out.println(reader.nextLine ( ) ) ; } } finally { reader.close ( ) ; } }
Among other things , the Java version needs to wrap the creation of the Scanner in a try block so it can be guaranteed to be closed .
In contrast , the Ruby version :
def run( input ) File.open ( input , " r " ) do |f| f.each_line { |line| puts line } end end
Because of the existence of blocks , it is possible to abstract away the need to close the File in a single location , minimizing programmer error and reducing duplication .
7. Combo Attack : Self - Hosting Language
The combination of several of the above features produce real - life examples of ways that we can " extend " the Ruby language in Rails .
Consider the following :
respond_to do | format| if @user.save flash [ : notice ] =
' User was successfully created . ' format.html { redirect_to( @user ) } format.xml { render : xml => @user , : status =>ted , : location => @user } else format .
html { render : action => " new " } format.xml { render :xml => @user.errors , :status => :unprocessable_entity } end end
In this case , we 're able to seamlessly mix methods ( respond_to ) with normal Ruby code ( if and else ) to produce a new block - scoped construct .
Ruby 's semantics for blocks allow us to return or yield from inside the block , further blending the boundaries of the code - block and language constructs like if or while .
In Rails 3 , we introduced :
class PeopleController < ApplicationController respond_to : html , :xml , : json def index @people = Person. find ( : all ) respond_with ( @people ) end end
Here , respond_to is provided at the class - level .
It tells Rails that respond_with ( in index ) should accept HTML , XML , or JSON as response formats .
If the user asked for a different format , we automatically return a 406 error ( Not Acceptable ) .
If you dig in a bit deeper , you can see that the respond_to method is defined as :
def respond_to( * mimes ) options = mimes.extract_options !
only_actions = Array ( options.delete( :only ) ) except_actions = Array( options.delete( : except ) ) mimes.each do |mime| mime = mime.to_sym mimes_for_respond_to[mime ] = { } mimes_for_respond_to[mime ] [ :only ] = only_actions unless only_actions.empty ? mimes_for_respond_to[mime ] [ : except ] = except_actions unless except_actions.empty ?
end end
This method is defined on the ActionController : : MimeResponds : : ClassMethods module , which is pulled into ActionController : : Base .
Additionally , mimes_for_respond_to is defined using class_inheritable_reader in the included lifecycle hook for the module .
The class_inheritable_reader method ( macro ? ) uses class_eval to add methods onto the class in question to emulate the built - in attr_accessor functionality .
Understanding all of the details is n't important .
What 's important is that using the Ruby features we described above , it 's possible to create layers of abstraction that can appear to add features to the Ruby language .
A developer looking at ActionController : : MimeResponds need not understand how class_inheritable_reader works -- he just needs to understand the basic functionality .
And a developer looking at the API documentation need not understand how the class - level respond_to is implemented -- she just needs to understand the provided functionality .
With that said , peeling back each layer leads to simple abstractions that build on other abstractions .
There 's no need to peel back the whole curtain at once .
8. Nice Literals
I often forget about this when programming in Ruby , only to crash back down to earth when using a language with fewer , less expressive literals .
Ruby has literals for just about everything :
Strings : single - line , double - line , interpolated
Numbers : binary , octal , decimal , hex
Null : nil
Boolean : true , false
Arrays : [ 1,2 ] , %w ( each word is element )
Hashes : {key => value} and in Ruby 1.9 {key : value}
Regular expressions : / hello / , %r{hello / path} , %r{hello#{interpolated}}
Symbols : : name and :" weird string "
Block : { block literal }
And I think I 'm missing some .
While it may seem academic , good , readable literals can increase the programmer 's ability to write short but extremely expressive code .
It 's of course possible to achieve the same sorts of things as you can with literal Hashes by instantiating a new Hash object and pushing the keys and values on one at a time , but it reduces their utility as method parameters , for instance .
The terseness of the Hash literal has allowed Ruby programmers to effectively add a limited keyword argument feature to the language without having to get approval by the language designers .
Yet another small example of self - hosting .
9. Everything is an Object , and All Code is Executed and Has a self
I showed this to some degree earlier , but a lot of the reason that Class bodies work the way they do is a consequence of the unfailing object orientation of the Ruby language .
Inside of a class body , Ruby is simply executing code with a self pointing at the class .
Additionally , nothing is special about the class context ; it is possible to evaluate code in a class ' context from any location .
Consider :
module Util def self.evaluate ( klass ) klass.
class_eval do def hello puts " #{self} says Hello ! " end end end end class PersonName < String Util.evaluate( self )
end
This is exactly equivalent to :
class PersonName < String def hello puts " #{self} says Hello ! " end end
By removing the artificial boundaries between code in different locations , Ruby reduces the conceptual overhead of creating abstractions .
And this is the result of a strong , consistent object model .
One more example on this topic .
This idiom is quite common in Ruby : possibly_nil && possibly_nil.method_name .
Since nil is just an object in Ruby , sending it a message it does not understand will result in a NoMethodError .
Some developers suggested the following syntax : possibly_nil.try ( : method_name ) .
This can be implemented in Ruby as follows :
class Object alias_method : try , : __send__ end class NilClass def try nil end end
Essentially , this adds the method try to every Object .
When the Object is nil , try simply returns nil .
When the object is not nil , try just calls the method in question .
Using targeted application of Ruby 's open classes , combined with the fact that everything in Ruby , including nil , is an object , we were able to create a new Ruby feature .
Again , this is n't such a big deal , but it 's another case where the right choices in the language can allow us to create useful abstractions .
10 . Rack
I 'm going to cheat a little bit since Rack is n't part of the Ruby language , but it does demonstrate some useful things about it .
First of all , the Rack library only hit 1.0 earlier this year , and already every single Ruby web framework is Rack compliant .
If you use a Ruby framework , you can be guaranteed that it uses Rack , and any standard Rack middleware will work .
This was all done without any backward compatibility sacrifices , a tribute to the flexibility of the Ruby language .
Rack itself also leverages Ruby features to do its work .
The Rack API looks like this :
Rack :: Builder.new do use Some :: Middleware , param use Some :: Other : : Middleware run Application end
In this brief code snippet , a number of things are at work .
First , a block is passed to Rack : : Builder .
Second , that block is evaluated in the context of a new instance of Rack : : Builder , which gives it access to the use and run methods .
Third , the parameter passed to use and run is a class literal , which in Ruby is a simple object .
This allows Rack to call passed_in_middleware.new ( app , param ) , where new is just a method call on the Class object Some : : Middleware .
And in case you think the code to implement that would be heinous , here it is :
class Rack :: Builder def initialize ( &block ) @ins = [ ] instance_eval ( &block ) if block_given ?
end def use ( middleware , * args , & block ) @ins << lambda { |app| middleware .
new ( app , * args , & block ) } end def run( app ) @ins << app #lambda { |nothing| app } end end
This is all that 's needed to implement the code I showed above the creates a new Rack application .
Instantiating the middleware chain is a simple affair as well :
def to_app inner_app = @ins.last @ins [ 0 ...- 1 ] . reverse_each { |app| inner_app = app.call( inner_app ) } inner_app end def call ( env ) to_app.call( env )
end
First , we take the last element from the chain , which is our endpoint .
We then loop over the remaining elements in reverse , instantiating each middleware with the next element in the chain , and return the resulting object .
Finally , we define a call method on the Builder , which is required by the Rack specifically , that calls to_app and passes the environment through , kicking off the chain .
Through the use of a number of the techniques described in the post , we were able to create a Rack - compliant application that supports Rack middleware in under two dozen lines of code .
CONSTITUTION IN EXILE , ... Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price : $ 0.10 Buy New $ 3.93 ( as of 04:40 EST - Details )
A line was drawn in the sand last week  a response by the Federal Government to the State of Tennessee and their assertion of sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution .
( Editors note : A similar response was sent to Montana Firearms licenses on 07 - 16-09 as well )
Part of a series of moves by states seeking to utilize the Tenth Amendment as a limit on Federal Power , the Tennessee State Senate approved Senate Bill 1610 ( SB1610 ) , the Tennesse Firearms Freedom Act , by a vote of 22 - 7 .
The House companion bill , HB1796 previously passed the House by a vote of 87- 1 .
Governor Breseden allowed the bill to become law without signing .
The law states that federal laws and regulations do not apply to personal firearms , firearm accessories , or ammunition that is manufactured in Tennessee and remains in Tennessee .
The limitation on federal law and regulation stated in this bill applies to a firearm , a firearm accessory , or ammunition that is manufactured using basic materials and that can be manufactured without the inclusion of any significant parts imported into this state . 
America Fights Back : A ... Workman , Dave Best Price : $ 4.48 Buy New $ 4.45 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
At the time of passage through the TN House and Senate , Judiciary Chairman Mae Beavers had this to say :
 Be it the federal government mandating changes in order for states to receive federal funds or the federal government telling us how to regulate commerce contained completely within this state  enough is enough .
Our founders fought too hard to ensure states  sovereignty and I am sick and tired of activist federal officials and judges sticking their noses where they dont belong . 
The Federal Government , by way of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms expressed its own view of the Tenth Amendment this week when it issued an open letter to all Tennessee Federal Firearms Licensees  in which it denounced the opinion of Beavers and the Tennessee legislature .
ATF assistant director Carson W. Carroll wrote that  Federal law supersedes the Act , and thus the ATF considers it meaningless .
Constitutional historian Kevin R.C. Gutzman sees this as something far removed from the founders vision of constitutional government :
 The letter says , in part , because the Act conflicts with Federal firearms laws and regulations , Federal law supersedes the Act , and all provisions of the Gun Control Act and the National Firearms Act , and their corresponding regulations , continue to apply . 
That is precisely what I predicted the Federal Governments response to the Tennessee act would be .
As I told Judge Andrew Napolitano on Fox Newss Glenn Beck Program on June 5 , 2009 , federal officials dont care about a good historical argument concerning the meaning of the Constitution . 

The rare , spherical planetary nebula was first spotted by an amateur astronomer last year but has been photographed in all its perfection for the first time
Astronomical objects generally do n't live up to their names , with constellations like Taurus or Aries bearing little resemblance to a bull or ram .
Blame ancient stargazers with overactive imaginations .
The same cannot be said for the recently discovered Soap Bubble Nebula , however .
A transparent , near - perfect sphere , it hangs in the night sky like a bubble floating on the wind .
It was first spotted by amateur astronomer Dave Jurasevich in California on 6 July 2008 , but it was n't until last month that the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona was able to capture the clear image above .
Officially known as PN G75.5+1.7 , the Soap Bubble is an example of a planetary nebula .
These are formed when the nuclear fusion reactions at the centre of a star can no longer support its structure .
External layers of the star are forced outwards , drifting through space for thousands of years .
These gases are ionised by ultraviolet light from the remaining core and glow , resulting in nebulae that take on a variety of shapes and sizes .
Most are elliptical or cigar - shaped , but the Soap Bubble Nebula is a rare sphere .
The label " planetary nebula " is another astronomical misnomer , as the objects are completely unrelated to planets .
The name originates from the 18th century , when telescopes were n't powerful enough to distinguish nebulae from gas giant planets .
Most famous of the gas giants is Jupiter , which also benefited from the vigilant observation of an amateur astronomer this week .
Australian Anthony Wesley discovered that a comet or asteroid had crashed into Jupiter , and emailed Nasa to let them know .

The FDIC head said she had no plans to ask for more funds at present
The number of problem US banks rose to the highest level in 15 years between April and June , the industry 's regulator has revealed .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) said 416 banks had failed its test criteria during the quarter , up 111 from January to March .
It added that 81 US banks had now been forced to close this year .
The FDIC judges banks on criteria such as the quality of their outstanding loans and the reserve funds they hold .
' Difficult process '
The regulator said that due to the large number of failed banks , its deposit insurance fund - which safeguards up to $ 250,000 ( £ 154,000 ) per personal bank account - had fallen by 20 % between April and June to $ 10.4bn ( £ 6.4bn ) .
While this was the lowest the fund has been since 1992 , FDIC chairman Sheila Bair said she had no plans as yet to ask the Treasury for more funds .
However , she said it was likely that banks would have to pay an additional fee to help replenish the fund .
Ms Bair said the banking industry " can look forward to better times ahead " .
" But for now , the difficult and necessary process of recognizing loan losses and cleaning up balance sheets continues to be reflected in the industry 's bottom line , " she added .

FRANKLIN FURNACE , Ohio 
The teenager in the padded smock sat in his solitary confinement cell here in this state ’s most secure juvenile prison and screamed obscenities .
The youth , Donald , a 16 - year - old , his eyes glassy from lack of sleep and a daily regimen of mood stabilizers , was serving a minimum of six months for breaking and entering .
Although he had received diagnoses for psychiatric illnesses , including bipolar disorder , a judge decided that Donald would get better care in the state correctional system than he could get anywhere in his county .
That was two years ago .
Donald ’s confinement has been repeatedly extended because of his violent outbursts .
This year he assaulted a guard here at the prison , the Ohio River Valley Juvenile Correctional Facility , and was charged anew , with assault .
His fists and forearms are striped with scars where he gouged himself with pencils and the bones of a bird he caught and dismembered .
As cash - starved states slash mental health programs in communities and schools , they are increasingly relying on the juvenile corrections system to handle a generation of young offenders with psychiatric disorders .
About two - thirds of the nation ’s juvenile inmates  who numbered 92,854 in 2006 , down from 107,000 in 1999  have at least one mental illness , according to surveys of youth prisons , and are more in need of therapy than punishment .

On cadence and collaboration
From : Mark Shuttleworth < mark - AT-ubuntu.com >
To : debian - project-AT-lists.debian.org
Subject : On cadence and collaboration Date : Wed , 05 Aug 2009 10:21:38 +0100
Hi folks I 've stayed quiet in this discussion , though several folks have invoked my name and ascribed motivations to me that were a little upsetting .
I 'm not responding to that here , instead I 'd like to focus on what we can achieve together , and how we can lead a very significant improvement in the health of the whole free software ecosystem .
Apologies in advance if this mail is lengthy and not particularly witty !
Imagine you are the leader of a key upstream component .
You care about your users , you want them to appreciate and love the software you write .
But you also know that most users wo n't get the code from you - your code will land in most users hands through one or other distribution - maybe RHEL , maybe Fedora , maybe Debian or Ubuntu or Gentoo .
And you can maintain a few personal relationships with distribution - space that help to straighten things out , but more often than not , users will get your code from a distribution with whom you have little contact .
To make things worse , at any given time , different distributions may be shipping wildly different versions of your code .
That makes all the bug reports harder to evaluate , and all the patches harder to apply .
It also makes it harder to know where to commit precious resources to stable version maintenance .
I hear this story all the time from upstreams .
" We 'd like to help distributions , but WHICH distribution should we pick ? "
That 's a very difficult proposition for upstreams .
They want to help , but they can't .
And they should n't have to pick favorites .
Adopting a broad pattern of cadence and collaboration between many distributions wo n't be a silver bullet for ALL of those problems , but it will go a very long way to simplifying the life of both upstreams and distribution maintainers .
If upstream knows , for example , that MANY distributions will be shipping a particular version of their code and supporting it for several years ( in fact , if they can sit down with those distributions and make suggestions as to which version would be best ! ) then they are more likely to be able to justify doing point releases with security fixes for that version ... which in turn makes it easier for the security teams and maintainers in the distribution .
We 're already seeing a growing trend towards cadence in free software , which I think is a wonderful move .
Here , we are talking about elevating that to something that the world has never seen in proprietary software ( and never will ) - an entire industry collaborating .
Collaboration is the primary tool we have in our battle with proprietary software , we should take the opportunities that present themselves to make that collaboration easier and more effective .
OK , so that 's the theory .
How do we get there ?
How do we get many distributions to sit down and explore the opportunities to agree on common base versions for major releases ?
Well , the first thing is to agree on the idea of a predictable cadence .
Although the big threads on this list are a little heartbreaking for me to watch , I 'm glad that there has n't been a lot of upset at the idea of a cadence in Debian so much as * which * cadence .
We can solve the latter , we could n't solve the former .
So I 'm happy at least at that :-)
The second thing is to find the opportunities that are most likely to be successful .
That depends as much on psychology and practical interaction as anything else .
As pointed out on this list , Debian and Ubuntu share a great deal .
We have largely common package names ( imagine what a difference that will make to practical discussions over IRC ;-) ) and we have established relationships between folks who care about most of the major components already .
We have lots of people with shared experience in both projects ( most of the strongest Ubuntu contributors are or have been very strong Debian contributors too , and many new Debian maintainers have come to the project through Ubuntu ) .
When I look over the commentary on debian - devel and in debbugs and on #debian - devel , I see a lot of familiar names from Ubuntu , especially on the deep , hard problems that need solving at the core .
I 'm proud of that .
So , practically , we would be in a good position to collaborate .
Psychologically , I do n't know so much .
Have you ever noticed how family disputes can be the most bitter ?
Or how neighboring countries that share the same food , the same dress , the same values , can often be the bitterest feuds ?
Some days I think that applies between us .
I see mails on this list saying it would be easier and better for Debian to coordinate with distributions that I think would be almost * impossible * to work with practically , but somehow they are more attractive because they are not family .
Perhaps we know each other too well .
It 's hard to be a prophet in your home town .
How do I think it could work in practice ?
Well , if Debian and Ubuntu went ahead with the summit in December , where we reviewed plans for 2010 and identified opportunities to collaborate , I think we would get ( a ) several other smaller distributions to participate , and ( b ) several upstreams to participate .
That would be a big win .
It would set us off on a good course .
If we delivered , then , we would virtually guarantee that almost all the distributions and key upstreams would participate the next time around .
And if * that * worked , we 'd win RHEL over too .
A December summit is not about tying anybody 's hands .
It 's about looking for opportunities , where they exist naturally , and communicating those more widely .
At the moment , if we happen to ship the same version , it 's partly an accident , and upstream does n't know about it till afterwards .
With an effort made on reviewing and thinking about it , we should get much better information and communicate much better .
Which is a win , right ?
So , I 'd like to address some of the comments and ideas expressed on this list recently .
First , there has been no secret cabal or skunkworks effort to influence Debian .
As best I can tell , folks from both Debian and Ubuntu who have deep insight into release management established a shared interest in working together better , at many levels , and this was one idea that came forward .
The fact that those discussions were open and ongoing was no secret - I would n't have talked about it in the media if it were !
( Ironically , someone suggested that the fact that I was talking publicly about something in Debian implied there was a secret cabal .
Aiieee . )
I have always tried to make sure that I speak regularly with the DPL - some DPL's have not responded to that at all , others have been happy to speak .
Steve and I have spoken about every quarter , which is great , and we focus those conversations on ways we can make collaboration better .
Finding teams we can introduce to one another .
Finding ways to communicate better .
This was again , one of the things that came up , as was the idea of a joint sprint on boot process , which was very successful .
In both cases , the individuals and teams concerned have a mandate from their organisations to think problems through and speak for the project .
Large organisations can't work any other way .
I was stunned when I saw the announcement of a " decision " because I know that Debian works by building steady consensus ( and by small groups who Just Do It now and then , but that wo n't work on something like this ) .
I had expected there would be more of a proposal for discussion .
As far as I can tell , that 's what happened at DebConf , but the announcement afterwards was abrupt .
A pity , because the discussions have been colored by the perception of an imposed decision , when they need n't have been .
Second , this is not about Debian changing to meet the needs of Ubuntu .
As I 've said elsewhere , Ubuntu would be happy to reach a compromise if needed to work with Debian and others .
I think there 's agreement on a two year cadence , and if needed we can change one of our cycles to help bring multiple distributions into line .
Alternatively , with Debian specifically , we can contribute resources to help Debian meet a stretch ( or squeeze ;- ) ) goal .
From my perspective , committing Canonical employees to help Debian freeze in December , or stretching our one cycle to get us both onto a two year cadence , are roughly the same .
It would be unreasonable to expect us to do BOTH of those , but I 'm happy to work one either basis .
Compromise requires some give from both parties , though .
But most importantly , this whole thing will have it 's best and biggest impact if it goes beyond Ubuntu and Debian .
The debate on this list has mostly been about " Ubuntu vs Debian " , which misses the real goal : let 's send a signal to upstreams that they can participate and help shape the way end users will experience their software .
To do that , we need to get multiple distributions .
And looking at it that way , a December summit gives us a much stronger ability to influence multiple distributions that are planning releases in 2010 .
Based on the feedback from the Debian release team that they liked the idea , I 've been reaching out to other distributions to try to get more of them together .
This gets much more powerful the more of them we bring to the same forum .
I 'm saddened that the aggressive tone of this debate has thrown the exercise into question - I think largely because of unfortunate communications after the discussions at DebConf .
C'est la vie .
Third , I think we need to call on the people who are not fundamentally prejudiced to speak out .
I see many mails on this list from people who are clearly absolutely certain in their minds that " Ubuntu is an evil thief of Debian 's work " .
I do n't see any way to change their minds .
No matter how many positive examples of effort made by Ubuntu folks to collaborate we find , they will always find examples that reinforce their view .
If that view dominates the discussion , we can never improve the situation , because that view says " do n't bother doing anything different , do n't look for opportunities to collaborate , do n't make any offer to compromise " .
How can we achieve anything from that basis ?
Debian is made up of hundreds of contributors , many stay silent .
I 'm saddened that the loudest voices seem to be those who are vociferous in their opposition to Ubuntu , rather than those who are finding ways to make things better .
I 'm saddened that a good idea - a sounder basis for collaboration , backed by real investment and effort - gets crushed on the rocks of hate from folks who do not make the bulk of the contribution .
It 's not hard to tell if someone is expressing an opinion based on prejudice or one based on openness .
Anyone who says , definitively , that a whole organisation or hundreds of people is " bad " , is making a generalisation that can only be harmful to relationships .
I enjoyed Linus Torvalds ' recent interview where he talked about prejudice against Microsoft in the Linux community , and how poisonous it is .
The same is true of prejudice against Ubuntu here in Debian .
There are very good people , with long histories in Debian , who have pointed out the positive things that have come from Ubuntu .
Listen to them .
Ubuntu is in a great position to help with big and deep changes that need to be made .
Look at the folks who have been instrumental in discussions around multi-arch , or the move to event - based booting , for recent examples , and you 'll see people who work effectively in both projects .
Neither project can claim credit for all the good work that goes on , but it would be very wrong to make a sweeping statement that Ubuntu makes no contribution .
As for my motivations - I love free software and want it to win .
If it wins properly , it will not come in a single package branded " Debian " or " Ubuntu " or " Red Hat " , it will come in a coordinated diversity .
I have no interest in seeing anything bad happen to Debian .
Quite the reverse , I 've acted in the ways I thought would carry the greatness of Debian into new places in the most effective way possible .
I 'm sorry that some folks have responded to that as if it were a threat , and sought to create divide and disharmony .
I stayed away from DebConf this year - the first time in six years - because I did n't want to be a flashpoint for division , when there are so many positive threads of collaboration under way .
I hope this mail does n't turn into a magnet for flies and pus .
If it suits your brain to think that I 'm an evil capitalist thieving pig , so be it , I doubt there 's anything I could do to change your mind .
Paranoia will only get you so far .
But if you 're open minded , take the time to look again at what I 've done and said , and ask if it's made a positive difference to Debian and free software in the last five years , and make your own mind up .
Rather than turning this into a debate on the integrity of individuals or organisations or projects , let 's look at how to make a big improvement in the free software ecosystem .
In summary ( and thank you to anyone who made it this far :-) ) :
To achieve anything together , we 'll both need to work together , we 'll need to make compromises or we 'll need to contribute effort to the other side .
If the Debian community is willing to consider a December freeze , then Ubuntu ( and Canonical ) will commit resources to help Debian meet that goal .
It means we 'll get less done in Ubuntu , but the benefits of having a schedule which could attract many other distributions would outweigh that .
I think multiple other distributions , who tend to think in financial years ( 2010 ) and plan accordingly , will join a December freeze summit , and there are significant benefits to Debian to being part of that rather than on a different schedule .
This is a good faith offer of help and support in order to reach a tough but noble and achievable goal .
It wo n't be easy , the first time or the next , but it will kickstart a process that will bring dividends to Debian , and to the whole broader ecosystem .
Ask upstreams what they think , and whether they would want to participate , and you 'll hear a very positive response .

As in any office , my co-workers and I experience several WTF - Situations during our working day .
So we decided to implement a simple system to count the WTF's and use them as a metric for our working climate :-)
we use an " emergency stop " - Button which is connected to an arduino .
This arduino sends the string " WTF " on the serial line a little python scrip writes them to a file , another processing app count 's the lines in the file and offers the result via http , which is read by a processing app for visualisation ...
Bank Failure Friday is in full swing .
Tonight there were 5 more failures , numbers 73 through 77 on the year .
In the biggest failure since WaMu , BB&T Takes Over Colonial .
Colonial BancGroup Inc. , the Alabama lender facing a criminal probe , had its banking operations closed by regulators and taken over by BB&T Corp. in the biggest bank failure since Washington Mutual Inc. collapsed last year .
Branches and deposits of Colonial , Alabama ’s second - largest bank , were turned over to Winston - Salem , North Carolina - based BB&T in a deal brokered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , the regulator said today .
The failure of Montgomery - based Colonial followed a Florida expansion that saddled the lender with more than $ 1.7 billion in soured real - estate loans .
Colonial ’s failure will deplete the FDIC ’s deposit insurance fund by $ 2.8 billion , the agency said .
The fund , which the agency uses to pay customers of a failed bank for deposit losses up to a $ 250,000 limit and is generated by fees paid by banks , stood at $ 13 billion at the end of the first quarter , according to the FDIC .
The agency has set aside an additional $ 25 billion for bank failures , agency spokesman David Barr said .
Is There Any Money Left In The Fund ?
As late as in the end of April just before the release of the bank stress tests , Ms. Bair Chairman of the FDIC said they would not need any additional bailouts from the U.S Treasury within the immediate future according to The Bulletin .
After three new bank failures last Friday , the FDIC ’s Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) diminished by another $ 185 million for a total remaining balance of $ 648.1 million .
Below is a graph showing the DIF capital as a percentage of total bank deposits insured by the FDIC .
Note that this graph is based on the old insurance limit with a maximum coverage of $ 100.000 / account .
This limit has been changed to cover up to $ 250.000 / account until January 1st 2014 .
Estimates say that the change increases the deposits covered under FDIC insurance to approximately $ 6 trillion in total .
FDIC Reserve Ratios & Insured Deposits
click on chart for sharper image
The current reserve ratio of 0.014%1 strongly indicates how bad this crisis has affected U.S financial institutions .
However , this is not the entire story .
If we take a closer look at non-current loans and charge - offs from banks one realizes that the FDIC still has a lot of work to be done .
Combined non-current loans and charge - offs amounted to nearly $ 100 billion in Q109 compared to $ 15 billion / quarter pre-crisis .
Moreover , according to analysts at the Royal Bank of Canada the U.S still has banking failures in the thousands to face before the crisis is over .
In turn that should result in the FDIC requesting the pre-approved funding signed by the Congress in May 2009 , including $ 100 billion from the U.S Treasury Department .
Tonight 's Bank Failures
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 6.8 million .
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 2.8 billion .
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 61 million .
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 25.5 million .
The cost to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund is estimated to be $ 781.5 million .
Taxpayers Bailout FDIC
The real total cost for Q1 09 turned out to be almost twice the amount of the estimates .
If that will be even close to reality for Q2 09 the FDIC ’s DIF will ( very ) soon be out of funds completely .
[ Mish : as of tonight the DIF is bankrupt . ]
We believe the main reason for this observation lies in a de facto relaxation of accounting standards , even before the FASB 157 amendment on March 15th earlier this year .
Basically the relaxation allows banks to only write - off parts of their losses due to market impairment and they may themselves decide a fair price that the asset could have been sold for during normal market conditions to keep in their books .
Allowing banks to control how they mark - to - market their assets , will likely backfire and when they ultimately end up failing , imply greater closure costs for the FDIC .
From the graph [ below ] one can infer that the average yearly DIF costs / bank assets have increased at an alarming rate to almost reach 31 % in 2008 and 2009 .
Yearly Average DIF Costs / Bank Assets

So , what does that imply ?
Basically it means that when valuating any U.S bank , their assets should probably be marked down significantly relative to their book value , much because of how they nowadays are allowed to manipulate their balance sheets in order to appear more solvent than they in fact are .
The Moral Hazard of FDIC Insurance
The Seen and the Unseen
Total Up The Unseen
Looming taxpayer bailouts of the FDIC
Taxpayer bailouts of failed banks
Taxpayer bailouts of mortgage reductions to keep people in their homes
Rising property taxes because of increased speculation

Fraud costs
Investigatory costs
Stock market crash
Cost to pension plans dumb enough to buy debt in failed banks simply because they were " growing "
FDIC Is Asinine Model

In fact , losses from today 's failures are lower than had been projected .

It looks like it will be another prosperous year for the 1 Percenters !
Investment banker year end holiday bonuses are on their way and by all accounts , except one , it is going to be another year of excess for employees of Bank of America , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , US Bank , and Wells Fargo !
The one exception being Goldman Sachs where it is expected the average year end “ performance ” bonuses will decline 13 % this year to a “ paltry ” $ 362,862 per its 38,900 employees .
You may recall two years ago , amid a flurry of negative publicity over excessive investment bank executive bonuses , Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein asked employees to refrain from high profile , flashy , or excessive purchases .
Apparently he does n’t want his employees rubbing their manipulation of investment markets in the face of everyday Joes and Janes !
Well , I think this year it is safe to say that “ all bets are off ” when it comes to spending !
Hey , maybe it will help jump - start the economy !
So , what does one consider a “ high profile ” purchase when some of these individuals ’ base salaries already exceed seven figures ?
You and I might consider a neighbor ’s purchase of a $ 40,000 BMW as flashy , while in other neighborhoods , this purchase may be seen as a “ frugal ” choice .
After some careful thought , I have compiled a list of what I might buy if I won the investment bank executive employment lottery !
Just promise me that you wo n’t tell Mr. Blankfein …
The Bar Harbor , ME “ Summer Cottage ”
Forget the Hampton’s !
For over a century , some of the World ’s wealthiest and affluent families have called Bar Harbor , ME ( and surrounding villages ) home during the warm summer months .
Know for it ’s gorgeous landscapes , mild weather , and over abundance of outdoor recreation ( including Acadia National Park ) , Bar Harbor , ME is home to some of the most beautiful homes ( affectionately called “ cottages ” ) in the world .
Even though the convenience of modern day travel has opened up the entire world to the ultra-rich , the bourgeoisie continue to visit this little peace of Heaven on Mount Desrt Island , Maine each year .
Homes prices here can reach well over $ 10 Million , and most of these “ cottages ” are occupied less than two months a year making them the perfect investment vehicles to hide some “ hard - earned ” bonus money .
The Hinckley Sou’wester 70 Sailboat
There may is no better way to announce your success as a master manipulator of financial markets than purchasing one of the most impressive , exclusive , and expensive custom sailing yachts ever conceived .
You can easily spend $ 7 million ( or more ) on one of these sailing vessels depending on how carried away you get customizing it .
Of course , my lack of sailing ability has been well document in my recent article on buying boat , so naturally I would hire a crew to maintain and sail this vessel for me .
I figure this would add another $ 200,000 a year to the bill !
From the Hinckly Yacht Website :
Critics applauded the Sou’wester 70 , designed by Bruce King , for its welcome return to classic lines and to design features that matter most to serious sailors .
Significant overhangs , low freeboard , sweeping sheer lines and a gorgeous counter leading to a traditional transom make this ultimate Hinckley a head - turner in any harbor anywhere in the world .
While undeniably a big boat , the Sou ’wester 70 sails easily .
Whether seated or standing , the helmsman can follow the inner toerail from bow to stern .
Excellent seakeeping abilities and the convenience of a shallow draft of 6 ′ 6 ″ allow you to sail her anywhere you wish in comfort , safety and distinction .
The best thing about Hinckley Sailboats and Powerboats is they are manufactured in the next town over from Bar Harbor where you now own your summer cottage !
Talk about convenience !
You could spend $ 20 million of your investment banker bonus without ever leaving Mount Desert Island !

Never mind that admissions officers say that no outsider can truly predict how a particular applicant might fare .
“ I guess there are snake oil salesman in every field , ” said Amy Gutmann , the president of the University of Pennsylvania , “ and they are preying on vulnerable and anxious people . ”
While the going national rate for such work is about $ 185 an hour , a counselor in Vermont and another in New York City are among those who charge some families more than $ 40,000 .
Their packages might begin when a child is in eighth grade .

“ I ’m at the top of my field .
Do people economize when they have a brain tumor and are looking for a neurosurgeon ?
If you want to go with someone cheaper , or chance it , do n’t hire me . ”
Dr. Hernandez , a former Dartmouth admissions officer , says she counsels as many as 25 students in each high school grade each year .
She also offers four - day “ boot camps ” every August in a Boston hotel , charging 40 incoming high school seniors as much as $ 14,000 each .
Image Katherine Cohen has a Web site called ApplyWise that puts prospective college applicants through a 12 - step presentation .
Lee Stetson , who retired in 2007 after three decades as dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania , now has a counseling practice near Philadelphia , where he charges as much as $ 15,000 for his junior - senior package .
Unlike many competitors , Mr. Stetson says he cautions his small group of clients , maybe seven students a year , that he will not handicap their chances of admission to a particular college , nor button - hole former colleagues on their behalf .
“ I ’m hoping they see me more as someone who understands the process , ” he said , “ than someone who can influence the chances of acceptance . ”
While Mr. Stetson was one of the most influential admissions officers in the country , the extent of other counselors ’ experience may be more difficult for parents to divine .
Pillars of Prosperity : ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 4.87 Buy New $ 7.63 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
The most important economic phenomenon lying ahead of us , which we must understand as traders and / or investors , is the inflation - versus - deflation battle .
Below I discuss this most important of all financial phenomena , one poorly understood by the public at large , as we lead into specific ways to position ourselves in the marketplace .
Inflation - or - deflation is a phenomenon not just of money supply , but of money in circulation .
When Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was interviewed recently by Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , one of the smartest guys in Congress , he did n’t give the full answer .
Here ’s an excerpt from that interview ( with some additional comments Rep .
Paul then gave to correspondent Neil Cavuto ) :
Ron Paul :
So it seems to me that you ’re in the midst of massive inflation , but I guess you have a different definition .
When you double the money supply , that ’s not inflation itself ?
Or are you looking at only prices ?
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Ben Bernanke : " Inflation " is the change in the price of the consumer price level , which is very stable right now , and the various measure of money , as you know , in the broad measures of money , the measures that cut the measures of money in circulation like M1 and M2 are not growing quickly .
Neil Cavuto : So , Congressman , he more or less said your inflation concern was misplaced .
What do you make of that ?
Ron Paul : Yeah , that ’s what he said .
But when it comes , people will realize they should have been more concerned .
Just like he was totally unconcerned about the crisis building .
Remember the many years and months before the crisis hit he reassured everybody that there were no problems .
So I do n’t know why we should be reassured by him now saying , " Do n’t worry about inflation . "
But I was trying to make the point that the definitions are different .
If you increase the supply of money , that is inflation .
It causes harm , even if you do n’t have your rise in prices yet .
But we do have rising prices in medical care and there is a lot of inflation out there .
Neil Cavuto :
And you ’ve been arguing that a lot of this federal printing of money led by the Fed and all these rescues and bailouts where we are pulling money out of our you know what , I mean , that ’s going to be eventually inflationary .
Now , to be fair to you , you ’ve been saying this long before even our economists started picking up on this .
What is your worry now ?
How pronounced is this threat ?
How soon is this threat ?
Ron Paul :
Well , I do n’t think you can predict , that ’s one thing , Austrian economics teaches you that you can predict trends , but not timing and yet , it will come because the money supply has been increased . …

John Bolton , the hawkish former US ambassador to the United Nations was a Bush hardliner .
Considering that even erstwhile Bush loyalists generally think the Iraq war has been a mess , it 's surprising that his opinions on how to deal with countries America does n't like are still taken seriously .
But the Washington Post yesterday published an opinion piece by him condemning Bill Clinton 's visit to North Korea that resulted in the release of two American journalists who had been held as prisoners for almost five months .
His reasoning is essentially that negotiating with North Korea sends a signal of weakness , and may encourage " terrorists " to take hostages in the hope that it will enable them to negotiate with the US government .
For Bolton , North Korea is still part of the axis of evil : countries whose government the US should actively seek to topple .
On 29 July , Bolton was a guest on Jon Stewart 's The Daily Show where , amazingly , he argued that " regime change " in Iran was still a good idea .
It 's scary enough that the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq has apparently not dented Bolton 's belief in violent toppling of other country 's governments , but it was something else he said on The Daily Show that was even scarier :
My argument for regime change in Iran is that in the few examples we have where there has been regime change of countries pursuing nuclear weapons and have given them up and there 's a prospect that could happen in Iran .
The best example is South Africa where when the apartheid regime fell and we got a truly democratic government , the new government under Mandela renounced the quest for nuclear weapons .
I think that 's possible in Iran .
Aside from the fact that regime change in South Africa came through a peaceful settlement negotiated by South Africans themselves , the apartheid government stopped the nuclear programme in 1989 and ensured that there were no nuclear bombs left to hand over to the country 's new rulers .
The apartheid government made sure the country would not have the bomb long before Mandela got into office .
Bolton 's ignorance is astounding .
It 's a relief that he no longer represents the diplomatic interests of the US , but a shame that he he is still taken seriously by the American media .
The Washington Post has released a " near final " draft of Obama 's financial reform proposals .
As expected , the paper whitewashes the role of the Fed and Fractional Reserve Lending as well as the role of unfunded Congressional spending in creating the mess .
Instead , Obama 's plan gives more power to those responsible for creating the mess .
Please consider Obama Blueprint Deepens Federal Role in Markets .
The plan seeks to overhaul the nation 's outdated system of financial regulations .
Senior officials debated using a bulldozer to clear the way for fundamental reforms but decided instead to build within the shell of the existing system , offering what amounts to an architect 's blueprint for modernizing a creaky old building .
The plan is built around five key points , according to a briefing last night by senior administration officials and a copy of the white paper obtained by The Washington Post .
The proposals would greatly increase the power of the Federal Reserve , creating stronger and more consistent oversight of the largest financial firms .
It also asks Congress to authorize the government for the first time to dismantle large firms that fall into trouble , avoiding a chaotic collapse that could disrupt the economy .
Federal oversight would be extended to dark corners of the financial markets , imposing new rules on trading in complex derivatives and securities built from mortgage loans .
The government would create a new agency to protect consumers of mortgages , credit cards and other financial products .
And the administration would increase its coordination with other nations to prevent businesses from migrating to less regulated venues .
" Speed is important , " Obama said yesterday in an interview aired by CNBC .
" We want to do it right .
My Comment
The administration 's plan leans heavily on the Fed , expanding its role as the regulator of the nation 's largest banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to include other giant financial firms , such as the insurance companies American International Group and MetLife .
The agency , which has greater independence from the political process than other regulators , would have broad authority to impose special requirements on those companies , such as mandating that they set aside a larger percentage of their assets against possible losses than smaller firms .
Such a requirement could limit large companies ' appetite for risk , but also their profit and growth .
My Comment
The plan calls for a council of regulators to consult with the Fed , including the Treasury secretary and the heads of the other financial regulatory agencies :
The Securities and Exchange Commission , Commodity Futures Trading Commission , the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the agencies that regulate banks .
My Comment
A second element likely to provoke fierce debate is the establishment of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
The agency would have a mandate to increase the availability of financial products in lower - income communities and other underserved areas , in part by enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act , which requires banks to make loans everywhere that they collect deposits .
My Comment
Several ideas have been dropped as the administration picks its battles .
The plan will not include a new way of regulating insurance companies at the federal level .
The insurance industry , which is regulated at the state level , is deeply divided , and the White House anticipated a distracting fight .
The administration instead plans to create an office in the Treasury Department to monitor the insurance industry .
Some of the largest insurance companies could still fall under the scrutiny of the Federal Reserve in its new role as a systemic risk regulator .

Keith asked me to remind everyone of this important fact :
Fed Uncertainty Principle In Action
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Two
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .
Try not to scream aloud with fear and / or excitement , but video screens are coming to magazines .
Next month , thousands of copies of US showbiz mag Entertainment Weekly will contain a slimline electronic display capable of showing 40 minutes of video , activated when you open the magazine .
As an added bonus , if you dip it in the bath while reading it , you 'll instantly win a free 40 - minute full - body electroconvulsive therapy session ( although sadly , for legal reasons , I have to point out that absolutely is n't true ) .
This tragic news is no surprise .
Screens have got us surrounded .
Last week I stood on a tube platform watching a Persil commercial being digitally projected in HD on to the opposite wall , to give me something to stare at while waiting for my delayed train .
It showed gurgling kiddywinks in polar - white clothes gambolling in a field at the height of summer , tumbling and rolling and skipping and laughing , as if the sheer supernatural luminance of their outfits had somehow short - circuited their mushy little brains .
The contrast between the faces in the advert and the faces on the platform could n't have been more marked .
In the advert , all smiles .
On the platform , morose expressions laminated by a thin sheen of grime and sweat ; hangdog mugs smeared with London .
There 's no air - con on the underground , so on a hot day people quickly resemble clothed piglets trapped in a can , waiting for the air to run out .
In these circumstances , the Persil ad was downright sarcastic ; not a harmless video , but a magic window showing what life could be , if only you were n't stuck in a stinking , clammy - walled pipe , glumly jostling for space with fellow victims .
The underground also has video adverts lining the escalators .
Where once stood rows of little posters with the occasional blob of dried chewing gum stuck to the nose of a beaming model , now stand rows of plasma screens displaying animated versions of movie posters and slogans for chain stores , and no one knows where to stick their gum any more because the images slide around .
It 's impossible not to be slightly impressed , not to think , " Ooh , I 'm in Minority Report , " even as you glide by for the 10,000th time .
The screens seem to belong there more than the real people trundling past them .
Ad - world looks so vivid and clean , we humans are grotty streaks in a toilet pan by comparison .
They should ban us flesh - scum from using the escalators , and lovingly place glossy examples of technology on there instead : Macbooks , iPods , shiny white smoothie makers , Xbox 360s and so on ; one brilliant white machine quietly perched atop each step , screens advertising Ice Age 3D mirrored in their gleaming minimalist surfaces as they scroll steadily upwards , ascending into the light .
Hey , it 's their destiny .
We can use the stairs .
At London 's Westfield shopping centre – picture the Duty Free section of a 22nd - century spaceport – a series of " information centres " vaguely resembling giant iPhones stand dotted around the echoing floorspace .

And if you want to know where to buy a radio or some comics or maybe just something with a bit of character to it , simply tap it again and it'll sit there ignoring you ; judging you somehow , like a mutely brooding obelisk – until you can't bear the chill any longer and run screaming from the complex , passing across 2,000 CCTV screens as you go .
If a Victorian gentleman arrived in present - day London , he'd think we 'd been invaded by glowing rectangles .
The average single Londoner 's day runs as follows :
You wake up and watch a screen until it tells you it 's time to leave the house , at which point you step outside ( appearing on a CCTV screen the moment you do so ) , catch a bus ( with an LED screen on the outside and an LCD screen on the inside ) to the tube station ( giant screens outside ; screens down the escalator ; projected screens on the platform ) , to sit on a train and fiddle with your iPod ( via the screen ) , arrive at the office ( to stare at a screen all day ) , then head home to split your attention between the internet ( the screen on your lap ) and the TV ( the screen in the corner ) and your mobile ( a handheld screen you hold conversations with ) .
All we city dwellers need is a screen to have sex with and the circle is complete .
Panasonic is doubtless perfecting some hideous LCD orifice technology as we speak .
Probably one that makes 3D adverts appear in your head at the point of orgasm .
Coco Pops are so chocolatey they even turn the milk brown .
Now pass me a tissue .
The absolute omnipresence of screens is still a recent occurrence – they 've only become totally unavoidable in the last four years or so – but already I 'm utterly acclimatised .
When I venture into the moist green countryside , the lack of screens is stunning .
I stare at wooden pub signs with dumb incomprehension .
The King 's Head ?
Is that a film ?
Why is n't he moving ?
Is it a film about a king who can't move ?
When a cow saunters by without so much as a single plasma display embedded in its hide , I instinctively film it on my phone , so I can see it on a screen where it wo n't freak me out .
Then I email a recording to the folks back home , so they can look it up online and tell me what it is .
Ooh : apparently it 's a type of animal .
I get it now , now it 's on my screen .
Yes .
Screens .
If you want a picture of the future , imagine a screen pissing illuminated phosphor into a human face – for ever .

Did Blackwater / Xe founder Erik Prince knock off informants working with federal authorities investigating the company ?
These eye - raising allegations , among others , are contained in the anonymous declarations of two individuals claiming to be ex-Blackwater employees , which were filed in federal court yesterday and first reported by the Nation ‘s Jeremy Scahill .
( Find their sworn statements here and here . )
According to one of the former employees , John Doe No. 2 , “ … Based on information provided to me by former colleagues , it appears that Mr. Prince and his employees murdered , or had murdered , one or more persons who have provided information , or who were planning to provide information , to the federal authorities about the ongoing criminal conduct . ”
( He does n’t , however , provide any information about who the targets of these alleged hits were . )
Explaining why he must remain anonymous , John Doe No. 2 says that “ on several occasions after my departure from Mr. Prince ’s employ , Mr. Prince ’s management has personally threatened me with death and violence . ”
He also charges that Prince , a devout Catholic , “ views himself a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe . ”
To that end , Mr. Prince intentionally deployed to Iraq certain men who shared his vision of Christian supremacy , knowing and wanting these men to take every available opportunity to murder Iraqis .
Many of these men used call signs based on the Knights of the Templar , the warriors who fought the Crusades .
Mr. Prince operated his companies in a manner that encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life .
For example , Mr. Prince ’s executives would openly speak about going over to Iraq to “ lay Hajiis out on cardboard . ”
Going to Iraq to shoot and kill Iraqis was viewed as a sport or game .
Mr. Prince ’s employees openly and consistently used racist and derogatory terms for Iraqis and other Arabs , such as “ ragheads ” or “ hajiis . ”
Via Scahill ’s article :
Among the additional allegations made by Doe # 1 is that “ Blackwater was smuggling weapons into Iraq . ”
He states that he personally witnessed weapons being “ pulled out ” from dog food bags .
Doe # 2 alleges that “ Prince and his employees arranged for the weapons to be polywrapped and smuggled into Iraq on Mr. Prince ’s private planes , which operated under the name Presidential Airlines , ” adding that Prince “ generated substantial revenues from participating in the illegal arms trade . ”
Doe # 2 states : “ Using his various companies , [ Prince ] procured and distributed various weapons , including unlawful weapons such as sawed off semi-automatic machine guns with silencers , through unlawful channels of distribution . ”
Blackwater “ was not abiding by the terms of the contract with the State Department and was deceiving the State Department , ” according to Doe # 1 .
This is not the first time an allegation has surfaced that Blackwater used dog food bags to smuggle weapons into Iraq .
ABC News ’s Brian Ross reported in November 2008 that a “ federal grand jury in North Carolina is investigating allegations the controversial private security firm Blackwater illegally shipped assault weapons and silencers to Iraq , hidden in large sacks of dog food . ”
Another former Blackwater employee has also confirmed this information to The Nation .
Both individuals allege that Prince and Blackwater deployed individuals to Iraq who , in the words of Doe # 1 , “ were not properly vetted and cleared by the State Department . ”
Doe # 2 adds that “ Prince ignored the advice and pleas from certain employees , who sought to stop the unnecessary killing of innocent Iraqis . ”
Doe # 2 further states that some Blackwater officials overseas refused to deploy “ unfit men ” and sent them back to the US .
Among the reasons cited by Doe # 2 were “ the men making statements about wanting to deploy to Iraq to ‘ kill ragheads ’ or achieve ‘ kills ’ or ‘ body counts , ' ” as well as “ excessive drinking ” and “ steroid use . ”
However , when the men returned to the US , according to Doe # 2 , “ Prince and his executives would send them back to be deployed in Iraq with an express instruction to the concerned employees located overseas that they needed to ‘ stop costing the company money . ' ”
The declarations were filed in conjunction with a series of civil cases brought on behalf of Iraqi civilians suing the company for war crimes and wrongful death .
Court documents filed by the plaintiffs have accused the company of a range of criminal activity , from murder and kidnapping to tax evasion and child prostitution .
According to John Doe 2 ’s declaration , “ Mr. Prince knowingly hired two persons who were previously involved in the Kosovo sex trafficking ring to serve at relatively high - levels within his company . ”
He adds that “ Mr. Prince ’s North Carolina operations had an ongoing wife - swapping and sex ring , which was participated in by many of Mr. Prince ’s top executives . ”
In the past , Blackwater / Xe has strongly denied any wrongdoing .
Without knowing the identities of John Does 1 and 2 , it ’s impossible to know whether any of these explosive charges hold any truth .
I have an email in to Xe spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell Stacy DeLuke requesting a reponse to the allegations .
I ’ll update this post if and when I hear back .
UPDATE : DeLuke emailed me the following statement this morning , which I ’m reprinting in its entirety :
The proper place for this case to be litigated is in the Court , and we will respond fully in our reply brief ( which will be filed on August 17 ) to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs .
Because the plaintiffs have chosen inappropriately to argue their case in the media , however , we will also say this : –
The brief filed by Plaintiff includes two anonymous affidavits state that their “ information ” has been provided to the Justice Department — we can gauge the credence given to those statements — which hold no water .
When the indictments were announced , the United States Attorney the United States Attorney made a point of stating that “ [t ] he indictment does not charge or implicate Blackwater Worldwide ” ; “ [ i]t charges only the actions of certain employees for their roles in the September 16 shooting . ”
He emphasized that the indictment was “ very narrow in its allegations ” : “ Six individual Blackwater guards have been charged with unjustified shootings . . . not the entire Blackwater organization in Baghdad .
There were 19 Blackwater guards on the . . . team that day . . . .
Most acted professionally , responsibly and honorably .
Indeed , this indictment should not be read as accusation against any of those brave men and women who risk their lives as Blackwater security contractors . ”
- It is obvious that Plaintiffs have chosen to slander Mr. Prince rather than raise legal arguments or actual facts that will be considered by a court of law .
We are happy to engage them there .
- We question the judgment of anyone who relies upon and reiterate anonymous declarations .
As DeLuke notes , Blackwater / Xe will be filing its reply on August 17 .
I ’ll parse it here .

He said they began pummeling him .
" The started to beat and beat and beat me , with their batons , feet and cables . "
But instead of laying off , the militiamen came after him .
" They started to follow me , " he said .
" I ran and changed my direction , but in a dead - end street they caught me . "
" Do not beat him ! " he protested to the Basijis .
Ali-Reza said he was near Tehran 's Fatemi Square on June 13 , a day of riots and unrest just after the election , when he spotted the plainclothes Basiji fighters beating a man " in a very bad way , " he said .
The east Tehran resident 's story is among the tales of abuse and detention surfacing from Iran 's weeks - long crackdown against dissidents and protestors in the wake of the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a vote marred by allegations of massive vote - rigging .
They stuffed him into a van with other young men and women and took them to a holding cell near Horr Square , where they were all beaten for more than two hours , he said .
" You voted for Mousavi , " one of the Basijis told them , according to Ali-Reza .
" Beating you is our right .
We can even kill you . "
The Basiji called each other by honorifics , like Haji or Seyed , never by their real names .
For two days the captives were held in the facility , fed only bread and sugar .
But Ali-Reza said his treatment improved after he was handed over to the regular police .
At one point a Basiji interrogator was about to break the fingers of a 24 - year - old man , but the police stopped him , Ali -Reza said .
After days at the police detention facility , he and others were moved into Tehran 's infamous Evin Prison , where they were no longer subject to as much abuse , but crammed into horribly overcrowded conditions .
" Our place for sleeping was nothing , " Ali -Reza said .
" There were too many people forced to sleep in one place and the toilet was very dirty . "
During interrogations he and others were presented with pictures and video footage showing them at demonstrations and asked to answer questions about their political views and lives .
After 10 days , Ali -Reza was freed .
His family had to put up the deed to their house as collateral , and in a month he 's scheduled to appear before a judge at a branch of the Revolutionary Court .
The ordeal has made him more angry and contemptuous of Iranian authorities .
He remembers watching as young men lay bleeding and injured on the ground and no one came to help them .
" Now I know whom I hate , " he said .
" Now I know how they are wild , are not human .
They do not believe in anything .
They just close their eyes and beat you until they kill you . "

( AP is reporting , “ The nation 's food banks , struggling to meet demand in hard times , are turning to prison inmates for free labor to help feed the hungry . ” )
Out in the street , you soon notice fewer cabs and town cars .
More people are walking or using public transportation , even though the fares recently went up .
Even that is deceptive because there are still a lot of tourists in Midtown to complicate the picture .
New Yorkers have other things on their minds .
There are retail vacancies on every block .
Other stores are discounting everything .
The fast food places have their specials going for $ 2 - 5 dollars .
Many of the clothing stories look like good will shops .
When a JC Penny opened a store in Midtown , 15,000 people applied for 500 jobs .
As we walked downtown , we passed nearly empty bars and restaurants , a sign that the most customers are staying away .
Media reports are now confirming what I saw .
The Wall Street Journal reports , “ Major retailers reported that American consumers are continuing to hunker down , casting a cloud over the durability of the U.S. recovery and underscoring the importance of overseas demand in restoring the world economy to health .
Retailers across the spectrum provided foreboding reports . ”
Down where I live , you also pass new buildings with empty stores and unsold apartments .
The foreclosure crisis is already hitting New York ’s condos and co-ops .
You just ca n’t see it from the street the way you can in a suburban tract .
When you read the auction notices , you realize its real .
A new wave of foreclosures is expected and not just in poor homes .
The middle class and commercial real estate is affected .
Almost every block on 8th Avenue in Chelsea has a new bank branch .
It ’s like ATM heaven except most are not crowded .
There was a report last week that banking industry opened 10,000 branches over the last five years .
Most were based in shopping areas or concentrated in affluent neighborhoods .
Only a small number are in poorer communities , especially those victimized by predatory subprime lending .
The New York Times reported this week that 91,100 NY households hide their savings in closets , in pillows — even in brown paper lunch bags , just not at a bank
Meanwhile , every week , more banks are going bust and being taken over and sold by the FDIC .
There are reports that the FDIC itself is insolvent .
And as for the markets , cooler heads prevailed when the wisemen realized that consumer demand has fallen up as defaults and delinquencies rise
Inequality is mounting in social and racial terms .
Recent statistics : cited in a Times study : " From the first quarter in 2008 to the first quarter in 2009 , the national unemployment rates for blacks rose from 8.9 percent to 13.6 percent , compared to a rise for whites of 4.8 percent to 8.2 percent .
In NYC , it was even worse : from 5.7 percent to 14.7 percent , compared to 3.0 percent to 3.7 percent for whites . ”
Remember these statistics notoriously undercount those not looking for jobs that are not there .
Unless you are following the trajectory of this crisis you might not know that economist Nouriel Roubini , who was among the first to predict it , still sees it as far more serious that most of us realize :
“ This is the worst US and global recession in 60 years .
If the US recession were — as is most likely — to be over at the end of the year , it will have been three times as long and about fives times as deep — in terms of the cumulative decline in output — as the previous two . ”
Notice he is not quite predicting its end , using the “ If ” word to mask his own uncertainty .
The Financial Times cautions against optimism taking refuge in the term “ caution . ”
Here in the Big Apple , The City ’s top money man , Controller Bill Thompson says , “ 108,000 jobs evaporating citywide between August , 2008 and May , 2009 .
Typically , unemployment continues to climb even after the economy bottoms out and begins to recover .
I expect the number of unemployed in New York City to reach 400,000 in 2010 , for the first time in decades . ”
Still invisible are the impact of cutbacks on city services and the educational system .
Income disparities are growing , according to a new study but how do I show that to my visitor since people with credit cards can still charge it even as credit limits are being cut back and interest rates rise .
At the same time , A Bank of America Merrill study shows the Middle class is being hit hardest .
The LA Times reports , “ The consumer debt problem in the economy really is a debt problem for the middle class .
The need to work off a chunk of that debt will sap middle - class family spending power for perhaps years to come .
By contrast , the upper 10 % of income earners face a much smaller debt burden relative to income and net worth .
Those people should have ample spending power to help fuel an economic recovery . ”
And do n’t think the end of the recession will bring back many of the jobs that are gone .
Economists are now getting us used to a new term : “ jobless recovery . ”
Already employers are introducing compulsory furloughs , as the Christian Science Monitor reveals : “ For millions of Americans , this might be the year of the furlough .
Over the course of a month or so , workers — both white - collar and blue — may have to take several days off whether they want to or not .
Call it a temporary pay cut — an action that is sold by management as a way to help save some jobs . ”
Another new study finds , “ Income inequality in the United States is at an all - time high , surpassing even levels seen during the Great Depression , according to a recently updated paper by University of California , Berkeley Professor Emmanuel Saez .
The paper , which covers data through 2007 , points to a staggering , unprecedented disparity in American incomes .
On his blog , Nobel prize - winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called the numbers " truly amazing . "
It 's all amazing , all devastating to our lives and futures , and yet you ca n’t necessarily see it if you do n’t look , or know what to look for .
No one is talking about our economic pain — not the right or the left , perhaps because it is not an “ event ” that you can cover live at a town hall .
It ’s there but , for many , it ’s invisible and seen as a personal problem , not a social issue .
This crisis did n’t just happen ; it was caused .
Will those responsible ever be held accountable ?
Out of sight is out of mind .
The hope is that if we ignore it , it will go away .
If you think that , think again .
Glen Johnson may have taken part in his first Liverpool training session yesterday , but he was officially unveiled as Liverpool player to the media today .
There have been ongoing debate about the £ 17 million fee , and even Rafa himself admitted he had hoped to avoid spending that sort of figure , but he remains impressed with the signing of the England international right back .
Rafa said :
“ We are really pleased because we ’ve signed a really good player , an England international .
“ It ’s very positive .
He has quality and a very good mentality , and from the first time I spoke with him it was clear he wanted to come here .
“ He has quality , that ’s clear .
He ’s more mature – you can see from the press conference he is good .
“ Chelsea were trying to win big trophies at the time he was there and they needed experience in order to win .
Now it is a good moment because he is a much better player , he has the experience and the desire . ”
Johnson admitted there was no doubt in his mind that he wanted to join Liverpool when their interest became clear , he went on :
“ I ’m delighted .
I ’ve come to win a few trophies .
I knew Carra and Stevie and some of the other lads from playing against them .
I am looking forward to it .

Rare is the scholar to inspire a festschrift — a volume of papers written by top specialists in honor of a major thinker - but this one is very special .
It is sure to grow in importance as the years move on , for it contains phenomenal contributions written in the tradition of the work of Hans - Hermann Hoppe .
Hoppe is one of the most important scholars of our time .
He has made pioneering contributions to sociology , economics , philosophy , and history .
His important books include Handeln und Erkennen ( 1976 ) , Kritik der Kausalwissenschaftlichen Sozialforschung ( 1983 ) , Eigentum , Anarchie , und Staat ( 1987 ) , A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism ( 1989 ) , The Economics and Ethics of Private Property ( 1993 , enlarged 2nd edition 2006 ) , Democracy -- The God That Failed ( 2001 ) , and The Myth of National Defense ( editor , 2003 ) .
He is the founder and president of the international Property and Freedom Society , which promotes scientific debate in combination with intransigent libertarian radicalism .
Now Professor Emeritus of Economics at UNLV and Distinguished Fellow with the Ludwig von Mises Institute , Hoppe and his writings have inspired scholars around the world to follow in his footsteps and to provide a scientific foundation for individual freedom and a free society .
The festschrift honors the occasion of his 60th birthday .
The festschrift contains personal testimonies and essays in Professor Hoppe 's preferred research areas , such as political philosophy , democracy , and economics .
The contributors are colleagues , collaborators , and former students from all over the world , including Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Sean Gabb , Jesús Huerta de Soto , Robert Higgs , Frank van Dun , Paul Gottfried , Joseph T. Salerno , Walter Block , and Thomas J. DiLorenzo .
The 400 - page Festschrift was presented to Professor Hoppe at a private ceremony on July 29 , 2009 , in Auburn , AL during Mises University 2009 .
Harriet Harman 's office is in trouble with the statistics watchdog again .
After ticking off the equality minister in June for using a figure which " risks giving a misleading quantification of the gender pay gap " , the UK Statistics Authority is more than a little perturbed that a quango based in her office - the Women and Work Commission - went ahead and published the figure again just a few weeks later .
The number was quoted across the British media - including the BBC .
The figure in question is 22.6 - the percentage that Ms Harman 's department likes to suggest is the difference between the earnings of men and women .
But the head of the UK Statistics Authority , Sir Michael Scholar , told the Government Equalities Office on 11 June that the figure should not be used , because to do so " may undermine public trust in official statistics " .
Imagine his reaction , therefore , when he went to the GEO website on 29 July and saw what they had published [ 334 Kb PDF ] .
There , clear as day on page five , in the foreword written by commission chair Baroness Prosser , is this :
When Sir Michael finished reading the offending paragraph , he had another bone to pick with Ms Harman 's department : namely , the figure of 39.9 % cited as the pay gap for part - time workers .
In a letter sent to Baroness Prosser at the GEO today , he points out that the document " does not explain what this is a measure of " .
However , he assumes that this must be another figure his authority red-flagged in June - " 39.9 per cent appears to be a measure of the difference between the median hourly earnings of part - time women compared with full - time men " .
This is apples and oranges statistics - comparing the pay rates of women who work part - time with men who work full - time in order , cynics might assume , to achieve a really big number .
Back in June , Sir Michael told Harriet Harman that " such a comparison needs particularly careful presentation and justification if it is not to mislead " .
Today , he told Baroness Prosser that he was " disappointed that it should have appeared in the Foreword to Shaping the Future without any explanation " .
Sir Michael makes the point that the story of part - time pay looks very different if one compares like with like :
" The casual reader would be surprised to learn then that median hourly earnings of women and of men ( excluding overtime ) are very close , with women 's median pay actually being slightly higher than men's ( by 3.4 per cent ) . "
Yes , that 's right .
If you compare part - time women with part - time men , women get paid slightly more .
This fact , needless to say , is not found anywhere in Shaping A Fairer Future .
Reading that offending paragraph again , one could be forgiven for thinking it is an attempt to make matters appear worse than they really are .
As Sir Michael puts it in his letter :
" It would be an easy mistake for a casual reader to conclude from the Foreword that if the overall gender pay gap stands at 22.6 per cent and the full - time gender pay gap stands at 12.8 per cent , then the part - time gender pay gap must be considerably greater than 22.6 per cent .
Indeed , the Foreword appears to confirm just such a conclusion when it states that ' pay gaps are even greater for part - time workers ( 39.9 per cent ) ' . "
I am awaiting a response from the Government Equalities Office .
In the meantime , this is what they said last time a letter from Sir Michael dropped on the departmental doormat :
" The 23 % gender pay gap figure used by the Government Equalities Office includes both full and part - time employees .
With women representing over three - quarters of the UK 's part - time workforce , we believe this figure gives the fullest picture of the country 's gender pay gap . "
Update :
In a statement this evening , the government said :
" The WWC is an independent body , and the way they chose to measure the gender pay gap in their report is a matter for them .
" The 22.6 % gender pay gap figure used in the report is also used by the Government and includes both full and part - time employees .
" With 41.9 % of women working part - time , and women representing over three - quarters of the UK 's part - time workforce , we believe this figure gives the fullest picture of the country 's gender pay gap .
" As Sir Michael 's letter makes clear , GEO has discussed this issue with ONS and the National Statistician has agreed to look at the way the gender pay gap is presented in ONS statistical bulletins . "

I 'm not so sure .
YouTube is very popular despite the fact that its video clips resemble the transmission from the moon landing in 1969 .
And JPEG2000 achieves better pictures / megabyte than JPEG , but internet users are not calling for it .
Saving a megabyte here and there is less important than having a video format that is free and open for all to use .
Dailymotion.com has understood this and their recent offerings using < video > and Ogg Theora is laudable [ 1 ] .

Google would not have existed without the web .
It will be a terrible tragedy if you tip the scales in favor of patent - encumbered formats on the web .

Running coach Greg McMillan coaches some of the world ’s top marathoners .
I asked him about the speed workouts of elite runners and whether new runners like myself could benefit from interval training .
Here ’s our conversation .
Q
As a new runner , I ’m just hoping to finish a marathon .
If you do n’t have a time goal , should you still be thinking about interval training ?
A
I think everybody should do interval training — maybe more so for beginning runners .
Intervals increase your average speed .
You go out for a four or five mile run and you slog along .
You think , my goodness , I do n’t want this to be my marathon .
You ’d like to be able to run faster .
Q .
Should I go to the track for interval training ?
A
I ’m not a fan of beginners going to the track and running 400 meter repeats or 800 meter repeats .
You ’re getting into other energy systems that just are n’t developed yet .
Just running quickly for 20 or 30 seconds or even a minute during a regular training run seems to be a great way to increase average running pace , and it avoids the monotony of just building miles .
It adds variety .
I advise it for the beginning runners I work with .
Every run has something where they ’re running a little bit quicker just so they are n’t slogging along .
It ’s different for the more competitive runner .
They often have to force themselves to run slow .
Q
Being a very slow runner can be demoralizing , especially when you are at the very back of the pack .
What ’s your advice ?
A
It is tough when you ’re toward the back .
I think the one thing I encourage people to focus on : you ’re the only one who cares you ’re in the back .
Everyone else is just celebrating and cheering for you .
It ’s really important just to focus on having fun and why you ’re out there .
If you get caught up in the competitiveness , it ’s a losing game .
Everywhere you turn there is someone better .
Even in the middle of the pack .
Q
It looks like more fun in the middle of the pack than the back !
How do I get there ?
A
Adding in some strides or a “ fartlek ” ( alternating bursts of speed with regular training pace ) on a few of your regular runs can boost that average pace .
If you could increase your average pace just 10 seconds a mile , think what that could do for your overall time .
If you increase by 30 seconds per mile , that ’s a whole world of difference .
Then you wo n’t be in the back anymore .
Q .
What kind of advice do you have for more experienced runners with time goals in the marathon ?
A .
When you have a time goal , pace practice becomes more important .
When you ’re just trying to finish , you find a pace that feels good for you , but in essence you do n’t care about the time .
When you add the time goal it becomes much more important to think about pace .
You have to do certain training faster than race pace and some that ’s slower .
You need more variety in your training plan , so you make race pace feel easy .
Q .
When should you train at your race pace ?
A .
The standard workout is a goal pace run .
For 30 minutes to an hour you ’re practicing running at your target pace .
So if your target marathon pace is 8 minutes per mile , you go out and dial in 8 minutes per mile .
Another workout that practices marathon pace is a fast - finish long run .
If you ’re running 14 , 16 , 18 or 20 miles , at the end of that you ’re trying to run at your goal marathon pace for the last last 4 miles or 8 miles .
Workouts like that help you groove your marathon pace so it becomes easier .
You do n’t want to go out during the marathon and run 30 seconds per mile faster than your goal pace .
Next week , I ’ll post the final segment of my interview with Coach McMillan , where we talk about using pace calculators , preventing injury and which top athletes he ’s working with now .
And be sure to check out what Coach McMillan had to say last week about “ The Summer Running Slump . ”
And check out Greg McMillan ’s website at www.McMillanRunning.com
From the initial call to even after the case was closed Michael Brehne ’s office was very informative , helpful , and compassionate .

Like an aspiring indie band , the Cybraphon has many instruments , plays them on an irregular schedule , likes to have an audience around it – and obsesses over comments on its blog , the number of friends it has on Facebook and how many fans follow it on MySpace .
The difference is that it is a handcrafted musical robot and one whose emotion meter swings from delirium to desolation based on its online popularity at any given moment .
" The Cybraphon has an almost egotistical desire for fame , " says Simon Kirby , one of the creators of the robot .
When the needle hits rapture , the Cybraphon 's built - in orchestra of mechanized acoustic instruments clang in harmony to belt out an upbeat tune .
But without online attention it slips into dejection and spews out a sad melody .
Three U.K. based artists – Kirby , Ziggy Campbell and Tommy Perman – built the robot over eight months using a £ 5,000 grant .
It 's a mechanical marvel that stuns with its attention to detail and construction .
An antique wardrobe houses more than 60 robotic components including musical instruments such as cymbals and an organ as well as electronic parts including a PC and a controller .
Kirby and his colleagues first created a sketch of what they wanted and then sourced the parts from antique stores , junk shops and donations .
The Cybraphon 's emotions are accessible via a Twitter feed but also appear on a on a 100 year - old galvanometer housed in the wardrobe ( pictured above ) .
Kirby says the Cybraphon is devised as a " tongue - in - cheek comment on people 's obsession with online celebrity . "
And it is almost Julia Allison - esque in its quest for attention .
The device scours the web all day looking for mentions of itself and tracking how many friends it has on Facebook and MySpace .
" It is happy when it feels its popularity increases but is miserable if it is being ignored , " says Kirby .
The musical instruments inside the wardrobe include an Indian classical instrument called a Shruti box , an organ and cymbals .
But they had to be tweaked to play on their own .
The team attached a motor - driven crank to the drives of the Shruti box and modified it with 13 robotic servos .
The organ was retro-fitted with robotic keys while a fan pumps air through it .
Cybraphon includes 12 chimes that are struck by suspended solenoids and percussion instruments that are hit by beaters attached to motors .
A custom made vinyl record is cued to play through antique brass gramophone horns .
The Cybraphon also has infra-red based motion detectors to sense when there are people around it .
It then comes alive , playing the music that is driven by its current mood .
" The Cybraphon is switched on all the time but it really wakes up when someone walks up to it , " says Kirby .
The brain of the system is a Macbook Pro notebook hidden inside one of the drawers of the wardrobe .
" That , a few Arduino boards and lots of wire , " says Kirby .
The computer runs software written in Python and MAX / MSP to monitor the web and update Cybraphon ’s emotions according to its rate at which its popularity is changing .
" The software takes email alerts from Facebook , Google and so on , processes them and compares the current activity to that in the last 24 or 48 hours to calculate the rate of change , " explains Kirby .
But no matter how much attention the Cybraphon gets , it always eventually slips into depression , says Kirby .
That means online attention could cheer up the Cybraphon in the short term but once the initial excitement dies down , the robot is disillusioned .
" We modeled it on an insecure , egotistical band , " he says .
Though the Cybraphon 's current mood is accessible via Twitter , and you can follow it on Facebook or MySpace , its music is not available online .
However , you can watch a demo video of it below .
" A streaming feed , although perhaps a nice idea , is possibly too literal , " says Ziggy Campbell , one of the creators of the Cybraphon .
Regular bands do n't stream live performances all day long and neither does Cybraphon .
It keeps things more exclusive . "
The Cybraphon will be shown at the Inspace gallery in Edinburgh during the Edinburgh Art Festival in August .
Campbell says the Cybraphon 's continued existence amuses him .
" Bands by their very nature tend to be volatile and prone to implosion , " he says .
" I 'm surprised that the Cybraphon , a highly neurotic beast with some questionable electrical wiring , has n't hit self destruct yet . "

Pot is one hot commodity this year -- at least , judging by the insanely large loads the U.S. Border Patrol have seized this summer .
During the month of July alone , Tucson seized more than 100,000 pounds of pot -- bringing the total poundage to 1,065,325 this year .
That 's well above the 722,000 pounds the Border Patrol had seized by the end of last July .
Why the dramatic increase ?
Tucson sector spokesperson Mario Escalante believes it 's because the Border Patrol is getting so damn good at catching the bad guys .
" We attribute our success to us allocating necessary resources where we deem necessary , " he says .
Hmm .
Ok .
Yuma sector spokesperson Ben Vik has another ( probably more complete ) explanation : Sure , Border Patrol strategies have improved .
But cartels may also be bringing in more drugs -- and in higher volumes -- in response to new Border Patrol strategies :
Rather than bringing across lots of little loads , they 're making fewer trips with more drugs .
Additionally , cartels have begun to build more tunnels across the border -- two were recently discovered for the first time ever in Pima county .
And drug lords are sending one - man ultralights ( sort of like a small motorized hang glider ) stacked to the brim with contraband to fly over the border walls .
And we 're still weeks away from the typically huge fall harvest .
S.F. native 's quest to fill city with natives Gardening

Greg Gaar sounded like an air traffic controller who'd just spotted the biggest plane in the world .
" Here 's a butterfly coming in right now ! " he shouted .
" It 's a red admiral . "
The butterfly had come to the right place : The Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Council 's Native Plant Nursery lures all kinds of wildlife to the southeast corner of Golden Gate Park .
Gaar , however , would like to attract more humans to the undertaking he started five years ago .
" I want people to know that we exist , " said the 61 - year - old ecologist .
" My main problem is marketing - it certainly is not propagating plants . "
That 's for sure .
The nursery has at least 60 species of native plants , most of them indigenous to San Francisco .
The 5,000 or so individual plants can trace their origins to the seeds Gaar collected from more than 30 natural areas in the city .
They are priced at $ 7 apiece , but will cost less if they 're for a community project or if someone buys several .
" If I can sell $ 150 worth of plants , that 's a good day , " Gaar said .
Weekends are busiest , but a typical Saturday or Sunday might draw only 15 people to the nursery , which shares space with the neighborhood council 's recycling center .
They occupy a parking lot that was reserved for media when the 49ers used to play at nearby Kezar Stadium .
" As a kid , I went to all the 49er games at Kezar .
I have n't moved that far , " said Gaar , who lived in the Haight 35 years before inheriting the Mount Davidson house in which he grew up .
" The first thing I did was rip out the driveway and put in native plants , " he said .
" That 's when the neighbors knew my mother was right when she said , ' I 've got a crazy environmentalist for a son . '
The last time I owned a car was 1971 . "
His passion for nature comes through when he shows off the nursery to visitors , who will probably get a botany lesson and a sense of San Francisco history when they drop by the spot at the corner of Frederick Street and Arguello Boulevard .
They are often greeted by a cat named Fluffy , abandoned by a homeless woman 14 years ago , and by Sylvia , a younger feline .
" The best thing you can do if you have a garden is to plant native plants , " Gaar said .
" Because then you 're creating habitat for the whole food chain of native plants .
We 're not saying mountain lion or grizzly bear , but something slightly smaller .
And we 're not going to bring back the drifting sand dunes that used to be here , but we still have many of the dune plants , which thrive quite well in nonsandy soil . "
Many plants are in pots , while others are growing in one garden or another .
They include seaside daisies , Douglas iris , lizard tails , columbines , coast buckwheat , monkey flowers and angelicas .
" Everything 's peaking right now , " Gaar said as he pointed out purple needle grass , one of his favorites .
" When the seed is ripe , the tail turns 90 degrees and then it spins and drills into the soil .
That 's what you call adaptation . "
He also showed off some farewell - to - spring plants , which are easy to find in San Francisco right now .
" If you look up to Twin Peaks , Tank Hill , Bernal Hill , Bayview Hill , you 'll see those areas are very pink , " he said .
" It 's not because of the Gay Freedom Day Parade - but they happen at the same time of year . "
Suddenly , Gaar spotted an Ehrharta erecta from South Africa and yanked it out of the ground .
" It 's a very bad weed , " he said .
" One of the worst .
It tries to turn everything into a soccer field . "
Gaar sniffed a California sagebrush .
" Does n't it remind you of California ? " he asked .
" It reminds me of going camping . "
Five years ago , he merely wanted to plant a garden on the perimeter of the recycling center , which he was running at the time .
" I never had any intention of starting a nursery , " he said .
" I took seeds and scattered them onto a flat of potting soil .
They came up like fur on a dog's back . "
Gaar 's dedication to native plants is contagious .
About a year ago , Haight resident Michelle Welch began visiting the nursery and , over time , bought 25 plants .
She said they 've transformed her small backyard , which used to feature pretty flowers that usually met untimely deaths .
" I just did n't have a clue about California , let alone San Francisco , native plants , " she said .
" They do n't need a lot of water .
In fact , they do n't need any water .
I do n't have to do much , except cut them back .
Once they get going , they go .
I 've been very happy with them . "
Whoever advised people to be skeptical of what they read in the papers must have had in mind this week 's coverage of the documents about CIA interrogations .
Now that we 've had a chance to read the reports , it 's clear the real story is n't the few cases of abuse played up by the media .
The news is that the program was thoughtfully developed , carefully circumscribed , briefed to Congress , and yielded information crucial to disrupting al Qaeda .
In other words , it worked — at least until politics got in the way .
That 's ...
Let 's start with my mother .
She recently had two falls in short succession , the last one causing her to break her shoulder .
She was treated in the ER and discharged to home .
This would not have been so bad had my father been in good shape , since the two of them have always been excellent care - givers for each other .
But my father had been in declining health , and has been weak and using a cane to get around .
He was only barely still driving .
This situation got worse , however , when my father collapsed and ended up in the hospital with a diagnosis of late - stage cancer .
To try to manage this situation , I hired a care manager from a local elder care organization , ElderHealth Northwest .
This is an amazing company that , among other things , runs adult day - health centers for those who need , among other things , help with medication management , and other assistance designed to keep them independent and , more importantly , out of hospitals .
Of course , the funding for these centers has been drastically cut , and so most are in danger of closing now .
Trying to come up with a plan for my mother , while my father was in the hospital , provided my first big glimpse into the irrationality of health care in this country .
My goal was to get my mother back to independent living , so that we could then focus on my father 's final time with us .
Both my parents are on Medicare , and also have an excellent Medi - gap policy .
But Medicare only pays for home health care , including physical therapy , which is what my mother needed especially , if you have been in the hospital for three days first .
Of course , providing home health care would likely keep lots of people OUT OF the hospital , and save money over the long haul , but that 's beside the point ( I guess ) .
So I was prepared to pay for my mother 's care myself , and felt fortunate that I was in a position to do so , where most are not .
Unfortunately , my mother took an unexpected turn for the worst , ended up in the hospital , and less than three days later , she passed away ( in the same hospital where my father was also then receiving care ) .
I would estimate that the cost of her health care in those last three days easily exceeded $ 150,000 , and none of it , even if half - successful , would have appreciably increased the likelihood of surviving to live anything near a life that should would have wanted for herself .
She did not have a living will .
I discussed her wishes with regard to a do - not - resuscitate order , but because she was going into emergency surgery , she at least wanted CPR .
This conversation was painful , because it was done while the surgeon was basically standing there waiting to have her wheeled into the operating room .
My mother did not want to be intubated though , and so she did have a DNI order put into place .
The only problem with the latter is that you get a breathing tube when you get surgery , and so , while there was no tracheotomy , she still ended up spending her last two days with a machine breathing for her .
Indeed , the whole thing was a horrendous ordeal that my mother , had she had sufficient time to decide , would have probably wanted to have avoided .
Instead , I was forced to decide whether to withdraw the medical interventions keeping her " alive , " a decision complicated by the fact that one of her doctors wanted to continue aggressive intervention " to get her through this rough patch , " while her other doctor questioned the quality of her life even if she was able to survive the immediate medical crises .
Having been without sleep for over 48 hours at that point , I told them I needed to go home and get a few hours rest , and that I would come back in the morning to decide what my mother would want , doing so with a clearer head .
My mother did not , however , make it through the night , dying " naturally " at 4 AM when her heart gave out .
She thus saved me from a gruesome and unwanted choice , while also giving me a hard lesson in the necessity of informed end of life planning .
Without that , medical care is a costly , runaway train that will take a person and their family to places none of them may have wanted to go .
Well , that is , if you have good insurance .
Because you can be sure that if my mother had not had Medicare and good medi-gap insurance , she might not have even ended up in surgery .
My mother was laid to rest nine days ago .
As for my father .
He was in the hospital for nearly two weeks .
The last two weeks because of a course of radiation that we decided to do for largely palliative purposes ( i.e. , to prevent some imminent , severe pain . )
The hospital wanted to discharge him and do the radiation on an outpatient basis .
This might have made sense had there been a skilled nursing facility ( nursing home ) as an adjunct to the hospital , but there is none .
Indeed , my ordeal has made plain that the discontinuity of care in the U.S. is a major source of inefficiency , waste , and improper care .
There is simply no way in this country to have people move seamlessly to the level of care appropriate for their condition , like , for example , when a patient is moved into intensive care , if needed , and then back to a " regular " hospital room when a lower level of care is appropriate .
Instead , nursing homes are all independent , are of vastly differing quality , and have varying degrees of selectivity as to whom they wish to admit , paying special attention to what kind of insurance you have .
But because I am a lawyer , and spent ten years on the Board of Directors of a skilled nursing facility and adult - day - health program for people with HIV / AIDS , I knew that hospitals cannot discharge a patient against their will .
Well , that 's not totally true ; but to do so could potentially take months .
( And that 's why hospitals try so hard not to admit uninsured people .
It 's not because they are that concerned with the immediate uncompensated care ; it is because they fear that they will be unable to find any place to discharge the patient to .
Remember the recent story of the severely disabled patient who was deported as a way of discharging him ?
That 's what I 'm talking about . )
And so with the back up of the oncologist , my father was able to complete his five day course of radiation while remaining in the hospital .
This also bought me time to plan my mother 's funeral .
When it came time to find a place for my father to be discharged to , yet another horrifyingly educational phase began .
First , everyone adult over 40 years old in this country should be required to tour 3 or 4 nursing homes .
Second , these same people should have to watch a video explaining what Medicare and medi-gap insurance pays for , because it pays for a LOT less than most people assume .
Specifically , Medicare pays for 20 days in a nursing home ( if you have been in the hospital for 3 days ) at 80 % , and then the next 80 days at 20 % .
A good medi -gap insurance usually picks up the rest , up to a the total of 100 days .
At that point , if you do not have long - term care insurance , you are on your own .
You then " spend down " your assets until impoverished , at which point you will be covered by Medicaid .
And if you have never looked at the kinds of facility that accept Medicaid patients , you should have a look .
Prepared to horrified .
With the help of the care manager I had hired , and a savvy , helpful discharge planner at the hospital , I found a nice place near me for my dad to be transferred to .
Unfortunately , at the last minute , the bed became unavailable , leaving me less than 24 hours to find an alternate .
( My dad was scheduled to be discharged on a Wednesday , and my mother 's funeral was that Thursday . )
Fortunately for me the care manager I had hired found a room at a gorgeous , new facility that rarely took admits from outside the facility .
It was what is called a " continuous care retirement facility , " which means you buy an apartment for independent living , and then that becomes assisted living gradually as you need more help .
Finally , when your condition gets to the point where you require 24 - hour care , you move into a nursing home room there in the same facility .
This is a great model , but it is also VERY expensive .
( And so who is it that has been saying rationing of health care is bad ?
We ration quality health care every day in the U.S. , we just do it on the basis of how much money people have . )
Because my dad was going to get hospice care , that meant that Medicare paid for the care but not the room and board .
So , in the absence of long term care insurance , the nursing home room would need to be private pay .
And although we had found this room in an amazing facility willing to admit someone like my dad from outside the community , they would first need to do a credit - check on me , and I would need to write a check for the first two months of my father 's care , an amount well over $ 10,000 .
And , let me tell you , I was overjoyed to do it .
But how many other people would have been able to pull this off ?
Instead , most would end up in a nursing home that was , if you 're lucky , not too offensive , and you would not be getting hospice care , which is AMAZING , because that meant the room would not be covered .
Instead , your parent would get " comfort care , " which is to say - - lots of pain medicine , and maybe a semi- private room where the person in the other bed did n't howl too often .
As for my dad , he received amazing care .
The hospice RN assigned by the hospice provided checked in regularly , with me and my dad .
There was a social worker , a chaplain , and bath aides .
He could get massage therapy if need be , and a host of other services designed to make his last days pain - free and meaningful .
And this was all on top of the services provided by the facility , including a private room that we were able to move my dad's own furniture into , and amazing care from well - trained and respectful staff .
This was end - of - life care at its very best , and it is what every parent in this country deserves , and very few will .
My Dad died peacefully last night at 6:30 PM , having benefited from the very best of medical care that this country has to offer .
Certainly it fell short at times , especially with regard to discharge planning .
But I can live the rest of my life knowing that my dad was well cared for , and had a peaceful death , largely because of hospice care , and a beautiful and well - run facility .
Of course , the Sarah Palins of this world dont ' understand any of this , or pretend not to .
They 'd rather talk about death panels .
But , let 's be honest , what they are really saying is this :
We want to keep the system the way it is because it works great for people with lots of money .
In other words - -" Let them eat cake . "
If you love your parents like I did mine , then fight for real health care reform .
You should n't have to endure the primer that I did .

MOBILE , Ala . --
Mobile police have concluded their investigation into an officer who was caught on YouTube punching a man who had just led police on a car chase , Police Chief Phillip Garrett said today .
Officer Patrick Luckett admitted hitting the man twice , and will face a trial board in the next few weeks on a charge of excessive force , Garrett said .
On July 23 , police were pursuing David Pate , 34 , through west Mobile .
He refused to stop , and hit two police cars during the chase , Garrett said .
The chase ended on Hillcrest Road near Airport Boulevard , but even after Pate stopped driving , he refused to get out of the car .
Officers had to break the driver side window and pull Pate from the car , Garrett said .
Pate was laid on the hood of the car , while to officers attempted to restrain him .
The third , Luckett , circled around the hood and can be seen in the YouTube video striking something five times .
Garrett said that investigators enhanced the video and saw that Luckett struck Pate twice , but his other blows glanced off the car .
" We wo n't condone any excessive use of force , " Garrett said .
" He ( Luckett ) admits that he did it , and that does mean something to me . "

Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson can only shake his head over the outcome of the Joel Tenenbaum trial , a case in which his young client was hit with a $ 675,000 damage award for uploading and downloading 30 songs .
" How can a jury of common sense people be brought to a conclusion that is clearly divorced from its common sense base ? " he wants to know .
" The law here is off base , " he added , the verdict functioning as a reductio ad absurdum that highlights the problem with applying statutory damages to noncommercial copyright infringers .
The music industry says it 's a " fact " that 25 - year old Boston University grad student Joel Tenenbaum is a " hard - core , habitual , and unrepentant P2P abuser who has caused harm to the music community . "
To Nesson , though , Tenenbaum is a great kid fighting for " a lot of people the RIAA has screwed over . "
Nesson intends to help Tenenbaum fight on ; he tells
Ars that he still wants to file a class - action lawsuit against the major labels and he will continue to litigate the Tenenbaum appeal .
" This is round one , " he says .
" We now have the question well defined . "
A question of fairness
That question is one of " fairness and justice , " words that Nesson uses with obvious conviction .
Now that we have three such verdicts ( two for Jammie Thomas - Rasset and one for Joel Tenenbaum ) , it 's clear that the verdicts are " produced by the law " — but the end result appears totally disproportionate to the harm caused .
Nesson plans to push the issue of fairness in post - trial motions about the unconstitutionality of such damages .
If Judge Nancy Gertner agrees that some amount — any amount — would be too high to pass constitutional muster ( such as the maximum $ 150,000 per song in damages ) , then " the thread can be pulled and pulled . "
Once the courts go down that path , " it creates a shakiness in the structure " of the law .
" As soon as you confront such issues , " says Nesson , " you see that this statute just does n't fit " Tenenbaum 's noncommercial infringement .
Not everyone is buying what Nesson is selling .
The Register 's Andrew Orlowski tore into the professor this week , saying that :
Nesson has achieved something I thought was completely impossible in 2009 , and that 's to allow the US recording industry 's lobby group to paint itself in a sympathetic light ...
The Boston case allowed the four major labels to justify an enforcement policy against opponents who appeared compulsively dishonest , irrational , paranoid , and with an abnormal sense of entitlement .
Nesson failed in his avowed mission " to put the record industry on trial .
He failed to show why disproportionate statutory damages are harmful , which could have had a lasting constitutional effect .
He failed to paint the defendant as sympathetic , or " one of us . "
He failed to demonstrate why copyright holders make lousy cops ...
Now I 've no doubt Nesson is sincere in his beliefs that he 's doing everyone a favour , but then again , there 's a bloke on my bus who thinks he 's Napoleon .
And that 's just about the trial ; the events leading up to it were even stranger .
We covered many of them , but the complete list of questionable decisions can't be summed up any better than it was by Ben Sheffner , a copyright attorney who covered the Tenenbaum trial for Ars .
Nesson is " notoriously eccentric , " admits Debbie Rosenabaum , one of the Harvard Law students who served longest on the Tenenbaum case .
" But we love him for that . "
Calling Nesson one of her best law school professors , Rosenbaum tells
Ars that Nesson " maintains the naive belief that the law should truly be just " and that he has a strong sense of how law " should be . "
A common complaint is that this sounds more like an approach better suited for the legislature than the judiciary , and Rosenbaum concedes the fairness of the point .
But " a lot of people say that something out of the norm is crazy until it becomes mainstream , " she says , and points to a host of Supreme Court decisions that essentially changed the law in major ways , such as rulings on segregation and abortion .
" The law has changed because the social norms have made it obvious that what was the law is no longer good law , " she says .
And Nesson is convinced that his quest for " fairness " is in fact deeply rooted in the law — it is not merely a request to ignore or overturn the statute , but to reinterpret it .
" You cannot sensibly read this statute to apply these statutory damages against noncommercial users , " he says , pointing to the legislative history behind 1999's Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act .
The heretic
Nesson 's arguments so far have n't found much success in court .
One famous example was the appellate court brief he submitted which cited no case law and referenced only a Bible verse about Solomon .
It 's an example that Rosenbaum brings up when we talk about the case , since it appears to reflect so badly on the Harvard Law students doing much of the work .
Law students at one of the top schools in the country thought this was an appropriate appellate brief to file ?
Did they not even know how to cite precedent ?
Rosenbaum stresses just how much work the students did on these briefs , and she says the initial drafts of this one in particular were stuffed full of case law and traditional legal reasoning .
But Nesson had the final say before submission and apparently preferred the wisdom of I Kings to the past wisdom of the American court system .
" I think it 's fun to test the limits of legal norms , " says Rosenbaum , though she admits to being " absolutely petrified " about being disbarred over some of Nesson 's actions .
But orthodoxy is not Nesson 's way .
Nesson " at his very core is not a trial attorney , " says Rosenbaum .
He 's a teacher , a thinker , a philosopher who thinks about " big , theoretical questions . "
" There are things we could have done differently along the way , " she adds , but is quick to provide a firm " yes " when asked if Tenenbaum had good representation .
Not backing down
Nesson 's hope for arguing the " fairness " of Tenenbaum 's actions hit a huge speed bump just before the trial , when Judge Gertner ruled that downloading and sharing full songs over P2P networks was not " fair use " under US copyright law .
At that point , given the evidence against him , it was clear that Tenenbaum would be on the hook for some serious cash — minimum statutory damages are $ 750 per song , which means that Tenenbaum faced a damage award of more than $ 20,000 .
Given that the labels had long been trying to settle with Tenenbaum for less than this amount , were there any discussions about just throwing in the towel and taking a settlement ?
The defense team says no , this was never a consideration .
It 's about the principle of the thing ; according to Nesson , Tenenbaum 's " generation is not to blame for what happened " to the record labels , so why should he settle , admit guilt , and pay anything at all ?
We checked in with the RIAA , which says that " of course " it is still open to a settlement .
" We 're always interesting in settling these cases , " said spokeswoman Cara Duckworth .
But Team Tenenbaum intends to fight on .
A few Harvard Law students who have n't yet graduated will help out with the case in the fall , but the original team has all moved on now .
Looking back over her experience on the team , Rosenbaum says that she " would n't trade it for anything in the world , and I do n't think Joel would either . "
$ 675,000 is a lot to pay for the privilege of being sued in federal court , but Tenenbaum has a plan for dealing with the damages .
If Nesson 's work fails to get him off the hook , " I declare bankruptcy . "

I just spotted an article on CNN ’s website about the success story of Guinness in Nigeria .
I did n’t expect to find anything amazing here , just another affirmation of Mike ’s hypothesis about the amazing international growth opportunities for brewers as the developing world ’s growing middle class acquires a taste for beer ( and frankly they could do much worse than Guinness in my opinion , I salute Nigeria ’s good taste ! )
It turns out that Nigeria now consumes more Guinness than Ireland , and is second only to the UK in consumption of this most renowned of dry stouts .
That ’s not to say that Ireland is slouching here ; Nigeria is a nation of 150 million people , the UK about 60 million , and Ireland only about 6 million …
I ’d say they ’re pulling their weight , for sure .
What was surprising to me is that in Nigeria , Indonesia , and other markets in which Guinness is brewed under contract this way , Guinness is apparently an extract beer .
Without getting too technical , there are two ways to brew beer , all grain or extract .
An all grain brewer steeps malted grains like barley in warm water ( a process called “ mashing ” ) , which creates a sort of tea by dissolving sugars and other compounds out of the grain and into the water .
This “ tea ” is then called wort .
Hops are added , the mixture is boiled for sanitization and to trigger certain chemical reactions , then the result is cooled and the yeast are unleashed , creating beer .
All grain brewing is like making soup from scratch , if you will .
Extract brewing on the other hand can be thought of more like making condensed Campbells soup .
A manufacturer of malt mashes the grains at the factory , then dehydrates the wort , extracting as much water as possible , which improves the shelf life .
Sometimes hops are added , sometimes not , and then the dehydrated mixture is diluted by the brewer and boiled .
Homebrewers usually start out with extract brewing because it is easier , but then switch to all grain when they feel they can handle the challenge and want to increase the quality of their brews .
However , this does n’t mean that all extract beers are bad ; I ’ve heard of many extract homebrews going on to win awards at major competitions , and have also heard of professional brewpubs that make extract brews exclusively , among them two in Canada ( one in Calgary , the other in Nova Scotia ) and another in California ( Pacific Coast BC in Oakland ) .
I have n’t been to any of the three but have always been secretly skeptical , even though I ’m sure that a good brewer can make proper use of any ingredient to make good beer , so long as they are smart about selecting and using it .
As for Guinness Nigeria , they use an unfermented , hopped extract shipped in from Dublin and add it to unspecified local ingredients .
My guess is that certain ingredients are easy to get locally , the others are not of the same quality ( or quantity ) as those available in Dublin , so the extract replaces those that are harder to come by .
The Nigerian brewery was the first outside of Ireland and Great Britain and has seen torrid growth despite a global economic recession and challenging operating environment ( including failing infrastructure and unpredictable governance according to CNN ) .
I ’d love to get my hands on their product and see what extract Guinness tastes like , but I do n’t think it ’s distributed in the US , so I ’ll have to wait for now .

Belarus , a classe trabalhadora contra Lukashenko by CAB Τι εννοούν οι &... by Daniel al - Rashid * Ατομικισμός , ... by Tommy Lawson * Building a Non-Eurocentric Anarchism in Our Communities : Dialogue with Ashanti Alston international | anarchist movement | interview Saturday June 27 , 2009 08:25 Saturday June 27 , 2009 08:25 by José Antonio Gutiérrez D. by José Antonio Gutiérrez D. The following is an interview with Ashanti Alston Omowali , an African descent anarchist activist , who started his political militancy back in the 60s in the Black Panther Party .
He was also a member of the Black Liberation Army , and because of his revolutionary activities spent more than a decade in prison .
In prison he moved forward to anarchism and after his release he has participated with numerous libertarian initiatives and publications , and is one of the founders of Anarchist People of Color ( APOC ) , a network that brings together anarchists of colour in the remarkably racist US .
Ashanti also participates in a number of initiatives ranging from solidarity with political prisoners in the US to the Institute for Anarchist Studies .
This interview was done on March 9th , 2009 , during the time he spent in Ireland when he came as a speaker for the 2009 Dublin Anarchist Bookfair .
In the interview we talk about the APOC initiative , the links between exploitation and other forms of oppression , of the need to go beyond Eurocentrism and the place of people of colour and Third World struggles in shaping a really internationalist movement that learns from experiences everywhere .
He also reflects on the roots and legacy of the Black Liberation Movement and of his own experiences in it .
Ashanti Alston speaks at the Anarchist Bookfair in Liberty Hall , Dublin , March 7th 2009 .

1 . How and why the idea of Anarchist People of Colour came about ?
In the US the anarchist movement I would say since the 90s it grew a lot and a lot of people wanted to know what it was about , including many people of colour , because the traditional revolutionary groups that were Marxist - Leninist or nationalists were not appealing to them for being so rigid in their ideology and the loyalty they wanted you to adhere to , it was something that a lot of folks did not want .
But folks that were moving into anarchism from Black , Latino and Asian communities , and even indigenous communities , found that their experiences within anarchist groups were racists .
It may have been good in the sense that they were practicing direct democracy , or they would be active in the street demonstrations , but they though themselves to be exoticised  within these predominant white groups , because they were from African , Asian , Latino or Indigenous descent that they were treated as if they were so special , that wasnt a good experience .
Or the racism of white anarchists was just too much to put up with , and people werent fighting racism .
So at some point towards the late 90s , the call went out to have a conference that would be for anarchist of colour , anti-authoritarians of colour , or people who were interested in something beyond traditional ways of organisations , so in 2003 it was the first APOC conference .
And I said about 300 people came to Detroit , Michigan , in the US , to a university called Wayne State University .
And that was a great conference which allowed many of us to see each other for the first time , and we realized we had so much in common , but we needed to work from foundation where we knew that we would respect each other , and wed have a way to work in our communities in a more wholesome way .
2 . You talk about having to face discriminatory or racist practices within the anarchist movement , which was often not explicit practices but part of a culture , we could say ... how do you think that this racism that is entrenched in peoples culture can be fought within the movement and within society at large ?
In the anarchist movement we were basically asking to white anarchists to deal with racism within anarchist organisation .
Many of them were not understanding that being born in a racist society , and if you were born white in that society , you were not only being raised with a sense of superiority but that you have privileges , and we wanted them to face that fact in their interactions with us , because most of them from the anarchist movement come from privileged background .
So deal with the fact that you have some behaviours that come up very offensively to us , that are very insulting to us , since they have never lived the type of circumstances in which weve had to live in , and we want us just to be with you and not recognize that when we go back to our communities we are with our backs against the wall , but when we are with you things are pretty nice and you just want everything to always be pretty nice .
We want to tell you that in the US you pretty much got communities of colour that are locked down .
So we need to fight racism not only in the institutions , whether it is schools , around jobs or police brutality in communities of colour , but fight it within anarchist institutions , as a way to fight racism in the US in general , what s all still one struggle .
3 . Women found the same experience within the movement , and they were pushed to form women only groups .
How do you fell that this relates to the fact that there are other types of oppression that interact with class struggle , but in which class struggle alone does not explain everything ...
I feel some sectors within the anarchist movement seem to be blind to these other forms of oppression , what do you think about it ?
Something Ive learnt , and that I m still learning by reading and listening to other people , is that we have to look at the fact that most of our understanding of anarchism comes from Europe .
And I dont think that we realize that it may have taught us a lot , in terms of another ways to live and organise , or how to be open to differences , but we dont really get that coming out of Europe it will also brings us a perspective on class struggle that they pretty much want to adhere to as if it was something Biblical , that if other struggles are anarchistic and they dont come out of working class struggles that does not make them any less anarchists because it is not workers taking it on .
It may be peasants taking it on , it may be people tied to the land in other ways .
So for me one cannot just read the anarchist classics coming out of Europe , but one have to learn from other peoples living experiences and writings on their experiences .
Even if those experiences and writings are not from people that say  I am an anarchist .
But you can tell pretty much from their writings and experiences that these are anarchistic struggles , you know , that play a big part even today in being at the foremost of some of the most challenging struggles against the Empire .
4 . You have mentioned Chiapas as being a big influence to you .
How do you think the struggle of the people of Chiapas relates to the type of anarchism you defend ?
I think the struggle of the Zapatistas played a big part because it made you realize that revolutionary thinking can come from many social categories ... for instance , in Chiapas you are talking about the South East of Mexico , which is one of the poorest regions of Mexico , predominantly Mayan people that have been written off by capitalism and imperialism .
And yet here theres a struggle that is producing the most cutting edge thinking on revolution today .
To me the Zapatista struggle really made important , for example , not only ethnic community struggles , but the struggle of women , struggle in the universities , struggles in the cultural field of life , and how all of these are part of a larger picture .
But when they say that we can create a world where many worlds exist , they also want you to recognize that you are in a world where many worlds do exist and that no one world can come along and predominate over all the other ones , " I have the only solution , I have the only revolutionary way to go " .
5 . You mention other important point , and it is that classic socialist thought has been a struggle for a hegemonic thought for a uniform culture , and yet your views come from the opposite view , that is diversity .
How do you think the anarchist movement can shape this view of diversity with the need for unity of struggle , so we can talk of a movement that while having unity preserves this diversity ?
Well , it is interesting that some of the things that have allowed me to look at struggles around the world and even struggles in my own community differently , was me reading a lot of revolutionary thought that came out of some of the older liberation struggles and some of the most recent university struggles that may have taken place in France and Germany , so we are dealing with people like Michel Foucault , or we are dealing with German thinkers who were talking for example of hegemony and some other different concepts on the intersection of different oppressions and how we have to look at the world in a more complex way .
What it tells me is that if anarchism wants to be vibrant , if anarchism is to remain vibrant it must be open to difference , it must be open to be enriched by other peoples struggles , other peoples thought , other peoples practices which challenge even some of the core beliefs of anarchism proper .
So for me again the Zapatistas the thing around difference becomes so important , because you have to have struggles from people from different worlds , from different realities , yet we can figure out a way within the same space and push our commonalities forward but in a way that respects the individuality of the struggles .
So if Im an African in America , if Im of African descent in New York , I want to be involved with the Mapuche , I want to be involved with the struggles in Africa , Asia , the Irish Republican movement , in a way that they all see me in the way I am , and I see them , and we realize that we can still move in a common way that brings down the Empires that affect all of our lives .
But weve to do it in a way that we dont have to submit any part of our identity that makes us who we are .
We are not all workers , we are very much multifaceted people wherever we come from , but our specific histories and specific space in time , makes us who we are , and with that comes out our richness and it has to be respected .
We dont have to submit who we are like the Russian Revolution , the Chinese Revolution and even I would say the Cuban Revolution , and all the major so called revolutions wanted people to submit to a mass line , and if you did not fit there , if you were still living in traditional ways or what they may call the jungle , tribal ways , some State power is going to say no , you are coming to the modern world or we will wipe you out .
Today we see that thats not the way we want to go .
6 . What you say makes a lot of sense in terms of learning from other peoples experiences .
Anarchism was a very strong movement earlier in the XXth Century , then it declined and now it is certainly coming back with great strength at potentials .
But somehow it seems that we largely ignore what happened in terms of struggles in the middle ...
Yes , we are going back to the Spanish Revolution , to the Russian Revolution but we forget that in the meantime the whole of the African Continent was in revolution .
Yes , they did not lead to anarchist socialism , as neither Russia nor Spain did , but something came out of it in terms of experience , lessons , and a lot of other stuff ... do you think there are experiences such as this that could actually enrich anarchist thought today ?
It s like you say .
When you can get away from all of the classic struggles that are pushed over and over for you to learn about , whether is China , Russia or Spain , we forget that there are struggles that are right around you most likely , or in local areas all around the world that provide examples .
So for example in the US those of us in the Black nationalist movement , in the Black liberation movement , we studied the examples of the Maroon communities from the North American to the South American continent , of Africans who broke away from slavery , who were in many cases able to hook up with indigenous communities and formed free communities , communities in resistance , of resistance .
They are worth studying .
For instance , in Africa you also have the Igbo womens war in 1929 .
If one wants to see an anti-authoritarian struggle lead by women against British colonialism , you have to start studying the Igbo womens war of 1929 in Nigeria .
These are just examples of how people dealt with their economic needs , the needs to feed themselves .
In places in Africa where you have borders , you have folks that out of necessity , who say , well , fuck the borders .
We want to trade with folks across the border because we were connected with them until the Europeans put up an artificial borderline to our lands .
But in them defying the borders they are creating new anti-authoritarian experiences where they say , we dont need borders .
Borders are oppression .
The Chicanos say all the time about the border between Mexico and the US that it is not them crossing the border it is the border crossing them .
Because that border was artificially border was put there to oppress them and now the US has the balls to say that Mexicans coming over into the US is illegal , when they are really coming to what is historically their own land .
So there are many things we need to re look and study , and not just confine ourselves to certain areas that we feel can only give us an example of some kind of proper anarchist struggle or anarchist revolution .
7 . In the US Anarchist Tradition you have some remarkable anarchists who were also people of colour ...
Im thinking of people like Ben Fletcher , Lucy Parsons , who also was a woman ... do you think that they made a sensitive contribution to the movement as such , what would you take from their experience and teachings ?
Ben Fletcher you know is someone like workers in the US still dont know anything about him , neither do they dont know about Lucy Parsons .
But Ben Fletcher was part of the IWW , the Industrial Workers of the World , an organisation which was so powerful in the US like in the 1910s , 20s and probably up to the 30s ... and they were very effective because here there was a revolutionary movement that also fought to include many different ethnic groups , you know .
So they had indigenous folks who were members of the IWW , they had folks of African descent , they had folks who spoke Spanish , the Italians were coming , everybody was making their way to the IWW .
But a lot of people dont know that this movement waged a fierce battle against what can be called the labour aristocracy up to the government and the corporations at the time , who were brutally ruthless in their repression .
One of the things about Lucy Parsons that many people dont know is that she was a woman of mixed heritage ...
I mean , she was Mexican , African and Indigenous , and although at a time in her life she denied to have an African ancestry , to many people at the time it was obvious that she did .
Yet , she was a woman who was extraordinary and played an extraordinary part in the growth of the anarchist movement within the US .
She did things so outrageous as to marry Albert Parsons , who was a white man who was a part of the Confederacy , that was on the side of the racist who wanted to enslave black folks , but at some point , like the soldiers who went to Vietnam , he came into a consciousness that it was the US and the capitalists who were the enemy , so he and Lucy Parsons married and they moved to Chicago .
Both of them become outspoken proponents of anarchism for working class people .
Lucy Parsons even though she may have had her problems with people calling her black , she still spoke against lynching and for the rights of people of African descent in the US .
So she goes down history in the anarchist movement as being a key figure , but few people to this day know about Lucy Parsons .
But she was a courageous woman up to the day she day .
But its like for her , Ben Fletcher , all these other people ... there was also a very important Native American that was assassinated , but theres a lot of other heroes and heroines we need to know about , especially folks of colour , to see that there were many people that were inspired by anarchist ideas , what it basically is we dont need bosses even though they should be considered themselves as revolutionary bosses ; we need to be collective , we need to be communal , we need to be as they say today horizontal in all that we do .
So I am looking for ways today to spread information about people like Ben Fletcher and Lucy Parsons .
8 . You know better than me , but the two key figures of the African - American movement seem to be Malcolm X and Martin Luther Kin ... what would you get from them and learn from them ?
And what would you reject from them ?
They were definitely two very key leaders .
I would also include among them people like Ella Baker , Fannie Lou Hamer and a few others ...
Ella Baker was key in the early Civil Rights Movement where she pushed for the students and the young folks to reject the older black leadership that were pretty much held by the black ministers , the preachers , you know , because they kept holding the students back .
And Ella Baker , who was an old woman at the time , told the students :  you must become your own leadership  and she pushed for a kind of leadership that was community based .
She wanted people to get away from the charismatic preachers or the leadership of the educated ones .
Fannie Lou
Hamer because she was just this poor Black woman who got involved with the Civil Rights Movement and became such a dynamic leader , because she brought everything she learned from being just a regular community person , a church person , in to the movement , what meant that she cared about people .
Malcolm X and Martin Luther King had a relationship with them .
One of the preachers that Ella Baker criticized was actually Martin Luther King !
Because he was part of that preacher leadership , no matter how great he was in many other ways .
And here you have Ella Baker telling the students be your own leaders , no matter how brilliant and charismatic they are , be your own .
But Martin Luther King was great in other ways too .
Because , just like Malcolm , they both showed that when they were challenged by a reality that they found hard to accept , they were willing to look at it and change their thinking and change their ways on it .
So when Martin kept confronting the failure of the non-violent movement , he had a key thinking about the role of violence .
When he was challenged to stop being so local and to start looking at the international scene , he began to look at the Vietnam war .
When he was challenged to look at the role of workers , or the activity of workers , he began to support workers .
And those three things , how he began to oppose the Vietnam war , how he began to support workers , and it was obvious even to the FBI that he was rethinking his position on non-violence , a lot of us believe that it was then when the system had him killed .
Similarly , Malcolm challenged us even like not to confine ourselves to thinking about civil rights .
Malcolm said civil rights is when you keep everything in the hands of the enemy , we got to get out of that , we need to get our own thinking .
Malcolm X also challenged us to think that if you want to be free , you must be willing to do it by any means necessary .
This any means necessary  part became so popular , because it gave us a way to really think that if we want to be free , even if that means bring down the American system , we got to be willing to engage our life in that direction .
But Malcolms life too was one where when he saw that he was wrong , he had the courage to face it , admit it and move on .
So many of us look at Malcolm as someone whos not that egotistical to keep on going on one path , even when it is clear that this path dont work .
When his mentor , Elijah Muhammad of the Nation of Islam , started to obviously betray his own teachings , it took Malcolm a way , but when finally he had to face it , he had to reject the practices of his mentor and move on his own as it was necessary .
But Malcolm was so important with moving people towards revolutionary thinking that when he went to Africa and other parts of the world , he came back talking about socialistic revolutions .
He brought back messages saying that people were moving more towards socialism and getting away from capitalism .
And that was important for us to know , because most of us did not think about that .
We just wanted to get rid of racism , but he got us to see that there was a connection between racism and capitalism , that you cant get rid of one , without getting rid of the other .
So Malcolm was really important .
If the two of them had come together in some kind of unity , we dont know how it may have changed the course of our struggle , but we cant live with that now , we just got to learn from them and just keep moving and learn from our own mistakes and go forward and figure out how we are going to win .
They are dead , everything is on us now , the future is on us , but their lives they still are here , close to us .
9 . If theres something you think was a crucial learning in your period in the Panthers , what is it ?
Ok , then that would be sitting in prison as I did .
This is the long stretching prison , this is like 12 years .
And all that time you are turning that prison into a university ; you got to think , you got to reflect on the past .
It helped me to see the strengths and the weaknesses of the Black Panther Party ( BPP ) .
And I think that both of them are key to me to this day , because I think they are still relevant today .
The strength of the BPP was that we were willing to think about the revolution .
We understood the role of criticism and struggle and we were willing to go into our communities with programmes .
We were not the intellectual types that all we did was being intellectual towards each other , day in and day out .
If you got something that you think is good , you put it into practice .
Practice will tell you whether it works or not , if it doesnt , you go back to the drawing board .
I think the weaknesses of the BPP was that we were young , that our enemy was very experienced and that we did not have a strong enough what may be called a decolonisation programme whereas while we are doing this work in our communities , while we are combating out enemies , that we are consciously trying to work this system out of our bodies and out of our minds , and out of our most intimate relationships .
Because I think those are the areas that our enemies use to bring us down : the sexism , the authoritarianism , the fears of freedom , the fears of death , all those things .
We didnt have ways to deal with those areas and I think it weakened us a lot .
10 .
You are talking about the intimate relationship between capitalism and racism , sexism and other types of oppression ...
I think its a tough one , because they are not necessarily linked in very obvious ways at all times .
So do you think there is any single main link between them ?
How do they interact within a capitalist framework ?
How can you bring together a programme to end exploitation while at the same time finish all kinds of oppression what is the main purpose of anarchism ?
Now , going back to prison , I did a lot of reading into revolutionary and feminist psychology , on Critical Theory that gave a lot of understanding on authoritarianism and a lot of the writers had been Jews who were put away in concentration camps .
But what it helped me to understand , and this goes back to Franz Fanon , is that oppression gets internalized , that you are not just fighting a system out there , outside of you , is like when the anarchist say  you have to kill the cop inside your head .
The capitalist system is also inside of you .
So I think one of the most important lessons while in prison was thinking and reflecting on the movement , was that we have to find ways to combat the system inside of us , the enemy inside of us , as it comes out in our relationships .
And Im talking of relationships very broadly , because it is not only family , personal , intimate , friend relationships , but is also your relationships with your comrades , and what ways do you act out oppressions within your relationships .
So it is important , of course , to be anti-sexist , but we cant just take an anti-sexist verbal position ; we got to really understand what is it about us men and the way we act that shuts down women , and shuts down people who are less powerful , because it also shuts down children and it gets into an ageist thing as well .
If we say that we want to end white supremacist society and a lot of times you look at all the ethnic groups which are not part of the white race as inferior to you , but you may not realize it , you are doing it in an unconscious way .
So when we organise , even the most simple type of organisation , a mutual aid organisation , we need to be conscious what we do with each other within that organisation that axe out the system that we are trying to bring down .
So if Im in an organisation with women , I want to be aware of my sexism .
If Im in an organisation that is mixed in terms of ethnic groups , I want to be conscious of who has been historically silent within that group .
If Im in an organisation that has queer folks I want to be very mindful , if I m not a queer person , what do I do that shuts that person down and make them feel unsafe .
Because as an anarchist I want to be in organisation that in some way create the kind of world we want .
So if I m raising my kids , I dont want to raise them traditionally , the same way my parents raised me ...
I want to be very careful that I m raising them in a manner as free as possible , no matter how insane that may be sometimes , but I want to make sure that their individuality and initiative is respected .
Im going to be careful , I m the parent .
But I m going to make sure also that I dont make them just obey me , as an authoritarian preparation for the world we are going to release them into .
We want to raise anti-authoritarian children , we want to raise children that have a deep love and respect for life .
And at the same time we have to recover those same things within ourselves because we never realize how much we loss them .
11 . How do you think that Anarchist People of Colour can play a positive role to make this movement you talk about a living reality ?
I think APOC want to do two things : we want to push white anarchists and anarchists in general to deepen their understanding of oppression and liberatory practices .
But also , within our communities , we know we got to deal with some oppressions that other folks dont necessary have to deal with : for example , in the black community I have to deal with the low self - esteem of my community that has a history of four hundred years of being enslaved and having every American racist institution directed towards belittling us from the moment we are born .
So it makes my struggle in many ways like a national struggle , you know , because there are certain things we need to do to help to raise our self - esteem and we need to see that we can self - organised without any white person involved at the same time we are always open to any kind of coalition work with any other groups , with white groups .
I think also in the US , anarchist of colour we can lead the way in terms of really being pretty good at being conscious on the oppressions that we act out on other people .
So we try to be very conscious of shutting down women , shutting down queer folks , shutting down young folks .
We seem to be more at to want to be very active in our communities , we seem to have more of a sense that our backs are up against the wall , so that we dont have all the safeguards to fall back on that many other groups may have .
But we want other groups , especially white groups , to know that if our backs are against the wall , our tactics and strategy may be more aggressive at points .
But whatever they be , we want our white comrades support .
We dont want intellectual privileged ones to be in a position that they say , well we dont like what you are doing , so therefore we are not going to support you ; we dont like that you are going to try to stop the police from shooting you down in the streets with guns by arming yourselves .
We want them to understand that whatever we decide to do , we have brains , we are intelligent as anybody else and we can figure out our own way .
Some of that they should have learnt from studying to liberation movements of the past and is that every person has a right to self - determination , every people has to be respected and can figure out their way forward , whether it fits other groups prescriptions or understandings or not .
Every form of free society is not going to be the same , yet we hope that every free society is one that does not allow any small group to put the masses of folks in a position of being exploited or oppressed again .
But I envisage a society that allows Muslims , Christians , Hindus , Bikers societies , whatever , to be able to create their own societies yet to be still part of the same community and that well use resources in a respectable way , that doesnt put anybody else at a disadvantage , because we may live over a field of uranium or oil ... we can think about those things now , but we dont want to be in a position where those who feel they have all the intellectual readings on a particular thing can tell us what to do .
12 . As you say there are many struggles , such as national liberation struggle , that a lot of folks dismiss because they dont necessarily fit into this perfect scheme of how an anarchist struggle should look like , but they are not willing to go with the people to see how far we can go ...
I feel that you have covered many issues on community struggles and resistance very well , but Id like to know if theres anything you want to add to wrap up the interview , knowing that this will be read by comrades in many continents ?
I want just to say thank you for the opportunity to talk with comrades from here to Brazil ...
I think the important thing is that folks understand that anarchism has to be vibrant , open to change , if it is ever going to be relevant ... it has to be like jazz , I speak of US jazz a lot .
Jazz comes out of African communities that are on the bottom in the US , where we were able to take nothing and create something .
Obviously , part of the European experience and part of the Black experience come together and create this thing called jazz , which is improvisation .
You know , for me is nothing but anarchy .
People in the anarchist movement need to understand that anarchism takes different forms all around the world and all throughout history , whether they use the name or not .
If we get holed up on whether a group publicly identifies as anarchist or not , we are no different from the Christians and the nationalists , and others who we are so quick to put off .
I come from a Baptist family and I tell people that I m close to the church , even if Im an atheist , because it is very communal and that is even with the minister .
If people cant see anarchism in their daily lives , act it out in many different ways , how people live and treat each other , we will never see how we can seize the moment , you know .
If the moment is being seized by everyone having to declare Kropotkin or Bakunins anarchism in a particular day of crisis , that means nothing .
But if we can see that people can seize their lives just adhering to what they really do on a day to day basis without authority , well see that anarchism is probably here more than we can imagine .
So in Brazil , for example , you have struggles with the landless peasants and what the anarchists are doing there , and in Colombia , and in Mexico , to the US and across the world all the way over here , which finds me in Ireland , there are struggles going on a daily basis , communities living their lives , and you got to realize that the task is to figure out the way to bring all of this together .
But we need to do it with respect for each peoples struggles , so we dont feel that we have to bring everybody in line with our particular interpretation .
So I hope to see if a general strike comes here as is being talked , for me , I dont look for that in terms of having to turn into an anarchist moment , other than an anarchist moment for me will be when many thousands of people in Ireland will realize that the solutions to the problems of Ireland lie on the hand of regular Irish people ; that those who are bankers , those who are politicians , those wield the positions of power over the Irish people need to be the ones rejected .
If they can see that , the anarchist will have done well .
If in the US , with Obama as president , if people come out of his term in office with this crisis affecting the US and just see that power lies with the people , it will be an anarchist moment .
It will be what we need to do , as what Malatesta said : it aint important that everybody joins your organisation , but is important that we raise consciousness among people that they have to be their own liberators , their own leaders , their own authority and create conditions where never , never again , some people , because of money , because of the military , or politics can control our lives again .

Outward appearances aside , Houston rapper Slim Thug and I have somewhat of a shared history .
We both hail from the great state of Texas .
We both know our way around the section in the club nominally reserved for Very Important Persons .
And , though ours may occasionally be rough exteriors for the purposes of intimidating ‘ haters ’ , we both have a special fondness for speaking deliberately .
Slim
Thug lays it out for us on his 2005 song ‘ Like A Boss ‘ :
I call shots – like a boss
Stack knots – like a boss
Cop drops – like a boss
On top – like a boss
Paid Tha Cost – like Tha Bo$ $
When I floss – like a boss
Big house – like a boss
Rep the North – like a boss
Who the boss nigga ?!
Who the motherfucking boss ?!
Who the boss nigga ?!
Who the motherfucking boss ?!
Who the boss nigga ?!
Who the motherfucking boss ?!
Who the boss nigga ?!
You see the motherfucking boss !!
Much in the same way I ’m concerned about my advancement in my career of choice , Mr Thug appears concerned with establishing or qualifying his position as ‘ The Boss ’ .
In defense of his presumed desire to be a boss , he delineates his list of qualifications , such as the facts that he Calls Shots , Stacks Knots , Drops Cops ( I assume that he caused the Cop to Drop ) , is On Top , etc .
This allows us to determine that a boss , any boss , would call shots , stack knots , etc .
We can represent these formally using First Order Logic as follows :
In English , this means that for every person , if they ’re a boss , then they necessarily call shots , stack knots , etc .
However , it is not the case that Slim is known to be the boss , merely that Mr Thug is known to call shots , stack knots , drop cops and to be on top .
Unfortunately for Mr
Thug , the definition of the material conditional tells us that calling shots and stacking knots are necessary but not sufficient conditions to be considered the boss .
That is , if you do n’t call shots or stack knots , etc , then you ’re not a boss .
Mr
Thug knows he ’s not by logical definition the boss , but he also knows that he ’s not logically precluded from being the boss either .
This situation appears to present him with some moderate apprehension ( “ Who the motherfucking boss ? ! ” ) .
Finally , Mr
Thug reminds us that this hypothetical boss is no myth ; rather , he exists , and more specifically , I can see him ( “ You see the motherfucking boss ! ! ” ) .
In English , this can be translated as saying that there exists at least one person with the quality of being a boss .
Again , using First Order Logic :
Is Slim Thug the boss ?
Am I the boss ?
In Mr Thug ’s case , we may never know for sure .
Unfortunately , due to the fact that I have never actually killed a police officer , I know that I am , for the time being ( per the first equation above ) , logically precluded from being The Boss .

Zimbardo ’s foundation gives hope to Sicilian students
Courtesy of Philip Zimbardo Stanford professor emeritus Philip Zimbardo is surrounded by students of Cammarata at their first meeting after announcing the scholarship program funded by his foundation .
Courtesy of Philip Zimbardo Cammarata , Sicily , is about 40 miles from Palermo .
Whenever Philip Zimbardo asked his Italian grandfather where his family came from , the answer was vague — a little village outside Palermo .
That small burg , however , was to have a major impact on the emeritus psychology professor ’s life .
His effect on his ancestral village has been just as big .
With his new Philip G. Zimbardo Educational Foundation , he hopes to shift the educational landscape for many Sicilian students .
Zimbardo is a name well known in the world of psychology .
Most people know Zimbardo as the author of the Stanford Prison Experiment .
Others know him for his Shyness Clinic .
The average American , of course , remembers him for his PBS series , Discovering Psychology , now used in high schools and colleges nationwide .
For generations of students , he has been a popular mentor and teacher .
But when a television interview was broadcast throughout Italy in 2005 , his sense of identity shifted .
For one small village , he was first and foremost a Zimbardo .
“ I started getting e-mails and letters from people in a town called Cammarata .
People were saying , ‘ You must be connected to us , because there are a hundred Zimbardos in this village , ’ ” he recalled .
“ They said , ‘ How come you have n’t contacted us ? ’
Well , I did n’t know you existed . ”
On his visit to Cammarata , about 40 minutes outside Palermo , he learned he was already a star .
He still becomes animated when he describes the experience : “ In every store window , bars and restaurants , there ’s a big poster of the Statue of Liberty , and it says , ‘ From America :
The world ’s most famous psychologist is a son of Cammarata . ’
And the mayor greets me in a red - white - and - green sash , and everybody ’s out hugging and kissing .
We go to the church and the priest takes out the old records and sure , there ’s my grandfather there .
“ It ’s three or four hours to eat one meal and with wine , and family , and fun , and it was great .
And the kids were all over . ”
For Zimbardo , however , Cammarata foreshadowed the themes that were to become central to his 2008 book , The Time Paradox : The New Psychology of Time That Will Change Your Life ( coauthored with John Boyd ) , which explores the need to balance the past , present and future .
That day in Cammarata , Zimbardo went to the local high school with a translator and told the student assembly that had gathered to see him :
“ You ’re so lucky , because you have this wonderful rich , vibrant past . ”
Praising the households where extended families were all living together , he noted the community also has a healthy dose of “ present hedonism , with good food , good wine and , given all the kids , probably good sex as well . ”
In need of a future
“ The only thing you ’re missing is a future , ” he said .
“ Unemployment is 41 percent in this town , and that means it ’s going to be very hard to get a job , unless you get a college education , you have computer skills , you learn English , you travel outside of Sicily .
You have to discover a marketable skill .
What is it that you can do that your town needs , that people will pay for ? ”
He arranged to have the chief executive officer of Overstock.com , Stanford alumnus Patrick Byrne , ship 20 new PCs to the school ; prior to that , the school had only one computer .
Soliciting funds from colleagues and friends along with his own contributions , Zimbardo founded the Philip G. Zimbardo Educational Foundation , providing scholarships for eight students a year ( four boys and four girls ) .
Scholarships for local colleges are 1,000 Euros each , based on merit , grades and all - round performance .
An additional scholarship is offered for a high school graduate who has had to overcome adversity — either a physical , psychological or familial difficulty .
Every other year , the foundation arranges for several students to visit Zimbardo and his family and colleagues in America .
“ It ’s only a small number , but essentially it creates a sense of hope , ” said Zimbardo .
“ Things could get better , things could change . ”
Moreover , the foundation , which is not yet fully endowed , arranges and funds annual conferences of scientific and cultural exchanges in the twin towns of Cammarata and San Giovanni Gemini and also donates funds to a local nonprofit organization for children with physical and mental disabilities .
“ Thanks to Professor Philip Zimbardo , we have been promoting in both the towns a new culture based on hope and sense of future , characteristics that were almost absent among our children , ” said Pasquale Marino , Sicilian director of the foundation .
“ A new spirit is developing here , and to my surprise , it seems to be contagious even in other towns near Cammarata and San Giovanni Gemini . ”
Beyond Cammarata
It has been contagious on this side of the Atlantic as well :
The chief executive officer of Seagate Technology , Stanford alumnus Steve Luczo , contacted Zimbardo to discuss his own Italian roots in the city made famous by The Godfather .
Luczo ’s grandmother emigrated from Corleone when she was barely old enough to remember it .
“ My grandmother always spoke of her home and the lush fruit orchards and vineyards , based on the stories her mom told her , ” he said .
“ She always said in her Sicilian - accented English : ‘ She shoulda never left dat place … dat land was beautiful . ’ ”
Within a year after their first conversation and with a major donation from Luczo , Zimbardo had recruited the mayor of Corleone as an ally , and the foundation gave its first 10 scholarships to its students in early June this year .
The “ talented , ambitious and grateful students ” were “ amazed that their family from America had remembered them , ” said Luczo .
Zimbardo , a man who has had many missions over a lifetime , now has a new one : “ For me , it ’s really been transformative — to connect deeply to my roots , ” he said .
“ I ’m somebody who is anchored or embedded in a cultural heritage as well as the heritage of my lineage over time .
It ’s really been enlightening and enriching , ” he said .
“ The more I think about it , there are a lot of Sicilian Americans who have some money to try to do this in all these little small towns , ” he said .
“ Most kids live at home , so a relatively small scholarship goes a really long way .
“ For me , it ’s one of the most exciting things I ’ve done , and it also gives me an excuse to go to Sicily every year . ”
Luczo would agree : “ To see and smell and dig in the dirt that my Grandma had so often talked about was beyond description , ” he said .
“ And it was as beautiful as she said . ”

A New South Wales woman travelling in the Northern Territory accidentally submerged her four - wheel - drive in a crocodile - infested river after mistaking a boat ramp for a river crossing .
Photographs released by police show a crocodile lurking close to where the woman's white Troop Carrier became stranded in the East Alligator River , about 300 kilometres east of Darwin .
Police said the woman had mistaken a boat ramp for Cahill 's Crossing , where vehicles are able to cross the river between Kakadu and Arnhem Land .
In 1987 , a 40 - year - old man was decapitated by a five metre crocodile near the area where the woman 's car became submerged .
Two people , including a 11 - year - old girl , have been killed by crocodiles in the Territory this year .
Police say the woman was able to get out of her vehicle and back to the riverbank without any problems from crocodiles .
But they have reminded tourists to take extreme care near Top End waterways .
" Members of the public need to be reminded that when travelling through the NT it is their responsibility to research the area and be aware of the extreme road conditions , especially that of remote areas , " Brevet Sergeant Ben Higgins said .
" All water crossings should be considered extremely dangerous and exceptional care should be taken to avoid similar incidents such as these , especially considering the number and size of crocodiles that inhabit remote waterways . "
Feinstein : Holder should have waited
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif .. ) , the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , criticized Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday for moving ahead with an investigation into harsh CIA interrogation techniques .
“ Candidly , I wish the attorney general had waited , ” Feinstein said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ” .
“ Every day something kind of dribbles out into the public arena .
Very often it has mistakes , very often it ’s half a story .
I think we need to get the whole story together and tell it in an appropriate way . ”
Feinstein said that her committee was in the midst of taking a “ total look ” at the intelligence agency ’s interrogation and detention practices .
“ We ’re well along in that study , ” she said .
“ And I ’m trying to push it along even more quickly . ”
Though the she was “ horrified ” by the findings of the 2004 report by the CIA 's Inspector General ’s detailing cases of prisoner abuse , the senator said the timing of the Justice Department inquiry was “ not very good . ”
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz ) also expressed his concern with Holder ’s decision on the same program , saying that he was worried about the “ morale and effectiveness ” of the CIA .
He said he supported President Barack Obama ’s conclusion that “ we ought to go forward and not back . ”
McCain said that although torture has “ harmed our image in the world ” and served as a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda , “ for us now to go back , I think would be a serious mistake . ”

New public , private and college - based programs are targeting a grim and growing market : unemployed college graduates who can't afford to repay their student loans .
This week , BridgeSpan Financial , a start - up based in Washington , D.C. , introduced SafeStart , a product designed to protect borrowers from the risk of defaulting on their loans .
For an upfront payment of $ 40 to $ 60 per $ 1,000 of student debt , SafeStart will provide an interest - free line of credit that borrowers can use to repay federal student loans for up to five years after graduation .
ADVICE : How college students should handle debt
To tap the line of credit , the graduate must be unemployed or have loan payments that exceed 10 % of income .
Once the borrower 's circumstances improve , the individual has up to five years to repay the interest - free loan .
Currently , borrowers with federal student loans who are experiencing economic hardship can postpone payments for a specific period of time by applying for deferment or forbearance .
But depending on the type of loan , interest may accrue during that period , leaving borrowers even deeper in debt , says Carlo Salerno , a principal for BridgeSpan .
Also targeting cash - strapped borrowers : • Bellevue University , a private university in Nebraska that primarily enrolls adult students , says students who are laid off can have tuition , fees and loan obligations deferred for up to six months .
The program is designed to prevent laid - off students from dropping out or taking on more debt , says Scott Klene , senior director of student financial services .
• A new government program allows borrowers with federal student loans to sign up for a repayment plan that caps payments based on their income .
About 8,700 borrowers who have loans through the federal Direct Loan program have applied since the program 's July 1 launch , the Department of Education says .
Most borrowers who qualify for the program wo n't have to spend more than 10 % of their income on loan payments .
Borrowers whose income falls below 150 % of the poverty level wo n't have to make any payments , says Lauren Asher , acting president of the Project on Student Debt .
The latest Education Department figures estimate that student loan default rates rose to 6.9 % for fiscal 2007 , from 5.2 % a year earlier .
The consequences of default are severe :
The loan balance becomes due , and the government can garnish the borrower 's wages and withhold tax refunds .

Strikeforce announced today that former PRIDE FC Heavyweight Champion and Affliction MMA headliner Fedor Emelianenko ( 30 - 1 ) has signed a multi- fight contract with the San Jose - based mixed martial arts promotion under a special co-promotion agreement with M - 1 Global .
" The Last Emperor " was in cruise control under the Affliction MMA banner after back - to - back wins over former UFC Heavyweight Champions Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovski .
He was in line for a WAMMA title defense against Josh Barnett at the Aug. 1 ' Trilogy ' event until " The Babyface Assassin " got popped for steroids in a random pre-fight drug test .
The financially unstable promotion closed up shop shortly thereafter , leaving Emelianenko ( once again ) the hottest free agent in mixed martial arts .
The Russian gladiator was first up for grabs following the collapse of Pride FC in 2007 .
The UFC lobbied hard to bring the Sambo champion on board however , talks broke down when the parties could not agree on an exclusive fight contract , eventually leading him to Affliction under his terms .
It was those terms that once again failed to bring him to the Octagon despite the financial efforts of Zuffa , who went on record with a guarantee that he would never see a deal as lucrative as the one they offered .
In the end , co-promotion was apparently more important than cash , as Strikeforce brings M - 1 Global into a partnership similar to the one it had with the now - defunct Elite XC back in 2008 .
From Vadim Finkelchtein , President of M - 1 Global :
" I am very happy and excited about the upcoming collaboration with Strikeforce .
We are very pleased that we found a reliable partner and I feel that Strikeforce and M - 1 can support each other on many things .
This will create big opportunities for both parties to test their fighters against worthy opponents . "
Strikeforce currently has a heavyweight roster that 's comprised of potential opponents like Brett Rogers , Fabricio Werdum and Alistair Overeem .
From Emelianenko :
" I am looking forward to going back to work and fighting at the highest level .
Strikeforce is a top fight promotion that houses some of the greatest fighters in the world .
I am prepared to fight any of them . "
Most of the mixed martial arts community is presumably anxious to hear Zuffa 's reaction after their intense negotiations with M - 1 Global that ended with incredulous frustration .
In the meantime , fans can look forward to finally seeing the Stary Oskol native make his much anticipated debut inside a cage .
It 's worth noting that Brett Rogers was holding out for an October fight when first approached as a fill - in for Josh Barnett .
With Emelianenko's debut penciled in for Fall 2009 , perhaps that 's a match we 'll get to see after all .
Man , I 'm bored .

Представьте себе у
Вас завтрак !
Вы хотите выпить кокосового сока , открываете пачку , а там на дне… .
Смотрите , что нашли в пачке кокосового сока .
Я такого раньше не видел !
Собственно , большой кусок свинины плавал там .
Как же так ?
Это уже другой вопрос .
Ваши идеи ?
If you believe that all the good men are already taken , does n’t it follow that you ’d be more interested in a married ( or otherwise engaged ) guy ?
It ’s been found to be true of other female animals — even fish and birds — they all prefer to “ poach ” males already chosen by other females .
And I describe in BLONDES , studies have found that men who are in the company of an attractive woman ( especially if they ’re smiling at him ) are more desirable to female judges .
But are women more likely to chase that guy if he ’s already taken ?
Psychologists at the University of Oklahoma wanted to know , so they recruited nearly 200 heterosexual men and women , some of whom were single and others who were in relationships .
Told only that they were participating in a study on attraction , they were shown a photo of an opposite - sex stranger and answered questions about their attraction to that person :
How likely would you show interest ?
How likely would you be to initiate conversation ?
How likely would you be to initiate a romantic relationship with this person ?
The psychologists also attached a relationship status to the person in the photo : either single or in a relationship .
Turns out the relationship status made a tremendous difference — but only when it comes to women choosing men , and not the other way around .
As expected , women in relationships were less attracted to the stranger than single women were , regardless of the man ’s relationship status .
But here ’s the interesting result : single women were more attracted to the man , and more likely to initiate a relationship with him , when told he was in a relationship than when told he was single .
According to the psychologists , an attached man signals desirable resources and a willingness to commit to family life .
He ’s been tested , “ pre-screened . ”
Simply put , commitment makes men more attractive .
As for men , a woman ’s relationship status , at least in this study , had little effect on her attractiveness Single men were slightly ( although not significantly ) more attracted to the woman when told she was single .
Attached men were slightly ( although not significantly ) more attracted to a woman when told she was attached .
Of course , bear in mind that this study is based on photos and is hypothetical .
I suspect a man ’s partner has some influence over whether a single woman dares move in on her territory .
Is she beautiful ?
Is she the jealous type ?
And what happens after a divorce or break - up ?
Is a divorced man more attractive than one who never committed ?
Republicans , frustrated in their attempts to undercut President Barack Obama 's first high court choice , said they were still worried Sotomayor would bring bias and a political agenda to the bench .
" It 's muddled , confusing , backtracking on issue after issue , " complained Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the top Republican on the Judiciary panel .
" I frankly am a bit disappointed in the lack of clarity and consistency in her answers . "
Alabama 's courtly but hate - filled Klan senator ventured off
Fox for a moment to complain on CNN that Judge Sotomayor is n't answering questions to his satisfaction and he called her testimony " muddled " and unclear , comparing her testimony to Alito 's and Roberts ' .
Since the KKK 's most outspoken leader in the House of Lords is n't known for having any intelligence -- he could n't get into a real school and attended an unaccredited Bible College -- Senator Reid 's office put together an actual video showing Alito 's and Roberts ' clarity , consistency and forthrightness in answering questions .
Behind all this ?
GOP extremists ' unwillingness to accept that the law gives women the right to reproductive choice .
The Republicans are doing their best to trip her up but have n't succeeded .
As I noted in a comment replying to a reader comment , the thing about trying to watch Little Jeff Sessions is that he always makes me think of the actor Henry Gibson , except that Henry Gibson at least has a shot at being entertaining .
So now I 'm thinking , since Little Jeff 's inquisition has been such a bust , even from the R propaganda standpoint , why do n't they get Henry Gibson to play the part ?
He could do it in character as the grumpy , utterly cuckoo judge he played on .
I did n't find the character all that funny , but then , I do n't find Little Jeff very funny either .

I have n't really delved too much into the Twilight bashing that 's swept the Internet lately .
Part of this is my wariness of nerd - on - nerd violence in general , but perhaps more importantly , I also had no interest in learning anything at all about Twilight .
In fact , aside from the barely - legal variety , I do n't really have an interest in teenagers either .
However when news broke last week of a possible Twilight Massively Multiplayer Game being created , my interest was finally piqued .
The idea of a community combining MMO players ( sweaty , pale , pathetic ) with Twilight fans ( pale , pathetic ) was too much to pass up .
" What a great way to offend millions of people . "
I said , right before penning this article , which if I got everything right , will offend millions of people .
Probably you , in fact .
So , you know , heads up .
From a gaming perspective , lots of questions are raised by the prospect of a Twilight MMO .
Will the game be a conventional World of Warcraft MMORPG , with it 's dungeons , monsters and equipment hoarding masses , except now set in the fearsome and epic landscape of western Washington ?
Or would it be a sort of electronic brothel , with vampires exchanging come - hither looks with werewolves and owls fucking leprechauns , all set in the erotic and sensual landscape of western Washington ?
What would a " 25 man raid " entail exactly ?
To find out how a MMO like this would go down with the Twilight community , I decided to ask around in a popularTwilight forum .
For the sake of your eyes , I did n't take screenshots of my experiences there .
For some reason
Twilight fans use forums like they were chatrooms and , as every single person had a 300 - pixel tall signature , all of which look like this :
... it would have made this article 65 pages long , broken your monitors and collapsed the Internet into a really stupid singularity .
You 're welcome .
The transcript of my attempts to gather feedback are below .
This was all copied verbatim , with the exception of the smileys .
If it helps , imagine there 's about six - billion of these : scattered throughout .

At that point I got a private message from GavinOwnsABoat announcing I had been kicked off the forum , and IP - banned .
Standing up from my computer , I left my office and walked into the hall .
Seconds later , Gladstone came flying out of his office , his eyes damp .
He grabbed me by my huge , fashionable lapels and shook me .
" Can you fix my computer ?
I just got kicked off a forum for no reason ! "
A terrible sound violated the air , seemingly coming from all directions .
It took a few moments before I understood it was Gladstone , vibrating at an incredible speed .
I frowned .
So they had IP - banned the whole office network .
This would be tricky .
I walked down the hall to Cracked Editor Jack O'Brien 's office and stuck my head in .

The fossil was discovered in Russia in 1994
A 260 - million - year - old fossil is the oldest known tree - dwelling creature , according to researchers .
Scientists described the finding as the earliest evidence in the fossil record of an " opposable thumb " .
In the Royal Society journal Proceedings B , they described how the animal 's elongated hands and fingers would have helped it to grip and climb .
This , they say , shows an evolutionary change that allowed animals to live in trees , away from terrestrial predators .
The fossilised creature , named Suminia getmanovi , has been dated to late Permian period , 100 million years earlier than the first known tree - dwelling mammal .
It was first discovered in Russia in 1994 .
But for lead author Jorg Frobisch , from the Field Museum in Chicago , US , said this study was the first opportunity to examine its whole skeleton .
He told BBC News that he and his colleagues looked in most detail at the fossil 's hands - comparing them to other , living terrestrial and tree - dwelling animals .
Suminia , he explained , was a small animal - about 50 cm ( 20 inches ) from its nose to the tip of its tail .
" But for the size of its body , it had relatively long limbs , and very long hands and feet , " said Dr Frobisch .
" The hands and feet made up almost half of the length of its whole limb , " he continued .
" That 's humungous , if you compare it to your own arm . "
The ends of its fingers were long , slender and curved - like claws .
" In life these probably would have been covered in a hard , keratinous coating , much like in modern - day birds , " Dr Frobisch explained .
These would have helped the small creature to grip and climb .
Thumb - like appendages and claws allowed the creature to climb
But the most significant observation the team made was that one finger on each hand and foot was " opposed " to the rest , much like a thumb .
" It 's the first time in the fossil record that we 've seen evidence of an opposable thumb , " he said , adding that the creature was an early ancestor of mammals .
Between the time when Suminia lived , and the period to which fossils of the earliest - known tree - dwelling mammals have been dated , there is a gap of about 100 million years .
" It 's exciting to see the evidence of an initial and successful evolutionary change or diversification that was successful and allowed these small animals to live in the trees , " said Dr Frobisch .
The evolution of its specialised hands and feet , he explained , would have allowed Suminia to escape the fierce competition for food on the ground and avoid predators .
Simon Conway Morris , a palaeobiologist from the University of Cambridge described the finding as " very exciting " .
" It shows once again that things in evolution can happen far earlier than might be expected , " he told BBC News .
" In this case a vertebrate , specifically a synapsid - from which the mammals themselves emerged - was ahead of the game of climbing trees .
In fact it was about 30 million years ahead of schedule . "

EXCLUSIVE :
A month after they voted to punish some corporate executives for taking hefty bonus payouts , members of the House of Representatives quietly gave their own staffers a new potential bonus by making even their top - earning aides eligible for taxpayer dollars to repay their student loans .
The change , which took effect in May , means House employees earning up to $ 168,411 , or the top level , are now eligible for government - funded subsidies to help pay down their student loans .
House officials defend the change as a job - related benefit necessary to keep the government competitive in the hiring market - the same argument corporate chieftains used to defend their own pay scales .
“ There ’s still a tremendous demand for high - end Hill talent even in this current job market .
Expanding eligibility for the benefit allows us to retain valued and seasoned personnel who might otherwise be lured away to more financially lucrative pursuits , ” said Kyle Anderson , a spokesman for the House Administration Committee .
The committee , which has jurisdiction over internal House employment , salaries and expenses , directed House officials to make the change .
But taxpayer advocacy groups said that straightforward salary increases - not new perks and bonuses - are the best way to attract and retain talent .
Offering bonuses to some of the best - paid Capitol staffers just feeds into popular resentment toward Washington , said Thomas A. Schatz , president of Citizens Against Government Waste .
“ It ’s another example of the imperial Congress and setting themselves aside from the rest of the country , ” Mr. Schatz said .
“ It goes along with the congressional jets , the executive jets .
It goes along with the travel .
It fits in with all the concerns about spending generally in Washington . ”
Although widely used in the federal work force , the job - related perk of paying off an employee ’s college bills is rarely offered in the private sector , employment analysts say .
The move to boost the income cap was made just a month after the House voted 328- 93 in March to slap a 90 percent tax on bonuses for executives from companies that took bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The Senate never followed suit , and the bill did n’t become law .
The salaries and dollar amounts involved in those bonuses were far higher than what ’s at stake in the House program .
The House program is expected to cost $ 12.6 million this fiscal year .
As of August , it was making payments for 2,251 staffers .
The Office of the Chief Administrative Officer , the branch of the House that administers the program , is unable to estimate how many of those staffers are taking part under the new , higher - income limits , spokesman Jeff Ventura said .
Mr. Ventura said that , with members of the House up for election every two years , job security is uncertain and the student loan program helps attract talent .
“ We regard this benefit as a major job recruitment and retention tool , ” he said .
“ Even in a bad job market , we compete with the private sector for the kind of talented employees government work today demands . ”
The House program pays up to $ 10,000 a year , with a maximum lifetime benefit of $ 60,000 .
Staffers making any salary are now eligible , though their total compensation - including the loan repayment - cannot exceed the 2009 cap of $ 168,411 .
From 2008 through May of this year , the cap was $ 145,159 .
Each representative decides which of his or her staffers can receive the benefit .
The funds do not come out of each congressional office ’s budget , but there is a cap on how much each office can spend on the repayments .
That cap was also boosted by 75 percent in May .
Student loan repayments are not limited to the House .
The Senate offers a far less generous program than the House , while many executive branch agencies offer a similar program .
The Senate income eligibility cap for its program is $ 146,500 this year , which is about $ 23,000 less than the maximum a staffer could make .
The Senate caps lifetime payments at $ 40,000 - $ 20,000 less than the House .
A spokeswoman for the secretary of the Senate , who administers the program , said the program will cost $ 4.7 million this year .
That ’s up from $ 1 million in 2002 , when the program began , but down from 2003 , the peak year , when the Senate spent $ 6.8 million .
The spokeswoman would not give details about who participates in the program and referred questions to the committees with oversight over the program .
Executive branch agencies , meanwhile , provide an extensive annual accounting of their student loan benefit program , and it appears to be just as popular as the House program .
In 2008 , federal agencies spent more than $ 51 million to repay loans for 6,879 employees , at an average benefit of $ 7,511 .
The 2008 figure is a 22 percent jump over the previous year .
Like House staff members , executive branch employees are limited to $ 10,000 per year and $ 60,000 over their lifetimes .
The loan repayments are taxable .

The bottle of cheap perfume you put on this morning does not make you sexy , it makes you smell , bad .
No one wants to see your boobs , no matter how many push up - bras , bottles of glue , and rolls of duct - tape it took to get them above your belly button .
You all are loud and drunk , and obviously you do not like coffee by the massive amount of creamer and sugar you put in .
I mean really ladies , 9 creamers and 12 packets of sugar for one fucking cup of coffee ?!?

More napkins , once again i run to get napkins .

The Best Drama noms are the usual cavalcade of grown - up shows .
Great to see friendly faces like House , Dexter and Big Love .
Sadly , with so many popular standouts , there was apparently no room at the inn for The Shield , Sons of Anarchy or Battlestar Galactica .
Blah .
Also not nominated this year ?
True Blood .
Hmmm ...
Over in Best Comedy , it 's good to see fan faves HIMYM , The Office , 30 Rock and Weeds .
The Big Bang
Theory got no love as a series , but Family Guy and Flight of the Conchords were happily recognized !
The Best Reality noms salute the very deserving The Amazing Race and the gold standards of glossy reality shows , Project Runway and Top Chef .
But we can't help but be bummed that Dancing With the Stars was nominated , while So You Think You Can Dance was dissed as a series .
We persist in thinking that SYTYCD is educational TV magic that belongs in the Smithsonian as part of the national record of American culture .
Still , congrats to NappyTabs , Mia Michaels , Tyce Diorio and Dmitry Chaplin for their choreography nods !
Another treat we 're delighted to get is Elisabeth Moss ' Best Drama Actress nomination for Mad Men !
Peggy is the best !
We 're disappointed to not see Lost 's Evangeline Lilly or Elizabeth Mitchell , but it 's nice to see an underdog in the gang along with perennial contender Mariska Hargitay and the likes of Glenn Close and Holly Hunter .
( Can we say something evil ?
Is it just us or do the Emmy nominators seem to always save a few slots for " Oscar - winning female who deigns to do TV " ?
And why ca n't Mary McDonnell get some of that action ?
Her two Oscar nominations and her four years of brilliance on BSG are not chopped liver ! )
Oh , and speaking of actresses who were robbed : Where the hell is Connie Britton for Friday Night Lights ?!
The Best Drama Actor nods are perfectly respectable , but again , ugh , why no room for the sexy people ?!
No Lost , BSG , True Blood , Kyle Chandler , nothing !
Over in Comedy land , Christina Applegate got an acting nod , which leaves ABC looking a little silly for canceling Samantha Who ? , and Sarah Silverman makes a first - time appearance .
Sarah Silverman , your Twitter is too dirty for us to follow , but you seem like a cool girl .
But even though the Best Comedy Actress category is populated with the likes of our god Tina Fey and the insanely talented Toni Collette , we still want Mary - Louise Parker to win for Weeds .
And not just because of her recent Esquire spread , although that was pretty damn hot , too .
The Best Comedy Actor category includes Tony Shalhoub because apparently that is an inevitability .
( He 's the nicest guy in the world , but seriously ?
Every !
Year ! )
At least that dull routine was leavened by the first - time nom for Jim Parsons .
Also yay for Steve Carell and Alec Baldwin .
But no Zachary Levi for Chuck ?
Come on people !
Watch the TV before you vote !

The state pension retirement age could be increased further , the UK 's pensions regulator has told the BBC .
David Norgrove said rising life expectancy meant millions of people would " undoubtedly " have to wait longer in future to draw a state pension .
People will not save as much for retirement as in the past , with many people " frightened " to do so , he said .
The state pension age is due to rise to 68 , and Pensions Minister Angela Eagle said there were no plans to raise that .
Government debt Currently , the state pension age is 60 for women and 65 for men , but four years ago Lord Turner published a report calling for it to rise to 68 for everyone by 2050 .
But Mr Norgrove said he thought it would end up higher .
Mr Norgrove said : " People are going to have to work longer , partly because we 're not going , as a nation , to save as much for retirement as we did in the past . "
STATE PENSIONS
Currently , pensionable age is 60 for women , 65 for men
For both sexes , that will rise to 66 in 2024 , to 67 in 2034 and to 68 in 2044
The time it takes to qualify for a full basic state pension will be cut to 30 years From 2012 , people will be automatically enrolled in a low - cost , opt - out national savings scheme
He added : " The government 's recent legislation is increasing the state retirement age progressively to 68 .
I think it will end up higher than that . "
He said the ability of the current working generation to pay for the retirement of its predecessor would be " a real issue for the next 30 years " , not least because of a lack of knowledge among the public about how to save .
" The evidence is that people generally are frightened of saving for pensions , " he said .
" They think that pensions are very complicated .
Actually , pensions in many ways are quite simple .
Once you 've made the initial decision you can let it run . "
With life expectancy rising each year , many people argue that the government simply cannot afford to maintain state benefits at their current levels .
Any potential shortfall has come sharply into focus following the massive increase in government debt amid the financial crisis , during which it has spent billions of pounds trying to boost the UK economy .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Money has got to be found to pay pensions as life expectancy increases .
So either we have to pay more tax or the pension age has to increase Paul Goddard However , Ms Eagle said there was " no point " raising the state retirement age beyond 68 .
She told the BBC : " We believe that we 've covered the predictions of increased life expectancy adequately in the legislation and unless these statistics change we 'll have periodic reviews , but it wo n't happen for another generation .
" I think it 's important that people can predict accurately when the retirement age is if we 're trying to persuade them to save into pensions , and that 's what we 're trying to do .
So there is certainty there . "
Patrick South from the charity Age Concern and Help the Aged welcomed the government 's response , arguing there were better ways to enable older people to continue working .
" Any increase in the state pension age would affect the poorest people disproportionately , " Mr South said .
" Far better to focus on the barriers that currently prevent people working past 65 , and chief among those is the default retirement age which enables employers to compulsorily retire people when they reach the age of sixty five . "
Plummet in value Experts say people will have to rely far more on company and private pensions arrangements in the future .
As part of his pensions review , Lord Turner called for employees to be enrolled automatically in their company 's pension scheme to encourage more people to save for their retirement .
However , Mr Norgrove warned that generous company pension schemes , such as final salary arrangements , were in " long - term decline " , partly because government rules had made them too expensive for businesses to run .
But he said : " I think there 's a good chance that we 'll see a core of companies continuing to offer final salary schemes , particularly big companies . "
Earlier this week , figures from consultant Lane Clarke & Peacock showed that Britain 's leading companies have seen their pension schemes plummet in value over the past year .
It said firms listed in the FTSE 100 index now had a combined deficit of £ 96bn , the largest on record .
The good thing about pension schemes is that , by and large , they 're a very slow matter
David Norgrove
This compared with a £ 41bn deficit in mid-July 2008 and a surplus of £ 12bn in the same month of 2007 .
Just as the government may struggle to keep paying state pensions , some companies already say they can no longer afford to pay out .
Earlier this month American Express announced that it had suspended pension contributions for all its UK employees for the next 18 months , saying payments had become unaffordable .
But Mr Norgrove said he expected the impact of the economic downturn on the majority of pension schemes to be " manageable " .
" Inevitably , in a serious recession , we 're going to see more companies going insolvent , but I do n't think at the moment we see this as a crisis , " he said .
" The good thing about pension schemes is that , by and large , they 're a very slow matter .
This is n't like the banking system that can collapse overnight .
" Generally speaking , if the sponsoring company stays in business there 's time to work this out . "
The full interview with David Norgrove can be seen on Leading Questions with Robert Peston on the BBC News channel at 2230 BST on Saturday .

Video : D’Artagnan Collier speaks on Detroit mayoral campaign
8 July 2009
D’Artagnan Collier , the Socialist Equality Party ’s candidate for Detroit Mayor , discusses the economic crisis and the political issues facing workers in Detroit .
WASHINGTON
THE “ cash for clunkers ” program will be back in full swing this weekend after President Obama signed a program extension on Friday .
The $ 2 billion infusion should help dealers sell thousands of cars to customers who can reap a bounty of $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 for trading in an old vehicle .
The short - term effect will be obvious , but the program ’s longer - term value  either as a method of stimulating the economy or saving energy  is less clear .
Economists say that most buyers simply moved up the timing of their purchase , and that the projected gasoline savings are exaggerated because many of the trade - ins were seldom used .
The program ’s first $ 1 billion was considered money well spent , at least by the new car industry , because it lured a quarter - million buyers into dealerships ; the vehicles they purchased would go about 60 percent farther on a gallon of gasoline than the ones they turned in .
But measuring the stimulative effect of the program would require employing scientific methods like those used in drug trials , where some participants are given a placebo instead of the drug being tested .
The problem , according to market experts , is that nearly everyone who bought new cars would have done so at some point anyway .
The LaRouche Cult and the Health Care Protests
Created : August 19 , 2009 10:57 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
After noting that the disturbed woman who accused Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) of supporting a “ Nazi policy ” was a LaRouche cultist , I checked out the trove of videos that LaRouche ’s Virginia - based organization has made available since the health care debate began ; they upload new ones at least once daily at their YouTube channel .
And comparing their rhetoric to the rhetoric of mainstream Republicans is downright eerie .
Take this video , in which Leandra Bernstein of LaRouchePAC.com makes the case that a “ mass strike ” is on .
Predictably , the LaRouchePAC takes full credit for the protests against Democratic members of Congress : “ The White House has been in a defensive flight forward fit ever since Lyndon LaRouche and LaRouchePAC exposed his Nazi health reform . ”
The protesters are real Americans : “ It is not a group of Brooks Brothers - wearing protesters or highly - paid , highly - groomed astroturf organizations . ”
The death panel threat is real : “ The population as a whole has come to realize that their lives are being directly threatened by Obama ’s health policy . ”
The flag@whitehouse.gov campaign was a “ snitch ” program : “ They have called for informants to monitor the Internet for criticism of the White House ’s reform policy . ”
The president ’s advisers support euthanasia : “ They ’ve seen Ezekiel Emanuel ’s utilitarian scheme to calculate the value of a human life , and his recommendation to euthanize patients with conditions that are cost - ineffective , or the patients that the state deems unfit due to age , disability , or disease . ”
That point is illustrated by this ultra-classy image :
Now , obviously , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) would never make a comparison like that .
But compare her rhetoric to the LaRouchePAC’s .
This has always been a smear against Emanuel , an outspoken opponent of euthanasia .
It ’s the sort of thing that would usually be limited to the LaRouche cult .
But it has n’t been limited to them .

The Other Looming Debate Over ‘ Cash for Clunkers ’ Funding
Created : August 06 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
i Stockphoto
While Senate leaders have reached agreement on a $ 2 billion extension of the cash for clunkers program , many lawmakers are already bracing for a more distant confrontation :
The likely debate over how to return that funding to * another stimulus program that it came from .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
The House last Friday provided the generous lifeline to the wildly popular clunkers program — which grants drivers up to $ 4,500 to scrap their gas guzzlers for more fuel efficient vehicles — and the Senate is poised to pass that bill Thursday .
But there ’s a glitch .
The proposal steals its funding from a Department of Energy program encouraging the development of renewable energy technologies .
That initiative , granted $ 6 billion under this year ’s stimulus bill , provides federal loan guarantees to clean energy projects — including solar , wind and biofuel innovations — in hopes of spurring private investment in those industries .
Tens of billions of dollars in loan applications are before the DOE , but the program funding was seen by lawmakers as low - hanging fruit because it would n’t be spent until next year , at the earliest .
The saga has created a dilemma for a number of lawmakers who support the cash for clunkers extension but do n’t want to pilfer from the loan guarantee program to fund it .
“ I would hate to see us take money from that source , ” Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) , who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , told CNBC on Tuesday .
“ I hope we can find an alternative . ”
They did n’t .
Although seven amendments to the House proposal will be offered on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon , none aims to locate a new source of the $ 2 billion .
The Senate plans to vote on final passage later in the day , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) announced Wednesday night .
Indeed , with the House having left town Friday for a five - week vacation , any changes at all to the House - passed bill are unlikely .
The reason ?
If the Senate alters the proposal , then either ( 1 ) cash for clunkers will have to forgo the additional funds until Congress returns in September , or ( 2 ) House lawmakers will have to return from recess to iron out the differences between the two bills .
In light of the overwhelming popularity of the program , the former option is a political landmine .
And on Wednesday , the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) pretty much ruled out the latter scenario .
“ The House is n’t coming back , ” said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly , “ so that ‘s just a dumb idea . ”
More likely , the Senate will pass the House bill , and push to replenish the $ 2 billion loan funding at a later date .
Indeed , Democratic leaders have gone out of their way to assure Bingaman and other loan guarantee supporters that the money will be replaced .
Shortly after Friday ’s House vote , for example , President Obama vowed to work with Congress to replace the funding “ down the road . ”
On the same day , Pelosi promoted the importance of having all $ 6 billion available for the loan program .
And , responding to concerns voiced by Rep. Edward Markey ( D - Mass . ) , House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey ( D - Wis. ) said Democratic leaders “ have every intention of restoring these funds . ”
But that might be easier said than done .
With the Democrats hoping to pass a health reform agenda tickling the $ 1 trillion mark , finding ways to pay for another $ 2 billion program wo n’t be easy .
And in the wake of spending hundreds of billions of dollars salvaging the economy , many in Congress have lost their tolerance for deficit spending .
This is true not only in the eyes of conservative deficit hawks , but also some Democrats as well .
Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , for example , had hinged her support for cash for clunkers on a single mantra :
No new spending .
On her Twitter account , the Missouri Democrat said Monday that she “ may support ” the addition funding – ” if it is $ already appropriated for stimulus . ”
A failure to reinstall the “ borrowed ” $ 2 billion would spell bad news for the renewable fuels and technologies industries , which are banking on the loan program to jump - start the innovations that might wean the country from its current reliance on foreign oil .
“ For the U.S. long - term auto and fuel needs , it seems counterproductive to limit the renewable fuels industry , ” Bob Dinneen , president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association , said in a statement last week .
Supporters of the loan guarantee program also argue that , even if it lacks the catchy name and political appeal of cash for clunkers , it provides much more bang for the buck .
Indeed , each $ 1 provided under the loan guarantee program is estimated to spur $ 10 in additional investment and spending .
“ $ 2 billion in the cash for clunkers program results in $ 2 billion worth of economic activity , ” Sam Jaffe , senior research analyst at IDC Energy Insights , a consulting firm , wrote for Greentech Media on Tuesday .
“ $ 2 billion in loan guarantees will result in at least $ 20 billion worth of economic activity , all of which will have to take place on U.S. soil . ”
Not that cash for clunkers does n’t have any environmental or stimulus benefits .
On Wednesday , the Department of Transportation released figures revealing that , of the nearly 185,000 transactions prompted by the program , the average fuel efficiency of new purchases is 25.3 miles per gallon , while the average mileage for the trade - ins is 15.8 mpg .
Figures like those have alleviated some lawmakers ’ criticisms that the program ’s mileage requirements do n’t go far enough to encourage the purchase of small , energy efficient vehicles .
Sens. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) and Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) , for example , had vowed to oppose any new funding unless the mileage thresholds were made more stringent .
On Monday , however , the lawmakers backed off of their threat .
“ The original intent of the ‘ clunkers ’ program was to encourage people to buy more fuel efficient vehicles , and the data so far tells us that ’s exactly what ’s happening , ” Feinstein said in a statement announcing her support .
Still , there is growing recognition that , as a long - term environmental strategy , the DOE ’s loan program will have much greater effect .
“ It is not appropriate for us to take money to do one thing for fuel efficiency , ” Pelosi said , “ out of an account that is designed to do just that . ”
Playing for the sixth straight week on a road trip that has taken him to five countries , John Daly felt as though he hit rock bottom Friday with his worst score ever in a regular PGA
Tour event that left him wondering whether he should quit .
His swing coach , Rick Smith , described Daly as being in a " toxic state " after an 88 in the Buick Open , which Smith attributed to a massive weight loss , not enough sleep and the wrong kind of diet .
Whatever the case , it led to Daly feeling as badly as ever about his golf .
John Daly has lost weight , and some of his hitting power , over the last four months .
Chris Graythen / Getty Images
" The last two weeks have been the first time in my career I did n't think I could win , " Daly said .
" I do n't have the feel I used to have .
I do n't have the confidence .
I just do n't have it .
I tried my [ tail ] off and shot 88 .
I 've thrown in the towel and shot 82 when I quit .
But I did n't quit this time .
It was a weird feeling . "
Daly hit two balls out - of - bounds on the par - 5 first hole -- his 10th of the second round -- and took a 10 .
He wound up shoot 51 on his back nine for a 16 - over 88 .
That was one shot less than the 89 he had last year at Royal Birkdale in the wind - swept British Open .
Smith said he followed him along Warwick Hills and almost did n't recognize him .
" I saw a guy I did n't know existed , " Smith said .
" What I saw today was scary .
It was a literal disconnect .
He has n't eaten or slept in a week .
His body needs food , and it's going to the muscle , and the muscle is breaking down to the point he 's in a toxic state . "
Daly says he has lost over 80 pounds in the last four months after having Lap - Band surgery , in which a tube place around the top of the stomach helps control the appetite .
He was eating only 1,200 calories a day , but now says his intake is about 600 calories daily .
Daly said he weighed himself this week at 205 pounds .
" He 's gone through it so quickly , faster than most , " Smith said .
" He has n't felt well , he has n't slept .
He 's starving himself .
His doctors says if he does n't have 80 to 90 grams a day of protein , he 'll be in trouble .
He needs to eat the right food and get himself back so he can even play golf .
Looking at his swing today , it was irrelevant . "
The PGA Tour suspended Daly for six months dating to November because of various off - course incidents , including a jailhouse photo of Daly with his eyes half - closed after being taken to a cell to sober up in North Carolina .
He has played mostly in Europe this year as he tries to qualify for the " Race to Dubai , " but after a runner - up finish in May at the Italian Open , Daly has made little progress .
His recent trip took him from the BMW International in Germany to the French Open , to the Scottish Open and British Open , then to the Canadian Open and the Buick Open .
The two - time major champion tied for 27th in the British Open at Turnberry , then he played the next two weeks on sponsor exemptions .
Daly said he does n't want to take a spot from someone else in the field if he continues like this .
Daly 's career is littered with big numbers , such as the 18 he took on the par - 5 sixth hole at Bay Hill .
His confidence has fluctuated along with his weight .
" This is different , " Daly said .
" I can't control my hands like I used to .
I have no clue where it 's going .
I just do n't have any feel , and it scares me .
This is the most down I 've ever been with my golf game .
I 'm working my butt off , doing everything I need to be doing , and nothing is going right on the golf course . "
Daly said he would see his doctor in Florida next week , then decide whether to play in the PGA Championship at Hazeltine .
Daly 's career took off in 1991 when he won the PGA Championship as the ninth alternate .
He later won the British Open at St. Andrews .

Million Dollar Challenge Update :
It 's not ending !
We have a fantastic announcement to make :
The JREF 's famous Million Dollar Challenge will continue !
Last year , we announced that the MDC would end in March 2010 due to the strains on time and effort of the JREF staff .
However , after much discussion , we have decided not to terminate the Challenge .
Instead , we are in the process of examining how it can be improved , streamlined , and made more efficient so that we can continue to use it to test claims of the paranormal .
However , we have n't made any final decisions about it yet ; we 're taking our time and making sure we do this right .
When next March comes around we will roll out the new and improved Million Dollar Challenge .
So never fear !
We will continue to test the claims and examine the evidence , and we will always strive to ensure that reality - as it usually tends to do - wins out .

The International Ice Hockey Federation is refusing to grant Jiri Hudler his transfer card , which means he is not allowed to practice or play for his new team , Moscow Dynamo , reports Sovietski Sport .
Without this card , Hudler ca n’t play in any IIHF - sanctioned game .
The Russian league is under the domain of the IIHF , hence Hudler ’s current problem .
The IIHF ’s stance is baffling to Alexander Medvedev , chief of the KHL , because both the Detroit Red Wings , Hudler ’s NHL team , and the Czech federation have given permission to Hudler to play for Dynamo , according to Medvedev .
Australia has tropical rainforests , deserts and temperate zones
An Australian scientist says the continent needs five or six seasons to suit its climate .
Tim Entwisle , chief of Sydney 's Royal Botanic Gardens , says Australia should " unhook " itself from the " arbitrary " four seasons it inherited from Britain .
Mr Entwisle has proposed " sprummer " - the season between spring and summer - and " sprinter " - an early spring .
He says a new system could help people better understand their environment and monitor signs of climate change .
" Having four three - month seasons ... does n't make any sense in the place we live , " he told Australia 's public broadcaster ABC News .
" Something with more seasons would work better and something that unhooks us from these arbitrary European seasons , " he added .
Aboriginal Australians use up to eight seasons in some parts of the country to capture local conditions .
Mr Entwisle says that for the system to work well , different regions would need a different number of seasons .
" I 'd be encouraging different areas to have local regional seasons , to spend some time working that out and to use them to reflect what 's going on around us , " he told ABC .
He has suggested holding a national debate on the subject , and a public competition to name the new seasons .
“ He carried that flag higher and bolder than anyone , ” Mr. Alva said as he stood in a wide alleyway next to the warehouse .
“ He skates with me today . ”
More than 30 years of skating the homemade ramps and rutted streets of New York City left plenty of marks on Mr. Kessler , including scrapes and scars from bone - shattering collisions .
And in many ways , Mr. Kessler left an equally strong impression on the city .

They called him the Godfather , and as a teenager on the Upper West Side in the 1970s he skated at places with names like the Death Bowl , an abandoned pool in the Bronx , and Suicide Hill , a steep slope near the banks of the Hudson River .
He also became a member of a group of graffiti writers and skaters who called themselves the Soul Artists of Zoo York and who helped define East Coast skating .
“ Andy was like the president , the king , ” said an artist called Zephyr , who was part of the group .
As a teenager Mr. Kessler skated on the fringes of the city , using planks pilfered from construction sites to create makeshift ramps .
Later , after wrangling with the New York City parks department , he designed and helped build one of the city ’s first sanctioned skate parks , at 108th Street and Riverside Drive .
It opened in the mid-1990s at a spot where he had first skated 20 years before .
Other skate parks followed .

The red band trailer for Zombieland .
In a world overrun by zombies , Columbus ( Jesse Eisenberg ) and Tallahassee ( Woody Harrelson ) are perfectly evolved survivors .
But now , they 're about to stare down the most terrifying prospect of all : each other .
The lowly appendix used to get no respect and was simply regarded as a useless evolutionary artifact but two years ago researchers at Duke University Medical Center proposed that it actually serves a critical function as a safe haven where good bacteria could hang out until they were needed to repopulate the gut , like after a nasty case of diarrhea .
Now a group writing in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology claim something even more aggressive ; that Charles Darwin was wrong and the appendix is a whole lot more than an evolutionary remnant .
Not only does it appear in nature much more frequently than previously acknowledged , but it has been around much longer than anyone had suspected .
Why go after Darwin 150 years later ?
Well , he 's a big name and New Scientist will do another Darwin Was Wrong cover if they do .
Regardless of the hyper they 're trying to create , they have a point .
Some biology texts still refer to the appendix as a ' vestigial organ .
' Using cladistics , which utilizes genetic information in combination with a variety of other data to evaluate biological relationships that emerge over the ages , William Parker , Ph.D. , assistant professor of surgical sciences at Duke and the senior author of the study and colleagues found that the appendix has evolved at least twice , once among Australian marsupials and another time among rats , lemmings and other rodents , selected primates and humans .
"
We also figure that the appendix has been around for at least 80 million years , much longer than we would estimate if Darwin 's ideas about the appendix were correct .
" Darwin theorized that the appendix in humans and other primates was the evolutionary remains of a larger structure , called a cecum , which was used by now - extinct ancestors for digesting food .
We 'll have to forgive Sir Charles for not knowing everything there was to know about biology in the mid-19th century but surgeons are n't cutting him any slack , noting that modern data showsseveral living species , including certain lemurs , several rodents and a type of flying squirrel , that still have an appendix attached to a large cecum which is used in digestion .
Parker also notes that the appendix is actually quite widespread in nature .
" For example , when species are divided into groups called ' families ' , we find that more than 70 percent of all primate and rodent groups contain species with an appendix .
" So much for the idea that appendices appeared in only a small handful of animals .
In your face , Darwin !
Darwin also was not aware that appendicitis , inflammation of the appendix , is not due to a faulty appendix , but rather due to cultural changes associated with industrialized society and improved sanitation .
" Those changes left our immune systems with too little work and too much time their hands – a recipe for trouble , " says Parker .
That notion was n't proposed until the early 1900's , and " we did n't really have a good understanding of that principle until the mid 1980's , " Parker said .
" Even more importantly , Darwin had no way of knowing that the function of the appendix could be rendered obsolete by cultural changes that included widespread use of sewer systems and clean drinking water .
" Parker says now that we understand the normal function of the appendix , a critical question to ask is whether we can do anything to prevent appendicitis .
He thinks the answer may lie in devising ways to challenge our immune systems today in much the same manner that they were challenged back in the Stone Age .
" If modern medicine could figure out a way to do that , we would see far fewer cases of allergies , autoimmune disease , and appendicitis .
" Colleagues who contributed to the study include lead author Heather Smith , of the Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine ; Rebecca Fisher , of Arizona State University ; and Mary Lou Everett , Anitra Thomas and R. Randal Bollinger from the Department of Surgery at Duke .
Ivo Sanader announced the move at a news conference in Zagreb
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has announced he will resign and withdraw from politics .
" I have decided to withdraw from active politics and not to run for the presidency , " Mr Sanader said .
The announcement came as a surprise .
Croatian media had speculated recently that Mr Sanader , 56 , would run for president next year .
The leader of the conservative Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) , Mr Sanader had been prime minister since 2003 .
But he told reporters at a news conference in the capital , Zagreb : " My job has been done , my political life ends now . "
He said he was not resigning because of illness or to take up a post at the European Union .
Mr Sanader stressed that he " did not make these decisions easily " but after " deep consideration " .
" I have always said that politics is not an end in itself . "
' Goals achieved '
Mr Sanader , who won a second term in office in November 2007 , had made gaining Croatian membership of Nato and the European Union a key part of his time in office .
He said he was leaving his post " satisfied because the strategic goals have been achieved . "
Croatia joined Nato in April this year but accession to the EU has stalled over an unresolved border dispute with neighbouring Slovenia .
Mr Sanader said Croatia was " on the doorstep " of EU membership and only awaiting a " political decision " .
State media reported that Mr Sanader recommended his deputy , Jadranka Kosor , as the best person to replace him .
The Problem Being ???
The “ Washington Post ” : http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/29/AR2009082902388.html?hpid=topnews cites worries among intelligence officials :
A. B. “ Buzzy ” Krongard , the third - ranking CIA official at the time of the use of harsh interrogation practices , said that although vigorous oversight is crucial , the public airing of once - classified internal assessments and the prospect of further investigation are damaging the agency .
“ Morale at the agency is down to minus 50 , ” he said .
…
Krongard , one of the few active or retired CIA officers with direct knowledge of the program willing to voice publicly what many officers are saying privately , said agency personnel now may back away from controversial programs that could place them in personal legal jeopardy should their work be exposed .
“ The old saying goes , ‘ Big operation , big risk ; small operation , small risk ; no operation , no risk . ’ ” “ If you ’re not in the intelligence business to be forward - leaning , you might as well not be in it , ” Krongard said .
‘ Forward - leaning ’ in this context being a rather transparent euphemism for being ‘ willing to break the laws forbidding torture of captives . ’
There is of course a case that relatively low ranking CIA officers should not be prosecuted for torture while the high officials that ordered them to torture , or provided flimsy legal justifications for torture ( or perhaps indeed encouraged them to go beyond the guidances provided ) get off scot free .
But I think that the pragmatic case that these officers should be prosecuted is a stronger one ; on two grounds .
First , and most obviously , bringing these cases to trial may lead to the uncovering of new evidence .
The most obvious defense open to these officers is that they were indeed only following legally mandated instructions – and it seems at least plausible to me ( as a non-lawyer ) that a judge will be more likely to allow discovery on potentially exculpatory evidence for these officers than for other potential plaintiffs , such as those who were in fact the victims of this torture .
This is of course screwed up – but it is ( as best as I can tell ) part of the legal culture of this country .
This evidence might perhaps ( not very likely , given politics – but then I would not have predicted Holder ’s decision a month ago ) lead to the prosecution of high level officials who were more directly involved in creating the policies in question and possibly encouraging their underlings to go beyond even these policies .
Second , the more cautious that low - ranking CIA officers are about breaking the laws criminalizing torture in future , the better .
I _want_ them to be worried that they will be hung out and left to dry by their political masters if they break the law .
This will give them a strong rationale to say no , the next time that they are asked to , and at least partially reshape the incentive structure in benign ways .
There is something rather obviously fucked up about a political culture in which high ranking officials can make the opposite claim – that we want intelligence officers to be able to break the law by torturing people , and that not giving them this license ‘ lowers morale . ’
But you would not know that from reading the _Washington Post . _
There is a crack that has opened all of a sudden between Silvio Berlusconi and his voters , between the prime minister 's mythological image and reality .
It is nothing more than a crack , in a wall of consensus that is very high and very robust .
But it is an important crack and one that is growing .
It showed up in the European elections last month ( the prime minister had announced that he would bag 45 per cent of the vote , he ended up with 35 per cent ) ; it widened with the Church having to take a stand against his behaviour .
What happens now ?
For the first time , the prime minister is on the defensive .
He has to operate according to an agenda that is not his and over which he has no control ; he is feeling the pressure from the international media ; and he is being forced to speak about his troubles every time he appears in public .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
How come , our foreign friends ask us , Italy is not reacting like any other Western democracy ?
Why has the crack not become a chasm ?
First of all , one might reply , the majority of Italians know nothing about the scrapes their leader has got himself into in the past few days .
I think the English know more about his troubles than the Italians , for example , and come to mention it the Spanish and Germans too .
In Italy , the television channels have done nothing to cover this affair , despite the fact that it revolves around sex , money and power , all ingredients that would interest their viewers .
You have to remember of course , that Berlusconi – as well as being the head of the government and the biggest party in the country – controls the entire universe of Italian television .
He owns three private television channels , because he never felt duty - bound to get rid of them on entering politics ; and the three public stations over which the party in power , whether left or right , has always exerted control .
But the current monopoly of mainstream television is without precedent .
It has led to the elimination of the modern agora , that public space for information and debate in which the delicate free market of consensus develops in the West .
Just consider the fact that 73 per cent of Italians ( according to data from Censis research institute ) made up their minds about who to vote for in the last elections through the television , and you have a concrete idea of what conflict of interest means .
The new element that the latest scandal has exposed is that the television monopoly does not only guarantee a favourable presentation of the prime minister , it can actually cancel out reality , prevent things from becoming part of the public consciousness .
This week , the week of the escort tapes , six prime - time TV news bulletins did not let their viewers know what the Spanish , the English and the Germans were able to read about in their papers .
The Italian bulletins eventually include Berlusconi's exasperated reaction to the news , but without ever explaining what that news was , what he was reacting to .
" I am not a saint , " the prime minister said on Wednesday after the recordings of the night he spent at his home with the escort , Patrizia D'Addario , emerged .
This headline finally made it on to TG1 ( flagship news programme of the Rai state network ) and TG5 ( the main news programme of the Mediaset empire owned by Berlusconi ) but their viewers had been told nothing about the tapes that prompted it .
In some senses , George Orwell has already said it all : " And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed – if all records told the same tale – then the lie passed into history and became truth .
' Who controls the past ' , ran the Party slogan , ' controls the future : who controls the present controls the past . '"
But there is something more subtle going on Italy .
Fifteen years ago , the Left lost its cultural hegemony , that is to say the capacity to promote its values through cinema , television , glossy magazines , through the debate in newspapers and academic circles .
The Right has become the ringmaster of the new hegemony and it is culture on a different scale .

The country no longer has a public opinion , capable of reacting autonomously or making spontaneous judgements .
On the contrary , Italians are immersed in a " common understanding " , which is something else altogether .
It is Berlusconi who is the great architect of this " common understanding " and at the same time the interpreter of its success .
As far as the latest news is concerned , the new hegemony has imprisoned the opposition in a web , using tried and tested defences : the protection of privacy , the belittling of gossip , and a clear distinction between the professional and the personal .
But there is nothing private about a statesman who turned his own family photo album into a manifesto and sent it to 50 million Italians , who recounted his life story as the destiny of the nation .
And there is nothing private about his wife Veronica Lario 's denunciation that highlighted a general political problem : the trashy exchange of a young woman 's favours for a place on the list of electoral candidates .
There is , in short , a fundamental problem : Berlusconi has kept Italy in a state of high tension for 15 years .
Using emotions is the most effective way of introducing a modern populism .
This is a populism that asks citizens to mobilise , not so they can get involved in public debate , but so they can anoint the leader with their vote .
He then thinks that he alone can solve the country 's problems , with no need for the system of checks and balances typical of a modern state , that this direct coronation by the people makes his power neater and above all others .
In this state of permanent tension , you have the Berlusconian phalanx who do n't want to know or hear about the troubles of the cavaliere ( the knight ) , yet are engaged in a perennial defence of their leader .
It 's a story of a power that is very strong but has shaky foundations , a power ready to transform every criticism into " campaigning " , " manoeuvring " , even " plotting " and " subversion " .
A power which is curiously abusive and uncertain , as if it lacked an absolute legitimacy despite the consensus , a power which might be ready to destroy the temple to save itself from the ruins .
If – as Berlusconi said publicly this week – we are seeing an act of subversion at the heart of European democracy , what has the prime minister done to thwart it ?
What networks of persuasion , of threats , of blackmail have emerged in the past days around who knows , who saw , who participated ?
How does he use the secret services and the state security apparatus towards the witnesses who are recounting his troubles , the newspapers who are publishing their investigations and the magistrates who are prosecuting ?
All this explains perhaps why the crack has not become a chasm .
And yet , and yet , the smiling superficiality of a power that considered itself invulnerable has been broken .
And all the while Berlusconi continues with his lies , faced with a series of questions that he does n't know how to answer , because he can't .
Escortgate : Extracts from the sex tapes
PUTIN'S BED
Silvio : I 'm going to take a shower too .
And if you finish before me , wait for me on the big bed .
Patrizia :
Which bed ?
Putin's ?
Silvio : Putin's .
Patrizia : Oh , how cute !
The one with the curtains .
MASTURBATION
Patrizia :
You know how long it 's been since I had sex like I had with you tonight .
It 's several months , since I broke with my boyfriend .
Silvio : May I ?
You should have sex with yourself .
You should touch yourself often .
THE MORNING AFTER
Silvio : Everything good ?
Patrizia : Yes , you ?
Silvio : Me , yes .
I 've worked a lot ... and I do n't seem too tired .
Patrizia : Ah , me neither ...
It 's just my voice that 's gone .
Silvio : Eh , how come ?
We did n't scream .

" We all know what Berlusconi is like .
He 's so rich and powerful , he does what he likes .
If this had happened anywhere else in Europe , the leader would have resigned by now .
But he 's a billionaire , he controls the media .
It means that Italy 's like a third - world country .
I wish there was something positive to vote for , rather than just voting to get rid of him . "
Fabio Vassallo , 33 , a TV writer from Naples
" Setting aside my disgust ... it seemed like a script from an Italian comedy – especially with the ' Putin 's bed ' stuff .
I liked the soundtrack in the background playing the old Italian musical number ' Zoccole zoccole zoccole ' – which in that song means ' rats ' but can also mean ' whores ' .
It was just perfect .
But I suppose it makes the country look like a joke , as well . "
Claudio Bianco , 46 , an optician from Milan
" I did n't even know about the tapes .
I did n't see anything on the TV , but that 's not a surprise as Berlusconi controls most of that .
It 's embarrassing for Italy ... but even in the next election I do n't think I 'll vote .
Getting rid of Berlusconi would n't change much for Italy because the left is so weak . "
Giuseppe Flagella , 29 , a travel agent from Foggia
" I do n't think much of him , but the papers should pay more attention to other things .
If he can get away with bribing people , why should he have to quit for what he does in his private life ?
People are more worried about jobs and finances than what he gets up to at night . "
Enrico Dessiri , 30 , a graphic designer from Turin
" The sex tapes are really amusing , but I do n't think he should resign because of them .
Why should he ?
Because of something he 's done in his personal life ?
Absolutely not .
He 's not done anything illegal – lots of men his age , with his money , would do similar things .
I think the reaction of some people is hypocritical .
It 's probably being used by his opponents as a way to attack him , because they 've failed trying other things . "
Silvia Cuoco , 46 , waitress , from Milan
" I 'm not that bothered about the sex tapes .
Though I 'm sure Berlusconi is – for someone like him it must be humiliating that everyone knows he has to pay for sex .
Who cares what he does in his private life ?
I 'm more concerned that he can't be prosecuted for more serious things , such as corruption , because of the immunity law .
But he's also a hypocrite because he supports Family Day and he 's against civil partnerships , but then he goes with prostitutes . "
Elena Mereghetti , 35 , a housewife from Milan
" Sure , all this stuff has damaged Italy 's reputation abroad .
But I do n't think most Italians care .
For us a sex scandal is n't such a big deal – even if some foreigners might find that a bit hard to believe .
Here you do n't quit if you 're found guilty of corruption or association with the Mafia .
We 're fed up with the scandals about his private life .
Tell us something we do n't know . "
Wally Pezzotta , 50 , a teacher from Piacenza
" It has become embarrassing .
Italy 's seen as a joke .
It 's as if he 's still on that cruise ship , flirting with the ladies .
In fact he 's only doing what he 's always done – playing the clown .
But come the next election , people will still vote for him because they 're stupid , and because the opposition is so weak . "

Will the real owner of this fake Kenyan birth certificate please stand up ?
Is n’t it a shame that 99 % of the birthers make the movement look bad , ‘ cuz their leader , Orly Taitz , is saving this country !
Nice thing for a Russian immigrant to do , too .
And where ’s the thanks ?
Just FYI , Russia is where the Dominionist think the Anti-Christ is hiding .
Also , too .
Remember “ we ’re all Georgians now ” ?
When McCain / Palin tried to start a war with Russia during the campaign ?
This kind of puts that little skirmish with World War III into perspective .
Well , anyway , Taitz produced the REAL birth certificate a few days ago .
A Kenyan thing .
Looked good , Dobbs was sure breathin’ a sigh of relief .

Ah , darn .
Widely debunked , dated before Kenya was a republic .
Oopsie .
Birthers stood by Taitz , who is now being sued by California Bar Association for oodles of behavior not becoming a lawyer .
Jiminy .
Seems she tried to give two suitcases of “ evidence ” to Supreme Court Justice ’s security detail .
Not very lawyerly - like !!!
Kinda creepy .
Two suitcases ?
How many of those Kenyan birth certificates did the Russian correspondent school dentist / lawyer / real estate agent copy ?
But most embarrassing is that a few hours ago , an Australian man ( David Jeffrey Bomford ) has just announced that the birth certificate they say is Obama ’s actually belongs to him .
Yowza !!!!!
Holy birthers !
So , the Great Last Hope of the birthers , and one I might add , they touted with great pride on national TV just yesterday , was totally debunked in the Australian press .
Ouch !
http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2646009.htm
By the way , what in the heck were they doing copying an Australian birth certificate and passing it off as Kenyan ?
Maybe Palin told them Australia was a continent in Africa ?
Come to think of it , we have n’t seen Orly and Sarah in the same room together , have we ?
Hmm … .
Orly and Dobbs are surely figuring out their next plan of attack in the great effort to deny being crazy or racist beyond all reason .
Can we suggest they check the sky for alien sightings ?
I ’ve heard tell you can find the occasional birth certificate up there !
But take heed , my fellow real patriots .
The birthers will surely take their rage over this fraud , albeit perpetrated on them by themselves , out on American citizens at Town Halls around the country .
Be prepared , and if they disrupt the meeting , or hang in effigy your representative or claim to be with the Teabaggers , yell out a “ Gu daiyy mate ! ” for me .
' Gayby Boom ' Fueled by Same - Sex Parents Post - 1980s children of gay parents thrive in school and a more open society .
Aug. 3 , 2009  --
In 1994 , Daddy Dave and Daddy Bob prepared 5 - year - old Elizabeth Wall for the first day of kindergarten in New Jersey , meeting with the principal in advance to ease her transition as the daughter of two gay men .
They never learned until years later how insensitively the school reacted to their unconventional family , according to Wall , now 20 and a sociology major at The College of Wooster in Ohio .
" They had never had gay parents before , " Wall told ABCNews.com .
" It 's funny , after the principal met with them , he went to the faculty and said , ' Who wants to take her ? ' "
Fortunately one teacher , who later became a close friend , volunteered and took the little girl under her wing in the classroom , but for years
Wall was careful about only telling close friends that she had two fathers .
" Obviously I was different and did n't have a mom , " she said .
" We are living in a world that treats our families differently .
It can be isolating and challenging . "
Wall is one of a growing number of children , who affectionately call themselves " gaybies " or " queer spawn . "
Born after the AIDS crisis of the 1980s , they are now reshaping the American family .
Of the 270,000 children living with same - sex parents , about 65,000 are adopted .
Most , like other Americans , are in two - child families .
" It 's amazing how many of us there are , " said Wall , who is working this week as a counselor with the organization COLAGE , or Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere , at its Family Week in Provincetown , providing children of same - sex families with support .
20 Percent of Gay Couples Have Children Under 18
Just under one percent of all couples in the U.S. -- or 594,391 people -- identify themselves as gay , lesbian or transgender , and about 20 percent of them are raising children under the age of 18 , according to the Williams Institute , an organization that advances sexual orientation law and public policy .
Having children is made possible through reproductive technology such as egg or sperm donation and surrogacy .
Many , like Wall 's parents , choose to adopt .
About four percent of all adoptive parents are same - sex couples .
" Anecdotally , we are hearing a lot of stories about what is being called the ' gayby boom , ' same - sex couples having children , " said Naomi Goldberg , a public policy fellow at the Williams Institute .
" They are shattering the stereotypes that gay men do n't want kids , " she told ABCNews.com .
" They want the same thing straight couples want . "
Television personality Rosie O'Donnell first brought gay parenting to light in the mid-'90s and since then , same - sex families have gained growing acceptance in a predominantly heterosexual society .
Today , gay marriage is legal in six states .
And for the first time in history , the 2010 census will include data from same - sex marriages , unions and partnerships , bringing gay families out of the demographic closet .
But families like the Walls say it 's been a long , hard road to gain societal approval .
In 1989 , at five days old , Elizabeth Wall was adopted by David Wall and Bob Houck ( though Houck would not get legal custody until 1994 ) as part of the first major wave of children adopted by gay couples .
Prior to that , children who lived in same - sex households were from straight , divorced parents .
Children of Gay Parents Come of Age
" There were few ' out ' models of gay and lesbian - headed families 20 years ago , " said David Wall , registrar at Princeton Theological Seminary .
" Many folks were still in the closet or only partially out .
That has now totally changed . "
Elizabeth
Wall was born at the height of the AIDS crisis in New Jersey and was at risk for being a " boarder baby , " according to David Wall .
" No one wanted these kids . "
Her biological mother died of the disease , and Elizabeth Wall hersellf tested positive for antibodies until she was 2 .
At 12 , she was reconnected with her biological family , finding she had a sister , uncle , aunts and cousins .
But as a child , her adoptive parents made a point of having female role models in her life -- grandmother and trusted family friends .
" I did n't long for a mother , " she said .
There was only one support group in New Jersey , and the family had to travel one to two hours to find another gay couple with a child .
" Each year , new things would come up , and she was educating the teachers and classmates , daily , " said David Wall .
Forms -- from schools to doctors to insurance companies -- were the biggest issue for the couple .
Annoyed by Forms and Afraid to Travel
" People just did n't ever imagine our family configuration , " David Wall said .
" I was constantly crossing out mother and father , mom 's phone , mom 's work , etc. , and putting parent or simply crossing out mother and putting in second father .
Our box just simply did n't exist . "
When their first family photo appeared in their church directory , conservative groups made derogatory remarks .
Wall and Houck were afraid to travel for fear they would not be recognized as their daughter 's parents and always carried her birth certificate .
But by the time Elizabeth Wall got to high school , she was greeted by an openly gay principal and found a friend from a similar same - sex family .
" Churches are much more open to gay young people coming out , and families like ours are more visible , " David Wall said .
" And people are no longer afraid to talk about our families . "
Cathy Renna , a Washington , D.C. , lesbian , and her partner have a 4 - year - old daughter through artificial insemination .
They often attend Rosie O'Donnell family cruises and hear discussions by older children about the challenges of having gay parents .
" I was trying to imagine when she was a teenager what she would say , " said Renna .
" Most of the kids on the panel were the product of hetero marriages and the parents came out .
That 's totally different than being brought into the world by a same - sex couple . "
" This generation of kids growing up will look back and wonder what all the fuss was about , " she told ABCNews.com .
" This kid could not be more loved or more wanted . "
Less research has been done on children in families headed by gay men , but data collected as part of the National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study have shown few differences in psychosexual development , psychological adjustment and overall well - being .
" Boys seem to do as well as girls , " said Dr. Nanette Gartrell , associate clinical professor of psychiatry at University of California , San Francisco and principal investigator in the 23 - year study .
" Most offspring of same - sex parents are heterosexual as adults , " she told ABCNews.com .
" By the time our study kids were 10 years old , they demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of diversity and tolerance , and an appreciation of the destructive effects of discrimination . "
Lesbian Daughters Have Double the Fun
Abby and Jenna Bergman of Los Angeles have two mothers : Natalie and Kim Bergman .
The lesbian couple was married in British Columbia in 2008 and has been legally recognized in California while Proposition 8 is being challenged .
" Love makes a family , " said Abby , who is 13 .
" I always grew up this way .
I never realized anyone was different . "
Though Jenna , 10 , thinks it might be " kind of cool " to know what it 's like to have a dad , she has friends and even a teacher with " two mommies . "
The girls have uncles and a grandfather who have been a male presence in their lives .
They also like making two presents on Mother 's Day -- " double the fun , " said Abby .
For the most part , their lives are not unlike their schoolmates ' , though every once in awhile they encounter ignorance and homophobia .
" Once at camp I remember talking to a kid and becoming rather close , but when I told him I had two moms , he avoided me for the rest of the week , " said Abby .
" He was afraid because his parents had said something to him . "
Jenna , too , said when she was younger some of her classmates thought her family was " weird and did n't understand it . "
The girls have been told by their mothers , " you can marry anyone you want , regardless of gender . "
For Julien Goutierre , who is heterosexual , growing up in a same - sex family has expanded his view of relationships .
The 33 - year - old health care worker grew up in Paris with a gay mother who introduced her partner to her son when he was 13 .
" I preferred it be a girl than a man , " he told ABCNews.com .
" A woman would be less dominant . "
Claire Elkins , an American , and Barbara Goutierre , who is French , married in Vancouver in 2003 , and their son said their relationship has shaped his own character .
" I am very tolerant about gay people , and with my girlfriend I shared the housework , cleaning and doing all the dishes , " said Julien Gouttiere .
" In France , that 's something men just do n't do . "
Meanwhile , Elizabeth Wall , who is also straight , agrees that being the daughter of a gay couple has made her more tolerant of others , no matter what their racial or religious background .
" It 's given me a lot more confidence in my family and makes me a stronger person , " she said .
Houck became her second legal parent after the ACLU took on their case , the second in the state , to challenge the adoption laws in New Jersey .
" It opened the door to others , " said David Wall .
" I worried if something happened to me that my brother would get Elizabeth instead of Bob . "
Though they had been legal domestic partners since the early 1990s , Wall and Houck exchanged vows in a civil union at their church in 2007 , and their daughter took part in the ceremony .
Today , Elizabeth
Wall said life with her two fathers is no different than having a mother around .
" Both are very open and emotional , " she said .
And like any set of parents , one is more permissive than the other .
" When I scream , ' Daddy , ' they know which one I want by the tone of my voice , " she said .
" There 's a Dad who says ' no ' to everything and so I know which Dad to go to if I want something . "
World War I veteran Harry Patch will be buried tomorrow .
The former plumber , who fought at the battle of Passchendaele in 1917 , gave a memorable interview to Today reporter Mike Thomson in 2005 .
Thom Yorke , lead singer of the band Radiohead , was moved by the interview to write a tribute to the veteran , inspired by Harry Patch 's words .
The song can be downloaded from the Radiohead website - all profits will go to the Royal British Legion .
Harry Patch ( In memory of )
I am the only one that got through
The others died where ever they fell
It was an ambush
They came up from all sides
Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves
I 've seen devils coming up from the ground
I 've seen hell upon this earth
The next will be chemical but they will never learn
Amazon attracted considerable media attention this week for publishing the source code of some of the components that are used in its popular Kindle reading device .
The hype generated by the source release is mystifying and largely undeserved .
It seems to be a result of widespread misconceptions about the scope and nature of the code disclosure .
Contrary to the ambiguous headlines declaring that Amazon is opening the Kindle , the reality is that Amazon has not released a significant quantity of new code and is not empowering competitors to replicate their successful product .
Amazon has been publishing the source code of various Kindle components since 2007 in order to fulfill its licensing obligations .
Like many new consumer electronic devices , the Kindle 's operating system is built on top of the Linux kernel and leverages numerous libraries and frameworks that are part of the Linux platform ecosystem .
These components are distributed by their original creators under open source licenses that broadly permit recipients to study , modify , and redistribute the source code .
The Linux kernel itself is distributed under version 2 of GNU 's General Public License ( GPL ) .
One of the defining characteristics of the GPL is a share - alike provision which requires recipients to make publicly - distributed derivatives available under the same terms .
The function of that mandatory reciprocity requirement , which is often referred to as " copyleft , " is to guarantee that the freedoms granted by the original developer remain intact and are transfered to recipients of modified versions of the code .
Not all licenses share this characteristic .
There are some , such as the BSD license , that are more permissive and allow third - party developers to build proprietary derivatives .
When a hardware maker ships a product that contains GPL - licensed source code , the company has to inform users of their rights under the GPL and make the source code available .
To inform users of their rights , most consumer electronics companies simply include a printed copy of the GPL license itself in the product 's packaging alongside warranty pamphlets , safety notices , and other detritus that typically gets stuffed into the box .
To make the source code available , companies will either physically mail users a CD on request or they will publish downloadable code archives on a website .
It 's important to understand that companies can ( and usually do ) make products that have both proprietary and open source components .
Including a GPL - licensed program or building your platform on the Linux kernel does n't mean that you have to open or publish the source code of all the other programs that you ship on your device .
In the vast majority of cases where hardware makers use an open source kernel and open source frameworks , the parts that differentiate the device remain proprietary .
This allows companies to collaborate on shared infrastructure but maintain a competitive advantage with the parts that really matter to the user .
Amazon 's Kindle fits entirely into this model .
In addition to the Linux kernel , the underlying Kindle software platform uses other existing open source software components such as the GStreamer multimedia library and the BusyBox shell .
In conformance with the requirements of the licenses , Amazon is merely publishing its own modified versions of existing open source components .
Other companies obviously do this too , though with very little fanfare .
You can find similar code disclosures for the open source components that are included in the Palm Pre , Roku set - top box , and TiVo DVR .
The components of the software that provide the core user experience are not published and remain proprietary .
As such , the source code that they publish cannot be used to replicate the unique functionality of their products .
There is nothing especially novel about doing this and certainly nothing that is interesting enough to warrant the buzz that surrounded Amazon 's publication of its Kindle source code .
It 's worth noting that Amazon has already been publishing its Kindle source code since 2007 and the most recent disclosure was simply the updated code for the Kindle DX and new versions of the Kindle software platform .
Part of the confusion about the code release comes from the fact that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently dropped some hints about the possibility of supporting other e-book formats on the Kindle and allowing more devices to read the Kindle e-book format .
Some bloggers appear to be conflating this news with the source code release and are wrongly assuming that Amazon is offering its entire Kindle platform up for competitors to use .
Although Amazon does n't share the most important parts of its software and is n't giving competitors the ability to make a copy - and - paste Kindle clone , the source that it has published is not entirely without value .
Open source developers can examine it and look for improvements that might be worth integrating back into the upstream versions .
The kernel source code can also be instructive in some ways , as it provides insight into some of the design decisions behind the Kindle .
For example , the source code can be examined to discover some of the tricks that Amazon uses to conserve energy or accommodate the device 's unusual hardware , including the e-ink display .
The difference between open source and an open device
With some hardware devices , developers can take the underlying source code that is used to power the product and they can build their own open source alternatives to the proprietary parts .
This approach enables developers to build a complete drop - in replacement for the software that ships with the device , potentially even making it possible to deliver richer capabilities and more features than the software that was originally shipped by the vendor .
An example of this phenomenon in action is the open source Rockbox firmware for hackable portable media players .
Another example is DD - WRT , custom firmware that can be loaded on some open Linux - based routers to boost their functionality .
Tragically , a growing number of hardware makers are using code signing and other technical measures to prevent users from swapping out the software that comes with a device .
The Kindle is sadly one such device .
Even though the source code of the Kindle 's kernel is available , it 's useless as far as Kindle enhancement is concerned because Amazon blocks installation of custom versions on the product .
This means that the Kindle is a fundamentally closed device despite its use of some open source software .
This trend of blocking users from installing custom software on Linux devices is deeply troubling to some members of the open source software community because it arguably prevents users from exercising their GPL rights .
It 's referred to as " Tivoization " because one of the most prominent examples is the TiVo DVR .
The FSF views Tivoization as exploitation of a loophole in the GPL .
The FSF has attempted to close the loophole by prohibiting the practice in version 3 of the GPL .
The GPLv3 anti-Tivoization language is considered highly controversial , however , and is strongly opposed by critics of the GPLv3 in the open source software community .
Among those critics is Linus Torvalds himself , the creator and lead developer of the Linux kernel .
He argues that licenses should not govern what can be done with hardware and that there are legitimate reasons to want to block code tampering .
The Linux kernel is licensed under version 2 of the GPL , which means that it can be used freely on closed devices .
The Kindle 's closed nature makes it difficult for inventive third - party developers to repurpose the device in interesting ways or build alternate reader software from scratch with a different user interface and more features .
Unlike a conventional desktop computer , which can be reformatted and loaded with completely different software , the capabilities of the Kindle and other closed devices are controlled entirely by the companies that make them .
This degrades the freedom of end users and detracts from the value of the product .
The breathless proclamations this week from bloggers and Twitter users claiming that Amazon has " opened " the Kindle by releasing the source are simply untrue .
Amazon is complying with the GPL like every other company that makes a product with the Linux kernel .
The product 's most significant software components are still proprietary and the device itself is still completely closed and hostile to modification .
If I ’m ABD
Does that mean that I cannot
Finish this poem
Sarah Kamens
European Graduate School
Like many ABDs , I ’m suspended in pre-dissertation limbo , convinced I ’ll never finish .
Well , the meeting 's over now , so let 's just see how dynamited that landscape is .
The Hill , an hour ago :
Rep. Mike Ross ( D - Ark. ) , a Blue Dog who has led the charge to reduce the bill ’s costs , said after the meeting that " no final decisions have been made . "
He said he and others want to wait for the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) to score the bill and potential cost - cutting measures .
Ross said the president laid out what he wants to see in healthcare legislation , including that it be deficit - neutral .
House members discussed " about 10 issues we 're concerned with , " he said .
" Obviously , cost - cutting is first on that list , " Ross said .
No decisions and let 's wait and see ?
Wow , there 's been a seismic shift here !
Clearly the Blue Dogs have changed everything !
Judging from the utter lack of tough talk and failure to commit to any strong position , why do I have the feeling that whatever they said to Obama , it did n't have the desired effect ?
If they 'd scored any kind of victory in that meeting , they'd be crowing about it non-stop .
I suspect some of the Dogs will be very quiet in days to come .
It 'll be interesting to see how it plays out , regardless .
Holy shit , go to the gym and come back to being on the Rec List .
Thanks , everyone .
Nice view up here .
( Entertainment Weekly ) --
There are many documentaries about the fashion world .
Anna Wintour , editor - in - chief of American Vogue , attends a screening of " The September Issue " in New York .
Some , like " Unzipped " ( remember when Isaac Mizrahi was the new black ? ) , are impish fun , and a few , like " Valentino : The Last Emperor , " have been marvelous .
But the singular fascination of " The September Issue , " R.J. Cutler 's lusciously revealing fly - on - the - wall portrait of Anna Wintour , the editor in chief of Vogue , does n't hinge on clothes , or glamour , or the sprinkle of stars on display .
( Look , it 's Jean Paul Gaultier !
And Sienna Miller ! )
It begins with the electromagnetic pull of power .
We expect to see Wintour hidden behind her famous sunglasses , as indomitable as the Sphinx .
But Cutler , the producer of " The War Room , " opens the movie with Wintour un - spectacled , her face pert and pretty , gazing with a twinkle as she explains that those who look down on fashion people for being '' shallow ' ' feel threatened by them .
It 's an astute point , and Wintour makes it in a way that 's so direct and amused -- eager to defuse her mystique , which of course only adds to it -- that even when '' exposed ' ' by Cutler 's camera , she 's still a sphinx , impassive but for the occasional hint of a wince or a soft smile .
Her mind is always in two places at once : on the task at hand , and attuned to the global fashion ramifications of every move she makes .
Do n't Miss EW.com : Movie reviews
In " The September Issue , " we observe the process by which Wintour and her vast army of editors , designers , photographers , models , and gofers labor , throughout the summer of 2007 , to assemble Vogue 's massive September issue , a plush treasure chest of ads , photo spreads , and gilded dreams .
It 's through Vogue that Wintour , more than any other figure , reigns over the decisions -- of taste , aesthetics , economics -- that shape the $ 300 billion - a- year fashion industry .
The September issue is more than a magazine .
It 's a major motion picture stuffed between glossy covers , with Wintour as its all - knowing , all - dictatorial producer .
She pulls the whole issue together , keeping her eye on the big picture while micromanaging the small ones , like David O. Selznick presiding over the production of " Gone With the Wind . "
Is she a diva , a bitch ?
The devil in Prada ?
( If my eyes do n't deceive me , she seems to prefer Lagerfeld . )
Well , she 's a devil only if you think there 's something nasty about a woman who 's paid a royal salary to elevate her every whim into a command .
" The September Issue " is organized so that we observe the ruthlessness , the high perfectionistic logic , of each decision Wintour makes .
There 's not enough color in that collection !
Why does this layout feature only one fur garment ? -- it looks out of place !
" I do n't see any real evening on that rack , " she tells a quivering Yves Saint Laurent designer .
No casual comment about after - dark wear was ever such a threat .
Yet Wintour is n't mean ; she simply means what she says .
If she were just pushing people around , we might look on with derision ( or fear ) , but part of the movie 's dishy fun is that there 's room for more than one ego in the room .
André Leon Talley , who is Wintour 's consigliere and editor - at - large , is a bitch ( I mean that as a compliment ) , a witty postmodern man so neurotic about swaddling his giant physique that he can't play tennis without draping a designer towel over his shoulders .
And if Wintour is the film 's subject , its true heroine is Grace Coddington , Vogue 's passionate and addled creative director .
A former model ( like Wintour herself ) who rose up in the 1960s glory days of swinging London , Coddington now looks like a Pre-Raphaelite ghost .
It 's she who orchestrates the magazine 's photo shoots , which are like eroticized couture dioramas that fuse the past and the future .
When one of Coddington 's spectacular spreads gets cut , she sulks with fury .
We see why she 's mad -- every image she creates is gorgeous -- yet Wintour is n't out to destroy .
She simply has priorities , of mix , balance , and ( yes ) money , that keep Vogue thriving .
These two square off like jungle predators , but they need each other ; they create a yin and yang of commerce and beauty that Vogue melds into that indefinable thing called glamour .
I came away from " The September Issue " liking Anna Wintour more than I thought I would , but mostly with an appreciation for her mission : not just to sell magazines , to market clothing and style , but to give femininity its sheen .

Already , 20 companies have agreed to pull advertisements from Glenn Beck 's television show , within weeks of the Fox host calling Obama " a racist " and saying the president " has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture . "
Now , Farmers Insurance can be added to that list , a Farmers spokesperson confirms to POLITICO .
" We advertise on Fox News Channel , which places our ads in the Network programming , and we ceased placing on Glenn Beck a week ago , " said the spokesperson .
Just because advertisers pull ads from Beck 's show does n't mean the network will lose any money .
A Fox News spokesperson told the Daily News yesterday that " advertisers referenced have all moved their spots from Beck to other programs on the network so there has been no revenue lost . "
ColorOfChange.org , an African - American online political organization , has been targeting advertisers , while others , like RedState defend Beck in the midst of this boycott .

Dog gives birth to Britain 's largest - ever litter of Rottweilers with 18 puppies
When four - year - old Rottweiler Terrie went into labour , her owner already knew it was going to be a long night .
But when the six - stone dog started to give birth she did n't stop until she had produced 18 mewling , squealing Rottweiler pups - the biggest ever litter in Britain .
The incredible feat smashed the previous record of 13 and doubled the traditional litter size of eight or nine dogs .
Sadly , one was stillborn and another died two days after the birth , but the remaining 16 have already doubled in size and now weigh between 1 and 1.5lb .
Proud mother Terrie rests after she gave birth to the UK 's largest litter of rottweilers
At nine days old , they have yet to open their eyes but each is already gulping down 1.5 ozs of puppy milk every four hours .
The 10 female and six male pups are now snuggled up with their exhausted mum in owner Nicolette Morris ' lounge .
Livery yard manager Nicolette , 34 , acted as an emergency midwife when Terrie went into labour at 12.50 pm on Sunday July 26 .
She realised six - stone Terrie was ' huge ' but could not believe what was happening when Terrie gave birth to pup after pup .
One member of the record - breaking litter keeps his distance while the rest play rough - and - tumble with their new siblings
Nicolette , of Luton , Beds. , said : ' Terrie was absolutely huge before she gave birth but I never dreamt she would have so many .
' It was staggering .
They just kept on coming .
I began to wonder if she 'd ever stop .
Nicolette Morris has been forced to help Terrie out with feeding duties
' No - one has heard to a Rottweiler having more pups .
It 's certainly a British record .
' Thankfully I 've foaled horses before so when one got stuck I knew how to manoeuvre it to get it out .
' Now Terrie needs help with the feeding which is brilliant but completing exhausting .
' I know Rottweilers have got a bad name but I love the breed .
They 've got such fantastic temperaments , I 'd recommend them to anyone . '
Nicolette , who lives with her nursery nurse partner Lisa Johnson , 27 , is planning to sell the pedigree puppies for about £ 500 each .
A litter of 13 baby Rottweilers were born at the SSPCA centre in Cardonald , Glasgow , after their mother Tara rejected them in February this year .

Bees thrive in a clean colony
Honeybees sterilise their hives with antimicrobial resin , scientists have discovered .
In doing so , they give the whole colony a form of " social immunity " , which lessens the need for each individual bee to have a strong immune system .
Although honeybee resin is known to kill a range of pathogens , this is the first time that bees themselves have been shown to utilise its properties .
The team published details of their discovery in the journal Evolution .
Honeybees in the wild nest in tree cavities .
When founding a new colony , they line the entire nest interior with a thin layer of resins that they mix with wax .
This mixture is known as propolis .
They also use propolis to smooth surfaces in the hive , close holes or cracks in the nest , reduce the size of the entrances to keep out intruders , and to embalm intruders that they 've killed in the hive that are too big to remove .
A number of studies have shown that propolis has a range of antimicrobial properties , but mostly in relation to human health .
For example , numerous publications cite its effectiveness against viruses , bacteria and even cancer cells .
Honeybees store propolis inside their hives
That is how Mike Simone , a PhD student from the University of Minnesota in St Paul , US , and his supervisor Professor Marla Spivak became interested .
Spivak and her colleagues had tested the effectiveness of honeybee propolis against the HIV - 1 virus .
They then progressed to see how it impacted bee pathogens , such as American foulbrood .
" This led us to wonder what other things propolis might be doing for the bees , " said Simone .
In experiments funded by the US National Science Foundation , Simone 's team painted the inside walls of hives with an extract of propolis collected from Brazil or Minnesota .
This inside layer mimicked how propolis or resins would be distributed in a feral colony nesting in a tree cavity .
They then created colonies of honeybees and housed either in hives enriched with resin , or hives without the resin layer - to act as a control .
After one week of exposure they collected bees that had been born in each colony .
Propolis is a mixture of resins and wax Genetic tests on these 7 - day - old bees showed that those growing in the resin- rich colonies had less active immune systems .
" The resins likely inhibited bacterial growth .
Therefore the bees did not have to activate their immune systems as much , " said Simone .
" Our finding that propolis in the nest allows bees to invest less in their immune systems after such a short exposure was surprising .
Resins in the hive have been thought of as a potential benefit to a honey bee colony , but this has never been tested directly . "
Using resins to help sterilise the colony can be thought of as a type of " social immunity " said the researchers .
And it may partly explain why bees and other social insects , such as ants , collect resins to build their nests in the first place .
Bees will embalm anything , including this mouse skull found inside a hive " Honeybees can use wax , which they produce themselves , to do all the things that they use resin for in the nest .
So it is interesting to think about why they might go and collect resins , " said Simone .
" Especially since resins , being sticky , are hard to manipulate and take a lot of energy for individual bees to gather in very small quantities . "
There is also some evidence that some mammals and birds coat themselves in naturally - occurring plant resin in a bid to reduce infestations with parasites .

I happened to have tuned into Hardball two nights ago .
This is a very rare experience for me ( I was really waiting to see Olbermann 's show ) , as I avoid Hardball like the plague , realizing a few years ago that every minute I am forced to look at Chris Matthews and his typically braindead guests is a minute I become more despondent about the apocalyptic state of journalism , politics , America and , really , the universe .
This episode was no exception .
For the three minutes I tuned in , I caught right - wing lobotomy case Michael Smerconish stumbling through the latest Republican talking point against universal health care .
Here 's what he said :
[ Voters ] are very nervous about what 's going to come out of this debate concerning national health care .
And , Chris , if I have heard once in the last couple of days , I have heard it 50 times , if they can't get cash for clunkers straight , what in the world are they going to do with my national health insurance ?
Um ... let me get this straight :
This right - wing lobotomy case is appearing on television insisting Americans do n't want a health care system that 's like the cash for clunkers program - a program that has been so wildly successful and popular that the public is demanding it be expanded .
Really ?
I mean ... really ?
Look , it 's arguably a smart conservative tactic to try to liken a universal health care program to the DMV - it 's dishonest , of course , but at least that tactic tries to link universal health care to something people generally hate .
But it 's decidedly moronic for conservatives to believe that they will derail a proposed universal health care system by likening it to a program whose only problem ( if you can call it that ) is that the public loves it far more than anyone expected .
Indeed , this is the stupidest Republican talking point I 've heard in a very long time - and maybe ever .
As I said , only a lobotomy case like Smerconish would think this kind of idiocy is helping his cause .
And only a lobotomy case like Chris Matthews would n't bother to make that very simple point .
Teh stupid ... it burns .

( CNN ) -- Zieba Shorish - Shamley 's Afghanistan does n't exist anymore .
As recently as the 1970s , Afghan women could be seen wearing miniskirts in Kabul .
The tea and fresh fruit her Muslim family shared over laughter with their Jewish friends at home .
The female lawmakers who spoke out in Afghanistan 's parliament .
The tourists who were so enchanted by Kabul , the country 's cosmopolitan capital , they called it the " Paris of Central Asia . "
When the Afghan native recently returned home , all of those childhood memories seemed like a mirage .
What she saw instead was what many Americans now associate with Afghanistan : destruction .
" When I got off the plane , I cried my eyes out , " she said .
" Most of Kabul was destroyed . "
Shorish - Shamley 's memories represent a side of Afghanistan that 's easily overlooked .
As Afghans prepare to pick a president in their national election Thursday , much of the media has focused on pre-election violence .
Afghanistan has often been portrayed as a barbaric country where warfare has been a way of life for centuries .
But not long ago , Afghanistan was something else : a politically stable , religiously moderate government that recognized women 's rights , Afghan natives and scholars say .
Elizabeth Gould , co-author of " Invisible History : Afghanistan 's Untold Story , " says a U.S. diplomat visiting Afghanistan in the early 1970s said its citizens were so passionate about democracy that he saw them debate their constitutional rights in the streets .
" The years after World War II , in the '50s , '60s and early ' 70s , were the golden years , " Gould said .
Afghanistan 's ' wave of freedom '
Afghanistan 's earlier stability started at the top .
It rested in part on its royal leadership .
The country was ruled by a king , Mohammad Zahir Shah , from 1933 to 1973 .
Though a monarch , some say Zahir Shah tried to spread the power in Afghanistan .
In 1964 , he convened a council of scholars , religious and tribal leaders to create a constitution that supported more individual freedoms .
Critics say , however , that the shah was slow to implement those democratic reforms .
" The king and some of the people who worked for the king believed in democracy and the rights of people , " said Shorish - Shamley , now founder and director of the Women 's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan .
" It was the '60s , and there was a wave of freedom . "
Shorish - Shamley says Afghanistan was , in some ways , ahead of the United States when it came to empowering women .
" We had more women in parliament than the U.S. had in Congress at the time , " she said .
" We were moving toward democracy .
People did n't have much , but they were happy . "
That wave of freedom filtered down to ordinary people 's lives , says Tanya Amri , an Afghan - American who spent her early childhood in Kabul .
Amri remembers an idyllic time .
Her mother worked as a journalist , and her father worked at the U.S. Embassy .
There was hardly any crime in Kabul , and the government was stable , she says .
When she tells some Americans that her mother worked as a journalist in Afghanistan , they can't digest the news .
" They ask me if my mom wore a burka , '' said Amri , who is writing a book about Afghanistan 's food and cultural heritage .
" I tell them she wore a miniskirt . "
Religious intolerance may be a problem in Afghanistan today , but not as much in the past , Amri says .
The country has a history of religious tolerance .
Its mixed religious heritage could be seen in two soaring statues of Buddha that were carved into a cliff in central Afghanistan .
Buddhist monks lived in the caves behind the cliff , she says .
" At one point , Afghanistan was a Buddhist country , " Amri said .
" In those caves , 2,000 monks used to meditate . "
The Taliban , however , demolished the statues in early 2001 because they deemed them graven images offensive to Islam .
Afghanistan 's earlier religious tolerance was due in part to geography .
It was at the intersection of the ancient world 's great civilizations , says Paul Fitzgerald , co-author of " Invisible History . "
Afghanistan was crisscrossed by the Silk Road , an ancient network of routes that linked China to Rome .
Wool , gold , silk and spices were dispatched over the roads , and Buddhist and Hindu pilgrims settled into Afghanistan , Fitzgerald says .
" Afghanistan has been called the graveyard of empires , but it 's more of a crossroad of cultures , " Fitzgerald said .
The cultural richness is what Shorish - Shamley remembers from her childhood .
Though she was a Muslim , she remembered attending Jewish holiday celebrations .
Hindus , Sikhs , Shiites and Sunnis lived easily with one another , she says .
" My mother 's best friends were Jewish , " she said .
" My mother had a set of cups and dishes that were kosher that she kept for her friends when they came over for dinner . "
Is the past romanticized ?
Yet there are others who say it is tempting to romanticize Afghanistan 's past .
Christine Beasley , the program manager in Afghanistan for World Vision , a Christian humanitarian group , says Afghanistan did modernize in the 1960s and the 1970s .
But most of the country 's rural areas remained conservative in their practice of Islam and treatment of women .
" There was relative stability , but the changes in the '60s and ' 70s were confined to very small , urban elite , primarily around Kabul , " Beasley said .
Afghanistan 's stability started to unravel in 1973 .
A military coup ousted the king .
If he was so just , why would a coup succeed ?
Fitzgerald says
Afghans grew unsatisfied because change was n't coming quick enough to the impoverished country .
" It was the lack of progress at modernization by the traditional Afghan government that was the source of unrest , " Fitzgerald said .
" It was not the fact that they were modernizing .
They did n't have the economy to absorb all of those educated Afghans . "
In the late 1970s under a communist regime , Afghanistan 's internal stability worsened .
In 1979 , the Soviet Union invaded and deposed the country 's leader .
But Soviet forces ended up getting bogged down in a 10 - year - long military conflict .
The Soviets were finally driven out by U.S. - backed Afghan resistance fighters .
Afghan resistance leaders formed a government but it eventually descended into civil war .
In 1996 , the Taliban stepped into the power vacuum left by feuding factions and took control .
The Taliban , though largely indigenous to Afghanistan , was nurtured by Pakistan 's military and intelligence services .
The Taliban " would have never been able to take over Afghanistan without that support , " says Peter Bergen , CNN national security analyst .
" The Taliban has to be viewed as a creation of Pakistan intelligence with the objective of taking over Afghanistan and putting in a Pakistani - friendly government , " says Elizabeth Gould , author of " Invisible History . "
Shorish - Shamley , the Afghan women 's activist , agrees with Gould and says it is useless to negotiate with the Taliban .
" There is no such thing as a moderate Taliban , " she said .
" If you will show me a moderate Nazi , I will show you a moderate Taliban . "
Perhaps Afghanistan can recover its stability .
Afghans and exiles recommend the same solutions : weed out government corruption , oust the Taliban , boost economic development and prevent Pakistan from interfering in Afghanistan 's internal affairs .
Amri , the Afghan - American who is writing a book about her native country 's heritage , says nostalgia will not be enough .
She and other Afghans must return to Afghanistan to help it recover .
" It 's up to the people of my generation to go back and contribute , " she said .
" I 'm very hopeful .
Nothing lasts forever .
I hope it happens in my lifetime . "

300 MPG Riversimple Urban Car Open - Sources Its Hydrogen Fuel Cell Tech
A hydrogen - powered two - seater unveiled in London this week can seat two , turn in the equivalent of 300 MPG and hit a top speed of 50 mph .
Plus , its blueprints are open source .
Take that , auto industry
FOR proof that Communism was bound to fail , pull a chair up to the table of a restaurant critic and his three guests .
Then watch what happens after he tells them what to order , the food has been delivered , and everyone begins to take bites of everything , making a broad sample of the menu .
Jane tries some of the gnocchi
Dick has passed to her , and curls her lip .
“ My pork loin is much , much better , ” she proclaims , with a resounding emphasis on the word “ my ” and no hint of recognition that the loin was n’t her pick : the critic randomly assigned it to her .
“ True , ” Mary chimes in , affirming the pork , only to add , “ My short ribs are the best thing on the table . ”
“ Well , I love my gnocchi , ” Dick counters , possessive and prickly .
He ’s defending more than dumplings .
It ’s his very discernment that he ’s standing up for , even though it never came into play .
And he accentuates his pique by wresting the gnocchi from Jane .
Like a kid in the schoolyard , he wants his ball back .
Conservative columnist David Brooks thinks Rush Limbaugh has gone too far in comparing President Barack Obama to Hitler .
Brooks was stunned by the comparison when he first saw it on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday .
" I had n't seen the Rush Limbaugh thing .
That is insane .
What he 's saying is insane , " said Brooks .
Brooks went on to criticize Sarah Palin for saying that health care reform would create a " death panel " to euthanize older Americans .
" Again , that 's crazy .
The crazies are attacking the plan because it 'll cut off granny , and that 's simply not true .
That simply is not going to happen , " explained Brooks .
Yesterday Harry Markopolos ( the guy who handed Madoff to the SEC on a silver platter , but was shooed away ) warned of an impending CDS disaster that will , in his words , make Madoff ’s $ 50 b ponzi scheme look “ small - time ” .
He continued ,
To put it in simple terms , it is like buying fire insurance policies from five different insurance companies on your neighbor ’s house and then burning down the house
The CDS warning came during a speech at his SouthHampton church , and was reported in the NY Post .
Can he really not get a bigger pulpit to speak from ?
He should be on 60 Minutes , FrontLine , bubblevision , Bloomberg talking about this .
Give the man some respect .
Better yet , ask him to head the SEC .
Not likely , I know .
Maybe mainstream outlets are waiting for the Post piece to get confirmed , or something .
It was on Page Six of the NY Post …
Will keep this post updated .
" Any reasonably attractive young woman exercises as much power over men as the male ruler of the world does over women " declares Satoshi Kanazawa .
Wrong .
Without even getting into the definition of " reasonably attractive young woman " ( RAYW ) which can lead to a whole lifetime of arguments ( and I have n't had my second cup of coffee yet ) , I 'd like to take exception to my distinguished colleague 's assertion that pretty girls have as much influence in the world as men with money , guns , property , lawmakers and lawyers on their side .
If that were the case , then RAYW would be the ones running governments , owning corporations , deciding the futures of educational , economic , and cultural institutions .
There would be no war , no slave camps , no government - graft , and Tampax rather than Viagra would be covered by all health care plans .
I take feminism seriously , and treat anti-feminists lightly .
I also take it personally and here 's why :
When I started my first year as a student at Dartmouth College , there were five men for every woman .
I thought I had it made .
Dartmouth had only recently admitted women , and the administration thought it best to get the alumni accustomed to the idea by sneaking us in a few at a time .
With such terrific odds in my favor socially , how could I lose ?
I 'd dated in high school and although I was n't exactly Miss Budwiser I figured I 'd have no problem getting a date every Saturday night .
But I noticed an unnerving pattern .
I 'd meet a cute guy at a party and talk for a while .
We would then be interrupted by some buddy of his who would drag him off to another room to watch a friend of theirs " power boot " ( the local vernacular for " projectile vomiting " ) and I realized that the social situation was not what I had expected .
Then somebody explained to me that on this campus " they think you 're a faggot if you like women more than beer . "
This statement indicated by its very vocabulary the advanced nature of the sentiment behind it .
If a guy said he wanted to spend the weekend with his girlfriend , for example , he'd be taunted by his pals who would yell in beery bass voices " Whatsa matter with you , Skip ?
We 're gonna get plowed , absolutely blind this weekend , then we 're all gonna power - boot .
And you wanna see that broad again ?
Whaddayou , a faggot or something ? "
It turned out that the male - female ratio did not prove to be the marvelous bonus I had anticipated .
But still I figured that the school was good enough to justify spending the next few years getting down to studying and forgoing a wild .
I thought it would all work out , that at least I would be accepted in my classes as a good student and get through the next couple of years without too much worry or trouble .
Okay , I told myself that I could live with that and found in fact that guys from other schools to be a healthy practice anyway .
But the real shock came in the classroom where I was often one of two or three women in the group .
One professor , I remember , always prefaced calling on me or any other woman in the class by asking " Miss Barreca , as a woman , what is your reading of this text ? "
I was profoundly embarrassed to be asked my opinion as a woman , since it seemed somehow less authoritative than being asked my opinion as a student or as a " general " reader .
At first , I jokingly replied that I would be happy to answer " as a person , " but that it was hard for me to answer as a woman .
When the professor did n't so much as smile , I knew that tactic would n't work .
Every time I raised my hand to answer a question , I was asked my opinion as a woman .
It frustrated and angered me , because I wanted to be treated as an individual and not as a representative of a group .
It took months to understand that in the eyes of this teacher , I 'd always be a " Miss " rather than just another , ordinary student .
When I realized that there was no alternative , I figured I 'd go with it , exaggerate the situation enough so that I could at least enjoy myself .
So I started prefacing every answer with the phrase , " As I woman , I think Shakespeare means . . . " , " As a woman , it strikes me that Tennyson 's point is . . . "
But then I figured , why stop at this ?
I started to say " As a woman , I think the weather 's rather cold for June . "
" As a woman , I think I 'll have the meatloaf for dinner . "
" As a woman , I think I 'll go to bed early tonight . "
It started out as a joke , but as it caught on ( a number of my friends started to use the same strategy to make the professors and guys in general hear how their remarks sounded ) we started to examine further .
Maybe we really were always speaking as a woman .
Maybe there was no such thing as speaking as " just " a person .
Maybe we always spoke as women whenever we spoke .
Maybe this joke was n't such a joke .
So that even as I stopped saying " As I woman , I believe such - and - such , " I started thinking it .
It occured to me that nothing was neuter or neutral .
I saw that my responses were in part determined by the fact of my -- as well as by other factors like my class and .
I did n't read novels about war in the same way a man would , for example , since I had n't been brought up to consider going to war as a soldier as a possible future for myself .
I had n't played war games as a kid , I did n't find the idea of war engaging .
It did not have " universal appeal " since it did n't appeal to me , a but nevertheless compelling argument .
In the same way that the male students complained that Jane Austen was obviously a second - rate writer because all she was interested in was ( Mark Twain once said that it was " a pity they let her die a natural death " ) , so I decided to assert that Hemingway 's concern for bullfighting was no concern for an intelligent , insightful woman .
Of what interest is bullfighting to the contemporary female reader ?
Hemingway was therefore second - rate , by their definition , since his subject matter had limited appeal and seemed gender - specific .
I learned to answer " Of course " when asked whether I responded to things as a female .
I learned to accept that and even enjoyed discovering the ways in which my viewpoint differed from the perspective offered by my male peers .
But even understanding that the world identified me first as a woman and only secondly as anything else did n't stop me from being horrified the first time somebody called me a " feminist . "
I thought being a feminist meant I could n't wear lipstick or crave men with small behinds .
I thought that " feminist " meant I could n't send " Peanuts " cards to guys who I was afraid would n't call back , or buy stockings with seams .
I thought " feminist " meant no more steamy flirtations or prolonged shopping trips .
I thought it meant braided hair and short nails , maybe mandatory tofu .
I certainly associated feminism with humorless , dour , and -- worst of all - - unblinkingly earnest women .
That was because I was accepting the male version of things , which was sort of like believing the mouse 's version of the cat , since it entailed being given access to a vision that could see nothing besides teeth and claws .
I was warned about so - called feminists .
I was told by boyfriends , relatives , professors and other disreputable sources that such women were ambitious , sharp - tongued , a little too smart for their own good .
They told me that only women who could n't get laid got political .
They told me what was perhaps the biggest and most interesting lie of all : that independence and ambition were unattractive in a woman .
They also suggested , subtly but seriously , that too much of a in a woman made her unattractive ( a comment to which comedian Elayne Boosler would reply " Comedy is very , very sexy when it 's done right " ) .
Luckily , during a moment that eclipsed all earlier illumination , I heard a female graduate student repeat a wonderful line from writer Robin Morgan , " We are the women that men have warned us about . "
It was as if the little light - bulb that appeared over Bugs Bunny 's head when he got an idea suddenly appeared over mine .
It seemed unnerving , actually , that I was gazing reprovingly at all those qualities that I myself possessed .
I was certainly ambitious , ready to speak and eager to defend my position on a subject .
I liked being a woman , was proud of my femininity and believed myself to be equal to any task set before me by society -- at least as well equipped to deal with them as any guy I sat next to in class ( he could no more skin a bison than I could and I could probably defend myself on Tenth Avenue more ably than he ) .
So , when I really thought about it , I was already a feminist no matter what I chose to call myself .
When I looked around , I saw a lot of smart , funny women who also fit the bill .
We were all feminists , the fun kind , whether or not we 'd admitted it aloud before .
It was sort of like admitting we were secretly Bad Girls , and for me the admission held the same sort of delightful relief .
Oh , is that what I am ?
Is this what the word means , is this what the name names ?
Is this what a feminist is ?
Oh good
It 's like when Gloria Steinem was told on her 40th birthday " You do n't look forty , " to which she replied " This is what forty looks like . "
When I was told after that moment of revelation " You do n't look / act / speak like a feminist , " I answered " This is what a feminist looks / acts / speaks like . "
These old narrow ideas of the feminist as a dour , sour - faced woman have got to go .
Feminists are not a tribe of women fenced off from the rest of society .
Feminists read cookbooks and clip coupons from Sunday supplements .
Feminists like to dance , and wear high - heels , often doing all three at the same time .
Feminists can like men-- and enjoy the process of liking individual men for their own worth instead of valuing all men simply because they 're male .
Feminists enjoy the company of other women and value the company of other women .
Feminists do n't wish they were men ; they celebrate their womanhood .
Nicole Hollander had " Sylvia 's " daughter pose the eternal question " Ma , do you think I can be a feminist and still like men ? "
Sylvia replies , as she always does , in unambiguous terms : " Sure .
Just like you can be a vegetarian and like fried chicken . "
While Hollander 's example is wonderfully funny , it also indicates the way in which women struggle with the do's and don'ts of feminism .
The point of feminism is not to alienate men , but for women to focus on our own concerns and needs , to establish our own values .
These may or may not coincide with the already established values of our dominant culture , just as our concerns and needs may or may not fold neatly into a relationship .
The point is to work on making decisions based on choices that are really choices instead of following a script -- in other words , it means learning to laugh at what we find funny instead of just following along with the laugh track and to make trouble when trouble is necessary .
I see , rather remarkably , my female students going through the same sorts of trials and self - examinations today in spite of the fifteen years of feminism that have passed .
Some of these women students are planning to go to medical school .
Some are engineering majors .
They are track stars or nationally - ranked basketball players .
These young women certainly work hard , compete fiercely and are not embarrassed about admitting that their are high .
They work to put themselves through school .
Most of them are n't considering getting married until they 're several years into their chosen professions .
Most of them leave home after graduation to make their way in cities across the country to find interesting , challenging jobs .
Yet when I ask how many of them consider themselves feminists , only about a third in any one class will dare to raise their hands .
These women may not be afraid of getting bad scores on the LSATs or GREs , but they 're afraid of not getting a date .
They can be independent , intelligent and proud to be women .
But a little word like " feminism " scares them .
One girl , a student who'd taken two women - and - literature classes with me said that she loved the material , that the books had changed how she thought about herself and her relationships with men .
We were having coffee in my office while discussing the subversion of the marriage plot in the contemporary woman 's novel when I mentioned something about being pleased that her feminist perspective was being finely delineated by her careful work on the novel .
" Oh , but I 'm not a feminist , " she said , surprising me , " I do n't like that word . "
I gulped , and felt that whatever work I 'd done in class I 'd obviously missed out a crucial discussion .
Why are so many women afraid to call themselves feminists ?
It is because they the condemnation of experts such as Satoshi Kanazawa ?
Catharine R. Stimpson wrote an article for Ms. in 1987 about how important it is for women to learn to say the " F Word " in public .
Stimpson , who is the dean of the Graduate School at Rutgers University , is of course referring to the word " feminism " when she uses the phrase " the F Word . "
We know well enough that nobody 's embarrassed to say the word " fuck " anymore , but a lot of women are still hesitant to say the word " feminism " in mixed company -- as if saying " Yes , I 'm a feminist " is much more unladylike than telling somebody , for example , to " fuck off . "
The trouble is that to a number of people , the two phrases are synonymous , which is a great pity .
Stimpson suggests that if women continue to change in a positive way then " people will be able to say ' feminist ' as casually as they now say ' wife ' or ' kid ' or ' snack ' " and ends her article by calling for feminists to use " more audacity , more humor , when we speak of feminism . "
Most of feminism is made up of just such gestures .
The last thing feminism is about is exclusion .
Feminists can be defined as those women and men who recognize that the earth does n't revolve around anybody 's son-- or around any one group .
In a collection of essays on women 's humor titled Last Laughs : Perspectives on Women and Comedy , Fay Weldon quotes the old joke " Question :
How many radical feminists does it take to change a light - bulb ?
Answer :
That 's not funny ! "
Weldon then goes on to say that humor acts as a kind of a shorthand that " saves me from writing a long paragraph about how feminists get accused of not being able to make jokes , and a few of us certainly can't , which makes a few of us uneasy , which is why it 's a joke in the first place ... "

1997 : Microsoft rescues one - time and future nemesis Apple with a $ 150 million investment that breathes new life into a struggling Silicon Alley icon .
In a remarkable feat of negotiating legerdemain , Apple co-founder Steve Jobs got needed cash — in return for non-voting shares — and an assurance that Microsoft would support Office for the Mac for five years .
Apple agreed to drop a long - running lawsuit in which they alleged Microsoft copied the look and feel of the Mac OS for Windows and to make Internet Explorer the default browser on its computers — but not the only choice .
Microsoft got to look like a noble competitor , for a change , for what amounted to a rounding error on their annual revenues .
Timing mattered :
The company was in the midst of an image - tarnishing antitrust fight over its heavy - handed promotion of IE during the height of the browser wars with Netscape .
The Apple faithful had already been conditioned to expect the unexpected when Jobs was in the house .
But this surprise announcement , at Macworld in Boston , was pure Jobs theater .
And it came with an oddly juxtaposed ( satellite ! ) video feed of then - Microsoft CEO Bill Gates piped into the auditorium , dwarfing Jobs on stage .
The imagery may have been unintentional but the metaphor was entirely accurate : Apple had a tiny share of the desktop computer market , had not yet revolutionized the music industry with the iPod and could n't possibly dare to dream it would disrupt the smartphone market with the iPhone — because there was no such thing as a smartphone .
And while the fanboys did n't exactly know what to make of the new friendship between the corporate equivalents of a mongoose and a cobra , their instinct was , of course , to be against it .
As reported at the time by The Seattle Times , " The unexpected revelation ... prompted gasps of disbelief and loud boos from the audience of thousands of Mac users and software developers . "
Jobs , the Times reported , " attempted to soothe the audience , saying : ' We have to let go of a few notions here .
We have to let go of the notion that for Apple to win , Microsoft needs to lose . ' "
Neither company ( or executive ) lost , but the world has changed in unpredictable ways and both have new competitors to worry about — in particular , a little company that was founded a scant year later .
In little more than a decade Google has become the leader in search and an emerging power in cloud computing , both vital to Microsoft , as well as a player in the smartphone platform , which horns in on Apple .
But in this simpler time the deal gave Jobs the running room to make Apple a 21st century powerhouse , which , after 18 months of losses , was hardly a forgone conclusion .
On the strength of the deal Jobs — still a mere adviser to the Apple board — got himself hired as " interim CEO . "
Fired in 1985 , Jobs would return at Top Dog .
He would receive no pay , and he could quit at any time .
" The message was clear , " Frank Rose wrote in a new introduction to his 1989 history of Apple , West of Eden .
" Apple needed him more than he needed Apple . "
And Jobs set out to prove it , with a rapid dismantling of virtually everything predecessor John Sculley had done .
As Rose recounts :
Over the next few months , more changes followed — each of them a repudiation of one Sculley initiative or another .
The number of product lines was winnowed from 15 to four .
The retail channel was streamlined : Instead of selling through competing chains in a misguided drive for " shelf space , " sales were unified through an exclusive national dealer .
Marketing was focused around a single message — the " Think Different " campaign from Chiat / Day , the newly rehired ad agency behind the unforgettable " 1984 ” TV spot that had launched the Mac .
The licensing deals that enabled other manufacturers to undercut Apple with Mac clones were terminated .
Operating expenses were cut nearly in half .
Within months , Apple was back in the black .
While another suitor or White Knight may have emerged instead , the Microsoft deal provided a number of things : a cash cushion , the neutralization of Apple 's chief tormentor , continued independence and — perhaps most important — a way for Jobs to make his Phoenix - like return and assemble the small inner circle that still runs everything at One Infinite Loop .
And without the alignment of these particular stars it is anyone 's guess if the iRevolution – iMac , iTunes , iPod , iPhone – would have ever happened .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has granted a “ special pardon ” to two jailed U.S. journalists which releases them from detention , the official KCNA news agency reported on Tuesday .
“ Kim Jong -il issued an order of the chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission on granting a special pardon to the two American journalists who had been sentenced to hard labor in accordance with Article 103 of the Socialist Constitution and releasing them , ” KCNA said in a statement which carried a Pyongyang dateline .
Chris Taylor is a young , naive American who gives up college and volunteers for combat in Vietnam .
Upon arrival , he quickly discovers that his presence is quite nonessential , and is considered insignificant to the other soldiers , as he has not fought for as long as the rest of them and felt the effects of combat .
Chris has two non-commissioned officers , the ill - tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin .
A line is drawn between the two NCOs and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid .
As the war continues , Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown .
And as he struggles for survival , he soon realizes he is fighting two battles , the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon .

Non takes a stab at answering the question , " is Fedor ducking the best competition by not signing with the UFC ? " :
The USA TODAY / SB Nation consensus rankings appear to support the criticism .
After Emelianenko at No. 1 , five of the next six heavyweights work for the Ultimate Fighting Championship .
( The exception happens to be the guy whose steroid testing result led to the current state of affairs ) .
But do n't sell Strikeforce 's roster short .
The second - biggest U.S. promotion lacks anyone with the hype of UFC champion Brock Lesnar , but the top of its heavyweight roster presents formidable options : Brett Rogers .
No. 8 in the consensus rankings .
Alistair Overeem . No. 10 in the rankings .
Fabricio Werdum .
No. 14 in the rankings .
Paul Buentello .
No. 24 in the rankings .
Then Sergio runs through the UFC roster :
... consider what UFC has to offer for credible competition over the next year or so , other than Lesnar and Frank Mir : Randy Couture .
A 46 - year - old .
A very tough , very skilled 46 - year - old , to be sure , but each day brings him closer to qualifying for an AARP membership .

Shane Carwin .
His 11 - 0 record is comparable to Rogers ' 10 - 0 resume -- if you remove Rogers ' win over a former UFC champion .
Either way , Emelianenko faces a paucity of exciting , big - name challenges .
Little wonder that his choice came down to building his business instead .
In contrast , here 's Kevin Iole 's take on the Strikeforce heavies :
• Emelianenko - Overeem : ... You ca n’t rule a guy with Overeem ’s power , strength and grappling skills out , but Emelianenko is far more gifted and would defeat Overeem in the first round .
• Emelianenko - Rogers : ... Rogers could win if he could hit Emelianenko with a wild shot , but the more likely scenario is that the fight gets to the ground and Emelianenko submits Rogers early .
• Emelianenko - Buentello : Buentello is n’t close to having the kind of all - around game to defeat “ The Last Emperor . ” • Emelianenko - Werdum : Werdum has a good all - around game , but you never know what you will get from him .
He has good jiu - jitsu and judo and his stoppage of Gabriel Gonzaga proves he has the power .
But he looked horrific in a loss to Arlovski in 2007 and was blown out by Junior Dos Santos last year .

We were as shocked as anyone when BMW announced it was quitting Formula 1 to devote more resources to developing cleaner , greener automobiles .
There was some skepticism , but BMW was n't blowing green smoke .
It 's serious about building eco-friendlier pavement - peeling cars .
First up is a slick 356 - horsepower all - wheel - drive plug - in diesel - hybrid concept that BMW claims accelerates like an M3 , sips gas like a Toyota Prius and can go 31 miles on battery power alone .
It 's called the Vision Efficientdynamics Concept , and we 'll see it later this month at the Frankfurt auto show .
No , Vision Efficientdynamics Concept does n't exactly roll off the tongue .
But the name aside , BMW has a dynamite idea on its hands here .
The EfficientDynamics is a 2+2 four - door hybrid that combines M Series performance with better fuel efficiency and less emissions than you see in many compacts .
BMW performs this magic by marrying its ActiveHybrid technology with an extremely economical engine and excellent aerodynamics .
The result is a concept car with a top speed governed at 155 mph and a zero - to - 62 acceleration time of 4.8 seconds .
More impressive , the car gets 62.2 mpg and emits a Prius - like 99 grams of CO2 per kilometer .
Power comes from a 1.5 - liter direct injection 3 - cylinder turbodiesel engine and an electric motor on each axle .
The engine was small to squeeze in between the rear seat and the rear axle , which should make the Efficientdynamics Concept very agile .
The diesel puts out 163 horsepower and 214 pound - feet of torque .
Add in the motors and total output is 356 ponies and a stump - pulling 590 pound - feet , though you can only get that much power in short bursts .
The car has all - wheel - drive when running in electric mode .
BMW says the car can run on the diesel engine , either one of the electric motors or any combination of the three .
The lithium - polymer battery pack sports 98 cells .
It delivers 8.6 kilowatt - hours for driving the car , and BMW says the serial arrangement of cells has gross storage capacity of 10.8 kilowatt - hours .
The pack weighs 187 pounds and BMW says it does n't need an active cooling system .
BMW says the battery recharges in 2.5 hours at 220 volts .
All that tech is housed in a body designed with some serious inspiration from BMW 's Formula 1 cars .
BMW says the Vision has a drag coefficient of 0.22 , aided in part by the myriad vanes and ducts .
People are going to love it or hate it , but you 'd expect nothing less from BMW even without controversial designer Chris Bangle around anymore .
So far the Vision is just a concept .
Still , BMW has made it clear it plans to make sustainability a cornerstone of its lineup , so we 're sure to see some of the technology in road cars before long .

The curious tale of an Obama hating , cashed up , nuclear Timothy McVeigh from Maine .
By Julian Assange ( investigations editor )
It has all the makings of a great story .
But outside of the US state of Maine and select counter - terrorism circles , you wo n't have heard about it .
For this is a story with all the right ingredients but one wrong ingredient .
On the right side is a leaked FBI intelligence report , Obama 's inauguration , a multi-million dollar trust fund , a woman , uranium , thorium , the first attempt to build a " dirty bomb " on US soil , and , of course , murder .
On the wrong is the body of James G. Cummings , white supremacist millionaire , found in his Belfast home on December 9 , 2008 , shot to death .
After local police attended the scene , the FBI moved in and sealed off the building .
Men in protective suits descended on the home but police refused to comment about what they found .
Mrs. Cummings was taken into custody .
Then on January 12 , 2009 , Wikileaks revealed a confidential FBI field intelligence report on the incident as part of a Presidential inauguration threat analysis . [ 1 ]
According to the FBI report , Cummings had four lots of one gallon containers of bomb - grade hydrogen peroxide , uranium , thorium ( also radioactive ) , lithium metal , thermite , aluminum powder , beryllium ( radiation booster ) , boron , black iron oxide and magnesium ribbon .
While the radiation levels from Cummings initial device would have not have been physically significant compared to its explosive and toxic effects , had Cummings set off the device in Washington DC , during Obama 's Presidential inauguration , its psychogenic effect may have hospitalized thousands .
The FBI states it also seized literature on how to build “ dirty bombs ” and information about cesium - 137 , strontium - 90 and cobalt - 60 and other radioactive materials .
There was also evidence linking Cummings to white supremacist groups , including Cummings ' membership application to the US National Socialist ( Nazi ) party .
Local tradesmen who worked at the Cummings home told Maine reporters that Cummings was an ardent admirer of Adolf Hitler and had a collection of Nazi memorabilia around the house , including a prominently displayed flag with a swastika .
Cummings claimed to have pieces of Hitler ’s personal silverware and place settings . [ 2 ]
Though the Associated Press independently confirmed the Wikileaks FBI report , no - one outside of the Maine press ( and Wikileaks ) wanted to tell their readers about the first credible " dirty bomb " plot on US soil .
Why has n't the story been picked up by the national press ?
Perhaps the media has simply tired of " dirty bombs " ?
Not at all !
There have been at least 1,264 media references to " dirty bomb " in the past month .
A mere 23 , or 1.8 % , relate to the Cummings case -- despite it being the only real plot among them . [ 3 ]
Of the 23 Cummings references 21 are local Maine media and two are from security industry magazines .
The same time period saw 409 blog references , Some 76 , or 19 % , relate to the Cummings case -- ten times the ratio of organized media . [ 4 ]
However , 78 out of 79 bloggers simply copied text from Maine 's paper of record , the Bangor Daily News ( BDN ) which followed up the Wikileaks document with a strong traditional press investigation .
The 79th also wondered about the media silence outside of Maine .
Conservatives apparently did n't want to draw attention to a radioactive , wealthy version of Timothy McVeigh coming from their own sphere , although nearly every day during Bush 's reign saw " dirty bombs " hyped as the ultimate threat .
The left did n't want to repeat another " dirty bomb " story , the likes of which Republicans had used to drive hundreds of billions of dollars into Republican dominated military and security contractors .
Those same contractors normally would have comprised a lobby to get the story out -- and counter - terrorism dollars in -- but their message lines were finely honed to hype threats posed by militant Islam and radical anti-capitalist greens .
Libertarians all over had conditioned themselves to oppose reportage that might lead to reactionary state controls .
The FBI was n't talking and the Maine government tried to play incident down , under the rubric that they had protected Maine citizens at all times , despite apparently having had no conception of the Cummings plot .
Journalists of various hues at influential east coast outlets could have pushed the story had there been enough prestige incentive to overcome other allegiances , but because Wikileaks and BDN were " first " there was no such incentive .
If there were journalism awards to be had , they'd be going to Maine journalists and Wikileaks .
And there you have it .
The first " dirty bomb " plot on US soil , cut short only by a Shakespearean murder .
But until now , you probably never heard about it , because only a few had incentives to tell you .
But the Belfast dirty bomber is just one drop from an ocean of truth that is unreported , not repeated , and does not enter into civil discourse , because it is not perceived to be profitable to talk about , regardless of how profitable it may be to hear .
Yet it is from these shared perceptions that we form the structure of civilization itself .
Every government , every law , every regulation and every constitution is its product .
Hence the quality of civilization is predicated on the degree to which civil discourse is a fair representation of the world we live in .
That is why the revelation of primary source knowledge , from which everything else follows , is so important .
Its limits are the limits of civilization itself .

New ID cards are supposed to be ' unforgeable ' - but it took our expert 12 minutes to clone one , and programme it with false data
Adam Laurie is no ordinary hacker .
In the world of computing , he is considered a genius - a man whose talents are used by government departments and blue - chip companies to guard against terrorists and cyber-criminals .
But even by his standards , what he is about to demonstrate is mind - boggling - and deeply disturbing .
Laurie is holding one of 51,000 ID cards issued by the Home Office to foreign nationals currently working or studying in Britain .
Flawed :
The new ID card design , with the same data we were able to forge
It is similar to the ID card for British citizens unveiled last week by Alan Johnson , the Home Secretary , as part of the Government 's ongoing National Identity Scheme .
Embedded inside the card for foreigners is a microchip with the details of its bearer held in electronic form : name , date of birth , physical characteristics , fingerprints and so on , together with other information such as immigration status and whether the holder is entitled to State benefits .
This chip is the vital security measure that , so the Government believes , will make identity cards ' unforgeable ' .
But as I watch , Laurie picks up a mobile phone and , using just the handset and a laptop computer , electronically copies the ID card microchip and all its information in a matter of minutes .
He then creates a cloned card , and with a little help from another technology expert , he changes all the information the card contains - the physical details of the bearer , name , fingerprints and so on .
And he does n't stop there .
With a few more keystrokes on his computer , Laurie changes the cloned card so that whereas the original card holder was not entitled to benefits , the cloned chip now reads ' Entitled to benefits ' .
As a chilling twist , he adds a message that would be visible to any police officer or security official who scanned the card : ' I am a terrorist - shoot on sight . '
And all of this has been done in such a way as to fool the electronic readers intended to check the ID card 's authenticity .
It is , quite simply , a terrifying achievement .
For the implications of what he has demonstrated could scarcely be more serious .
Laurie 's fake card could be used to fool banks , commit fraud and maybe even illegally claim benefits or free NHS care .
More disturbing still , it could be used to cover the tracks of terrorists planning atrocities on British or foreign soil .
By any sensible measure , his demonstration , as part of a special Mail investigation , should be the final nail in the coffin of the Government 's £ 5.4 - billion ID scheme .
The card unveiled by the Home Secretary will not hit the streets until the end of this year , so Laurie has not had the chance to test the precise design .
But according to the UK Identity And Passport Service , it is essentially the same and potentially just as vulnerable as the Home Office 's ' foreign nationals ' card we tested .
' It is the same technology , ' a spokesman told me .
' We 're not running two different systems .
It is just the facade that is different . '
This does not augur well for the reputation of the supposedly fail - safe ID card .
The Government says the scheme will be rolled out only on a ' voluntary ' basis , beginning with a trial run in Manchester in November .
But if Labour wins the next General Election and continues with its current policy , the scheme will be expanded nationwide by 2012 .
And , as many banks , businesses and public service providers start to require an ID card as part of routine identity checks , Labour hopes the public will feel it has little option other than to ' opt in ' to carrying a card , if only to make life simpler .
But would you volunteer for one ?
The Government insists the technology is totally secure .
This investigation shows that the very opposite is true .
Our inquiries began last December , when Adam Laurie and I approached the Home Office with our suspicions that ID cards for foreign nationals , issued for the first time just one month earlier , were potentially flawed .
Officials agreed to meet us to discuss our concerns - then cancelled at the last minute .
So we decided to test the system for ourselves .
It took us several months to persuade a foreign student to lend us his card to examine .
But when we got one , even we were shocked by what we found .
Within 12 minutes of laying his hands on it , Laurie had made a clone .
I 'll explain what he did next , but first some background .
Disturbing :
The card , unveiled by Home Secretary Alan Johnson , will not hit the streets until next year
The Identity Cards Act introduced by Labour in 2006 states that the National Identity Register , which is the backbone of the scheme , may contain 50 separate categories of information about you .
These range from ' biometric data ' - your physical characteristics , fingerprints , facial image and so on - to your current and previous addresses , your immigration status , your National Insurance , passport and driving licence numbers .
And , once registered for the scheme , if you fail to inform the Identity And Passport Service of any changes of address , you can be fined up to £ 1,000 .
Contrary to common belief , only two sections of the community were ever to have been forced to have ID cards : foreign nationals from outside the EU wishing to reside in the UK and workers at airports .
Now , following an outcry by the unions , only foreign nationals will be compelled to have them .
Even so , it is a huge project .
By the end of this year , it is expected that 75,000 cards will have been issued , forming the basis of tougher immigration controls .
For our investigation we borrowed one of these cards from a foreign student whom we shall call Albert ( he has asked that we do not use his true name ) .
About the size of a credit card , it displays his photograph , as well as printed details of his name , date of birth and so on .
Embedded inside the plastic , however , is a computer chip that contains an additional digital record of all of these details , together with a copy of Albert 's fingerprints .
This is called a Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) chip .
It features a tiny antenna that allows the card to bounce back information when contacted by a special electronic ' reader ' device .
And it is this which was supposed to be the ' unbreakable ' security measure that would ensure ID cards could never be cloned or faked .
We set out to prove whether this was indeed the case , using technology that is freely available on the High Street .
We have deliberately withheld some details of our procedure , so as not to encourage criminals .
But at its simplest , this is how it works .
To create his ' clone ' , Adam Laurie studied the card to locate a particular set of numbers that are printed on it .
( These provide a key to cracking the encryption on the chip but , for security reasons , we will not reveal where they are ) .
Laurie then inputted these numbers into a standard Nokia mobile phone , which comes pre-equipped with chip - scanning software .
In seconds , the phone was able to read and copy the readable digital information contained in the chip .
Laurie then held the phone against a blank plastic smart card , of the sort routinely used in office buildings for electronic entry systems or for Transport for London 's Oyster cards , all of which contain similar RFID chips .
He was then able to download Albert 's ID chip details on to the blank smart card , creating a perfect copy or ' clone ' .
So far , so extraordinary .
But there is more .
Would we also be able to alter the cloned card , changing the details to match another person 's data ?
In other words , would we be able to make an ID chip that was not only a copy of a genuine one , but was a tailor - made fake - the sort that would be much sought - after by any criminal or terrorist seeking the ultimate false proof of identity ?
This was a more complex process because the ID chips are supposed to be tamper - proof .
Each chip stores its holder 's personal data in 16 separate files , known as ' datagroups ' .
Technology available on the High Street : Standard Nokias come equipped with chip - scanning software
So , for example , Number 1 datagroup has details of Albert 's name , date of birth and so on .
Number 2 holds a digital version of his photograph , Number 3 his fingerprints right through to Number 13 , which holds details of his immigration status , and Number 14 which is reserved for future use - possibly iris scan data .
Each one of these files is supposed to be protected with a special digital key , so that if anyone attempts to change it , the card would be identifiable as a fake to any official with a digital chip reader .
To get round this hurdle , we recruited the help of another technology expert , Jeroen van Beek , an Amsterdam - based computer consultant who advises many top companies on digital security .
Drawing on the work of renowned New Zealand computer scientist Peter Gutmann , our team was able to alter the contents of each datagroup and then ' relock ' them , so that the card would be accepted as genuine .
We had created a perfect fake chip .
The Government 's ' fail - safe ' security had failed .
So how could we prove that our fake card would work in everyday use ?
Well , according to the Home Office 's Identity And Passport Service ( IPS ) and the Government 's Directgov website , there will be three methods used to verify ID cards as they slowly become more commonplace .
The first method is simply a visual check .
You would present your ID card to a shopkeeper , bank worker , police officer or whoever and they would scrutinise the printed details on the card to confirm you were indeed the rightful holder .
The second would be an onsite check where your face or fingerprints would be compared with those held in the card chip .
The third would be an electronic comparison of your face or fingerprints with those lodged on the National Identity Register when you applied for your card .
As for the first check , we have allowed ourselves the luxury of assuming that , in common with all official documents , the facade of the ID card will be faked at some point , in spite of some impressive security features .
Either that , or blank cards will be stolen to order .
Last year , for example , 3,000 blank UK passports were spirited away while in transit .
Obviously , having changed the details on the chip , ours would fail the third check , the one against the information on the National Identity Register .
But the Identity And Passport Service does n't expect most transactions to involve a check with the register , because it is likely to involve a charge to the user of about £ 2 .
The most important check , therefore , and the one experts believe will be most commonplace , is the second one - the one where an electronic reader at a shop , bank , supermarket and so on would compare your fingerprints or facial image with that contained on your card 's chip .
' Folly ' : Chris Huhne , Lib Dem Shadow Home Secretary , dubbed the venture an ' intrusion into our privacy '
So would our ' fake ' card pass this test ?
Incredibly , even though more than 51,000 ID cards have already been issued , there are no official electronic readers to check them against , except at UK borders , where foreigners '
ID cards have replaced old - style paper visas .
There , the readers must comply with standards set down by the International Civil Aviation Organization , a branch of the United Nations .
Its card and passport - checking software , called Golden Reader Tool , is designed to spot faked chips and will almost certainly be the system implemented in the next phase of the ID card scheme .
So we downloaded the latest version of Golden Reader and used it to test our cloned card .
The card passed .
We had created a perfect electronic forgery - one that could be used for any number of illegal activities .
This , however , was not enough to ring alarm bells at the Home Office .
When told of our investigation , a spokesman said : ' We are satisfied the personal data on the chip cannot be changed or modified and there is no evidence this has happened .
' The identity card includes a number of design and security features that are extremely difficult to replicate .
' We remain confident that the identity card is one of the most secure of its kind , fully meeting rigorous international standards .
That view is not shared by Ian Angell , professor of information systems at the London School of Economics .
He said : ' This has put a huge nail in the coffin of the National Identity Scheme .
The Government can no longer say ID cards will protect us from identity theft .
You have proved that they wo n't . '
So what does all this mean ?
Well , technological fixes may eventually be available for all our hacks and fiddles .
Nevertheless , we have demonstrated that there are serious questions to be answered about the security of the whole project .
' If the Government is serious about preventing identity theft , then it really has to do better than this , ' says Adam Laurie .
' My real concern is that if someone falls victim to an identity theft of the type we have demonstrated , it is going to be very hard for them to prove their innocence if that forged card is subsequently used to commit a crime .
' After all , the Government claims that the technology is foolproof . '
Even if we set aside such security concerns , it would appear that the whole ID scheme is in a shambolic state .
The Identity And Passport Service is currently issuing about 10,000 ID cards a month , but in the absence of any digital readers , any organisation that wants to check a card 's authenticity is in for a shock .
The Home Office advises calling the UK Border Agency Card Verification Helpline .
So I did just that .
It took 19 minutes for someone to answer the phone .
Posing as a businessman , I said I had recently been shown a new ID card by a customer as proof of his identity and was uncertain whether I could rely on it .
I was told to ask my customer for a ' second proof of identity ' .
In other words , even the official ID card helpline says it 's best to rely on other forms of identity .
In which case , why bother having the cards at all ?
So , the theory is flawed , the technology is flawed , and the checks on ID cards are either non-existent or woefully insufficient .
When we told Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary , about our findings , he was appalled .
' The Daily Mail 's investigation has blown such a huge hole in the Government 's ill - fated ID card scheme that it is now sinking beneath the waves , ' he said .
' Surely it can only be a matter of time before Home Secretary Alan Johnson recognises the folly of continuing with this expensive and misguided intrusion into our privacy . '
How much more proof does the Government need before it bows to the inevitable and scraps this useless and nonsensical enterprise - and saves us £ 5 billion into the bargain ?

The essence of the program of German étatisme is social insurance .
But people outside the German Empire have also come to look upon social insurance as the highest point to which the insight of the statesman and political wisdom can attain .
If some praise the wonderful results of these institutions , others can only reproach them for not going far enough , for not including all classes , and for not giving the favored all that , in their opinion , they should have .
Social insurance , it was said , ultimately aimed at giving every citizen adequate care and the best medical treatment in sickness and adequate sustenance if he should become incapable of work through accident , sickness or old age , or if he should fail to find work on conditions he considered necessary .
No ordered community has callously allowed the poor and incapacitated to starve .
There has always been some sort of institution designed to save from destitution people unable to sustain themselves .
As general well - being has increased hand in hand with the development of capitalism , so too has the relief of the poor improved .
Simultaneously the legal basis of this relief has changed .
What was formerly a charity on which the poor had no claim is now a duty of the community .
Arrangements are made to ensure the support of the poor .
But at first people took care not to give the individual poor a legally enforceable claim to support or sustenance .
In the same way they did not at once think of removing the slight stigma attaching to all who were thus maintained by the community .
This was not callousness .
The discussions which grew out of the English Poor Law in particular show that people were fully conscious of the great social dangers involved in every extension of poor relief .
German social insurance and the corresponding institutions of other states are constructed on a very different basis .
Maintenance is a claim which the person entitled to it can enforce at law .
The claimant suffers no slur on his social standing .
He is a state pensioner like the king or his ministers or the receiver of an insurance annuity , like anyone else who has entered into an insurance contract .
There is also no doubt that he is entitled to look on what he receives as the equivalent of his own contributions .
For the insurance contributions are always at the expense of wages , immaterial of whether they are collected from the entrepreneur or from the workers .
What the entrepreneur has to pay for the insurance is a charge on labor 's marginal productivity , it thus tends to reduce the wages of labor .
When the costs of maintenance are provided out of taxes the worker clearly contributes towards them , directly or indirectly .
To the intellectual champions of social insurance , and to the politicians and statesmen who enacted it , illness and health appeared as two conditions of the human body sharply separated from each other and always recognizable without difficulty or doubt .
Any doctor could diagnose the characteristics of " health . " " Illness " was a bodily phenomenon that showed itself independently of human will and was not susceptible to influence by will .
There were people who for some reason or other simulated illness , but a doctor could expose the pretence .
Only the healthy person was fully efficient .
The efficiency of the sick person was lowered according to the gravity and nature of his illness , and the doctor was able , by means of objectively ascertainable physiological tests , to indicate the degree of the reduction of efficiency .
Now every statement in this theory is false .
There is no clearly defined frontier between health and illness .
Being ill is not a phenomenon independent of conscious will and of psychic forces working in the subconscious .
A man 's efficiency is not merely the result of his physical condition ; it depends largely on his mind and will .
Thus the whole idea of being able to separate , by medical examination , the unfit from the fit and from the malingerers , and those able to work from those unable to work , proves to be untenable .
Those who believed that accident and health insurance could be based on completely effective means of ascertaining illnesses and injuries and their consequences were very much mistaken .
The destructionist aspect of accident and health insurance lies above all in the fact that such institutions promote accidents and illness , hinder recovery , and very often create , or at any rate intensify and lengthen , the functional disorders which follow illness or accident .
A special disease , traumatic neurosis , which had already appeared in some cases as a result of the legal regulation of claims for compensation for injury , has been thus turned into a national disease by compulsory social insurance .
No one any longer denies that traumatic neurosis is a result of social legislation .
Overwhelming statistics show that insured persons take much longer time to recover from their injuries than other persons , and that they are liable to more extensions and permanent functional disturbances than the uninsured .
Insurance against diseases breeds disease .
Individual observation by doctors as well as statistics prove that recovery from illnesses and injuries is much slower in officials and permanent employees and people compulsorily insured than in members of the professions and those not insured .
The desire and the necessity of becoming well again and ready for work as soon as possible assist recuperation to a degree so great as to be capable of demonstration .
To feel healthy is quite different from being healthy in the medical sense , and a man 's ability to work is largely independent of the physiologically ascertainable and measurable performances of his individual organs .
The man who does not want to be healthy is not merely a malingerer .
He is a sick person .
If the will to be well and efficient is weakened , illness and inability to work is caused .
By weakening or completely destroying the will to be well and able to work , social insurance creates illness and inability to work ; it produces the habit of complaining — which is in itself a neurosis — and neuroses of other kinds .
In short , it is an institution which tends to encourage disease , not to say accidents , and to intensify considerably the physical and psychic results of accidents and illnesses .
As a social institution it makes a people sick bodily and mentally or at least helps to multiply , lengthen , and intensify disease .
The psychic forces which are active in every living thing , including man , in the form of a will to health and a desire to work , are not independent of social surroundings .
Certain circumstances strengthen them ; others weaken them .
The social environment of an African tribe living by hunting is decidedly calculated to stimulate these forces .
The same is true of the quite different environment of the citizens of a capitalist society , based on division of labor and on private property .
On the other hand , a social order weakens these forces when it promises that if the individual 's work is hindered by illness or the effects of a trauma , he shall live without work or with little work and suffer no very noticeable reduction in his income .
Matters are not so simple as they appear to the naive pathology of the army or prison doctor .
Social insurance has thus made the neurosis of the insured a dangerous public disease .
Should the institution be extended and developed , the disease will spread .
No reform can be of any assistance .
We cannot weaken or destroy the will to health without producing illness .
The protests and the ridicule may be having an effect .
From The Official Website of the President of Ireland :
President McAleese has decided to convene a meeting of the Council of State , under Article 26 of the Constitution , to be held at Áras an Uachtaráin on Wednesday 22nd July at 6:30 pm , for the purpose of consulting with the Council regarding the Defamation Bill 2006 and the Criminal Justice ( Amendment ) Bill 2009 .
To put this in perspective , this will be only the 27th time a Council of State has been convened since the Constitution of Ireland came into force at the end of 1937 .
The last time was in 2007 .
Paragraph 1.1 of Article 26 of the Constitution states :
The President may , after consultation with the Council of State , refer any Bill to which this Article applies to the Supreme Court for a decision on the question as to whether such Bill or any specified provision or provisions of such Bill is or are repugnant to this Constitution or to any provision thereof .
Ireland may yet be saved from a return to the Dark Ages !
( Tip : Mick Nugent on Twitter )
UPDATE : ( 18 July ) cearta.ie , the blog of Trinity College law lecturer Dr Eoin O’Dell , has an interesting analysis of the prospects .
Basically , it will come down to how much influence the European Convention of Human Rights , which enshrines freedom of expression , has over the Irish Constitution , which says blasphemy should be punished .
Whether the Council decides the bill is unconstitutional , or it is passed and challenged at the first attempt to get a prosecution under it , he concludes
Former President Clinton arrived in North Korea today in a dramatic bid to negotiate the release of two American TV journalists sentenced to 12 years in prison for illegally entering the secretive nation earlier this year .
Clinton , the husband of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , is the highest - profile U.S. official to visit North Korea in nearly a decade .
His surprise visit signals the Obama administration ’s readiness to engage the communist dictatorship , even as Washington presses other nations to curb ties with the country , which recently resumed its nuclear program and tested ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations resolutions .
Laura Ling and Euna Lee of San Francisco - based Current TV were taken into custody in March near the border with China while reporting on refugees fleeing North Korea .
They were sentenced to hard labor for illegal entry and “ hostile acts . ”
Lisa Ling , the sister of reporter Laura Ling , said Monday that the family could not comment on the report .

“ Everything is just so delicate , ” she said .
“ We ’re going to wait it out a while longer .
We ’re on pins and needles . ”
White House and State Department officials declined to comment on the mission , as did a spokeswoman for former Vice President Al Gore , a co-founder of Current TV .
But another U.S. official , who declined to be identified , confirmed the mission .
He said the Clintons were approached by the journalists ’ families when it became clear the North Koreans would permit a visit .
U.S. officials and North Korea watchers have predicted for some time that Pyongyang could be open to a visit from a high - ranking dignitary to discuss the women ’s imprisonment .
With its love of pomp and circumstance , North Korea in the past has used celebrity visits for propaganda , trying to show that the outside world validates its system of government .

Scott Snyder of the nonprofit Asia Foundation said Clinton ’s standing as a world statesman carried weight with Pyongyang .
“ The North Koreans have a lot of nostalgia for the end of the Clinton administration , ” he said .
“ The question is going to be how could he go to Pyongyang without some assurance that they would be released , ” Snyder said .
“ For someone at his level to go without a prior assurance of some kind would be to risk a huge loss of face . ”

The mission is especially delicate because U.S. - North Korean relations have fallen to a low point in recent months as the North has conducted a nuclear test , test - fired a series of missiles and broken off long - running disarmament talks .
U.S. officials have been debating whether to send an envoy .
The mission poses the risk that the North will try to link the release to concessions on the nuclear issue , an effort the U.S. will want to resist , officials say .
Clinton ’s mission represents his first role for the Obama administration and another chapter in the two Clintons ’ long - intertwined public lives .
Although Bill Clinton has not yet traveled with his wife in her official capacity as top U.S. diplomat , aides have not ruled out that the former president , who is involved in a number of international causes , would take part in some activity related to American diplomacy .
The visit comes at a time when the 67 - year - old leader Kim Jong
Il is reported to be gravely ill , having had a stroke last summer and , according to South Korean media reports , possibly suffering from pancreatic cancer .

Ralph Cossa , president of the Pacific Forum CSIS , a Honolulu - based think tank , said Clinton ’s visit will give the United States a rare opportunity to assess not only Kim ’s health , but who is actually making the decisions in North Korea .
“ For me , this is a stroke of genius on the part of the Obama administration , ” said Cossa .
“ Kim Jong
Il will have to meet with a former U.S. president .
Given his ego and desire for attention , this is a photo opportunity he does n’t want to miss .
If he does n’t meet with Clinton , we ’ll know he is on life support . ”
Neither the White House nor the State Department has said whether a meeting with the North Korean leader is planned .
An irony in the choice of Clinton is that Hillary Clinton and North Korean officials have recently engaged in a round of unusual name calling .
She compared the regime to schoolchildren clamoring for attention , while the North Koreans described her as a “ funny lady ” and a pensioner .

But Hillary Clinton has been deeply involved in the case of the two journalists and has been trying to separate it from the larger U.S. - North Korean security dispute .
At a recent town hall meeting at the State Department , Clinton sought to make progress by conveying the women ’s regret for what they had done and asking for amnesty .
“ The two journalists and their families have expressed great remorse for this incident , and I think everyone is very sorry that it happened , ” she said during a question - and - answer session with State Department employees .
“ What we hope for now is that these two young women would be granted amnesty through the North Korean system and be allowed to return home to their families as soon as possible . ”
Yet even as she has been pushing for the women ’s release , Clinton and the administration have been taking a very tough line on North Korea ’s behavior .
Officials have insisted that they are not going to offer the North more incentives to return to the group disarmament talks .

Instead , they say North Korea must follow through on commitments to dismantle existing nuclear facilities and take steps toward eventual disarmament .
U.S. officials have been leading an effort to crack down on the North through tightened scrutiny of its ships and planes for arms that have been banned under a U.N. Security Council resolution .
It is also trying to organize an international effort to cut the North off from the financing it has used to support its weapons trade .
Pyongyang ’s state media organ , the Korean Central News Agency , announced in a terse release that Bill Clinton had arrived in Pyongyang , the capital .
He and an undisclosed entourage “ were greeted by Yang Hyong Sop , vice president of the Presidium of the Supreme People ’s Assembly , and Kim Kye Gwan , vice minister of foreign affairs , ” the release said .

A little girl presented a bouquet to Clinton , it added .
Jang Cheol - hyeon , a researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy and a former official at North Korea ’s Unification Front Department , said Clinton ’s visit was the best chance the U.S. has to win the reporters ’ release .
“ He can surely bring the two journalists back home , ” he said .
Lee Woo-young , a professor at the University of North Korean studies in Seoul , said Clinton ’s sudden visit suggested some behind - the - scenes negotiations had been taking place .

“ It seems that this visit met some part of what North Korea has wanted , ” he said .
“ They wanted U.S. officials on the high - ranking level to come .
This will have a positive effect in improving U.S. - North Korea relations . ”
Beyond the immediate issue of the journalists , Clinton ’s visit is an enormous publicity coup for Pyongyang , which has been seeking U.S. recognition for decades .
Clinton is the most important visitor since his secretary of State , Madeleine Albright , met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in 2000 .
It was thought at the time the meeting might pave the way for regular diplomatic relations and possibly a visit by Clinton , as a sitting president , but relations fell into a deep chill after George W. Bush entered the White House .
Former President Carter met with North Korea ’s founder , Kim Il Sung , shortly before his death in 1994 and struck a handshake deal on nuclear dismantlement .

New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , at the time a congressman , was used as a high - profile delegate in 1996 to secure the release of a U.S. citizen who swam across the Yalu River into North Korea .
But most high - ranking visitors to Pyongyang in recent years have been Chinese officials , though those visits have recently been curtailed because of U.N. sanctions imposed after North Korea ’s May 25 nuclear test .

Unfortunately , nothing worked out quite as it was supposed to - years later , Hedwig is leading her rock band on a tour of the U.S. , telling her life story through a series of concerts at Bilgewater Inn seafood restaurants .
Her tour dates coincide with those of arena - rock star Tommy Gnosis , a wide - eyed boy who once loved Hedwig - but then left with all her songs .
Blue Dog Rep. Jim Cooper says he supports to public option , and claims that our R2 K poll showing his constituents angry with him is bunk because it assumes that he opposes it .
Of course , we never assumed any such thing , and the poll did n't make any assertions to that effect .
So how come all his constituents do n't think he supports the public option ?
Here 's a letter he sent a constituent :
There are already four different bills reported out by House and Senate committees , with one more expected to come from the powerful Senate Finance Committee in the next few weeks .
The main House legislation , H.R. 3200 , the America 's Affordable Health Choices Act , has been amended in different ways by the three House committees of jurisdiction .
I recently wrote an article in the Tennessean saying that I would not vote for H.R. 3200 as currently drafted .
No one knows yet exactly what the bill will look like that the House will vote on , probably in September , but it will probably be another version of H.R. 3200 .
We still have a long way to go in the legislative process because , assuming the House passes legislation , and the Senate does as well , then the differences between those two bills will have to be worked out before final votes in the House and Senate .
As a member of the fiscally conservative group , the Blue Dog Democrats , I have been working to see that health reform legislation is affordable , as the President has requested .
My preferred approach , the Healthy Americans Act , H.R. 1321 , is bipartisan , reduces the deficit , and reduces the cost of health care over time .
Unfortunately , House and Senate leaders have not allowed it to be seriously considered although it seems to meet all the President 's goals .
Although this bill does not contain a " public option , " I can support one as long as it is on a level playing field .
There are many ways to define a public option and Congress should be able to approve one that keeps insurance companies honest without putting them out of business .
You see ?
He does n't support the bill with the public option , but he supports a bill , along with Republicans , that DOES NOT contain a public option .
So OBVIOUSLY he supports a public option , because he says so !
Nevermind what he 's doing behind the scenes .
And he 's going to act outraged that his constituents think he 's selling them out to the insurance companies that fill his coffers ?
Update : Blue Advaark in the comments :
With G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra coming out on Friday , it made me think back to my youth and my favorite G.I.
Joe character , William “ The Refrigerator ” Perry .
Do n’t remember The Fridge ’s run with the Joe’s ?
Check out this 80s - riffic commercial from Perry ’s heyday .
Here are the specs on The Fridge per Yo Joe , the GI Joe collector ’s club .
Physical Training Instructor Code Name : The Fridge Figure Description : The Fridge – William “ Refridgerator ” Perry – was first available as a mail - order offer from Hasbro Direct in late 1986 .
He was available through 1987 , and then again in 1989 .
Versions of Fridge :
This was the only version of the Fridge ever released .
Accessories : Fridge came with a black football attached to a chain .
Variations :
There are two versions of the Fridge ’s belt – one version is silver , the other is brown .
There are also two versions of the red , white , and blue paint patterns on the Fridge ’s wristbands .
There are two versions of Fridge ’s filecard .
The early ones that came from Hasbro Direct have a dull , cardboard backing – later ones that came from Hasbro Direct has a glossy red backing .
Body Construction : Fridge ’s body is completely original – all new body parts .
None of his parts were ever used in other figures .
I ’m as big a Fridge fan as there is , but let ’s compare the action figure to the legendary Bears folk hero .
Something missing in that action figure ?
They ’re being a little generous with the physique , do n’t ya think ?
I need to get Hasbro to make an action figure of me !
But while they were at it , they could n’t fill the gap between Perry ’s teeth ?
I have n’t seen a gap like that since Strahan retired !
And what ’s with the football on a chain weapon ?
What the heck is that supposed to do ?
All kidding aside , Perry has been battling a rare disease called Guillain - Barre syndrome , where the body ’s immune system attacks its peripheral nerves .
He ’s been recovering slowly in South Carolina with brother Michael Dean overseeing his care .
Wish you a speedy recovery , Fridge !

You should n't have to wipe if coming from a JF ADP - based ROM , otherwise , probably .
If weird things are happening , try wiping .
You can also try the permission fixer script linked above .
If you are coming from an HTC - based ROM like Hero or Sapphire , you are going to have to wipe .
2 . Will you include the HTC Dialer / HTC Mail ?
No , because I wo n't be shipping the full HTC - modified Android core ( it 's not open source ) , which these apps depend on .
I do include the " Work Email " application which is the HTC Exchange client .
3 . Will this work on the Magic ?
It will work on Dream ( G1 ) or Magic 32B ( myTouch ) .
I plan to support 32A devices soon .
4 . How do I set up apps - to - sd ?
You need to create a second partition on your SD card in the ext2 / ext3 / ext4 format .
Search the forums if you do n't know how to do this .
Once created , the ROM will move your apps automatically and new apps will be installed to the SD by default .
5 . How do I install MyFaves ?
Look here : http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=542267
6 . Will you include feature X , Y , or Z ?
Maybe , ask me about it .
7 . How do I convert to Ext3 ?
Reboot into recovery ( home + power ) , drop to a console ( Alt+x ) , and enter : " upgrade_fs " .
Reboot and you will be at ext3 .
This requires my recovery image listed above .
8. Can I use Ext4 ?
Yes , the kernel supports it ( with delayed allocation fixes ) and the required tools are there .
You 'll need to do the conversion manually , though .
9 . How do I enable the HTC_IME ?
Go into settings -> Locale & text and disable " Android Keyboard " and enable " Touch Input " .
10 . Can I tether with this ?
Yes .
I recommend using Wifi Tether for Root Users
11 . I want to switch back to ext2 .
Reboot into recovery ( my recovery image ) , drop to a console ( Alt+X ) .
Remove the journal with " tune2fs - O ^has_journal / dev/ block / mmcblk0p2 " .
You should then fsck with " e2fsck /dev/block/mmcblk0p2 " .
12 . Will you include feature XXX from Hero ?
No .
Most of the HTC apps in Hero require the heavily modified closed - source Android core which I wo n't be including .
13 .
My / system / sd is read only and / or did n't upgrade to ext3 !
Your filesystem is probably corrupt .
Boot into Recovery 1.2 + and run a filesystem check from the menu .
If it tells you to run it manually , drop to a console ( alt+x ) and run " e2fsck /dev/block/mmcblk0p2 " .
14 . Is ext3 / ext4 safe for my SD card ?
Probably , unless your card is very old and does not support wear leveling .
Use Google and decide for yourself .
15 . I have problems with force closes of paid apps and have to reinstall my them after a no-wipe upgrade !
Run the " permission fixer " script .
It is included in this build as well as Recovery 1.2+ .
Just execute " fix_permissions " from a terminal or the recovery console and reboot .
16 . Can I use your work in my own ROM ?
Of course , I am all about sharing !
Just give credit where credit is due .
17 .
It 's taking forever to boot !
The first boot will take longer than normal because dexopt needs to run .
If you are nervous , connect USB and run " adb logcat " to watch the progress .
18 . My phone rebooted by itself !
Possible kernel panic or oops .
Please get me the output of " cat / proc / last_msg " when you reboot so it can be debugged .
19 .
My camera is black and white only !
You have settings left over from the old Android camera .
Just go into the Camera , hit menu , settings , then " reset to defaults " .
20 .
My auto - rotate / accelerometer is n't working !
Not really the fault of the ROM , but here 's how to fix it :
Go into recovery , drop to console , " mount / data " , then " rm /data/misc/akmd * /data/misc /rild * " and reboot .
21 . What about swap space ?
As of 4.0 , Compcache is activated by default unless a userinit.sh script is present .
Search the forums for information on how to create a userinit.sh to activate swap .
22 . Will you include the Flash Player from Hero ?
No , because it 's tightly coupled to the Hero Browser , which is tightly coupled to the Hero Framework .
It 's not easily portable at this point .
Run
Hero if you want it .
Otherwise , we will have to wait for something more compatible .
Not every minister would have been quite so cavalier about being handed control of the levers of Downing Street power .
Most would have relished every minute of their chance to run the country while Gordon Brown was out of town .
But Lord Mandelson appears happy to combine work and pleasure by standing in for the Prime Minister from his Corfu poolside .
The all - powerful First Secretary of State has taken over responsibility for the day - to - day operation of the Whitehall machine from Labour 's deputy leader , Harriet Harman , who began her holiday yesterday .
But he will not let the small matter of deputising for Mr Brown prevent him from enjoying the 30C temperatures on the Greek holiday island for the next two days .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The result is that the heart of the British government has temporarily shifted this weekend 1,200 miles out of London to a villa with spectacular views of the Ionian Sea .
Lord Mandelson will not return to Britain until Monday .
Aides will keep the sun-loving peer in touch with urgent developments via his BlackBerry and mobile phone – assuming he is not enjoying a dip in the water or an afternoon siesta .
They insisted there would be no need to organise an emergency flight home if a major crisis broke this weekend because Gordon Brown , who is on holiday a mere 420 miles away in his Fife constituency home , would step in .
But officials drew up a rota of Cabinet ministers to take charge throughout August to enable their workaholic boss to take a break .
The fact that Lord Mandelson , who was not even in the government last summer , has taken over while still in Corfu will be seen by admirers and detractors alike as fresh evidence of the huge influence he wields over the Brown administration .
His selection of holiday destination had already raised eyebrows , as his visit to the island last year provoked a political storm over the hospitality that he – and the shadow Chancellor George Osborne – received on board the yacht of the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska .
While Mr Osborne is steering clear of the island this year , Lord Mandelson flew out to Corfu last Monday .
One fellow passenger reported that he was engrossed with his BlackBerry until the moment of take - off .
He will be staying once again at the luxury villa owned by the Rothschild banking dynasty .

Last year his old friend Nat Rothschild became embroiled in the " yachtgate " controversy after arranging for him and Mr Osborne to meet Mr Deripaska .
Ms Harman " signed off " from duty on Thursday afternoon .
She has flown off for a family holiday in Italy after a controversial 10 - day spell in which she blamed the male dominance of banking for the global financial crisis and warned that men " cannot be left to run things on their own " .
Government sources confirmed that the baton had passed to Lord Mandelson yesterday morning , when he still had three days of his Corfu holiday to run .
His assumption of control appeared to run contrary to a warning last month from Mr Brown to ministers that they could not be " on call " with their families at home .
A Downing Street memo to Whitehall departments last month stressed : " The Prime Minister wants business to be fronted by ministers and expects duty ministers to be on duty in London or on departmental visits at all times . "
In fact it appears that the most senior minister currently on duty in the capital is Tessa Jowell , the Cabinet Office Minister .
Last night a Downing Street source said Lord Mandelson 's presence in Corfu would not affect the smooth operation of government .
Plans are being drawn up for a series of events next week to highlight government initiatives to boost industry .
The source said : " Gordon remains in charge .
This week Harriet has been around in London to help with the heavy lifting .
Peter will be around to help next week .
People are on call on BlackBerries and mobiles – Peter can do that from Corfu ; Gordon can do that from Scotland .
" The wonders of modern technology , " he added , " are such that it does n't make a difference where you are .
It 's not like there has to be someone sitting in London all the time .
We have never had any trouble getting hold of Peter . "
He pointed out that Jack Straw , the Secretary of State for Justice , had taken the decision to free Ronnie Biggs from prison although he was away on holiday .
Mr Straw and Alistair Darling , the Chancellor , will also have a week each " minding the shop " during the Prime Minister 's holiday .
I have been sitting quietly on the sidelines watching all of this national debate on healthcare .
It is time for me to bring some clarity to the table by explaining many of the problems from the perspective of a doctor .
First off , the government has involved very few of us physicians in the healthcare debate .
While the American Medical Association has come out in favor of the plan , it is vital to remember that the AMA only represents 17 % of the American physician workforce .
I have taken care of Medicaid patients for 35 years while representing the only pediatric ophthalmology group left in Atlanta , Georgia that accepts Medicaid .
For example , in the past 6 months I have cared for three young children on Medicaid who had corneal ulcers .
This is a potentially blinding situation because if the cornea perforates from the infection , almost surely blindness will occur .
In all three cases the antibiotic needed for the eradication of the infection was not on the approved Medicaid list .
Each time I was told to fax Medicaid for the approval forms , which I did .
Within 48 hours the form came back to me which was sent in immediately via fax , and I was told that I would have my answer in 10 days .
Of course by then each child would have been blind in the eye .
Each time the request came back denied .
All three times I personally provided the antibiotic for each patient which was not on the Medicaid approved list .
Get the point -- rationing of care .
Over the past 35 years I have cared for over 1000 children born with congenital cataracts .
In older children and in adults the vision is rehabilitated with an intraocular lens .
In newborns we use contact lenses which are very expensive .
It takes Medicaid over one year to approve a contact lens post cataract surgery .
By that time a successful anatomical operation is wasted as the child will be close to blind from a lack of focusing for so long a period of time .
Again , extreme rationing .
Solution : I have a foundation here in Atlanta supported 100 % by private funds which supplies all of these contact lenses for my Medicaid and illegal immigrants children for free .
Again , waiting for the government would be disastrous .
Last week I had a lady bring her child to me .
They are Americans but live in Sweden , as the father has a job with a big corporation .
The child had the onset of double vision 3 months ago and has been unable to function normally because of this .
They are people of means but are waiting 8 months to see the ophthalmologist in Sweden .
Then if the child needed surgery they would be put on a 6 month waiting list .
She called me and I saw her that day .
It turned out that the child had accommodative esotropia ( crossing of the eyes treated with glasses that correct for farsightedness ) and responded to glasses within 4 days , so no surgery was needed .
Again , rationing of care .
Last month I operated on a 70 year old lady with double vision present for 3 years .
She responded quite nicely to her surgery and now is symptom free .
I also operated on a 69 year old judge with vertical double vision .
His surgery went very well and now he is happy as a lark .
I have been told -- but of course there is no healthcare bill that has been passed yet -- that these 2 people because of their age would have been denied surgery and just told to wear a patch over one eye to alleviate the symptoms of double vision .
Obviously cheaper than surgery .
I spent two year in the US Navy during the Viet Nam war and was well treated by the military .
There was tremendous rationing of care and we were told specifically what things the military personnel and their dependents could have and which things they could not have .
While I was in Viet Nam , my wife Nancy got sick and got essentially no care at the Naval Hospital in Oakland , California .
She went home and went to her family 's private internist in Beverly Hills .
While it was expensive , she received an immediate work up .
Again rationing of care .
For those of you who are over 65 , this bill in its present form might be lethal for you .
People in Britain face rationing of care in that there is an eight month wait for cataract surgery , 11 for hernia and the same for disc and total hip The government wants to mimic the British plan .
For those of you younger , it will still mean restriction of the care that you and your children receive .
While 99 % of physicians went into medicine because of the love of medicine and the challenge of helping our fellow man , economics are still important .
My rent goes up 2 % each year and the salaries of my employees go up 2 % each year .
Twenty years ago , ophthalmologists were paid $ 1800 for a cataract surgery and today $ 500 .
This is a 73 % decrease in our fees .
I do not know of many jobs in America that have seen this sort of lowering of fees .
But there is more to the story than just the lower fees .
When I came to Atlanta , there was a well known ophthalmologist that charged $ 2500 for a cataract surgery as he felt the was the best .
He had a terrific reputation and in fact I had my mother 's bilateral cataracts operated on by him with a wonderful result .
She is now 94 and has 20 / 20 vision in both eyes .
People would pay his $ 2500 fee .
However , then the government came in and said that any doctor that does Medicare work cannot accept more than the going rate ( now $ 500 ) or he or she would be severely fined .
This put an end to his charging $ 2500 .
The government said it was illegal to accept more than the government - allowed rate .
What I am driving at is that those of you well off will not be able to go to the head of the line under this new healthcare plan , just because you have money , as no physician will be willing to go against the law to treat you .
I am a pediatric ophthalmologist and trained for 10 years post - college to become a pediatric ophthalmologist ( add two years of my service in the Navy and that comes to 12 years ) .
A neurosurgeon spends 14 years post - college , and if he or she has to do the military that would be 16 years .
I am not entitled to make what a neurosurgeon makes , but the new plan calls for all physicians to make the same amount of payment .
I assure you that medical students will not go into neurosurgery and we will have a tremendous shortage of neurosurgeons .
Already , the top neurosurgeon at my hospital who is in good health and only 52 years old has just quit because he can't stand working with the government anymore .
Forty - nine percent of children under the age of 16 in the state of Georgia are on Medicaid , so he felt he just could not stand working with the bureaucracy anymore .
We are being lied to about the uninsured .
They are getting care .
I operate at least 2 illegal immigrants each month who pay me nothing , and the children 's hospital at which I operate charges them nothing also .
This is true not only on Atlanta , but of every community in America .
The bottom line is that I urge all of you to contact your congresswomen and congressmen and senators to defeat this bill .
I promise you that you will not like rationing of your own health .
Furthermore , how can you trust a physician that works under these conditions knowing that he is controlled by the state .
I certainly could not trust any doctor that would work under these draconian conditions .
One last thing : with this new healthcare plan there will be a tremendous shortage of physicians .
It has been estimated that approximately 5 % of the current physician work force will quit under this new system .
Also it is estimated that another 5 % shortage will occur because of the decreased number of men and women wanting to go into medicine .
At the present time the US government has mandated gender equity in admissions to medical schools .
That means that for the past 15 years that somewhere between 49 and 51 % of each entering class are females .
This is true of private schools also , because all private schools receive federal funding .
UPDATED at 11:22 p.m.
AKRON — The Akron Petland store was shut down Wednesday by the chain 's corporate office after a photograph was posted on Facebook that showed an employee holding dead rabbits .
Under the photo , Liz Carlisle , 20 , of Ravenna , boasts to her friends that she drowned the rabbits because they were injured .
She said in the entry that the store 's manager took the photograph .
Carlisle is charged with two counts of cruelty to animals pressed by the Humane Society of Greater Akron .
She is to appear on Aug. 17 in Akron Municipal Court .
Petland officials said they terminated the owner 's franchise agreement because of the " horrific mistreatment of rabbits at the Petland store in Akron . "
" Petland will in no way , shape or form tolerate any abuse of animals in its care , " company officials said in a news release .
" We are outraged of this gross violation of Petland 's animal care standards . "
Investigators said Carlisle posted the photograph on her Facebook page on July 28 , and in the post she tells her friends she had to drown the rabbits because they injured each other while fighting .
Petland officials said company policy bars employees from euthanizing any animal .
The animals in the Akron store were moved to another Petland .
Carlisle 's father , Joe Carlisle , described his daughter as a well - behaved , respectful young woman who has done well in school and is working to pay her way through college .
" She is a good , good person who is innocent totally as a human being of any and all wrongdoing , " he said .
" She is being unfairly maligned . "
When the Oracle of Omaha speaks , people listen .
What is Warren Buffett saying now ?
What does he see on our economic landscape ?
How do we prepare ?
We can let Warren be our guide , but let ’s make sure we question him aggressively as we manage our own finances .
ABC News reports , Warren Buffett Backs Second Stimulus :
Buffett cautioned that a second stimulus package , like the first , wo n’t be “ a panacea , ” because stimulus packages take time to work .
He criticized lawmakers ’ work on the first stimulus package , which contained $ 787 billion in spending .
“ Our first stimulus bill … was sort of like taking half a tablet of Viagra and having also a bunch of candy mixed in … as if everybody was putting in enough for their own constituents , ” he said .
“ It does n’t have really quite the wall that might have been anticipated there . ”
Not for nothing , but where was Warren at the time the initial bill was rammed through Congress ?
Warren is a close economic adviser of Obama ’s but he does us no favor by playing his political cards when our country is screaming for real economic leadership .
In regard to the PPIP ?
What does Warren think about this government program to help banks cleanse their books of toxic assets ?
Buffett also criticized the government ’s public - private investment plan , through which private investors are supposed to buy so - called toxic assets off the balance sheets of ailing banks that received billions in government aid .
“ I do not like the idea of any kind of a plan involving the government where Wall Street makes a lot of money .
My plan provided that they would make no money whatsoever , and the American public would make the money .
I just think that Wall Street owes the American people one at this point , ” he said .
( emphasis added )
How about the economy ?
What does the Oracle see in his crystal ball ?
The grand swami believes that :
. . . despite the talk of recent economic “ green shoots , ” he could n’t predict when the flagging economy would bounce back .
“ We are not in a freefall , but we are not in a recovery either , ” Buffett said .
“ We were in a freefall really in the last quarter of last year , starting in the financial markets and spreading to the economy , and we had this huge change in behavior .
That change has n’t changed . ”
I concur .
Warren is not totally clear , but in so many words he is saying the American economy is adjusting to the lack of a shadow banking system .
How about over the long haul ?
Does Warren think America will rebound ?
He is very optimistic , as ABC reports :
“ I want to emphasize , we are going to come out of this better than ever , ” he said .
“ I mean the best days of America , by far , lie ahead .
But not next week or next month and then , I do n’t know exactly when we will come out , but we will come out big time . ”
That ’s great .
I am also eternally optimistic .
That said , things do not just happen and we will not have better days without reinstilling strong discipline and values throughout our economy and our country .
In my opinion , those disciplines and values need to encompass the following :
1. honesty on where we currently stand across all aspects of our economy and society .
Publicize our successes and , more importantly , our failures so we can properly address them .
Do not allow urban education dropout rates of 50 % to be swept under the rug .
Promote the correlation between those figures , single parent birth rates , income levels , and criminal behaviors .
BE HONEST ON THESE TOPICS !!!
2. Expose the lack of integrity and transparency in our financial and political institutions .
Hold people accountable !!
That is a good start .
Warren has the bully pulpit .
Perhaps he could speak aggressively on these topics in the future .

MSNBC just aired video of a man with a pistol strapped to his leg waiting for Barack Obama to arrive at a townhall in New Hampshire .
The man is carrying a sign that says , " It Is Time to Water the Tree of Liberty . "
That 's a reference to a Thomas Jefferson quote : " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time , with the blood of patriots and tyrants . "
It was a favorite slogan of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , who was wearing a T - shirt when he was arrested with a picture of Lincoln on the front and a tree dripping with blood on the back .
Now , this guy is carrying a legal weapon , says NBC News ' Ron Allen .
The local chief of police has no objections .
Open carriage of licensed handguns is legal in New Hampshire , and the man is standing on the private property of a nearby church (! ) that has no problem with an armed man hanging around .
But let 's be clear : anyone watching the mounting rage over , of all things , health care — perhaps one of the most boring and complex policy subjects — has to worry that these people are going to try to kill Barack Obama .
That 's not an extrapolation from unhinged rhetoric , or a partisan reading of the imagined intentions of our political enemies .
It 's a rational reading of the anticipated behavior of a man who brandishes a gun at the location where the president is expected to imminently arrive while holding a sign that openly advocates his assassination .
And the astonishing , breathtaking , maddening fact that he has n't been violently taken to the ground by large men wearing suits and earpieces is an open encouragement to anyone else so inclined to give it a shot .
There are always people who want to kill the president .
Generally speaking , they are politically marginalized , insane , and / or too incompetent to come close to achieving their ends .
But in the past six months , people who would be inclined to do violence to our political leaders have been affirmatively embraced by the Republican Party and its messaging operation .
It 's as if there had been a 24 - hour cable news channel in 1981 devoted to coverage of Jodie Foster , and what it would take for someone to get her attention .
Here 's what you get when you have a partisan political establishment that openly trades in themes of violence , xenophobia , paranoia , illegitimacy , and revolution :
And here is a town hall this morning where Sen.
Arlen Specter ( R... I mean D - Pa. ) faced a man threatening judgment from God :
Did extremists on the left adopt the same tone against Bush ?
Yes .
And there is an element in this wingnuttery of the same sort of dispossessed rage and periodic venting that many liberals felt under the last administration .
But it 's different when that rage is being purposefully manipulated to ( imagined ) political advantage by the GOP .
And it 's different when there 's actually a guy with a gun waiting for the president to show up .

Just as distinctly Korean may be the lengths to which some go to hide their newly humble status .
Mr. Lee says he carefully avoids the topic of work in phone conversations with friends and his parents , and dodges invitations to meet by claiming he is too busy .
He gave his name with great reluctance , and only after being assured the article would not appear in Korean .
Another former white - collar worker who now works on a crab boat in the same village said he could not tell family and friends , and told his wife only via e-mail after arriving here .
Yet another tells his parents that he is in Japan .
In a competitive , status - conscious society , these and other workers say they feel intense shame doing manual work .
Some also say they feel guilty working such rough jobs after years of expensive cram schools and college .
And many younger workers , having grown up in an increasingly affluent nation , consider physical labor a part of the bygone , impoverished eras of their parents and grandparents .
“ These days , many South Koreans think they have the right to be white collar , ” said Lee Byung - hee , senior economist at the Korea Labor Institute , a government - linked research organization based in Seoul .
“ But their expectations hit the dark reality of this economy , where people have no choice but to go into the blue - collar work force . ”
Labor experts say the number of former office workers who are moving into blue - collar jobs has increased as South Korea has suffered its worst unemployment since the 1997 Asian currency crisis .
According to the National Statistical Office , the unemployment rate has risen to 3.8 percent  low by American standards , but high for this Asian economic powerhouse .
( CNN ) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is trying to reform American health care , and it may be weakening the pulse of his presidency .
President Obama takes on critics of health care legislation in remarks Tuesday at the White House .
" We always knew that passing health care reform would n't be easy , " he said this week .
" We always knew that doing what was right would be hard . "
In fact , after six months in office during which he 's benefited from widespread support on issues ranging from Iraq to the economy , nothing has seemed harder .
What should Obama do about U.S. health care ?
Can he learn anything from other nations ?
Tell us .
Right now , the U.S. spends more on its health than any other industrial county but still leaves nearly 50 million of its people without routine care .
Obama wants lawmakers to find a way to provide health insurance to all Americans while holding down prices .
Several Congressional committees have been struggling to come up with new plans and the early results have been complicated , controversial and costly .
The process is starting to take its toll in public opinion .
Obama is still popular .
An ABC News - Washington
Post poll found that 59 percent of Americans approve of how he 's doing his job .
But on health care , he 's slipped below 50 percent for the first time , with just 49 percent approving of his efforts on the issue .
Hoping to fight that loss of momentum , he 's scheduled daily television appearances to campaign for quick work from Congress , and his political organization is running ads on TV too .
He 's keeping his distance from most details of the debate , but putting all of his personal popularity to work to get a plan with enough public support to be enacted .
" Presidents do n't work this hard when thing 's are going well , " said CNN 's Candy Crowley .
" They work this hard when something 's in jeopardy . "
The president 's opponents in the Republican Party sense an opportunity that extends far beyond the healthcare debate .
" If we 're able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo , " said Republican Senator Jim Demint .
" It will break him . "
Obama does n't seem like he 's about to be " broken , " but ironically , on health care he looks like he could be ailing .

Embassies do not help holidaymakers search for lost sunglasses British embassies around the world are getting " frustrated " by travellers wanting weather reports and advice on how to deal with unruly children .
Consular staff have also been asked to help make jam , pack suitcases and find lost sunglasses .
A woman unhappy with the size of her newly - enlarged breasts and a man in search of shoes also sought help .
The Foreign Office says British embassies are there " to help Britons in real difficulty abroad " .
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) is highlighting some of the less serious requests to clarify the role of its 261 embassies , high commissions and other diplomatic posts .
Other inquiries include : A mother asked the consulate in Florida to help her teenage son pack his case and give him a lift to the airport as he was feeling under the weather .
A traveller wanted the high commission in Zambia to phone his workplace to explain he would not be in because he was unable to get a flight .
A holidaymaker visiting Italy wondered where they could purchase a particular pair of shoes .
One caller asked : " I 'm making jam - what ratio of fruit to sugar shall I use ? " .
Juliet Maric , British consul in Alicante , Spain , said people thought they were a " one- stop shop " and it could be " frustrating " .
EMBASSY WORK Embassies do : Issue replacement passports
Help transfer money Support victims of crime
Embassies do not :
Make travel arrangements
Hand out money Get Britons out of prison " If you have a serious problem abroad - maybe you 've been involved in an accident , have lost your passport or are a victim of crime , we can help you , " she said .
" But we can't tell you who is allowed to use your swimming pool , pay your taxi fares for you or do anything about the exchange rate . "
Minister for consular affairs , Chris Bryant , said : " Consular staff are there to help Britons in real difficulty abroad - from victims of crime and bereaved families to those involved in accidents or who have lost their passports .
" It 's important that British nationals understand what the FCO can and can't do for them so our staff can focus resources on more serious situations where people really do need our help . "
FCO staff handle 2.1 million consular inquiries a year and in 2008/ 9 , assistance was provided to almost 35,000 British nationals .
Almost 11,000 emergency passports were issued to Britons overseas last year .

Earlier this year , the unpopular president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , introduced a referendum as a first step toward drafting a new constitution .
Opposition to the referendum was strong , with the Honduran Congress , Supreme Court and military all declaring it illegal .
Zelaya fired the head of the military for not providing support for the referendum - but was thwarted by the Supreme Court , who deemed the firing illegal , and reinstated General Romeo Velasquez to his post .
On Sunday , June 28th , the Honduran Army , under orders from the Supreme Court , stormed the presidential residence , arrested president Zelaya and put him on a plane to Costa Rica , then took possession of the residence .
The head of Congress , Roberto Micheletti , then assumed the role of Interim President of Honduras .
Internally split , Hondurans have taken to the streets both in support of Zelaya and in opposition to his return .
International reactions have been unanimously negative , the action condemned as a coup by the UN , the Organization of American States , the U.S. and every other country in Latin America .
Efforts are underway now to resolve the issue , with great international pressure on Honduras .

Update : Programmer Out on Bail
Via : Reuters :
A former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc computer programer accused of stealing secret trading codes from the financial firm has been released from federal custody after posting bail , authorities said on Monday .
Sergey Aleynikov , 39 , was arrested by the FBI on Friday and charged with “ theft of trade secrets . ”
He met the terms of his $ 750,000 bail and was released Monday , said FBI spokesman James Margolin .
Aleynikov is accused of misusing computer codes that belong to his former employer , a New York - based financial institution that authorities did not identify in court papers but sources say is Goldman Sachs .
A transcript of Aleynikov ’s appearance before U.S. Magistrate Kevin Nathaniel Fox in Manhattan on Saturday also shows that Aleynikov worked for Goldman .
His lawyer , Sabrina Shroff , said at that proceeding that Aleynikov told authorities after his arrest that he did not intend to sell the information or use it “ contrary to my employment agreement with Goldman Sachs . ”
Goldman has not seen its business or clients harmed by the purported computer breach , a source familiar with the situation said on Monday .
The firm declined to comment .
The case could shed light on the workings of intricate trading systems developed by Goldman .
It also raises questions about the security of lucrative Wall Street proprietary trading operations .
However , the New York Stock Exchange said on Monday there was no connection between the alleged security breach and an error that dropped Goldman from a trading report the NYSE issued last week .
Aleynikov , a Russian immigrant living in New Jersey , was arrested on Friday night as he got off a flight at Newark Liberty International Airport , according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case .
Aleynikov had been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn .
Terms of his bail required a $ 750,000 personal recognizance bond to be secured by three financially responsible people .
His bail also included $ 75,000 in cash , and Aleynikov was ordered to surrender his travel documents and not to access the computer data at issue in the case .
A preliminary hearing was scheduled for August 3 .
A “ For Sale ” sign stood on the lawn of Aleynikov ’s home on Monday night in Little Falls , New Jersey .
The vacated two - story Colonial - style home , whose open mailbox had letters peeking out , was listed as “ priced to sell ” in an online advertisement by an area real estate agency .
Authorities contend Aleynikov stole codes used for sophisticated automated stock and commodities trading .
They say Aleynikov , who earned $ 400,000 a year at Goldman , improperly copied proprietary computer code and then uploaded it to a computer server in Germany .
After he was arrested , he told authorities he had only intended to collect “ open source ” files on which he had worked but “ later realized that he had obtained more files than he intended , ” the FBI agent said in the court papers .
The FBI said Aleynikov worked at the financial institution from May 2007 until June 5 , when he left to work for a new company focused on high - volume automated trading .
Aleynikov ’s wife , Elina , told Reuters on Sunday that her husband is innocent .
She said in a phone interview from the couple ’s New Jersey home that her husband worked hard for Goldman and has been a good citizen who has lived in the United States for 19 years .

Do n’t miss the following Zero Hedge piece for more : Is A Case Of Quant Trading Sabotage About To Destroy Goldman Sachs ?
In the 5 days immediately preceeding his departure from “ Financial Institution ” ( potentially GS ) , Sergey allegedly downloaded 32 megs of ultra top - secret quant trading proprietary code , that , according to Special Agent McSwain ’s affidavit , he then proceeded to encrypt and upload to a website in Germany , with a UK owner .
One can only imagine the value of this “ code ” not only to Goldman but to the highest bidder .
After all , from the affidavit : “ certain features of the [ code ] , such as speed and efficiency by which it obtains and processes market data , gives the Financial Institution a competitive advantage among other firms that also engage in high - volume automated trading .
The Financial Institution further believes that , if competing firms were to obtain the [ code ] and use its features , the Financial Institution ’s ability to profit from the [ code ] ’s speed and efficiency would be significantly diminished . ”
Needless to say , many others are now also likely hot on the trail of the code .

Did someone try to steal Goldman Sachs ’ secret sauce ?
While most in the US were celebrating the 4th of July , a Russian immigrant living in New Jersey was being held on federal charges of stealing top - secret computer trading codes from a major New York - based financial institution — that sources say is none other than Goldman Sachs .
The allegations , if true , are big news because the codes the accused man , Sergey Aleynikov , tried to steal is the secret code to unlocking Goldman ’s automated stocks and commodities trading businesses .
Federal authorities allege the computer codes and related - trading files that Aleynikov uploaded to a German - based website help this major “ financial institution ” generate millions of dollars in profits each year .
The platform is one of the things that apparently gives Goldman a leg - up over the competition when it comes to rapid - fire trading of stocks and commodities .
Federal authorities say the platform quickly processes rapid developments in the markets and uses top secret mathematical formulas to allow the firm to make highly - profitable automated trades .
The criminal case has the potential to shed a light on the inner workings of an important profit center for Goldman and other Wall Street firms .
The federal charges also raise serious questions about the safeguards Wall Street firms deploy to protect their proprietary trading systems .
The criminal case began to unfold on the evening of July 3 when Aleynikov was arrested by FBI agents at Newark Liberty Airport , after returning from Chicago .
Aleynikov had just started a job with another firm in Chicago , after leaving the big firm in NY in early June .
It appears the financial institution allegedly victimized by Aleynikov had alerted federal authorities that its former employee might be up to no good .
On July 4 , Aleynikov was processed on a “ theft of trade secrets ” charge in a criminal complaint that was filed in federal court in Manhattan .
As of this afternoon , he was still being held in federal custody pending posting of bail .
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on the incident .
A spokeswoman for the US Attorney in the Southern District of New York did n’t comment .
Authorities reportedly took all the computers from Aleynikov ’s home in New Jersey .
Sabrina Shroff , Aleynikov ’s lawyer , says the facts will bear out that her client is innocent .
She ’s hoping he will be released from custody soon .
His wife , Elina , says her husband is innocent .
Speaking in a phone interview from the couple ’s New Jersey home , she says her husband worked hard for Goldman Sachs and has been a good citizen–noting he ’s lived in the US for 19 years .
She seems mystified that federal authorities would arrest him on the eve of a holiday .
The Federal Bureau of Investigations , in charging Aleynikov , says he began working for the major financial institution in May 2007 as a computer programmer and left in early June .
That would appear to match the description of a man named Serge Aleynikov , as it is listed on the social networking website LinkedIn .
The bio information for Aleynikov on Linked In says he joined Goldman in May 2007 and was vice president for equity strategy .
The bio says he was responsible for “ development of a distributed real - time co-located high - frequency trading platform . ”
In his own words , he goes on to describe the platform as “ a very low latency ( microseconds ) event - driven market data processing , strategy and order submission engine . ”
The case against Aleynikov may explain why the New York Stock Exchange moved quickly in the past week to alter its methodology for reporting program stock trading .
Goldman often was at the top of the chart–far ahead of its competitors .
On the week ending June 19 , Goldman , for instance , was ranked first on the NYSE program trading list .
But on the week of June 22 , Goldman mysteriously did n’t appear on the list of the top 15 firms at all .
It simply vanished without any explanation .
Then the NYSE announced it would change some of the data for calculating the trading report .
The Zerohedge blog was all over this controversy a week ago .
And now Tyler Durden of ZeroHedge has come in with his own excellent analysis of this strange , strange criminal case .
I highly recommend reading it .
It ’s possible Goldman asked the NYSE to alter some of its reporting methodology after the firm discovered that someone may have infiltrated the proprietary computer codes it uses .
Here ’s the way the criminal complaint describes the Goldman trading platform :
The Financial Institution has devoted substantial resources to developing and maintaining a computer platform that allows the Financial Institution to engage in sophisticated high - speed , and high - volume trades on various stock and commodities markets .
Among other things , the platform is capable of quickly obtaining and processing information regarding rapid developments in these markets .
Meanwhile , federal authorities appear to believe Aleynikov , who has lived in the US for more than a dozen years but frequently travels back - and - forth to his native Russia , may have had help .
The German website that Aleynikov allegedly uploaded the stolen information to is registered to a person in London .
That , of course , gives rise to speculation about this all being a case of international espionage .
This case is quickly unfolding and there ’s plenty more information to unearth about Aleynikov .
For instance , it appears that he and his wife are competitive ballroom dancers–there are some videos of them on youtube.com .
The job he took in Chicago , according to the criminal complaint , paid nearly three times more than his $ 400,000 salary at Goldman .
Which Chicago firm hired Aleynikov ?
Inquiring minds want to know .
But you can rule out the giant hedge fund conglomerate Citadel .
It ’s not them .
Also there ’s more to learn about anyone who might have been helping him and the fallout this may have for Goldman .
When he was arrested , Aleynikov told the FBI he “ only intended to collect ‘ open source ’ files on which he had worked , but later realized that he had obtained more files than he intended . ”
But authorities say after he uploaded the files he encrypted them and “ erased ” the program he used to encrypt them .
It ’s not clear why the authorities and apparently Goldman waited so long to move on Aleynikov , even though they knew he had uploaded the information weeks ago .
One question investors need to ask is whether this incident will have any impact on Goldman ’s second - quarter earnings .
The alleged wrongoing by Aleynikov took place at the beginning of the month–although it ’s not clear if it had any material impact on automated trading .
Update : The NYSE has not stopped reported program trading results .
Instead , it ’s altered the method it uses for putting together that report .

At least 600 children have excessive amounts of lead in their blood Hundreds of Chinese villagers have broken into a factory that poisoned more than 600 children , reports say .
Villagers tore down fencing and smashed coal trucks at the lead smelting factory in Shaanxi Province .
Local authorities have admitted that the plant is responsible for poisoning the children .
More than 150 were in hospital .
Air , soil and water pollution is common in China , which has seen rapid economic growth over the past few decades .
Toxic metal
The villagers broke into the Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Company , near the city of Baoji in western Shaanxi on Monday , according to the state - run Xinhua news agency .
About 100 police officers were sent to the plant to restore order .
The villagers are angry because medical tests revealed that at least 600 children under 14 from two villages near the plant have excessive amounts of lead in their blood .
About a quarter of them were taken to hospital for treatment .
Environmental officials from Baoji city government admitted on Sunday that the plant was " mainly to blame " for the children 's lead poisoning , according to Xinhua .
Checks found that water , soil and waste from the factory - a major local employer - all met national environmental standards .
But the lead content in the air around the factory was more than six times the level found a few hundred metres away .
The smelting plant has now been closed down .
Local officials had promised to relocate all residents living within a 500 m ( 550 yard ) radius of the factory within three years of its opening , but that plan stalled .
Xinhua said only 156 families had been moved ; three times that number are still waiting .
Villages are also worried that the new homes are still not far enough away from the plant to prevent their children from getting sick .
Lead is a toxic metal that can get into the air and water supplies .
It can cause a range of health problems , from learning disabilities to seizures .
Children under six are most at risk .

There is NO - WAY to un pop popcorn .
Once popped you have destroyed the membrain that was the ear of the corn .
It can be used as a cushion for packaging after being popped so long as it does not contain sugar or other flavoring .
Imagine a music app with instant access to any song you wanted to hear .
Imagine creating a playlist from those songs and quickly , easily sharing it with friends .
Such an app does exist , it 's called Spotify , and it could change music forever .

Hyperbole alert !
I admit it , I 'm over - the - moon about Spotify — both over what it currently is and more importantly over the potential it has .
If you get a chance to try it out , I think you may feel the same way .
( Click any of the full - width images for a closer look . )
What Is Spotify
In short , here 's how it works : Spotify is a peer - to - peer music streaming service ; it 's a desktop application , but its content all comes via the cloud .
Think of it as though the entire iTunes Music Store were actually just your library , and that instead of the poorly designed mess that it is , imagine that it was refreshingly streamlined , fast , and easy to search and use .
That gives you a little bit of an idea what Spotify is like .
It also works under Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux ( using Wine ) .
Advertisement
The best part :
It 's completely legal .
Spotify seeks out licensing deals with the music industry before going live , meaning it sits comfortably in the 100 % legit territory .
The catch : Oh , you knew there 'd be a catch , did n't you .
Although they 've told me they hope to make it stateside before the end of the year , Spotify is currently only available in Sweden , Norway , Finland , the United Kingdom , France , and Spain .
But after just one day of playing with Spotify , I was convinced it could change the way I listen to music .
After a week , I 'm absolutely hooked .
What 's So Great About Spotify ?
First , just because it 's really well done , let 's take a look at the official Spotify commercial :
The best part about Spotify is that it could not be easier to use .
Currently Spotify boasts around 3.8 million tracks ( not as impressive as iTunes ' over 10 million songs by any stretch , but they 're adding songs regularly and could easily someday match iTunes ) .
Here 's a quick overview of the best features you 'll notice as soon as you fire up Spotify for the first time :
Advertisement
You can access your music from any computer : Each time you open Spotify , you log into you Spotify account — meaning that no matter where you 're logging in from , all of your playlists are ready and waiting for you .
It 's not synchronization — it 's better than that .
That 's because you do n't have to worry about moving gigabyte after gigabyte of music from one computer to the next .
Spotify simply streams the music to wherever , and so logging into the application is essentially like logging into your Gmail account — except instead of all those emails , you 've got all your music ready and waiting to play .
Advertisement
Sharing any of your playlists is as easy as sharing a link : iTunes and other desktop players do a fair job of playlist creation , but if you want to share a playlist with a friend , your best bet is still to burn the mix to a CD .
Yeah ... old school , right ?
We 've featured plenty of web - based music players designed to make sharing playlists a breeze , including MixTape .me ( particularly notable to me because I created it ) .
With Spotify , sharing a playlist you 've created is as simple as right - clicking any playlist in the sidebar and selecting Copy HTTP link or Copy Spotify URI .
Send either link to a friend via email and clicking on it should send them straight to that playlist in Spotify .
It 's dead simple .
A web site has already sprung up dedicated to sharing Spotify playlists .
On top of that , Spotify already has tools built in for quickly sharing a playlist via Facebook or Delicious .
Pretty cool stuff .
Advertisement
Collaborating on playlists is a breeze :
But let 's say you 're not impressed with the simple playlist sharing .
Spotify also lets you turn any playlist into a collaborative playlist by , again , simply right - clicking the playlist and then clicking Collaborative Playlist .
Advertisement
It 's clean and easy to navigate : Spotify 's navigation is a little like a hybrid between traditional music players and the web .
( Do n't let that confuse you , it 's not like Songbird . )
All you get when you start is a search box , a home page , some Spotify radio stations , and a play queue .
The first time you search , you 'll notice that Spotify saves your most recent searches in the sidebar .
As soon as you start creating playlists , they show up below your saved searches .
Click on any artist to go straight to every song by that artist in Spotify , along with their top hits , a biography section , and a radio station for that artist .
Likewise , clicking on any individual album will take you to an album overview page containing all the tracks for that album and an album review .
You can navigate backward and forward through your history with the forward / back buttons in the top left of the app — just like in your web browser .

But What About Quality ?
In Spotify 's free version , your music streams at approximately 160 kbps using the Ogg Vorbis q5 codec ( an open - source codec ) .
Premium subscribers ( that is , folks who pay 10 Euros a month , or around $ 14 ) stream at a higher bit rate of 320 kbps ( among other benefits ) .
Advertisement
Wait ... I Have to Pay for It ?
No , you do n't have to pay for it , but yes , there are different versions of Spotify .
The free version is supported by ads , but apart from those ads , supports all the same search , radio , and sharing features I mentioned above .
Advertisement
Spotify ads are actually audio ads occasionally inserted into your playlists .
I have n't actually heard one in the time I 've tested Spotify , but presumably they 're there , and yes , one might imagine that such ads could get a bit annoying .
( One user described Spotify ads thusly : " It was streets ahead of most desperate , shouty radio ads : polite , informative and reasonably unobtrusive .
The ad for Watchmen that turned up a dozen songs later was a bit more traditional " In a world … " movie trailer voiceover fare . " )
Of course , that 's where the Premium subscription — or even the $ 1 day pass if you just want a breather for a day — comes in .

What 's Not So Great About Spotify
Now that I 've hyped it up , it 's time to acknowledge where Spotify is n't quite ready to replace your traditional desktop music player ( like iTunes ) .
Advertisement
First , these songs are all trapped in the cloud :
So how does one go about playing music when no internet connection is available ?
Actually , Spotify automatically saves some of the music to your hard drive as it plays ( you can adjust just how much in the Preferences ) , so you 're not entirely out of luck .
Still , those 3.8 million songs shrink pretty quickly when you can only cache a portion of the music .
Advertisement
You can't sync the music to your MP3 player :
If you want to Spotify music with you on your MP3 player , you really can't , right ?
Well , actually , that 's partly — but not entirely — true .
Spotify will probably never work on your old MP3 player , but if your player has Wi -Fi access ( or , better yet , 3G access ) , that 's another story .
In fact , Spotify already has submitted an iPhone app to Apple , which you can see in the video below :
Let 's pretend for a second that Apple would ever consider approving Spotify , despite their lame , indefensible app approval habits .
Think about how convenient Spotify on the iPhone would be :
You would never have to plug in your iPhone to sync your music .
Just fire up Spotify and stream any of your playlists and tunes using your iPhone 's data plan or Wi-Fi connection .
It even supports offline playback the same way the desktop version does .
( Okay , so we cheated on that one .
It 's not really that much of a bad thing — in fact , it 's exactly the kind of easy " syncing " we 'd like on an iPhone , Android phone , Pre , or any other cellphone . )
Advertisement
If a song is n't in the Spotify catalog , you 're out of luck : Spotify has a finite catalog , and unfortunately — for the time being , at least — you can't add anything of your own to that catalog .
( I was knocked on my face when I wanted to play some ELO and realized they did n't have Flashback in their catalog , for example .
In fact , it actually demonstrates another Spotify annoyance of mine : Artist pages are often filled with kind of lame compilations ; it'd be nice if you could filter artist releases and compilations . )
Advertisement
This , to me , the inability to add your own music is clearly the biggest limitation of Spotify 's potential .
Even if the service managed to support every major and even relatively minor label in the world , there 'd still be those tracks — like from your friend 's band — that will likely never make their way to Spotify .
Naturally , the folks at Spotify are aware of this problem , and they 've even said they 're considering some form of personal uploading , but right now it 's not available , and implementing it is likely problematic for their licensing .
Advertisement
It 's not available in my country yet :
Okay , so I said the library limitation above is the biggest problem with Spotify .
To be fair , that 's the biggest problem for people who can actually use the application .
For the whole of the United States and several other countries , Spotify 's biggest problem is that it 's not even available .
As I said above , Spotify is working to change that ; they 're already in talks with the major U.S. labels ( Wired quotes founder Daniel Eks as saying that " the labels want to see Spotify in the U.S. " ) , so it 's likely just a matter of time .
Your Thoughts
I realize this review is awfully glowing , but I also know that some of the problems with Spotify I 've mentioned above are absolute showstoppers for some .
In fact , some folks , the digital packrats — likely the people who have a hard time getting rid of their old CD collection despite having burned it all to their computer — may have no desire to ditch their hard drives full of music for a cloud - based alternative .
We respect that .

Whether or not you 've had the chance to play around with Spotify , love it or lump it , let 's hear what you think about the app in the comments .
Aux Etats - Unis , les fichiers de délinquants sexuels sont publics , et accessibles sur l’internet .
The Economist , qui prend partie contre les dérives que cela entraîne , y revient en détail au travers de l’histoire édifiante d’une jeune Américaine de 29 ans , fichée depuis 13 ans pour corruption de mineur : à 17 ans , elle avait été surprise en train de faire une fellation à un camarade de classe de 15 ans .
Mise à jour du 14/09/2009 : Wendy
Whitaker vient d’être incarcérée pour n’avoir pas prévenu la police qu’elle était retournée chez sa mère .
Elle risque 30 ans de prison .
En 1996 , Wendy Whitaker avait 17 ans .
Un jour , en classe , le professeur éteint la lumière pour y diffuser une vidéo , et son voisin lui propose de profiter du noir pour lui faire une fellation .
Le garçon allait avoir 16 ans trois semaines plus tard …
Wendy Whitaker fut donc accusée de « sodomie » ( en Georgie , c’est ainsi que l’on qualifiait les fellations ) .
Wendy a rencontré son avocat 5 minutes avant l’audience .
Il l ’a incitée à plaider coupable .
Elle ne comprenait pas trop ce qui lui arrivait .
Wendy a été condamnée à 5 ans de prison avec sursis , et a été incarcérée un an .
Elle est inscrite au registre des délinquants sexuels , de Georgie , consultable sur l’internet ( y compris via Google Maps ) , où n’importe qui peut trouver son nom , sa photographie et son adresse , ainsi que le motif de sa condamnation pour pédophilie : il y est inscrit « sodomie « , sans autre explication .
Copie d’écran de sa fiche , floutée par mes soins à l’intention des moteurs de recherche
Du fait de son inscription dans le registre , Wendy n’a pas le droit d’habiter ni de travailler à moins de 300 mètres de tout endroit susceptible d’accueillir des enfants ( écoles , parcs , bibliothèques , piscines… ) .
140 villes ont porté cette distance à 750 mètres .
A Miami , une centaine de délinquants sexuels ont ainsi été contraints de se réfugier sous un pont , parce qu’ils ne peuvent pas vivre ailleurs .
Jusqu’à récemment , il était également interdit aux personnes figurant dans le registre d’habiter près d’un arrêt de bus , ce qui ne revenait à interdire aux personnes fichées d’habiter dans quelque agglomération que ce soit .
Cette interdiction a finalement sauté , mais , et après avoir acheté une maison avec son mari , un juge a découvert que l’église de son quartier accueillait occasionnellement une garderie , et elle a été contraint à déménager .
Son mari a perdu son emploi dans la foulée .
Pourtant , ce qu’a fait Wendy n’est plus considéré comme un crime en Georgie : en 1998 , une cour de justice a finalement autorisé les fellations ( qui étaient interdites , même entre époux ) , et depuis 2006 , les relations sexuelles entre adolescents consentants ne sont plus traitées comme des crimes .
Mais la loi n’est pas rétroactive .
674 000 personnes fichées
Il existe de tels registres de criminels sexuels dans tous les états américains et , en décembre de l’an passé , 674 000 personnes y étaient fichées , un nombre sans cesse croissant , ne serait - ce que parce que , dans 17 états , on y est fiché pour la vie .
On aurait tendance à croire qu’on y trouve que des violeurs ou pédophiles .
Mais dans cinq états , le simple fait d’aller voir une prostituée suffit à y être fiché , tout comme le fait d’uriner en public , dans 13 d’entre-eux , et 29 y inscrivent également les adolescents ayant eu une relation sexuelle consentie avec un autre adolescent .
On y trouve même des personnes qui , depuis , se sont mariées avec celle ou celui avec qui ils avaient eu des relations sexuelles consenties , mais qui , prohibées par la loi , leur avaient valu d’être condamnées .
On y trouve aussi des adolescents qui , parce qu’ils ont reçu , ou envoyé , des « sextos » d’eux nus à leur petit(e ) ami(e ) , y ont été condamné pour « pédo- pornographie « .
On y trouve également des parents accusés de complicité pour avoir autorisé leur adolescent , mineur , à faire l’amour .
Plusieurs personnes ont été tuées par des gens qui avaient eu connaissance de leur passé judiciaire via ce type de bases de données .
Si les meurtres sont rares , les cas de harcèlement sont , eux , très fréquents , y compris des enfants de ceux qui sont fichés , sans parler du fait que ces derniers n’ont pas le droit d’aller avec leurs enfants au parc , à la piscine ou au musée , et donc de vivre ce que tout bon parent se doit de faire avec ses enfants .
Un fichage contre - productif
Cette ostracisation entraîne également pertes d’emploi , déménagements ( entre 20 et 40 % des personnes fichées ) , dépressions … facilitant d’autant le risque de récidive .
Plusieurs études ont été consacrées à la récidive des délinquants sexuels .
L’une d’entre-elle , portant sur 10 000 Américains , a montré que 5 % d’entre - eux avaient récidivé dans les 3 ans .
Une autre , portant sur 29 000 anglo - saxons , a constaté un taux de récidive de 24 % dans les 15 ans suivant leur première condamnation .
Le suivi psychologique ferait chuter le risque de récidive de 43 % , mais les autorités dépensent plus d’argent dans la répression et le fichage - qui coûte plusieurs millions de dollars , dans chaque état - que dans la prévention .
Parce que c’est plus « payant « , tout simplement -à court terme en tout cas .
Le fichage des délinquants sexuels est en effet d’autant plus populaire que les crimes ou délits qui leur sont imputés font peur , et sont largement exploités , souvent de façon populistes , tant dans les médias que par les responsables politiques .
Quel homme politique oserait prendre la défense des délinquants sexuels au nom de la défense des droits de l’homme ou de la vie privée ?
Un examen officiel du registre georgien , qui répertorie plus de 17 000 délinquants sexuels ( dont près de 400 femmes ) , a révélé que 65 % de ceux qui y étaient fichés ne représentaient pas de risque particulier , et que 5 % d’entre-eux seulement étaient considérés comme dangereux .
Un fichage également contre - productif .
Une étude universitaire avance d’ailleurs que ce type de fichage n’a quasiment aucun impact sur la récidive .
Sans parler du fait que le nombre de personnes fichées rend d’autant plus difficile le suivi , par les autorités et les policiers , de ceux qui sont vraiment dangereux .
Vers un fichier pan-européen des criminels sexuels ?
Human Rights
Watch fait partie de ceux qui réclament que l’on n’y fiche pas les mineurs , non plus que les auteurs d’infractions mineures , que seuls les criminels considérés comme dangereux y soient inscrits , et que les données ne soient pas accessibles au grand public .
Les états américains sont tenus de créer de telles fichiers depuis 1994 , et de l’interconnecter dans une base de données nationale depuis 2006 .
En Grande - Bretagne , on peut y être fiché dès l’âge de 11 ans .
Et plusieurs politiciens européens parlent de créer un fichier pan-européen .
En France , la loi Perben II a créé le Fichier judiciaire automatisé des auteurs d’infractions sexuelles en 2004 , pour « prévenir la récidive des auteurs d’infractions sexuelles ou violentes déjà condamnés et faciliter l’identification des auteurs de ces mêmes infractions , les localiser rapidement et à tout moment »
43 408 personnes y sont fichées .
Ce FIJAISV ne peut être consulté sur l’internet , mais nombreux sont ceux qui peuvent y accéder : gendarmes et policiers , autorités judiciaires , préfets et les ceux qui sont chargés de valider le recrutement des professionnels en contact avec les mineurs au seins d’un certain nombre d’administrations : direction des ressources humaines de l’éducation nationale , rectorats et les inspections académiques , directions départementales des affaires sanitaires et sociales , directions régionales et départementales de la jeunesse et des sports , directions départementales du travail …
Les données ( nom , prénom , sexe , date et lieu de naissance , nationalité , alias éventuel , dans certains cas la filiation , leur adresse ) y sont conservées pendant 20 ou 30 ans .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany could provide 4.5 billion euros ( $ 6.35 billion ) in state aid for carmaker Opel if General Motors chooses Canada ’s Magna , Berlin ’s favored suitor , as the buyer , a minister said .

The last - ditch offer would see the federal government and Germany states with Opel plants split the initial aid bill without waiting for other European countries that have GM sites to chip in , Deputy Economy Minister Jochen Homann said .
“ We could envisage making a loan available , then later agreeing precisely how the costs are to be shared out with the other European countries , ” Homann -- who heads the government ’s Opel task force -- told Reuters on Wednesday .
Others such as Britain , Spain , Poland and Belgium could contribute once the degree of their further involvement in GM ’s European operations , which employs some 50,000 in Europe , became clear .
Asked whether the offer to stump up the money would be extended to the Canadian automotive group Magna ’s rival bidder , Belgian financial group RHJ , Homann said : “ The question does n’t arise , because the German government has a preference for Magna ’s improved offer . ”
BOARD MEETING
General Motors ’ board of directors convenes later on Friday and sources close to the deal said the meeting would address the sale of Opel .
“ It ’s possible that the GM board will review both offers on Friday and will give a recommendation , ” Homann said .
“ The German government has clearly stated that it favors the Magna offer .
There are no doubts from this perspective . ”
Homann said the federal government and the states expected Opel ’s suitor to invest 10 percent of the sum in Opel that Germany would make available for the carmaker .
“ That means Magna would have to bring in 450 million euros of its own capital , ” he said .
Asked whether he was confident that this could be agreed , Homann said : “ Yes . ”
RHJ said on Wednesday it had about 380 million euros ( $ 535.9 million ) available to invest at the end of July , a sum that had dipped 12.5 percent since end -March .
Sources close to the talks said the GM board aimed to recommend one of the suitors at the meeting .
Trustees who oversee a majority stake in Opel -- which was ringfenced and propped up with German aid in May to avoid being swept into GM ’s brief bankruptcy -- must approve any decision .
GM declined to comment .
UP IN ARMS
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the German states that are home to Opel plants have come out clearly in favor of the Magna offer because they think the Canadian automotive group ’s expertise can save more of the 25,000 Opel jobs in Germany .
RHJ ’s offer for Opel seeks less European state aid and has won favorable comments from some GM officials , but is viewed skeptically in Berlin and by Opel ’s top labor leaders .
Still , Opel labor is divided on which buyer to favor , with immediate concerns about jobs being the major factor .
“ We prefer the RHJ offer because it provides greater job guarantees for the Spanish plant , ” said a spokesman for the UGT union , Spain ’s largest , in Madrid .
UGT fears 1,400 jobs in Zaragoza could go if RHJ wins but 1,700 if Magna prevails .
John Fetherston , head convener at the Ellesmere Port Vauxhall plant in Britain for trade union Unite , said the union had not backed a favorite but that a number of reports had suggested RHJ would be better for British plants .
GM ’s Vauxhall employs around 4,700 staff in Britain , including a site in Luton seen as especially at risk from cost - cutting .
Both Magna and RHJ plan to cut around 10,000 Opel jobs in Europe , or a fifth of the workforce .
Germany is set to get off relatively lightly , although RHJ has suggested idling the plant in Eisenach for two years .
Magna wants to keep all four German plants in operation .
Rudi Kennes , deputy labor leader for Opel in Europe and a representative of Belgium ’s ABVV trade union , said any preference for RHJ was most emphatically not shared in Belgium .
“ If the Spanish still think the sun is turning around Spain ... they ’re wrong , ” he said .

Two weeks ago ' The Guardian ' did a story on how the global financial crisis has affected those at the very top .
They said that , on average , the world 's glitziest luxury property has only dipped by around 12 % in the past year .
At the end of the article was an interesting league table in which they listed the top 10 most expensive streets in the world measured by price per square metre .
Hong Kong 's very own Severn Road came in at number 8 .
( For the record , Monaco 's Avenue Princesse Grace came in at number 1 with a staggering £ 73,000 per square metre ) .
OK I 'm not implying anything at all here , but last week I was asked by a certain photo agency to go and shoot whatever I could get of luxury property on Severn Road for another British newspaper ( which I can't name here ) .
It seems that they really liked The Guardian 's piece and wanted to do their own story .
Being up to date with the news on Hong Kong property due to my own vested interests , I knew that I had to get shots of Sun Hong Kai Properties ' Severn 8 ' development which , no prizes for guessing , is at the ( auspicious for some ) number 8 Severn Road .
The development is on The Peak , which was once favoured by colonial era Brits for being cooler than down along the tram tracks at grunge level Hong Kong .
According to The Guardian , a house at ' Severn 8 ' only costs £ 24,500 per square metre .
Exiled Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra bought a place here in 2007 .
And recently fung shui maestro Tony Chan put his House 3 at ' Severn 8 ' up for sale at a price lower than the market price .
There was no way the security guard at ' Severn 8 ' would ever let me in , though I did try to blag it .
So , like a pap , I scrambled through wet jungle and all the way along the exterior perimeter fence , none of which , by the way , is against the law in Hong Kong .
This is also why I ended up with mosquito bites and jungle scratch marks all over my shins and ankles .
( I did , however , see a couple of nice looking spiders .
They had tiny white bodies and very small white feet and legs as thin as human hair so you could hardly see them .
Alas they were too quick to get a shot of to post here .
Not to mention I was hardly in the mood for shooting natural history stuff , as by the time I saw them I was dripping in sweat and cobwebs and ready to leave ) .
So here 's what the most expensive property in Hong Kong looks like , anyway .
Another angle .
Note the killer view of the Hong Kong skyline from the infinity pool .
And here 's a different view of ' Severn 8 ' from the top of the Bank Of China Building in Central , ( bad weather , bad light ) .
And here 's that list in it 's entirety , courtesy of The Guardian : -
The world 's top 10
1. Avenue Princesse Grace , Monaco , £ 73,000 per sq /m
2. Chemin de Saint - Hospice , Cap Ferrat , South of France , £ 61,000 per sq /m
3. Fifth Avenue , New York , £ 44,000 per sq /m
4. Kensington Palace Gardens , London , £ 40,000 per sq /m
5. Avenue Montaigne , Paris , £ 33,000 per sq /m
6. Via Suvretta , St Moritz , Switzerland , £ 27,500 per sq /m
7. Via Romazzino , Porto Cervo , Sardinia , £ 26,000 per sq /m
8. Severn Road , The Peak , Hong Kong , £ 24,500 per sq /m
9. Ostozhenka Street , Moscow , £ 21,000 per sq /m
10 . Wolseley Road , Point Piper , Australia , £ 17,000 per sq /m
Owein R. knew that security at the government facility was going to be a big deal , but it was n't clear how big a deal it was going to be until he started his job .
To get anywhere in the facility , you needed a pass , and these were granted on a least - permissive basis .
Even if your clearance was high enough , you still needed a pass to get into certain areas .
To be granted access to a restricted area , you either had to have a pass , an appointment , or to be escorted at all times by someone with a pass – this included lunch and bathroom breaks .
One of Owein 's tasks required him to gain access to a restricted area of Building A , and since he had no clearance to the area , he 'd discussed ahead of time with the security officer that he'd be needing access , and that he would come by and grab the pass the following morning .
The entryway opened into the security desk and offices , which was as far as you could get without a pass .
The security officer was in a secured area , but it was literally on the other side of the wall from the publicly - accessible security desk .
Since Owein was n't allowed in that area , he called her from the security desk .
" Hi , my name is Owein R. , I understand you have a pass for me ? "
" Yes , I do , " she said , sounding a little flustered .
" I do n't have clearance to enter the SCIF , could you please bring the pass to me ?
I 'm in the main sec - "
" Sorry , " she interrupted , " I absolutely can't break away right now , I 'm terribly busy . "
" So ... "
" So you 'll need someone that 's approved to be in here to escort you in . "
So Owein moseyed back to his area and asked around , and thankfully his friend John was able to help him out .
" We 'll go after lunch , " he said .
A few hours later , they were back in the non-secure desk area of the SCIF .
Owein got on the phone with the security officer while a man at the sign - in desk listened to their conversation .
" Hi , it 's Owein again , I have someone with clearance with me now , can I come back and grab the pass ? "
" Sure ! " she said politely .
The man at the sign - in desk cut in ; " just sign in here and I 'll send you on back . "
The sign in form was simple enough ; name , date / time , reason access was requested , and a wide column labeled " appointment . "
" Uh , excuse me , what do I put under ' appointment ? ' "
" You do have an appointment , " he said , more like a statement of fact than a question .
" Do n't tell me you do n't have an appointment ? "
He paused , then continued " I 'm sorry , you can't come in without an appointment .
If you do n't meet the required clearance level you have to have an appointment . "
Again , Owein got the security officer on the line .
" I ca n't get in without an appointment , what should I do ? "
There was a pregnant pause while Owein hoped that she 'd just walk five feet to give him the badge .
No such luck , however – " I guess you 'll just have to make an appointment with someone that 's working on the same project . "
It was back to square one , except not really , since Owein had n't actually left square one yet .
He and John walked back , and Owein furiously dialed everyone on the project .
Of course , none of them had the necessary clearance level , and since John was n't on the project , he was n't acceptable as a chaperone .
In short , Owein had no official reason to enter the facility .
The following day , Owein woke up ready to kick the day's ass – first thing , he marched up to the security office and got the security officer on the phone .
" To get an appointment requires official business .
The only business I have in there is getting the badge from you .
Can I make an appointment with you ? "
" Sure can , " she said , ruffling papers audible over the intercom .
" Looks like I 'm free ... ahh ... in a little over two weeks , the 23rd at 3:00 PM . "
Owein slumped his shoulders and sighed – when he got confirmation that his pass was ready , the note also mentioned that it would only last for two weeks .
In fact , this project was supposed to be completed before then .
" My badge will be expired by then , and at this point it 's too late to reschedule my work authorization .
You can't fit in a five minute appointment some time today ?
Do you have any other ideas ? "
" Sorry , booked solid , plus all of the paperwork required for the appointment ...
I guess you could send someone in for it . "
With a new lead , Owein called John , who showed up at the security desk ten minutes later .
After disappearing in the security officer 's office building for a minute or two , he returned empty handed .
" She wo n't give me the badge because I 'm not you . "
With her on the intercom again , Owein tried to keep his temper .
" Did n't you just tell me to send someone in for the badge ? "
" Well ... " after a few seconds , she launched into a tirade .
" Have you read our security protocols ?
And are you aware of how badly you 're asking me to violate them ? "
She went into great detail about how wrong everything Owein had asked her to do was .
Trying to calm her down , Owein calmly pleaded " look , can you just bring it with you to lunch or something ?
I can meet you in the lobby if you'd be willing to bring the pass with you . "
Three hours later , he was back , and he finally met the security officer face - to - face .
She held the badge between her index and middle fingers , held near her temples .
Uh oh , time for another tirade .
" I 'm not a delivery boy , you have no regard for security , you 've wasted my time for several days , " she scowled .
Owein tried to calmly explain that they were on the same side of the security argument , he'd just been trying to find a way within the security protocols that he could get the pass that had already been approved and created for him .
Once Owein finally got his pass , it was a Pyrrhic victory .
Thanks to several days ' worth of delays , he did n't get the chance to finish his project on time , and he was downsized the following week .
" The very act of making education accessible , free , and learner - driven is the heart of democracy .
Here in Chicago , an incredibly segregated city , I 've seen learning circles be agents of social justice : they have brought people of all races , ages , and social classes , and helped them form bonds they might otherwise not have the opportunity to form . "

If you are well versed in the cultural phenomenon occurring within American fitness centers , then you are already aware that there are some strange characters in those places .
Here are the top ten worst .
10 . The Grunter
Like a female tennis player , this guy releases a Satan - like queef - moan with every rep he takes .
He makes that real butch - manly chick you brought home sound like that little , annoying , rat - like chick you brought home .
9 . The Girl Who Can Kick Your Ass
You always have to make sure she ’s distracted by hitting on one of the huge trainers before you start your reps .
This way she wo n’t be able to laugh at you .
No normal guy really wants to a bang a chick that can kick their ass anyways .
They already possess the mental powers of persuasion and irrational logic .
With the addition of hulk strength your penis becomes officially just for show .
8. The Napoleon Bro-naparte
The guy who ca n’t grow past 5 ’ 5 ″ makes up for it by growing outward .
Frenetically insecure , the steroids he ’s probably on make him very emotionally unstable .
If you watch him do sets you can hear his screams of pent - up rage as the weights go up .
This is then followed by intense crying of Maury Povich proportions as the weights come down .
He is most likely wearing a lacrosse jersey or something made by Abercrombie .
Either way it wo n’t have sleeves .
7. The Guy Doing Pointless Exercises
This guy stands there with the bright red eight pound Fisher Price dumbbells and spins them in circles over his head at random .
This guy clearly has no idea what he is doing .
He is a danger to himself and everyone in the gym and probably wo n’t ever see results .
But he will hop on a machine right after you to try and imitate what you were just doing .
After four reps of doing it wrong he ’ll give up and try to copy someone else and experience the same outcome .
He will eventually figure out how to do the chest machine that is generally only found in the workout room of a Best Western before he goes into the spin room to do eight jumping jacks and 15 jump ropes .
For some reason this guy almost always wears glasses .
6 . The Old Guy
Fully equipped with his bright white Saucony sneakers and a pair of khakis , this old man is ready to do what he calls “ working out . ”
He will sit on the arm bike , with or without an oxygen tank , shooting out looks that can make any young man feel guilty for being young .
5 . The Girl Who Just Hangs Out
When these girls grow tired of their regular routine of not eating , they head to the gym .
Usually gathered by the smoothie bar , or at worst a Vitamin Water vending machine , these girls mostly love to exercise their credit cards .
Like the majority of women they consider exercising carrying around the six dresses from their ‘ maybe ’ pile at Saks for 30 minutes .
They use the gym as an excuse to dress up in their cute gym outfits , check out boys and of course make all their other friends feel bad about themselves by telling them how long they were at gym for .

DERA ISMAIL KHAN , Pakistan – Pakistani Taliban deputy Hakimullah has called The Associated Press following reports that he was killed during a clash among militants seeking to succeed the group 's leader .
Hakimullah spoke to an AP reporter who was familiar with his voice .
He said in Monday 's call that the Pakistan Taliban remain united despite government reports that there is infighting .
He also insists that Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud is alive .
The U.S. and Pakistan say they are nearly certain that Mehsud was killed in a CIA missile attack last week .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A former U.S. State Department official and his wife have been arrested for spying for the Cuban government for nearly 30 years , the Justice Department said on Friday .

Walter Kendall Myers , 72 , aided by his wife Gwendolyn Myers , 71 , used his Top Secret security clearance to pass on classified information to the Cuban government and at one point met with Cuban leader Fidel Castro , according to court documents .
The two were charged with conspiracy to act as illegal agents of the Cuban government and to communicate classified information to Cuba , the Justice Department said .
They were also charged with wire fraud and acting as illegal agents .
They face up to 35 years in prison .
The two pleaded not guilty and will be held until a detention hearing on Wednesday , a Justice Department official said .
A lawyer representing the couple declined to comment .
The arrests come as the United States and Cuba have offered glimmers of hope that they might be ready to end years of hostility .
In mid-April , President Barack Obama pledged a “ new beginning ” with Cuba after modestly easing the 47 - year - old U.S. trade embargo against Havana .
The Cuban government had no immediate reaction .
According to court documents , the two were recruited in 1979 by a Cuban official who directed Kendall Myers to pursue a job at either the State Department or the CIA .
Myers worked part - time at the State Department since 1977 and joined full - time in 1985 , eventually working his way up to a position of senior analyst specializing in intelligence analysis on European matters .
With a Top Secret / SCI security clearance , he had daily access to classified information and viewed more than 200 intelligence reports about Cuba , according to the affidavit .
He retired in 2007 .
Gwendolyn Myers worked at a bank .
The two received messages from the Cuban government via shortwave radio and hand - passed messages , and typically passed their responses to handlers by hand .
Gwendolyn Myers said her favorite way to pass information was by swapping carts at a grocery story , according to the affidavit filed by an FBI agent .
A Justice Department official said they were motivated by a desire to help the Cuban government , not money .
They traveled occasionally to Cuba and other locations across Latin America to meet with their handlers , and met Castro in 1995 .
Kendall Myers told an undercover FBI source posing as a Cuban intelligence officer he had received “ lots of medals ” from the Cuban government .
The undercover operation began in April .
In meetings with the FBI source , who at one point offered Kendall Myers a cigar , the couple allegedly agreed to provide information on the April 17 - 19 , 2009 Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago , according to court documents .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has ordered a damage assessment and a review of the department ’s security procedures , the State Department said .
If you 've got a kid with ADHD , you 've probably spent countless hours pleading with him to sit still .
Well , stop it .
Fidgeting , as it turns out , helps kids with Attention - Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder focus .
So just like grown - ups need a cup of coffee before tackling a problem , kids with ADHD may tap their feet , swivel in their chairs or bounce in their seats while their brains are busily figuring out that math test .
That 's the conclusion of a groundbreaking study conducted by a team at the University of Central Florida .
The team , led by Dr. Mark Rapport , studied 23 pre-teen boys -- 12 with ADHD and 11 without -- and watched how the boys tackled problems that taxed their " working memory , " the short - term memory that most of us use unconsciously each day .
The tests were not easy :
The boys were shown a series of numbers , then a few seconds later , asked to recall the numbers and rearrange them in order .
In another test , they were shown a visual pattern and then asked to recall it , using the computer keyboard .
As they worked on the problems , the boys with ADHD spun around in their swivel chairs .
They tapped their hands and feet and jiggled around .
Even the movements that were not obvious on videotape were picked up by actigraphs , an activity monitor that the boys wore like watches .
" Everybody moves more when they 're concentrating on the tasks , not just the ADHD kids , " said Rapport , a former school psychologist who now studies the disorder at the Children 's Learning Clinic at UCF .
" But the ADHD kids moved significantly more , " and as the tasks got harder , the kids jiggled and bounced and spun more .
Why ?
Rapport said that , just as adults drink coffee to stay alert during a boring meeting , ADHD kids jiggle and wiggle to maintain alertness .
Parents naturally wondered why the kids , who bounce around during school hours , can sit still and play a video game or watch a movie .
But Rapport found that when he showed the preteen boys an exciting scene from " Star Wars , " all of them sat very still -- because they did not have to concentrate to watch the movie .
Likewise , even with video games , kids were not using working memory -- the higher - level thinking required of much schoolwork .
What makes ADHD kids different ?
Rapport suspects they are " under - aroused " -- that their brains do not produce enough dopamine to keep them alert during normal day - to - day activities -- so the kids move around to jiggle or wake their brains and bodies up .
For many teachers , like Darcey Eckers of Orlando , Rapport 's findings confirmed what she has seen in years of teaching .
" These kids have to move , " Eckers said .
" It can be any kind of movement -- some part of their body , it does n't even matter what part . "
But at some schools , such movement is frowned upon .
Eckers , who teaches second grade at Rosemont Elementary in Orange County , takes a different tack .
If the children are more comfortable standing or pacing while they work , they can move to the back of the classroom .
" Some of them need to squeeze a ball , some need to tap a pencil while they work .
I do n't mind , " said Eckers , a 17 - year veteran of New York and Florida schools .
What she 's found is that the ADHD children may be stifled by the sit still , be quiet methods , but when allowed to move a little , they thrive .
" They are the most amazing children ; they are some of the smartest kids in the class . "

KAOHSIUNG , Taiwan —
America 's world champion ultimate frisbee athletes do n't take themselves too seriously .
Still , they would n't mind getting a bit more respect .
" Sure , it would have been a lot cooler if Obama had called me up and said ' Good luck to you , bro , ' " said star Team USA member Beau Kittredge .
Kittredge and his teammates grabbed the gold medal Tuesday night at the World Games here in Taiwan , beating a scrappy Japanese team in a hard - fought , physical match in front of an enthusiastic crowd .
Not that most Americans would know .
No U.S. broadcaster picked up World Games coverage , and the U.S. media presence ( aside from yours truly ) was zero .
Ultimate frisbee may be one of the fastest - growing recreational sports in the United States , but it 's still fighting to shed its image as a campus quad past - time for the patchouli crowd , and be taken seriously on the world stage .
" The goal is to get more people to know that ultimate 's a real sport with real athletes , " said Kittredge after the team 's gold medal match .
" We train just as hard as anyone else in any other sport .
And if anyone thinks we do n't , they 're welcome to step on the field . "
Part of the challenge is that it 's such a young sport .
Recreational frisbee was the post - war invention of a U.S. World War II veteran , and ultimate dates to a New Jersey high school in the late 1960s .
It 's only caught on outside America in the last couple of decades .
Now , young Americans are flocking to the sport , said Team America 2009 captain Gwen Ambler .
There were 4.9 million ultimate frisbees players last year , up from 4 million in 2007 , according to statistics cited here , and Ambler said some 600,000 of those play the sport at least 20 times a year .
" Some of the growth and recognition is germinating now , " Ambler said .
" So I 'm optimistic in the long run . "
Could it ever become an Olympic sport ?
" The Olympics is n't adding team sports , it 's cutting them — so that would be a hard sell right now , " Ambler said .
" But the fact that it 's gotten such a good reception here is a good sign for the sport 's marketability , and its appeal to fans . "
Jonathan Potts , president of the World Flying Disc Federation ( so named to avoid the use of the trademarked term " Frisbee " ) , agreed , saying graduating to the Olympics would be " in the very distant future , " due to the sport 's limited resources .
" We 're on a steep learning curve , " said Potts , who was " tweeting " the progress of competition from Kaohsiung .
" We 're clearly not ready for the Olympics in terms of organizational capacity . "
Then there 's the question of whether the sport even wants to go Olympic .
The game is unique among team sports in being referee - less , with a strong emphasis on " spirit " and sportsmanship .
Potts says going Olympic could involve compromising those founding values .
" Right now we 're against having referees , because it violates the spirit of the game , " he said .
Call it ultimate 's awkward adolescence — the game 's not sure what it wants to become , and how seriously it wants to be taken .
In Kaohsiung , the teams balanced the intense on - field attitude of world - class competition with a friendly , relaxed vibe off the field .
Ambler said the team " plays best when really loose , " so they kept it fun in the lead - up to the finals — with karaoke on team bus rides , impromptu dance sessions and playings of Ludacris ' " On Top of the World " in the locker room .
Teammate Chelsea Putnam sported a gelled Mohawk hairdo for competition , and Ambler " poofed " hers out .
But make no mistake : training was a grueling , six - month process .
Twenty Team USA members were chosen from 130 that applied ; that was whittled to 13 who made the cut to go to Kaohsiung .
( Seven took the field at a time , four men and three women ; ultimate is the rare co-ed team sport . )
Many of the athletes are members of elite U.S. clubs —
Ambler , for example , plays for Fury , a San Francisco Bay - area women 's ultimate club .
And as with any world - class sport , the players devoted countless hours to getting in top physical and mental shape .
Given that , the lack of recognition can be frustrating .
" It was distressing how little media — none — was happening in the U.S. about this , " said Cassey Crouch , the mother of gold medalist Cara Crouch , 26 .
" A bone thrown to them would have been nice .
They worked very hard . "
Cassey and her husband Michael , of Sugar Land , Texas , said their daughter played soccer before , but started ultimate nine years ago at the University of Texas at Austin .
" We love watching it , " Cassey said .
" The passion for the game is unbelievable . "
That was clear in Kaohsiung on Tuesday night where excited Japanese and U.S. fans alternated cheers of " Nippon " and " U.S.A. " from the sidelines .
Will that passion translate into more eyeballs and media attention ?
Stay tuned for the next World Games in 2013 — in Cali , Colombia .

The sporting death
Ben Goldacre , 29 August 2009 , The Guardian
Why would you listen to a government health message , or your GP practise nurse , when the Sunday Telegraph has much more exciting news ?
“ Health warning : exercise makes you fat ” is the kind of full - width headline you want to see across a broadsheet page : it ’s affirmative , it ’s reassuring , and it gives you clear permission to sit on your arse all day .
“ Re-programming body fat is the key to weight loss , not working out . ”
Praise be .
“ Is it possible that all that exercise is doing nothing to make us slimmer ? ”
Please let the answer be yes .
The Telegraph produced three lines of research for this claim .
Firstly , more people are spending more money on more exercise than before , but there is also more obesity around in the UK than before : explain that with your science .
Then there was some speculative laboratory research about interfering with brown fat in animal models using stem cells and things : interesting to read , but distant from the headline claim , and not much use to you on a Sunday .
To properly examine whether exercise really will make you fat , they described two trials .
The first one , I can tell you right now , is cherry picked .
The Cochrane Library is a non-profit collaboration of academics who produce unbiased , systematic reviews of the medical literature , and they have a systematic review of all the 43 trials that have been done on exercise for weight loss .
This produces clear evidence that exercise is beneficial , albeit more modestly than you ’d hope .
“ Exercise plus diet ” was compared with “ diet alone ” in 14 trials : both groups lost weight , but 1.1 kg more in the exercise group .
High intensity exercise was compared with low intensity in 4 trials , high intensity exercise came out better in all of them , with extra weight loss of 1.5 kg .
There are also improvements in blood pressure , cholesterol , blood sugars , sense of well - being , and so on .
The Telegraph quoted one trial from Dr Timothy Church of Louisiana University , which compared three different levels of exercise with a personal trainer in overweight people .
There were no significant differences between the weight lost in any of the groups , including the “ control ” group , who were not given a personal trainer at all .
So it is true that exercise did indeed have no benefit , in this one single trial the Telegraph quoted , whilst ignoring the vast , overwhelming majority of published literature examing the same question .
Dr Church speculates that the explanation for his finding is that people who exercised more also ate more .
Fine .
Then there is the Telegraph ’s second trial .
“ Another study due to be published next month in the journal of Public Health Nutrition by researchers at the University of Leeds draws similar conclusions .
Professor John Blundell and his colleagues found that people asked to do supervised exercise to lose weight also increased the amount they ate and reduced their intake of fruit and vegetables . ”
I have this trial in front of me .
It ’s simply not true that participants increased their food intake .
Only 15 % of all participants gained weight during the study , and these were the only people to increase their food intake , but in any case , the weight gained even by these people was lean tissue , and they lost fat tissue .
In fact , what the Telegraph do n’t tell you , bafflingly , is that overall , participants doing supervised exercise in this trial lost more weight .
Much more weight .
In fact , people doing exercise lost 3.2 kg more weight , on average , over just 12 weeks .
Prof Blundell says : “ the Telegraph article was a complete distortion of the facts of our investigation , which showed that exercise is very effective for weight loss .
They completely reversed the outcome of our study . ”
Misleading journalism like this is becoming a genuine public health problem .
We ’ve previously seen the evidence that people change their health behaviour in response to what they read in the media .
To add to this , the World Cancer Research Fund recently commissioned a survey from YouGov .
This was a proper survey , in a representative sample , from a reputable data collector , where anyone is allowed to see the questions and the results , not a secret PR survey to get free advertising in a newspaper .
Half of all respondents said they thought scientists and doctors were constantly changing their minds about healthy living advice , although in reality , healthy living advice has n’t changed at all for at least a decade ( do n’t smoke , do some exercise , eat more fruit and veg ) .
And a quarter of all respondents said that because scientists keep changing their minds , you might as well eat whatever you want , because it wo n’t make any difference anyway .
Have another pastry and put the telly on .
Sometimes it ’s good to hide things instead of deleting them .
Users may accidentally delete something and this way there will be an extra backup .
The way I ’ve been doing this is I set a flag in the database , deleted = 1 .
I wrote this code to automatically hide records from django if they are flagged .
Django allows developers to create model managers that can change how the models work .
The code below was written to return only the undeleted records by default .
I added two new methods in case I need to get some of the deleted records .
from django .
db import models class SoftDeleteManager ( models .
Manager ) : '' '
Use this manager to get objects that have a deleted field ' '' def get_query_set ( self ) : return super ( SoftDeleteManager , self ) .
get_query_set ( ) . filter ( deleted = False ) def all_with_deleted ( self ) : return super ( SoftDeleteManager , self ) .
get_query_set ( ) def deleted_set ( self ) : return super ( SoftDeleteManager , self ) .
get_query_set ( ) . filter ( deleted = True )
This is usable by many models by adding this line to the model ( it needs a deleted field ) objects = SoftDeleteManager ( )
This will hide deleted records from django completely , even the django admin and even if you specify the id directly .
The only way to find it is through the database itself or an app like phpMyAdmin .
This might be good for some cases , but I went a step further to make it possible to undelete things in the django admin .
Django has a lot of customization options for the admin interface ( this article has some more info on customizing the django admin ) .
I wanted the queryset to be different in the admin , so I created a ModelAdmin to customize what is displayed .
First I set it up to show a few more columns than just __unicode__ on the list of items and added a filter to help easily separate the deleted from the active .
from django .
contrib import admin class SoftDeleteAdmin ( admin. ModelAdmin ) : list_display = ( ' id ' , ' __unicode__ ' , ' deleted ' , ) list_filter = ( ' deleted ' , ) # this requires __unicode__ to be defined in your model
This can also be used by many models by adding this at the bottom of the models .
py file :
from django .
contrib import admin from wherever import SoftDeleteAdmin admin. site .
register ( MyModel , SoftDeleteAdmin )
The next thing to do was override the queryset method in the default ModelAdmin .
I copied the code from the django source and changed it from using get_query_set to make it use all_with_deleted ( ) which was a method added to the ModelManager .
The following code was added to SoftDeleteAdmin .
def queryset ( self , request ) : " " " Returns a QuerySet of all model instances that can be edited by the admin site .
This is used by changelist_view . " " " # Default : qs = self.model._default_manager.get_query_set ( ) qs = self .
model ._default_manager .
all_with_deleted ( ) # TODO : this should be handled by some parameter to the ChangeList .
ordering = self .
ordering or ( ) # otherwise we might try to * None , which is bad ;) if ordering : qs = qs. order_by ( * ordering ) return qs
The list of objects in the admin will start to look like this .
They are showing up there now , but wo n’t be editable yet because django is using get_query_set to find them .
There are two methods I added to SoftDeleteManager so that django can find the deleted records .
def get ( self , * args , ** kwargs ) : '' ' if a specific record was requested , return it even if it ' s deleted '' ' return self.all_with_deleted ( ) . get ( * args , ** kwargs ) def filter ( self , * args , ** kwargs ) : ' '' if pk was specified as a kwarg , return even if it 's deleted ' '' if ' pk ' in kwargs : return self .
all_with_deleted ( ) . filter ( * args , ** kwargs ) return self .
get_query_set ( ) . filter ( * args , ** kwargs )
With those updated methods , django will be able to find records if the primary key is specified , not only in the admin section , but everywhere in the project .
Lists of objects will only return deleted records in the admin section still .
This code can be applied to a bunch of models and easily allow soft deletes of records to prevent loss of accidentally deleted objects .
I use webfaction to host a lot of my django projects .
It has an easy setup that will get you developing quickly and a great community of talented programmers .
There is also a quick setup for rails , wordpress , and a lot more .

Like many people , I had long wanted to learn how to make sourdough .
In fact , at one point I had a starter going and was sure I had killed it .
After much reading , in books and online , and some encouragement from my online friends , I tried again , this time with better results .
Although there is a wealth of information out there , I was never able to find one source that detailed the method I used , which was based on Reinhart ’s “ barm ” in The Breadbaker ’s Apprentice ( “ BBA ” ) .
My own experience and that of others here has taught me one thing : sourdough starters do n’t read baking books , so they do n’t know how they are “ supposed ” to behave .
I could have been spared the angst , the wasted time , and of course , pounds of precious flour , if only I had known what to expect and what to look for .
In the hopes of sparing others what I went through , I put together this tutorial blog .
This was a real test , as I wrote it day by day as I was trying out a modified starter that I had’t made before .
It ’s still based on Peter ’s starter , but I altered the amounts and the times to suit my own fancy .
I ended up with a more reasonable ( i.e. , much smaller ) amount of starter and got there with much less wasted flour .
So here goes :
Day 1 :
Ingredients : 1/3 cup rye flour and 1/4 cup water
For the flour , I use stone - ground rye .
Nothing special , just what I got from the grocery store .
My water is tap water run through a filter .
Before I had a filter on my sink , I used bottled drinking water .
Mix the flour and water in a bowl .
It will be thick and pasty , kind of like the oatmeal that ’s left in the pot if you do n’t come down for breakfast on time .
Once all the flour is mixed in , put it in a pint - sized or larger container and cover with plastic wrap .
Leave it out on the counter .
And that ’s it for today .
Day 2 :
Ingredients : 1/4 cup unbleached AP , bread , or high gluten flour ; 1/8 cup water
There should be little , if any , change in the culture from yesterday .
Again , I ’m not really particular about the flour .
I would just recommend staying away from bleached flour .
I am using AP flour for this batch .
Mix the flour , water , and all of the starter from yesterday in a bowl .
It will still be thick but a little wetter than yesterday .
Put it back in the container ( no need to wash it ) , press it down as level as you can get it , and mark the top of the culture with a piece of tape on the outside of the container .
Put the plastic wrap back on top , and you ’re finished .
Day 3 :
Ingredients : 1/4 cup unbleached AP , bread , or high gluten flour ; 1/8 cup water
Around Day 3 or 4 , something happens that puts terror in the heart of the amateur sourdough maker : they get a whiff of their starter .
When you check your starter on Day 3 , you may notice a strange , and not at all pleasant , odor .
And unless you know better ( which you will now ) , you ’ll swear something is drastically wrong .
In fact , I would venture to guess that that smell has been the ruin of more amateur sourdough growers than anything else .
It ’s an acrid , sour , almost rotten smell , and it ’s perfectly normal .
And rest assured , your new baby sourdough starter will soon outgrow it .
So , take heart , and press on .
You may also notice that your starter has begun to come to life .
It probably wo n’t grow a lot , maybe 50 % , but you will start to see bubbles , like these :
Regardless of the amount of growth , stir down your starter , throw out about half ( no need to measure , just eyeball it ) , and mix the rest with today ’s flour and water .
You will get a slightly more doughy - looking mass :
Once it ’s well mixed , put it back in the container ( still no need to wash ) , pat it down , and move your tape to again mark the top of the starter .
Put the plastic wrap back on the container , and take the rest of the evening off .
You worked hard today .
Day 4 :
Ingredients : 1/4 cup unbleached AP , bread , or high gluten flour ; 1/8 cup water
And now , a word about measurements .
If you bake regularly , or even if you ’ve just been nosing around baking sites for a while , you are no doubt aware that the ingredients in most artisan bread recipes are listed by weight rather than volume .
I measure by weight for my baking and for maintaining my sourdough starter .
You might wonder why , then , am I using volume measurements here ?
Two reasons : first , I have tried to make this starter as simple to follow as possible — no special tools , no monkeying around with the scales , just a couple of measuring cups and a bowl .
And , when it comes to starting a starter , the measurements are n’t as critical as when you actually go to bake with it .
So for now , we ’re just using measuring cups .
Today is another one of those days where novice sourdough starter makers often lose heart .
Your starter is now coming to life , and like most living things , it kind of has a mind of its own .
Up until now , we followed the clock , making our additions every 24 hours .
Now , we will be letting the starter dictate the timeframe .
Before you do your Day 4 additions , you want to make sure your starter has at least doubled .
If it doubles in less than 24 hours , you should still wait until the 24 hour mark .
If it takes more than 24 hours , be patient .
Let it double .
It may take another 12 or 24 hours , or it may take longer .
Again , be patient .
It will double .
Just give it time .
Eventually , you ’ll end up with a nice , bubbly starter :
You can see that mine more than doubled .
But I still waited for 24 hours .
Once it doubles , throw out half of the starter , then mix the rest with the flour and water , and back into the bowl it goes :
Replace the tape and plastic wrap .
Then wait for it to double .
It could take as little as 4 hours , or it may take more than 24 hours .
This time , you can move on to Day 5 at any point after doubling .
It ’s OK if you let it more than double ; it ’s also OK to move on right when it hits the double mark .
So , hurry up and wait .
If it does n’t seem to be doing anything after 24 hours , you can goose it with a tablespoon or so of rye flour .
Day 5 :
Ingredients : 3/4 cup unbleached AP , bread , or high gluten flour ; 1/2 cup water
Once your starter has at least doubled , it ’s time for the final mix .
Combine flour , water , and 1 /4 cup starter in a bowl and mix well .
Transfer to a clean container with room for the starter to at least double .
OK , one last time , cover with plastic wrap and let it sit on the counter until it gets nice and bubbly .
Do n’t worry so much about how much it grows , just so that it ’s bubbly looking .
This will probably take around 6 hours , but , again , do n’t stress about the time .
Let the starter tell you when it ’s ready .
When your starter gets bubbly , pat yourself on the back : you are now the proud parent of a bouncing baby starter !
Put a lid or other cover on your container and put it in the refrigerator .
Let it chill overnight , and you can begin using it the next day .
Day 6 and beyond :
By today , your starter is ready to use .
The flavor will continue to develop over the next several weeks to month , so do n’t be disappointed if your first few loaves are n’t sour enough for you .
I would still recommend beginning to bake with it right away , especially if you have never made sourdough bread before .
That way , you can hone your skills while your starter develops its flavor .
Feeding your sourdough :
If you keep your sourdough in the fridge , you only have to feed it about once a week .
And you can minimize your discards by keeping only what you need and feeding it when you want to bake with it .
I recommend a 1:1:1 ( starter : water : flour ) feeding , which means each feeding includes an equal amount , by weight , of starter , water , and flour .
Start by weighing your starter , subtracting the weight of your container .
Then add an equal amount of water and flour directly to the container .
So , for example , if you have 100 grams of starter , you would add 100 grams each of water and flour .
If you feed your starter right out of the fridge , as I do , warm your water to lukewarm ( 90 – 100 degrees F ) .
After you mix in the water and flour , leave it out on the counter for a few hours , then put it back in the refrigerator .
It ’s best if you feed your starter a few days before you intend to bake with it .
To illustrate , here is an example of my feeding routine , starting with the Day 5 starter and assuming that I finished making the starter on Friday night :
Saturday morning , I take out what I need to bake bread ( 2/3 cup using my normal sourdough bread recipe ) and return the rest of the starter to the refrigerator .
Wednesday of the next week , I get out the starter , weigh it , and add equal amounts of flour and water in a 1:1:1 ratio , as outlined above .
My goal here is to build up as much starter as I need to make bread on the weekend , and enough left over for my next build .
It ’s OK if I have more than I need to bake with .
If I do n’t think I ’ll have enough after a 1:1:1 build , I will increase my ratio of water and flour , maybe to 1:2:2 or 1:1.5:1.5 .
In that case , I will let it sit out until it almost doubles before returning it to the fridge , which might take a bit longer , as I ’m using less starter relative to flour and water .
Friday night or Saturday morning , I again take out what I need to bake with and return the rest to the fridge , to be fed again mid-week .
This is just an example of how I keep my starter .
You can feed yours more often if you bake more than I do .
It ’s also OK to let it go more than a week between feedings .
If you do that , though , you might want to feed it a few times before you bake with it .
So , that ’s it .
Hopefully I ’ve unravelled some of the mystery of sourdough starters and given you the confidence to try one yourself .
Good luck , and let me know how it works out for you !
Honeybee numbers are in decline Almost a fifth of the UK's honeybees died last winter , the British Beekeepers ' Association has said .
Combined with an average 30 % loss the year before , it means beekeepers are struggling to keep colonies going .
Honeybees are worth £ 200 m a year to UK agriculture because of their work pollinating crops .
Bees are suffering from viruses , a parasitic mite and changes in the weather .
Experts are calling for more money to be put into research .
A survey by the British Beekeepers ' Association ( BBKA ) suggested an average of 19.2 % of colonies died over winter , which is " double " the acceptable level .
The highest losses were recorded in the north of England , where 32.1 % perished , and the lowest in eastern England , where 12.8 % did not survive .
These ongoing losses in the pollination army of honeybees cannot continue if we are to secure food supplies
BBKA 's president Tim Lovett
The survey showed an improvement on the previous year , which the BBKA put down to the period of really cold weather in the winter which encouraged the bees to " cluster " together , helping them to survive .
It also said the good weather in early spring enabled them to forage for nectar and pollen .
' Onslaught of threats '
But there was still a " worrying and continuing high level of colony loss " , said the BBKA 's president Tim Lovett .
" It underlines the need for research into the causes and remedies for disease in order to ensure that our principal economic pollinator , the honeybee , can survive the onslaught of the threats it currently faces , " he said .
" These ongoing losses in the pollination army of honeybees cannot continue if we are to secure food supplies . "
Nearly all the UK's 250 species of bee are in decline .
In the last two years , honeybee numbers have fallen by 10 - 15 % .
The conservation watchdog Natural England recently called on people living in urban areas to consider keeping bees .
Its chief scientist Tom Tew told the BBC : " We want urban people to engage with wildlife and get joy and pleasure from it .
The more hives you have the more resilient the whole population is to the outbreak of disease . "
' Really distressing '
The BBC presenter Martha Kearney is an amateur beekeeper and has seen for herself the decline in numbers .
She told Breakfast on BBC One : " They 've died out on me before and it was really distressing .
" You put the bees away for the winter and you hope they 're going to be OK .
" And when you open up the colony in the spring and see lots of dead bees in there , it 's unpleasant .
" Beekeeping is a fascinating hobby and I love it .
But they are dying .
This year is slightly better than last year though . "
A report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee last month warned the government was giving " little priority " to the health of the nation 's bees despite their importance to the agricultural economy .
Experts say sustaining bee populations is essential to ensuring the survival of Britain 's plants and crops .

Proving gay relationships are just as susceptible to break - ups as heteros — even in the animal kingdom ! — beloved gay penguin couple Harry and Pepper have gone their separate ways .
The San Francisco Zoo pair , who joined up as adolescents , nested together as adults and together raised their own chick from an abandoned egg .
And then entered a lady .
Maybe Harry is actually bi ?
He ’s dropped Pepper for Linda ( pictured here with Harry ) , a widowed penguin known for quickly shacking up with new mates after ditching partners .
And , evidently , getting her new men to attack their gay ex-lovers .
Enter the recently widowed Linda , who has long had a reputation of sorts , according to Brown .
Several years ago , she left her longtime companion and moved in with much older Fig just hours after Fig ’s partner passed away , Brown said .
“ That was the fastest we ’d ever seen penguins move on , ” he said .
“ To be completely anthropomorphizing , Linda seems conniving .
She ’s got her plan .
I do n’t think she was wanting to be a single girl for too long . ”
This year , within weeks of Fig passing away in winter , Harry was seen in Fig ’s old burrow spending time with Linda , Brown said .
Then one day , Harry and Linda approached Pepper ’s pen and confronted Pepper .
Harry began attacking Pepper violently and the three ultimately had to be separated , Brown said .
Harry and Linda successfully nested this year and eventually Pepper was returned to the penguin exhibit from a bachelor pad at the Avian Conservation Center , where he quietly took up his old residence .
Zookeepers and fans are waiting with bated breath to see what might happen next .
“ That ’s the big question , ” Brown said .
“ It ’s molting season in late July and early August , and around that time we see couples getting shaken up .
It ’ll be interesting to see if Harry spends any of that time with Pepper .
We ’ll have to wait and see . ”
Bill O’Reilly will be thrilled .

It was a magical moment when I learned how to ride a bike no handed .
I saw someone on a TV show that had magical powers and they were driving a motorcycle with their eyes closed steering with their mind .
I decided to try it out .
I did n’t close my eyes but I let go of the handlebars and held my hands out in front of me thinking about which way I wanted the bike to go .
I managed to keep this up for a full 3 seconds before grabbing back on to the bike .
I immediately ran home and told my mother about the new powers I had discovered .
Being better at telling when you ’re being lied to than most people could obviously be beneficial for a number of reasons , however , and I think this is kind of funny , people generally find it most useful to apply to their romantic partners as opposed to anyone else where you might think it would be obvious , like the boss , coworkers , someone trying to sell you something , etc .
Most people want to know if the person closest to them , the person that they ’re the most vulnerable to , is lying to them or not .
Kinda makes sense when you think in terms of vulnerability and therefore how much being lied to could cost you : being lied to by a salesman and not knowing it might cost you a few bucks , but being lied to by your cheating spouse and not catching it has much , much more dire potential consequences .
Now , pay attention to this short public service announcement and stick around for a few extra tips after the show :
A few extra tips
If you can do this and get away with it ( depends on the situation ) , there ’s an almost surefire method of catching them right
then and there : ask them a series of questions in rapid - fire succession about specific simple facts surrounding the event in question , such as location , time , date , people involved , etc .
Things that they would have to make up if they were lying , and that will therefore cause them to stumble and pause while their imagination goes into overdrive trying to answer them quickly , things that someone who was telling the truth would be able to spit out without even thinking .
Conflicting signals : that is , when body language and / or voice tone conflicts with the actual words that are used .
It wo n’t be this obvious , but an exaggerated example would be someone frowning and looking down while saying ‘ I loved your gift . ’
Also , lastly , please do n’t be too quick to condemn people just because you see one ( or even a few ) of these , they might be lying but there ’s enough of a chance they ’re not that you do n’t want to
automatically assume they are : it ’s when you see several of these indicators all at once that alarm bells should start ringing , and even then that should often serve to get you to investigate further when you might not have otherwise , as opposed to making you automatically decide that they ’re guilty on the spot .
In short , be careful 🙂

Two German ships set off on Friday on the first commercial journey from Asia to western Europe via the Arctic through the fabled Northeast Passage — a trip made possible by climate change .
Niels Stolberg , president and CEO of Bremen - based Beluga Shipping , said the Northern Sea Route will cut thousands of nautical miles off the ships ’ journey from South Korea to the Netherlands , reducing fuel consumption and emissions of greenhouse gas .
I had the chance to ask Stolberg a few questions about the Arctic expedition :
Question :
What ’s the status of the voyage ?
Stolberg : MV “ Beluga Fraternity ” and the MV “ Beluga Foresight ” have just started to sail from Vladivostok ( on Friday ) with the destination Novyy Port at the river Ob .
Question :
When did they leave Vladivostok and when will they arrive in Europe ?
Stolberg :
They ’ve just left Vladivostok .
They are scheduled to arrive in Novyy Port around September 6th .
After discharging , they will proceed via Murmansk to Rotterdam .
Estimated time of arrival is still to be confirmed and up to further voyage development .
Question :
How much time / fuel / money / CO2 will this northern route save ?
Stolberg :
The amount of time , fuel , money or emission saved will be significant by transiting the Northeast Passage instead of sailing the traditional way through the Suez .
From Ulsan via the Suez Canal to Rotterdam it would be a roughly 11,000 nautical mile journey whereas the short cut between Asia and Europe utilising the Northeast Passage is a 8,700 mile journey .
The saved distance in detail always depends on the route , so the routes could be about 3,000 to 5,000 miles shorter .
Savings of about three million euros by sending six vessels through the Northeast Passage per open time frame is realistic .
Saving distance means saving bunker means saving money :
That is the formula .
Question :
Your company has been a pioneer in reducing costs / CO2 — is that why you ’re so eager to sail the northern route ?
Stolberg :
It is a hallmark of the corporate philosophy of Beluga Shipping to go off the beaten tracks whenever possible and reasonable : MV “ Beluga SkySails ” , co-powered by a towing kite system , or many projects developed and driven by our own department “ Research & Innovation ” follow that principle with the overall intention and make shipping more efficient as well as into a greener business .
In this sense , we reckon that the Northeast Passage offers unmatched chances for efficient sea traffic when as an effect of global warming in the summer there is the chance of using this seaway for a couple of weeks , thus connecting the markets in Europe and Asia
Question :
Is drawing attention to global warming an aspect of this journey ?
Stolberg :
This is not our intention nor does it reflect our business .
My personal opinion is that global warming and climate change , obviously , are developments with some negative effects .
However , the melting ice in the Northeast Passage and thus the possibility to transit through this passage for commercial purpose has positive effects , too .
This development enables shipping companies to reduce bunker consumption and as a consequence CO2 and other emissions as well which , in turn , are small factors to limit the scope of the global warming .
Question :
Do you think many other ships will be taking this Arctic short cut ?
Stolberg :
The possibility to transit the Northeast Passage in combination with the cargo flow between Europe and Asia is a major reason and motivation why the Northern Sea Route will become even more attractive for shipping companies .
So , it is our goal to utilise this seaway regularly , if possible , and we could imagine others will follow our example .
You also have to have appropriate modern vessels , you have to have an experienced team of experts on board and all behind in the onshore offices and you have to be granted permission by the authorities .
Question :
Why have no other ships tried this northern route yet ?
Why are you the first ?
Stolberg : Russian submarines and icebreakers have used the northern route in the past .
But it was n’t open for regular commercial shipping until now because there are many areas with thick ice .
It was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the Northeast Passage .
We ’re the first company to travel the route this summer because we have suitable vessels and are well prepared to master the challenge .
Question :
What are the dangers of the northern route ?
Stolberg :
There are numerous challenges and some risks awaiting both vessel and crew .
Even though the ice is melting in the respective time frame , cold temperature and ice , drifting ice fields or ridges can become a problem and produce a risk of injury to the crew as well as a risk of damage to the vessel .
The look out is highly important .
Also the ship material and not least the seaworthy and all lashings of the cargo have to be checked constantly under this even more rough and inhospitable conditions than elsewhere on the ocean .
There is no expertise or field report we could rely on .
However , we are well prepared and have been intensively working on this project for far more than a year now .
Question :
When exactly is the “ window ” ?
Will it be opening wider soon ?
Stolberg :
The open window for transiting the Northeast Passage roughly is a six to eight weeks time frame in the Russian summer between August and September .
This is when the sun powers up to 20 or even more degrees Celsius in Russia and the ice along the route is mostly melting .
Thereafter the sun loses power again and the area refreezes .
Whether or not the window will open wider soon is a question only climate experts can answer .

I know I should be mortified by the lobbyist - organized mobs of angry Brooks Brothers mannequins who are now making headlines by shutting down congressional town hall meetings .
I know I should be despondent during this , the Khaki Pants Offensive in the Great American Health Care and Tax War .
And yet , I ’m euphorically repeating one word over and over again with a big grin on my face .
Finally .
Finally , there ’s no pretense .
Finally , the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd ’s ugliest traits are there for all to behold .
The group ’s core gripe is summarized in a letter I received that denounces a proposed surtax on the wealthy and corporations to pay for universal health care :
“ Until recently , my family was in the top 3 percent of wage earners , ” the affluent businessperson fumed in response to my July column on taxes .
“ We are in the group that pays close to 60 percent of this nation ’s taxes . …
Think for a second how you would feel if you built a business and contributed more than your share to this country only to be treated like a pariah . ”
This sob story about the persecuted rich fuels today ’s “ Tea Parties ” — and I ’m sure you ’ve heard some version of it in your community .
I ’m also fairly certain that when many of you run into the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd , you do n’t feel like confronting the faux outrage .
But on the off chance you do muster the masochistic impulse to engage , here ’s a guide to navigating the conversation :
What They Will Scream :
We ca n’t raise business taxes , because American businesses already pay excessively high taxes !
What You Should Say : Here ’s the smallest violin in the world playing for the businesses .
The Government Accountability Office reports that most U.S. corporations pay zero federal income tax .
Additionally , as even the Bush Treasury Department admitted , America ’s effective corporate tax rate is the third - lowest in the industrialized world .
What They Will Scream :
But the rich still “ pay close to 60 percent of this nation ’s taxes ! ”
What You Should Say : Such statistics refer only to the federal income tax .
When considering all of “ this nation ’s taxes ” including payroll , state and local levies , the top 5 percent pay just 38.5 percent of the taxes .
What They Will Scream : But 38.5 percent is disproportionately high !
See ?
You ’ve proved that the rich “ contribute more than their share ” of taxes !
What You Should Say : Actually , they are paying almost exactly “ their share . ”
According to the data , the wealthiest 5 percent of America pays 38.5 percent of the total taxes precisely because they make just about that share — a whopping 36.5 percent ! — of total national income .
Asking these folks to pay slightly more in taxes — and still less than they did during the go - go 1990s — is hardly extreme .
Stripped of facts , your conversation partner will soon turn to unscientific terrain , claiming it is immoral to “ steal ” and “ redistribute ” income via taxes .
Of course , he will be specifically railing on “ stealing ” for stuff like health care , which he insists gets “ redistributed ” only to the undeserving and the “ lazy ” ( a classic codeword for “ minorities ” ) .
But he will also say it ’s OK that government sent trillions of dollars to Wall Streeters .
And that ’s when you should stop wasting your breath .
What you ’ve discovered is that the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd is n’t interested in fairness , empiricism or morality .
With 22,000 of their fellow countrymen dying annually for lack of health insurance and with Warren Buffett paying a lower effective tax rate than his secretary , the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd is merely using the argot of fairness , empiricism and morality to hide its real motive : selfish greed .
No argument , however rational , is going to cure these narcissists of that grotesque disease .

President Barack Obama Wednesday unveiled a 2.4 - billion - dollar funding boost for the development of new generation electric vehicles and slammed critics of his economic rescue plans .
President Barack Obama Wednesday unveiled a 2.4 - billion - dollar funding boost for the development of new generation electric vehicles and slammed critics of his economic rescue plans .
The president traveled to a jobs crisis blackspot in the economically - struggling midwestern state of Indiana to announce a plan he said would create tens of thousands of new jobs .
" For far too long we 've failed to invest in this kind of innovative work , even as countries like China and Japan were racing ahead , " Obama said .
" That 's why this announcement 's so important .
This represents the largest investment in this kind of technology in American history . "
" This is an investment in our capacity to develop new technologies tomorrow .
This is about creating the infrastructure of innovation . "
Obama spoke in a plant that formerly made recreational vehicles ( RVs ) but which closed down as the recession hit .
The factory has since been reopened and is now making RVs and electric hybrid vehicles .
The initiative , funded from the administration 's 787 - billion - dollar economic crisis bailout , came against a backdrop of shifting political fortunes with Obama 's high opinion ratings eroding and Republican opposition resurgent .
It also came ahead of government jobs data due out on Friday which some analysts believe could see the unemployment rate growing to 9.6 percent , just short of the politically perilous 10 - percent mark .
Obama 's tactic of appearing outside Washington is designed to place him metaphorically on the side of the people who sent him to power last November , rather than squabbling politicians in the US capital .
" You know , too often there are those in Washington who focus on the ups and downs of politics .
But my concern is the ups and downs in the lives of the American people , " Obama said .
He also hit out at critics peddling " misinformation " on his economic recovery plans , which he said were starting to work and transition the US economy out of free - fall into a new , more sustainable era .
" There are a lot of people out there who are looking to defend the status quo , " Obama said , touting political reforms to on energy , healthcare and economic policy .
" There are those who want to seek political advantage .
They want to oppose these efforts -- some of them caused the problems that we 've got now in the first place , and then suddenly they 're blaming other folks for it . "
The 2.4 billion dollars in grants for electric vehicles includes 1.5 billion dollars to US manufacturers to make batteries and components and to expand recycling , officials said .
A further 500 million dollars will go to US firms which produce components for vehicles including electric motors , electronics and other drive train items .
The grants gel with a wider Obama administration effort to wean the United States off foreign oil from volatile regions of the world and drive to slice into US greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming .

In many languages you have type constructors ; given a type A and a type constructor Lift , you get a new type Lift < A > .
A functor is a type constructor together with a function
lift : ( A -> B ) -> ( Lift < A > -> Lift <B >)
that preserves composition and identities .
If h is the composition of two other functions g and f
h ( a ) = g ( f ( a ) ) ,
then lift ( h ) is the composition of lift ( g ) and lift ( f )
lift ( h ) ( la ) = lift ( g ) ( lift ( f ) ( la ) ) ,
where the variable la has the type Lift < A > .
Similarly , if h is the identity function on variables of type A
h ( a : A ) = a ,
then lift ( h ) will be the identity on variables of type Lift < A >
lift ( h ) ( la ) = la .
Examples :
Multiplication
Lift <> adjoins an extra integer to any type : Lift < A> = Pair < A , int > The function lift ( ) pairs up f with the identity function on integers : lift ( f ) = ( f , id )
adjoins an extra integer to any type : Concatenation
Lift <> adjoins an extra string to any type : Lift < A> = Pair < A , string >
The function lift ( ) pairs up f with the identity function on strings : lift ( f ) = ( f , id )
adjoins an extra string to any type : Composition
Let Env be a type representing the possible states of the environment and Effect = Env ->
Env
Also , we ’ll be explicit in the type of the identity function id < A > : A -> A id < A> ( a ) = a , so one possible Effect is id < Env > , the “ trivial side - effect ” .
Then Lift <> adjoins an extra side - effect to any type : Lift < A> = Pair < A , Effect > The function lift ( ) pairs up f with the identity on side - effects : lift ( f ) = ( f , id < Effect > )
Let be a type representing the possible states of the environment and Lists
The previous three examples used the Pair type constructor to adjoin an extra value .
This functor is slightly different .
Here , Lift <> takes any type A to a list of A ‘s : Lift < A> = List < A> The function lift ( ) is the function map ( ) : lift = map
The previous three examples used the Pair type constructor to adjoin an extra value .
This functor is slightly different .
Here , takes any type to a list of ‘s : Double negation , or the continuation passing transform
In a nice type system , there ’s the Unit type , with a single value , and there ’s also the Empty type , with no values ( it ’s “ uninhabited ” ) .
The only function of type X ->
Empty is the identity function id < Empty > .
This means that we can think of types as propositions , where a proposition is true if it ’s possible to construct a value of that type .
We interpret the arrow as implication , and negation can be defined as “ arrowing into Empty “ : let F = Empty and T = F -> F .
Then T -> F = F ( since T -> F is uninhabited ) and T is inhabited since we can construct the identity function of type F -> F. Functions correspond to constructive proofs .
“ Negation ” of a proof is changing it into its contrapositive form : If A then B => If NOT B then NOT A. Double negation is doing the contrapositive twice : IF A then B => If NOT NOT A then NOT NOT B. Here , Lift <> is double negation : Lift < A> = ( A -> F ) ->
F .
The function lift takes a proof to its double contrapositive : lift : ( A -> B ) -> ( ( A -> F ) -> F ) ->
( ( B -> F ) -> F ) lift ( f ) ( k1 ) ( k2 ) = k1 ( lambda ( a ) { k2 ( f ( a ) ) })
Monads
A monad is a functor together with two functions
m : Lift < Lift <A >> -> Lift < A> e : A -> Lift<A >
satisfying some conditions I ’ll get to in a minute .
Examples :
Multiplication
If you adjoin two integers , m( ) multiplies them to get a single integer : m : Pair < Pair < A , int > , int > -> Pair < A , int > m ( a , i , j ) = ( a , i * j ) .
The function e( ) adjoins the multiplicative identity , or “ unit ” : e : A -> Pair < A , int > e ( a ) = ( a , 1 )
If you adjoin two integers , multiplies them to get a single integer : Concatenation
If you adjoin two strings , m( ) concatenates them to get a single string : m : Pair < Pair < A , string > , string > -> Pair < A , string > m ( a , s , t ) = ( a , s + t ) .
The function e( ) adjoins the identity for concatenation , the empty string : e : A -> Pair < A , string > e ( a ) = ( a , " " )
If you adjoin two strings , concatenates them to get a single string : Composition
If you adjoin two side - effects , m ( ) composes them to get a single effect : m : Pair < Pair < A , Effect > , Effect > -> Pair < A , Effect > m ( a , s , t ) = ( a , t o s ) , where ( t o s ) ( x ) = t ( s ( x ) ) .
The function e( ) adjoins the identity for composition , the identity function on Env : e : A -> Pair < A , Effect > e ( a ) = ( a , id < Env > )
If you adjoin two side - effects , composes them to get a single effect : Lists
If you have two layers of lists , m( ) flattens them to get a single layer : m : List < List < A >> ->
List < A> m = flatten
The function e( ) makes any element of A into a singleton list : e : A -> List < A> e ( a ) = [ a ]
If you have two layers of lists , flattens them to get a single layer : Double negation , or the continuation passing transform
If you have a quadruple negation , m ( ) reduces it to a double negation : m : (((( A -> F ) -> F ) -> F ) -> F ) -> ( ( A -> F ) -> F ) m ( k1 ) ( k2 ) = k1 ( lambda ( k3 ) { k3 ( k2 ) }) The function e( ) is just reverse application : e : A -> ( A -> F ) -> F e ( a ) ( k ) = k ( a )
The conditions that e and m have to satisfy are that m is associative and e is a left and right unit for m .
In other words , assume we have
llla : Lift < Lift < Lift < A >>> la : Lift <A >
Then
m ( lift ( m ) ( llla ) ) = m ( m ( llla ) )
and
m ( e ( la ) ) = m ( lift ( e ) ( la ) ) = la
Examples :
Multiplication :
There are two different ways we can use lifting with these two extra functions e( ) and m( ) .
The first is applying lift ( ) to them .
When we apply lift to m( ) , it acts on three integers instead of two ; but because lift ( m ) = ( m , id ) , it ignores the third integer : lift ( m ) ( a , i , j , k ) = ( a , i * j , k ) .
Similarly , lifting e( ) will adjoin the multiplicative unit , but will leave the last integer alone : lift ( e ) = ( e , id ) lift ( e ) ( a , i ) = ( a , 1 , i ) The other way to use lifting with m( ) and e( ) is to apply Lift <> to their input types .
This specifies A as Pair < A ' , int > , so the first integer gets ignored : m ( a , i , j , k ) = ( a , i , j * k ) e ( a , i ) = ( a , i , 1 ) Now when we apply m( ) to all of these , we get the associativity and unit laws .
For associativity we get m ( lift ( m ) ( a , i , j , k ) ) = m(a , i * j , k ) = ( a , i * j * k ) m ( m ( a , i , j , k ) ) = m( a , i , j * k ) = ( a , i * j * k ) and for unit , we get m ( lift ( e ) ( a , i ) ) = m ( a , 1 , i ) = ( a , 1 * i ) = ( a , i ) m ( e ( a , i ) ) = m ( a , i , 1 ) = ( a , i * 1 ) = ( a , i )

When we apply lift to m( ) , it acts on three layers instead of two ; but because lift ( m ) = map ( m ) , it ignores the third ( outermost ) layer : lift ( m ) ( [ [ [ a , b , c ] , [ ] , [ d , e ] ] , [ [ ] ] , [ [ x ] , [ y , z ] ] ] ) = [ [ a , b , c , d , e ] , [ ] , [ x , y , z ] ]
Similarly , lifting e( ) will make singletons , but will leave the outermost layer alone : lift ( e ) ( [ a , b , c ] ) = [ [ a ] , [ b ] , [ c ] ]
The other way to use lifting with m( ) and e( ) is to apply Lift <> to their input types .
This specifies A as List < A ' > , so the * innermost * layer gets ignored : m ( [ [ [ a , b , c ] , [ ] , [ d , e ] ] , [ [ ] ] , [ [ x ] , [ y , z ] ] ] ) = [ [ a , b , c ] , [ ] , [ d , e ] , [ ] , [ x ] , [ y , z ] ] e ( [ a , b , c ] ) = [ [ a , b , c ] ]

Monads in Haskell style , or “ Kleisli arrows ”
Given a monad ( Lift , lift , m , e ) , a Kleisli arrow is a function
f : A -> Lift <B > ,
so the e( ) function in a monad is already a Kleisli arrow .
Given
g : B -> Lift<C >
we can form a new Kleisli arrow
( g >>= f ) : A -> Lift < C> ( g >>= f ) ( a ) = m ( lift ( g ) ( f ( a ) ) ) .
The operation >>= is called “ bind ” by the Haskell crowd .
You can think of it as composition for Kleisli arrows ; it ’s associative , and e( ) is the identity for bind .
e( ) is called “ return ” in that context .
Sometimes code is less complicated with bind and return instead of m and e .
If we have a function f : A -> B , we can turn it into a Kleisli arrow by precomposing with e( ) :
( e o f ) : A -> Lift < B> ( e o f ) ( a ) = e ( f ( a ) ) = return ( f ( a ) ) .
Example :
Double negation , or the continuation passing style transform
We ’re going to ( 1 ) show that the CPS transform of a function takes a continuation and applies that to the result of the function .
We ’ll also ( 2 ) show that for two functions r , s , CPS ( s o r ) = CPS ( s ) >>= CPS ( r ) , (1 ) To change a function f : A ->
B into a Kleisli arrow ( i.e. continuized function ) CPS ( f ) : A -> ( B -> X ) ->
X , we just compose with e — or in the language of Haskell , we return the result : CPS ( f ) ( a ) ( k ) = return ( f ( a ) ) ( k ) = ( e o f ) ( a ) ( k ) = e ( f ( a ) ) ( k ) = k ( f ( a ) ) ( 2 ) Given two Kleisli arrows f : A -> ( B -> F ) ->
F and g : B -> ( C -> F ) ->
F , we can bind them : ( g >>= f ) ( a ) ( k ) = m ( lift ( g ) ( f ( a ) ) ) ( k ) // defn of bind = lift ( g ) ( f ( a ) ) ( lambda ( k3 ) { k3 ( k ) } ) // defn of m = f ( a ) ( lambda ( b ) { ( lambda ( k3 ) { k3 ( k ) } ) ( g ( b ) ) } ) // defn of lift = f ( a ) ( lambda ( b ) { g ( b ) ( k ) } ) , // application which is just what we wanted .
In particular , if f and g are really just continuized functions f = ( e o r ) g = ( e o s ) then ( g >>= f ) ( a ) ( k ) = f ( a ) ( lambda ( b ) { g ( b ) ( k ) } ) // by above = ( e o r ) ( a ) ( lambda ( b ) { ( e o s ) ( b ) ( k ) } ) // defn of f and g = ( e o r ) ( a ) ( lambda ( b ) { k ( s ( b ) ) } ) // defn of e = ( e o r ) ( a ) ( k o s ) // defn of composition = ( k o s ) ( r ( a ) ) // defn of e = k ( s ( r ( a ) ) ) // defn of composition = ( e o ( s o r ) ) ( a ) ( k ) // defn of e = CPS ( s o r ) ( a ) ( k ) // defn of CPS so CPS ( s ) >>= CPS ( r ) = CPS ( s o r ) .
Argonne scientists are working to improve techniques for capturing complex visualizations like this astrophysics simulation , which seeks to discover the mechanism behind the violent death of short - lived , massive stars .
The image shows entropy values in the core of the supernova ; different colors and transparencies are assigned to different values of entropy .
By selectively adjusting the color and transparency , the scientist can peel away outer layers and see values in the interior of the 3 - D volume .

If you wanted to perform a single run of a current model of the explosion of a star on your home computer , it would take more than three years just to download the data .
In order to do cutting - edge astrophysics research , scientists need a way to more quickly compile , execute and especially visualize these incredibly complex simulations .
These days , many scientists generate quadrillions of data points for visualizations of everything from supernovas to protein structures — and they ’re quickly overwhelming current computing capabilities .
Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Argonne National Laboratory are exploring other ways to speed up the process , using a technique called software - based parallel volume rendering .
Volume rendering is a technique that can be used to make sense of the billions of tiny points of data collected from an X - ray , MRI , or a researcher ’s simulation .
For example , bone is denser than muscle , so an MRI measuring the densities of every square millimeter of your arm will register the higher readings for the radius bone in your forearm .
Argonne scientists are trying to find better , quicker ways to form a recognizable image from all of these points of data .
Equations can be written to search for sudden density changes in the dataset that might set bone apart from muscle , and researchers can create a picture of the entire arm , with bone and muscle tissue in different colors .
“ But on the scale that we ’re working , creating a movie would take a very long time on your laptop — just rotating the image one degree could take days , ” said Mark Hereld , who leads the visualization and analysis efforts at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility .
First , researchers divide the data among many processing cores so that they can all work at once , a technique that ’s called parallel computing .
On Argonne ’s Blue Gene / P supercomputer , 160,000 computing cores all work together in parallel .
Today ’s typical laptop , by comparison , has two cores .
Usually , the supercomputer ’s work stops once the data ha­s been gathered , and the data is sent to a set of graphics processors ( GPUs ) , which create the final visualizations .
But the driving commercial force behind developing GPUs has been the video game industry , so GPUs are n’t always well suited for scientific tasks .
In addition , the sheer amount of data that has to be transferred between computers eats up valuable time and disk space .
“ It ’s so much data that we ca n’t easily ask all of the questions that we want to ask : each new answer creates new questions and it just takes too much time to move the data from one calculation to the next , ” said Hereld .
“ That drives us to look for better and more efficient ways to organize our computational work . ”
Argonne researchers wanted to know if they could improve performance by skipping the transfer to the GPUs and instead performing the visualizations right there on the supercomputer .
They tested the technique on a set of astrophysics data and found that they could indeed increase the efficiency of the operation .
“ We were able to scale up to large problem sizes of over 80 billion voxels per time step and generated images up to 16 megapixels , ” said Tom Peterka , a postdoctoral appointee in Argonne ’s Mathematics and Computer Science Division .
Because the Blue Gene / P's main processor can visualize data as they are analyzed , Argonne 's scientists can investigate physical , chemical , and biological phenomena with much more spatial and temporal detail .
According to Hereld , this new visualization method could enhance research in a wide variety of disciplines .
“ In astrophysics , studying how stars burn and explode pulls together all kinds of physics : hydrodynamics , gravitational physics , nuclear chemistry and energy transport , ” he said .
“ Other models study the migration of dangerous pollutants through complex structures in the soil to see where they ’re likely to end up ; or combustion in cars and manufacturing plants — where fuel is consumed and whether it ’s efficient . ”
“ Those kinds of problems often lead to questions that are very complicated to pose mathematically , ” Hereld said .
“ But when you can simply watch a star explode through visualization of the simulation , you can gain insight that ’s not available any other way . ”
Argonne ’s work in advanced computing is supported by the Department of Energy ’s Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research .

Dear Colleagues :
Welcome to the Abolitionist Approach Commentary .
The Commentary will consist of a series of podcasts that discuss and explore various aspects of the idea that we ought to abolish , and not merely regulate , animal exploitation .
The Commentary will reflect ideas contained in this website and in my books .
Animals are nonhuman persons and we cannot morally justify treating them as human resources .
In addition , because animals are chattel property or economic commodities , regulation of animal treatment costs money and animal welfare regulations will almost never provide significant protection for animal interests .
As a general matter , welfare regulations actually make animal use more profitable because the regulations implemented are those that result in an economic benefit for producers and consumers .
The Abolitionist Approach Commentary will discuss why animal welfare reform does not and cannot work to provide protection for nonhuman animals .
The Abolitionist Approach Commentary will promote ethical veganism and creative , non-violent vegan education as the primary forms of activism to move toward the abolition of animal use .
Ethical veganism goes beyond not just eating animal products ; it rejects the use of animals for clothing or the use of products that contain animal ingredients or that have been tested on animals .
There is no moral distinction between flesh and other animal products .
All animal products involve animal suffering and death .
The Abolitionist Approach Commentary will explore the notion of “ animal rights . ”
Although there is a great deal of controversy about what rights humans should have , we all oppose human slavery , or treating humans as chattel property .
The Abolitionist Approach maintains that we cannot morally justify denying this one right to all sentient nonhumans .
This means that we should stop bringing domesticated animals into existence .
We should care for those who are here now but we should not bring any more into existence .
We should leave non-domesticated animals alone and stop encroaching on and destroying their habitats .
The Abolitionist Approach Commentary will seek to explore our “ moral schizophrenia ” or the delusional and confused way in which we approach animal ethics .
We all agree that it is wrong to inflict “ unnecessary ” suffering and death on nonhuman animals .
If “ necessity ” is to have any coherent meaning , it must mean at least that it is wrong to inflict suffering and death on nonhuman animals for reasons of pleasure , amusement , or convenience .
But the overwhelming portion of animal use can be justified only by pleasure , amusement , or convenience .
Many of us live with nonhumans animals who we regard as members of our families .
But we stick forks into other animals who are no different factually or morally from the nonhumans we love .
The Abolitionist Approach Commentary will also discuss the issue of violence and will explain why the movement to abolish animal exploitation should be part of a larger movement for Ahimsa , or non-violence .
All humans exploit animals in some way or another .
Therefore , violence directed at institutional users makes no sense .
The institutional users of animals and producers of animal products are not the problem ; the problem is the public , which demands animal products .
If animal exploitation is ever to be ended , we must educate people in a non-violent way and shift the moral paradigm away from treating animals as property .
Finally , the Abolitionist Approach Commentary will address the important relationship between animal rights and human rights , and will explore why we should not use sexism , racism , and other forms of discrimination to promote animal rights .
In this first Commentary , I discuss whether we should promote vegetarianism as a “ gateway ” to veganism .
I conclude that the answer is “ no . ”
The bottom line : if you are a vegetarian , you are still complicit in animal suffering ; you are still complicit in animal killing .
If you regard animals as nonhuman moral persons , why would you be complicit in animal suffering and death ?
I hope that you find this Commentary and our future efforts useful for your thinking about animal ethics .

In part 1 we discovered how an auto - expanding textarea could be built and collated the requirements .
In part 2 we determined how coders would initialize our component .
It ’s now time to get our hands dirty with some JavaScript .
We are building a jQuery plugin named TextAreaExpander .
You can read about the intricacies of jQuery plugin development in this tutorial , but the barebones of our code is :
( function ( $ ) { // jQuery plugin definition $.fn. TextAreaExpander = function ( minHeight , maxHeight ) { // ... our code ... return this ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
The $. fn statement then declares our new jQuery plugin , TextAreaExpander , with the arguments minHeight and maxHeight .
We could express these in a JSON object but it ’s unlikely we ’ll need further parameters so we ’ll keep it simple .
Note that ‘ this ’ refers to the jQuery object ; we return it to ensure other jQuery effects can be bound to the same DOM elements .
Initializing the Textarea
The following initialization code is added to our TextAreaExpander function :
// initialize this.each( function ( ) { // is a textarea ? if ( this.nodeName.toLowerCase ( ) != " textarea " ) return ; // set height restrictions var p = this.className.match(/expand(d+ ) -*( d+ ) */i ) ; this .
expandMin = minHeight || ( p ? parseInt ( '0 '+ p [ 1 ] , 10 ) : 0 ) ; this .
expandMax = maxHeight || ( p ? parseInt ( '0 '+ p [ 2 ] , 10 ) : 99999 ) ; // initial resize ResizeTextarea ( this ) ; // add events if (! this. Initialized ) { this .
Initialized = true ; $ ( this ) .css ( " padding - top " , 0 ) .css ( " padding - bottom " , 0 ) ; $ ( this ) . bind ( " keyup " , ResizeTextarea ) . bind ( " focus " , ResizeTextarea ) ; } } ) ; return this ; } ;
This loops through all the jQuery - selected DOM nodes and runs an anonymous function .
The value of ‘ this ’ within that function is an individual textarea node .
The following initialization occurs :
The first line ensures that only textareas have the auto - expanding effect applied .
The next three lines extract the minimum and maximum height values .
The arguments passed to the TextAreaExpander function are used by default .
If none are specified , the textarea ’s “ expand ” class HTML is analysed with a regular expression .
If we still do not have values , 0 and 99999 are assumed ( note that the textarea will always have a minimum height of 1 character , so a zero height is never applied ) .
The values are stored as properties of the textarea node object — we can therefore examine them from any code .
The following line calls a ResizeTextarea function and passes the textarea node .
This will set the height to an appropriate size when auto - expanding is initialized .
Finally , we reset any vertical padding and define “ keyup ” and “ focus ” events .
The same ResizeTextarea function is called when the textarea receives focus and after text has been updated by the user .
The ‘ if ’ condition around these events ensures that they can only be applied once to any textarea .
This condition could have been applied to the whole of the initialization function , however , this code allows us to change the minimum and maximum heights at will .
Resizing the Textarea
We now need to define our ResizeTextarea function .
In part 1 , we discussed browser differences and noted that IE and Opera should never set a textarea height of 0 px .
Therefore , we will assign a variable that returns false if IE or Opera is being used :
var hCheck = !( $.browser.msie || $.browser.opera ) ;
It ’s dirty , but I ’m afraid that we cannot rely on better methods such as object detection .
I ’m open to suggestions , though !
We can now code our ResizeTextarea function :
// resize a textarea function ResizeTextarea(e ) { // event or element ?
e = e.target || e ; // find content length and box width var vlen = e.value.length , ewidth = e.offsetWidth ; if ( vlen != e.valLength || ewidth != e.boxWidth ) { if ( hCheck && ( vlen < e.valLength || ewidth != e.box Width ) ) e.style.height = " 0 px " ; var h = Math.max(e.expandMin , Math.min(e.scrollHeight , e.expandMax ) ) ; e.style.overflow = ( e.scrollHeight > h ? " auto " : " hidden " ) ; e.style.height = h + " px " ; e.valLength = vlen ; e.boxWidth = ewidth ; } return true ; } ;
This function is passed the argument ‘ e ’ .
This is either a textarea node ( during initialization ) or an event object ( when keyup or focus occurs ) .
The first line changes ‘ e ’ to a textarea node object if an event was fired .
The number of characters entered in the textarea is assigned to vlen .
The pixel - width of the box is assigned to ewidth .
If these values have not changed , we do not need to worry about resizing the box ( the user could just be moving the cursor ) .
vlen and ewidth are retained as properties of the textarea node object named valLength and boxWidth .
These are set after the textarea is resized so resizing will always occur the first time ResizeTextarea is called .
The next line resets the textarea height to 0 px .
This only occurs for non-IE / Opera browsers if content has been deleted or the box width has been changed .
The textarea ’s scrollHeight value is now assigned to variable ‘h’. Math.min and Math.max are used to ensure the value falls within the minimum and maximum pixel limits defined for this textarea .
Before we change the textarea height , we change the CSS overflow property .
The scrollbars will only be shown if the content height exceeds the textarea height .
We can now modify the textarea height and update the values of valLength and boxWidth .
Finally , the function returns true to ensure other textarea event handlers are not cancelled .
Our TextAreaExpander jQuery plugin is complete .
However , we need to ensure that the effect is applied to all textarea tags with an HTML “ expand ” class .
At the end of our file , we can add an event which initializes all appropriate textareas after the page has loaded :
// initialize all expanding textareas j Query ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { j Query ( " textarea[ class *=expand ] " ) .
TextAreaExpander ( ) ; } ) ;
I hope you ’ve found this series of tutorials helpful .
Feel free to use the auto - expanding textarea plugin in your own projects .

Michael Schumacher , the seven - time world champion , plans to come out of retirement as Felipe Massa 's replacement at Ferrari from the European Grand Prix .
Following days of speculation about who would slot in alongside Kimi Raikkonen following Massa 's Hungarian GP crash , Ferrari issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon confirming that Schumacher was being prepared for the role .
The statement said that Schumacher was ' ready ' to make his F1 return , and would undertake a training programme over the next few days to ensure he was up to full fitness for an F1 race .
The German , who quit F1 at the end of 2006 , injured himself in a motorbike accident earlier this year and the team want to make sure there are no hidden problems before confirming his position .
Schumacher has previously baulked at the idea of returning to F1 full - time , but with Massa looking likely to return when he is back to full fitness , and Ferrari in need of a top - line driver , the opportunity is one that has attracted him .
" The most important thing first : thank God , all news concerning Felipe is positive .
I wish him all the best again , " said Schumacher .
" I was meeting this afternoon with Stefano Domenicali and Luca di Montezemolo , and together we decided that I will prepare myself to take the place of Felipe .
" Though it is true that the chapter of Formula 1 has been completely closed for me for a long time , it is also true that for loyalty reasons to the team I cannot ignore that unfortunate situation .
But as the competitor I am , I also very much look forward to facing this challenge . "
Once Schumacher gets the green light , it will be the first time he has raced alongside Kimi Raikkonen , as the pair bid to secure Ferrari third place in the constructors ' championship .
It also comes at a time when Ferrari 's F60 appears to have made good progress on the track , and its KERS could prove to be an advantage in the forthcoming races at Valencia , Spa , Monza and Singapore .
Schumacher has not tested the current F60 , and has not driven since April 2008 when he ran an F2008 at Barcelona .
The announcement of Schumacher 's plans comes 24 hours after his manager Willi Weber totally ruled out the possibility of the German racing in Valencia .
" Whoever sits in the car at the next race in Valencia , it will not be Michael Schumacher .
I am not 100 per cent sure ; I am 200 per cent sure , " Weber was quoted as saying by The Daily Mail .
" The pressure on him would be huge .
He would be expected to win , but he has not driven this car .
When Michael was racing he would get as close to perfection as possible .
In this case , it would not be perfection ; it would be a gamble - and that 's not Michael 's style . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
In a victory for President Barack Obama , House lawmakers approved a sweeping energy bill on Friday that would set tough new greenhouse - gas emissions standards for U.S. companies and mandate more use of renewable energy sources .
The vote was 219 to 212 .
Obama argues that the bill will create jobs through new energy investments but critics say it will be a punishing tax on companies and consumers .
The bill 's heart is a " cap - and - trade " system for limiting emissions in which companies would buy and sell permits to meet emissions limits .
Every night , my wife Amy and I take turns lying with our six - year - old son Sam before he falls asleep .
It ’s his favorite time to ask questions , those particular ones I dread trying to answer .
“ Dad , is God real ? ”
Oh boy , here we go .
“ Some people think so … ” C’mon , do n’t be a jerk .
Tell him what you think .
“ I think so . ”
“ Then why ca n’t I see God ?
Is God a person ? ”
“ Well , it ’s more like a spirit . ”
“ So God ’s a ghost ?
God died and now God ’s a ghost ? ”
“ Well , no , I do n’t mean a spirit like that . ”
Then what do you mean ?
You ’re losing him .
“ Then what ? ”
“ It ’s like the force in Star Wars . ” Idiot !
“ But people ca n’t move things with their mind like Jedi . ”
“ Well , it ’s more like God keeps things together . ”
Pause .
A long , long pause .
I do n’t know where to go from here .
And then :
“ Oh I get it , ” Sam says .
“ The world is in pieces , and God has to hold them all in place or it will all fall apart . ”
“ Yeah . ” I say .
“ God just keeps it all in place . ”
*
These talks happen a few times a month .
I never thought we would be having these conversations so soon , but when Sam ’s uncle , my brother Eric , died three years ago , the questions began .
At three , Sam ’s questions were limited to “ Where is Eric ? ” but over the years his inquiries have deepened and become more unambiguous .
Maybe it would have been easier if Eric had been sick , or there had been an accident , but how do you explain suicide to a six - year - old ?
The first time he asked about death was one autumn afternoon a few months after that terrible day , Sam wanted to know how Eric died .
I told him Eric had a sick heart .
Sam seemed suddenly desperate , as if there was something I knew about the world that he also needed to understand .
But he was only three , and I was loath to tell him what really happened .
Sam next wanted to know where Eric had gone .
And it was then I knew I was in trouble .
My relationship with my brother was about as ambivalent as relations between brothers can get .
Eric was seven years older than I was , and so the context of our individual lives was always very far apart .
When Eric was getting dressed to go on a date , putting on cologne and shining his shoes , I was only eight or nine .
When Eric was secretly smoking cigarettes or working on his motorcycle in the garage , I was still playing with my action figures .
As we grew up our lives took very different paths .
It was n’t until our mother got sick with cancer that I felt we were finally sharing something as equals .
I turned to him for support and advice , and he checked in on me .
We reminisced and cried , told embarrassing anecdotes about my mother , and sat for long hours with our father .
After she died , as with many families , things eventually returned to their normal patterns .
Our familiar distance returned .
I finally pulled myself out of the quicksand that was my mother ’s death .
The rope that lifted me out of that muck and slime was the birth of my son .
It was n’t as simple as seeing life where before there was death .
What ultimately brought me back to solid land was that in the moment that Sam was born , God became real to me again .
With Sam , I saw that God was in all things .
God was not someone watching over us in heaven .
God was in the world .
And then Eric killed himself .
In the months leading up to his suicide , Eric was obviously in a dark place , but when he was with Sam he came alive in a way I had never seen .
Eric had raised a daughter of his own , and we communed on all the absurd and magical things that babies bring to the world .
Even more than when we cared for our dying mother , as fathers he and I shared something that seemed to finally transcend all our differences .
We waxed nostalgic about the toys we had loved and made plans to find them all on eBay one day for Sam : G.I. Joes , Dinky Toys , Snap - Tite models , and all the hundreds of variations of Lego sets .
I studied him while he played with Sam .
I wanted to learn how he could be so un-selfconscious , let himself get right down on the floor and play .
And right smack in the middle of all this joy and connection and the laughter of my little boy when he would see my brother come in the door , the S.O.B. went and killed himself .
Part of me wanted to retreat into faithlessness .
My mother had died naturally , albeit dramatically , by illness , with her husband at her side .
My brother ripped himself from the world .
He ’d been alone , desperate , hopeless , but all I could feel was rage that he would take himself from us , from my family when we needed him most .
And all I could think was , What are we going to tell Sam ?
For a child , death is simply a kind of transformation .
Sam understood that he would n’t see Eric anymore , but he wanted to know where Eric had gone .
That morning when he first asked , I said something vague and abstract about a person ’s spirit living on forever .
But how could I talk to Sam about an afterlife and heaven , things I do n’t really believe myself ?
And yet so many unsure parents quickly turn to this idea because we want our children to live in a world where magic and miracles are real , and because we are afraid the truths of the real world will force them to grow up more quickly than we would like .
Even after years of studying and writing about religion , I could n’t do much better .
There was very little in my upbringing to prepare me for this .
I was raised in a very secular home , and while we ate matzah on Passover and my brother and I both had bar mitzvahs , Judaism was not a way to make meaning , at least not explicitly .
When I was five my grandfather died .
My parents felt I was too young to go to the funeral .
But even though I was n’t there I know themen wore yarmulkes , I know my father rent a piece of his clothing , I know kaddish was said .
We did n’t observe the sabbath , but I know my grandfather had a Jewish funeral .
This is often when we call forth these rituals , to give form and language to something that has left us battered and dazed .
But for me , there was nothing , just a sense of emptiness and that strange hidden grief of adults that most children intuit .
As I grew older , through life ’s trials and circumstances ( you know the ones ; drugs , girls , and lots of bad decisions ) , I found myself seeking a grounded spiritual life where I could stop being such a jerk .
I was surprised to find this in the religion that I thought was little more than great jokes and even better chicken soup .
But while Judaism offered me a way to pray and to celebrate the seasons , I have had to continue to work through what God is .
Most of what I believe is still abstract , vaguely mystical , more questions and than answers .
And that ’s the way I like it .
So when Sam asked where Eric was , I fell back to that thing that means both so much and so little .
I told him Eric was in heaven .
But by the time he was six and could interrogate my answers .
I realized that a six - year old does n’t much understand the concept of metaphor .
“ Where ’s heaven ? ” Sam asked .
“ Well , it ’s not really a place . ”
See how quickly this gets complicated ?
“ Are there bathrooms in heaven ? ”
“ Well , I do n’t think you have to poop or pee in heaven . ”
“ Can you take your toys there ? ”
“ Sure .
Any toy you could ever imagine . ”
“ Did Eric take his toys ? ”
And so on .

What do we teach our children about faith when so many of us are n’t even sure what we believe ?
I can raise my son with a bounty of ritual and tradition , and it ’s even possible to do this without having to say much about God .
I would like to teach Sam about God because the idea of God is important to me and my life .
But as someone who has struggled with my own faith , I do n’t want to be dogmatic .
I do n’t want to tell Sam what he should believe just because I believe it .
And even more important , what faith I do have came from experience and years of reflection and meditation .
I want him to find his own way , but I would like my own faith to be a beacon for him .
The problem , it would seem , is my faith is not grounded in dogma or literal ideas about God .
My faith is rooted in experience , in the narrative of my life and in the stories that give my own abstract ideas color and form .
But this is the solution .
Stories are what put faith into context .
This is what my wife Amy and I do with Sam every night at bedtime .
We read stories ; myths , fables , and fiction .
When we read our children fairy tales and mythology , most kids do n’t ask whether they are true or false .
Does it matter that most scholars agree King Arthur likely did not exist ?
The first time I told Sam the story of Excalibur being pulled from the stone , a light went on inside him that has never dimmed .
Children draw from myth and fable what they need , extracting the nutrients and energy to keep them growing .
And so too with religion .
What I have for Sam are the things that others believe and the stories they told to express them .
Serpents and floods , the parting of seas and wrestling with angels .
It does n’t matter that things are n’t true in a literal way for them to have meaning and , more important , the power to shape our imaginations .
Judaism , while a religion of law and ritual , is still dependent on story to frame and ground it .
Passover is a story we tell each other every year , and it ’s a story that has meaning for more than Jews .
American slaves clung to the Exodus myth because it told them that the God of the Hebrews is a liberator .
Not once , but always .
But it was n’t until I had to try and explain something about faith to Sam that I understood why people frame the world in story .
And it was n’t until the death of a loved one that I realized if it was n’t for story , I would be lost .
Each of our lives , the stories of our lives , is a reflection of the human story .
“ Can I see Eric ? ” Sam asks .
“ Well , not with your eyes .
But I think if you try hard enough , you can feel Eric is a part of you . ”
“ Is Eric a ghost ? ”
“ Well , not a ghost , but a spirit . ”
“ You mean like God ? ”
“ Well , sort of .
But more like Eric is a part of God . ”
“ Are we a part of God ? ”
“ Well , yes . ”
“ But we ’re not dead .
Do you see my skeleton sticking out or something ? ”
I desperately want this conversation to end .
It ’s time for Sam to go to sleep , I tell myself , but it ’s because I do n’t have answers .
All I have are my own questions , my own doubts , and my own frail faith .
I just want to tell him a story .
And that , I realize , is always the answer .
“ When you were little and Eric would come over , you would literally jump up and down . ”
“ Remember when he used to pull my socks off halfway ? ”
Sam asks .
“ He loved you so much .
Sometimes even more than himself . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ Because you are an awesome kid and Eric was an awesome guy .
You were great pals . ”
As I say these things I realize this is all I have to know as well .
I do n’t believe Eric exists in some place called heaven , or even that he exists at all in any real way , but I know that he loved Sam and that every time we talk about Eric , he lives in us .
And I can look at Sam the way Eric did .
For a short time - when I experienced some of the most treasured moments I will ever have - Eric and I got to be fathers together .
Together , for a short time , we looked at each other with wonder at the miracle of this little boy .
And one day his love of his uncle would overpower any worries he might carry about the existence of God and heaven .
The BLS reports CPI data for July 2009 :
The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ( CPI - U ) decreased 0.2 percent in July before seasonal adjustment , the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today .
Over the last 12 months the index has fallen 2.1 percent , as a 28.1 percent decline in the energy index since its July 2008 peak has more than offset increases of 0.9 percent in the food index and 1.5 percent in the index for all items less food and energy .
The official price decline over the past 12 months was 2.1 percent .
That alone is unprecedented as far as I can tell .
But let ’s , as always , approximate real price declines :
Looking at the detailed table , one can see that owner ’s equivalent rent ( OER ) went up by 1.7 % .
If we want to calculate the True CPI , we have to replace OER with the Case Shiller home price index , which most recently dropped by 16.8 % over the year .
If we do this , we get an overall price decline from 1 Year ago of 6.6 % .
( Last month ’s release yielded a real price decline of 6.4 % )
Not only are prices falling , they are falling at an accelerating pace .
This a corollary effect of deflation , plain and simple .
Some investors say we should expect inflation soon .
Some expect it somewhere down the road and that it will me rampant .
Most of them do n’t dare use the D word , even though by all unconventional AND unconventional measures we are in the very midst of a massive deflation , not based on prices alone , most definitely not based on money supply alone , but first and foremost due to an ongoing and likely long lasting credit contraction :
Click on image to enlarge .
Since the peak in October 2008 , total credit and loans / leases outstanding have fallen by $ 725 billion , a 4.3 % drop .
And this does n’t even take into account the decline in outstanding bond prices and unfunded liabilities .
It is , indeed , tough to ascertain whether there is a decline in the net present value of unfunded liabilities .
Thus we shall ignore them for now .
However , bond prices have definitely declined across the board .
If we conservatively assume , for the sake of simplicity , that those bonds have contracted by about the same percentage since October 2008 , this would give us a total credit contraction of around $ 2.15 trillion since the peak .
[ smartads ]
On top of that , I do n’t think that people are oblivious to the fact that there is absolutely no way that all social security and medicare benefits will ever be paid .
Thus it would only be reasonable to conservatively assume that the present value of those liabilities has dropped by the same amount .
This would almost double the total contraction to $ 4 trillion .
It is , on top of that , rather questionable whether all this credit is marked to market .
I would say that all this number gives us at the moment is at the low end of the range .
Meanwhile , the true money supply since then has grown by merely $ 170 billion .
Why is this so important ?
Because it shows us the magnitude of the deflation that we are in right now , a deflation with all its consequences on home prices , consumer prices , interest rates , and stock prices .
And it gives us a solid foundation to understand why various investors and maintream journalists who continue to expect , fear , or hope for inflation anytime soon are way off base and will be proven wrong in the long run .
As far as a general mid-term trend one can expect based on this data , as far as certain asset classes are concerned :
Bullish : Treasurys , Dollar , Gold , ( maybe ) Silver
Bearish : Stocks , Corporate Bonds , Foreign Currencies ( except for the Yen maybe ) , Soft Commodities

Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together , leaving to brew for a few minutes , then depressing the plunger to trap the coffee grounds at the bottom of the beaker .
Making coffee via French press is more art than science .
There are a few fundamentals to follow , but beyond that , everyone 's got their own " recipe . "
And that makes it interesting .
The personalization of my morning cup of coffee is part of the fun of using a French press .

If you want to add a little jolt to your caffeine - enjoyment , check out the French press .
It 's fairly cheap , produces rich and delicious coffee , and it's not that complicated .
Here are step - by - step instructions and tips for getting the most enjoyment out of a cup of French pressed coffee .
How to Use a French Press : Step - by - Step
( Thanks to kpwerker for the awesome French press photo set that inspired this post .
I can almost smell that coffee ! )
1 . Use water that is slightly cooler than boiling .
Bring water to a boil , then wait a minute or two .
Or cool the boiling water with a shot of cool or cold water .
Use fresh water that has not been boiled before for the best taste .
The reason is because the water we drink ( from the tap or bottle ) has been aerated and has dissolved gases that make the water taste better .
Boiling removes the gases and leaves a " flat " taste .
( I 'm not 100 % convinced of this and am usually too lazy to empty the electric kettle of previously - boiled water .
But this advice has been handed down for generations , is often quoted by tea and coffee connoisseurs , and the explanation sounds reasonable . )
Tip :
Put a bit of hot water in the empty French press to warm it up .
You 'll end up with a hotter final cup .
2. Grind your own coffee beans .
Freshly ground coffee is easily 10 times better than pre-ground coffee .
Even non-connoisseurs will instantly notice the significant difference in aroma , flavor and overall awesomeness of the cup of coffee .
Tip :
For the best taste , freshly ground coffee is more important than having perfectly sized grounds .
So if the cost of a burr grinder is prohibitive , choose to buy whole beans and grind at home with a cheap blade grinder versus buying pre-ground coffee .
( See also : Best Coffee Grinders )
3 . Use a coarse grind .
You want uniform large pieces so the grinds do n't slip through the mesh filter .
But the grind should n't be so large that you can't extract most of the goodness , making for weak bland coffee .
Tip : Adjust the strength of your brew by adjusting your grind size .
I like my coffee strong , so I aim for a finer grind that is just large enough for the mesh .
4 . Use 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for every 1 cup of water .
The rule of thumb is for each 8 oz water ( 1 cup ) , use 2 tablespoons coffee .
You can add more or less , depending on how strong you like your coffee .
( I like it stronger , so I 'll go 2.5 or 3 tablespoons for every cup of water . )
If you want to get really nerdy about measurements , check out this chart of coffee to water ratios from The Black Bear Micro Roastery .
5 . Pour , stir , cover .
Pour water evenly over grounds and stir to make sure the hot water gets to every bit .
Stir to make sure all the grounds are immersed in the water and to help with the extraction of the delicious oils and compounds .
Tips :
A chopstick is great for stirring .
Try to avoid using a metal spoon as it causes microcracks in the glass of the French press and increases the chance it will shatter .
When you cover the French press for steeping , do n't let the filter touch the brew to prevent cooling it more than necessary .
6 . Steep for 4 minutes .
Four minutes is the standard number that gets thrown around .
For a stronger brew , steep for as much as 10 minutes .
For the small 3 - 4 cup ( 12 - 16 oz ) French presses , you can get away with 2 minutes of steeping .
Some folks really like the no steep time method .
This is the method recommended by French press maker Illy .
This produces a much less bitter cup of coffee .
To get the same kick as a longer steep but without the added bitterness , you can use more ground coffee .
Try these variations and see which one you like best :
Extra dark : Steep 10 minutes .
Steep 10 minutes .
Standard : Steep 4 minutes .
Steep 4 minutes .
Short steep : : Steep for 30 - 60 seconds .
: Steep for 30 - 60 seconds .
No steep : Plunge immediately after stirring .
7 . Press down on the plunger evenly and slowly .
Keep the plunger straight vertically , or else grounds will slip through the sides of the filter .
Press down slowly — just using the weight of your hand and arm for pressure — to minimize stirring up the dust or forcing tiny grinds through the mesh filter .
8. Pour and enjoy !
I 'll leave a bit of water in the French press to minimize the coffee dust in the cup .
Even with my crappy blade grinder , I get a fairly sludge - free cup of coffee .
Mmm ... dark , delicious coffee .
9 . Wash the French press .
Clean the press pot well .
It makes a difference in taste because droplets of oil from the coffee can go rancid and ruin your next cup .
Hardware Notes
French Press
Bodum is by far the largest press pot company in the world .
If you go to Target looking to buy a French press , 9 out of 10 choices will be by Bodum .
Coffee Geek gives us a quick lesson in press pot history :
Bodum is probably more responsible for the common day occurrence of the press pot than any other company .
In the seventies , they started introducing their whacked out colours in their plastic , metal and glass press pots .
In the 1980s , fueled by their profits , they bought lines like Chambord and brought out more classical - look press pots .
The rest is , as they say , history .
French presses come in a variety of sizes , from single - serving 12 oz ( 3 cup ) models up to monstrous 48 oz ( 12 cup ) ones .
Get a larger one than you think you will need .
About 10 - 20 % of the space will be " wasted " with grounds and unpoured water .
The glass Bodum press pots , especially the Chambord line , are ubiquitous .
But you have other choices as well .
Bonjour is another popular brand .
And there are unbreakable models that are worth a look .
( I 've broken more than one glass French press .
It especially sucks when there 's hot coffee in it when it falls off the counter and shatters . )
Buying tip :
When you see " cups " in product descriptions , they do n't mean the standard unit of measurement of 8 fluid ounces .
They mean little coffee cups ( Tasse à café ) that are typically 4 oz .
Coffee Grinder
There are two kinds of coffee grinders : blade and burr .
Blade grinders are much cheaper ( around $ 20 - 30 ) but produce " dust to boulder " sized pieces of coffee .
They also do n't have size settings — the longer you grind , the smaller the pieces — so you 'll have to learn how long to grind through trial and error ( and be consistent ) .
Serious French pressers only use burr grinders .
( Wise Bread Pick : Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder at Amazon )
Coffee geek explains why best :
With a press pot , particle size of the grounds is as important as it is for espresso .
The difference is , you want uniform large particles , instead of uniform tiny particles .
Cheap grinders can't give you either — they will give you a mixed bag of big and small chunks .
Dust and boulders .
It 's what leads to the thing people dislike most about press pot coffee — the sludge .
When he says cheap grinders , he 's talking about blade grinders versus their more expensive burr grinder cousins .
To get a uniform grind , you 'll need to use a burr grinder .
But blade grinders are far cheaper ( the coffee grounds still make a cup of joe , so you 'll have to weigh the pros against your budget ) .
Tips From Commenters
UPDATE :
There are some great tips and notes from commenters below I want to highlight :
Pour out the brewed coffee into a carafe if you 're not going to drink it right away .
Do n't leave it in the French press or else it will get really strong and bitter .
— Mike from Daily Shot of Coffee
Add a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg to the coffee grounds to spice things up .
— Guest
The French press is great for its portability !
Perfect for camping because you only have one item ( the press pot ) and no need for electricity .
— Myscha Theriault
The whole thing can go in the dishwasher !
Also , non-Bodum brands ( like one from Ikea ) could be significantly cheaper .
— Chris

( CNN ) --
Severe turbulence shook a Continental Airlines flight Monday , injuring dozens of passengers and forcing the aircraft to divert to Miami , Florida , according to the airline and a fire official .
Oxygen masks hang from a damaged part of the plane Monday , in a photo by passenger Camila Machado .
There were 168 passengers and 11 crew members on Flight 128 , which was heading from Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , to Houston , Texas , according to a statement from Continental Airlines .
" I 've never seen turbulence like that , so I really thought we would n't make it , " passenger Giovani Loss told CNN affiliate WSVN - TV .
Loss , who is originally from Brazil , said he is a lawyer in the United States and frequently travels between the two countries .
He said passengers were afraid the turbulence may have been the result of mechanical problems with the plane .
" People [ were ] screaming , then there was a huge silence for like 30 minutes , " Loss said .
Ambulances and other vehicles were lined up on the runway to treat and transport the injured passengers when the plane landed at Miami International Airport at 5:35 a.m .
Watch passengers describe what happened »
" People that were n't seat belted in flew up and hit the ceilings , " passenger John Norwood told WSVN .
" So their faces , their heads hit the plastics and broke all the plastics up top . "
Continental said seven passengers were transported to nearby hospitals , and approximately 28 other passengers were treated at the scene .
Lt. Elkin Sierra of the Miami - Dade Fire Department said 26 passengers were injured , including four seriously .
The Boeing 767-200 hit turbulence about 50 miles north of the Dominican Republic at about 38,000 feet , according to an official with the Federal Aviation Administration .
It landed in Miami an hour later with its seat belt signs illuminated , the airline said .
Many of the passengers said they did not hear any warning before the turbulence hit .
Injuries received included bumps , bruises , neck pain and back pain , Sierra said .
Passengers said they saw several people bleeding from their heads , including one woman who sustained a serious gash to her head .
The flight is scheduled to depart Miami for Houston later in the morning , according to Continental 's Web site .
It had been scheduled to arrive in Houston at 6 a.m. local time .

CAIRO 
An important group of religious leaders in Iran called the disputed presidential election and the new government illegitimate on Saturday , an act of defiance against the country ’s supreme leader and the most public sign of a major split in the country ’s clerical establishment .
A statement by the group , the Association of Researchers and Teachers of Qum , represents a significant , if so far symbolic , setback for the government and especially the authority of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whose word is supposed to be final .
The government has tried to paint the opposition and its top presidential candidate , Mir Hussein Moussavi , as criminals and traitors , a strategy that now becomes more difficult .
“ This crack in the clerical establishment , and the fact they are siding with the people and Moussavi , in my view is the most historic crack in the 30 years of the Islamic republic , ” said Abbas Milani , director of the Iranian Studies Program at Stanford University .
“ Remember , they are going against an election verified and sanctified by Khamenei . ”
The announcement came on a day when Mr. Moussavi released documents detailing a campaign of fraud by the current president ’s supporters , and as a close associate of the supreme leader called Mr. Moussavi and former President Mohammad Khatami “ foreign agents , ” saying they should be treated as criminals .
Two long - time peace and anti-nuclear activists have brought their nonviolent protest and resistance to the U.S. - Mexico border .
John Heid , a Quaker with Christian Peacemaker Teams , and Fr. Jerry Zawada , a Franciscan priest , were arrested on trespassing charges as they prayed and offered repentance for the thousands of migrant deaths that are the consequences of an increasingly militarized border .
In a prepared statement , Heid and Zawada announced their intentions :
On this , the 64th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima , Japan , we call for an end to militarization in all its guises .
An end to bombs , nuclear and conventional .
An end to the use of Drones ( unmanned aerial vehicles ) .
An end to walls , fences and their virtual counterparts that divide us and promote fear of each other .
An end to war without end .
This morning we vigil at the gates of Davis - Monthan Air Force Base , home of a Predator UAV unit which now flies missions around the clock in Iraq and Afghanistan armed with Hellfire missiles which have killed hundreds of unarmed civilians .
We demand an end to the unilateral slaughter .
This afternoon we vigil at a communication tower , “ Tucson - 1 ” ( virtual fence ) construction sight .
Fences and walls , solid and virtual , have funneled people in migration deeper into the harsh , dangerous terrain of the Sonoran desert , resulting in more than 5,000 deaths since 1994 .
These three – bombs , drones and fences / walls – are lethal weapons directed specifically at noncombatants .
Cities like Hiroshima , villages in Iraq and Afghanistan and the U.S. - Mexico borderland have been deliberately targeted and violated .
These are crimes against humanity .
A betrayal of civility .
In spiritual terms , a sin .
“ Today we pray without ceasing for a world without weapons and fences .
We pray for peace , for justice , for unity which makes walls and war obsolete .
The virtual tower that Heid and Zawada were arrested at is part of a larger initiative by U.S. federal authorities to deter migrants from crossing the border .
With physical walls – and in some places double walls – making urban crossings much less likely in places like San Diego , Nogales , and El Paso , the flow of migrants has been channeled into remote places hardly accessible to Border Patrol vehicles .
But with the introduction of these virtual towers , equipped with cameras , video , and radar , authorities are pushing migrants into even more lethal terrain .
Joseph Nevins reports on the escalation of U.S. border enforcement in his book Operation Gatekeeper : The Rise of the “ Illegal Alien ” and the Making of the U.S. - Mexico Boundary .
One scholar at the Scalabrini International Migration Institute , Gioacchino Campese , argues that the deadly U.S. immigration policy is not only immoral but also failing .
In his essay “ Cuantos Mas ” ( from A Promised Land , a Perilous Journey : Theological Perspectives on Migration ) Campese writes :
After more than ten years since the implementation of the new border strategy , the results have been mostly negative : the federal government has spent billions of dollars in taxpayers ’ money ; because of border enforcement the smugglers ’ industry has boomed to the point of becoming basically indispensable ; the violation of human rights of immmigrants continues unabated ; there is no real proof that this strategy has substantially reduced “ illegal ” immigration in the USA ; the border build - up , rather than deterring undocumented immigrants from entering the USA , discourages them from returning home ; and , most tragically , the number of immigrants dying at the border has simply skyrocketed .
To deal with this latter problem the Border Patrol launched in 1998 – five years after the El Paso experiment [ Operation Hold the Line ] – search - and - rescue operations to help immigrants stranded in the deserts and mountains of the border region .
But despite these efforts the number of deaths continues to rise because of the strategy itself – the rerouting of the immigrants towards the most dangerous terrains – that is causing these deaths .
The .
U.S. government refuses to take any responsibility for all these casualties , which are considered one of the “ unintended ” consequences of the nation ’s effort to protect its sovereignty .
The “ unintended consequences , ” which are more intentional then many Americans are willing to admit , are the reasons why John Heid and Fr. Jerry Zawada sat in prayer at the virtual tower surveillance site .
The site they visited is only one of seventeen towers in a 23 - mile stretch of the border surrounding Sasabe .
The two men , long - time friends through the Catholic Worker and Plowshares movement , have moved their lives and work to the U.S. - Mexico border south of Tucson .
Both are members of the No More Deaths community , whose humanitarian efforts have saved thousands of lives in the harsh terrain of the Sonoran desert .
The phrase , bending the stick , is often used to describe Lenin ‘s organisational method .
Lenin bent the stick or used exaggeration in order to grab attention .
The single - minded focus on what really mattered .
For many Leninist ’s , he might have bent the stick too far in some circumstances , but he always bent it back or corrected his mistake in the long run .
This was the infallible Lenin who embodied the actuality of the revolution .
Even so , a twisted stick can distort reality .
Also , the bent stick analogy is also used to suggest continuity where inconsistency exists .
Lenin ’s polemic against the so - called Economists in What is to be Done ( WITBD ) resulted in a concept of the relationship between organisation and class which bent Marxist theory .
According to Lenin : “ the history of all countries shows that the working class , exclusively by its own efforts is able to develop only trade - union consciousness . ”
Therefore , “ there can be no talk of an independent ideology formulated by the workers themselves .
Socialist consciousness is introduced into the proletarian struggle from without . ” [ 1 ]
This was , as Trotsky stated at the time absurd .
The historical facts are that the mass strikes of the Russian workers from 1896 to 1905 confirmed workers spontaneously went beyond trade union consciousness , as they did in the earlier Chartist movement in Britain .
Lenin ’s formulations were an aspect of his political imagination .
Lenin exaggerated the influence of Economism and saw Economism where it did not exist .
The reality was that Akimov and his Rebochee Dyelo comrades were not economists .
In words and deeds , they had opposed leaving the political struggle to the Liberals .
In fact , Lenin saw them as rival leaders .
So a factional war with false polemics was waged against them .
Zinoviev , Lenin ’s Bolshevik spokesman , claimed that “ Akimov told workers to know their place and not concern themselves with politics . ” [ 2 ]
This claim was entirely false .
The view of Marx was that the emancipation of the working class is an act of the working class itself .
If socialist consciousness derives from the intellectuals , and the spontaneous class struggle against exploitation is simply trade unionism , then little is left of this conviction of Marx expressed in a letter to Bolt , in November 1871 : “ the political movement of the working class has its ultimate objective , of course , the conquest of power by the working class developed up to a certain point and rising precisely from its economic struggles . ” [ 3 ]
A one - sided focus on the politics of the expected bourgeois revolution , which was a mistaken perspective , caused Lenin to downgrade the workers ’ class struggle rooted in their material conditions .
Lenin had previously argued that socialist conscious could develop through economic struggle .
The organisation was to be rooted in the factories where the industrial workers were most susceptible to Social Democratic ideas . [ 4 ]
The political struggle was not outside the economic struggle .
Rosa Luxemburg ’s intricate analysis of the Russian mass strikes showed the strikes , “ passed from the economic field to the political so that it was almost impossible to draw a dividing line between them . ” [ 5 ]
The economic and political factors were interwoven .
Trotsky mocked Lenin ’s short - term instrumental use of theory in WITBD and One Step Forward Two Steps Back .
He wrote , yesterday the proletariat were crawling in the trade union dust ; today the workers are raised to the role of teachers , instructing the intelligentsia in working class discipline .
Yesterday the intelligentsia was the teacher of socialist consciousness ; today it is a pupil learning factory discipline .
“ And this is supposed to be Marxism . ” [ 6 ]
The task of Marxists was to replace factory discipline not glorify it .
A communist organisation is created in the process of class struggle .
Marxists are not outside , but internal to the movement of workers .
Luxemburg criticised Lenin for making a fetish of centralism : “ The ultra - centralism that Lenin advocated , was imbued not with a creative spirit , but with the sterile spirit of the overseer . ” [ 7 ]
The Leninist central committee would think for every member of the organisation down to the smallest detail or in Trotsky ‘s sarcastic words “ I am recognised by the central committee therefore I am . ” [ 8 ]
However , the working class must learn from its own mistakes .
There is no other way .
Lenin ’s response to these criticisms was defensive : “ Comrade Luxemburg says for example that my book is a clear and detailed expression of intransigent centralism .
Comrade Luxemburg thus supposes that I defend one system against another .
But actually this is not so .
From the first to the last page of my book , I defend the elementary principles of any conceivable system of organisation . ” [ 9 ]
Lenin ’s concept of the party was technical rather than political .
Lenin was an advocate in this period of bureaucracy rather than democracy because it saw it as effective in Russian conditions .
In Marcel Leibman ’s opinion , Lenin ’s letter to a comrade on organisational tasks , written in 1904 , assumed all power would reside in executive bodies .
There was no account of the requirements of democracy . ” [ 10 ]
In One Step Forward Two steps Back , Lenin disregarded the issue of the degree of centralism .
It was centralism , centralism , centralism .
Democracy was dismissed : it was a mere toy .
To open up the party to publicity and elections was to open up the organisation to arrests and detention .
Nonetheless , this one - sided stress on centralism did not answer points about lesser forms of democracy such as local autonomy .
Besides centralism is not an organisational form which necessarily keeps out the police .
It can make an organisation more vulnerable if the central committee is penetrated by a state agent , as the Bolshevik central committee was by Malinovsky .
In any case , the Bolshevik underground organisation was not very effective in keeping out the police .
And even if ultra-centralism was necessary , why make a virtue of it ?
It is a myth that Menshevism and Bolshevism were fully formed political tendencies at the time of the split following the 1903 congress .
There were no programmatic differences .
Nor was it a break between revolutionaries on one side and opportunists on the other .
On Lenin ’s side was Plekhanov who would go on to oppose the Moscow insurrection of 1905 and the revolution of 1917 .
Against Lenin was Trotsky the leader of the Soviets in 1905 and 1917 .
The Mensheviks accepted Lenin ’s rule on membership at the unity congress in 1906 .
So this rule was not a life and death question as Lenin admitted .
Lenin went on in isolation to break organisational rules and set up his own central committee against the Bolshevik central committee but described his opponents as individualistic intellectuals .
Lenin ’s concept of a political organisation was strongly influenced by the model of German social democracy , with a heavy stress on the role of leaders at the top of the organisation .
“ Without a dozen tried and talented leaders professionally trained , schooled by long experience and working in perfect harmony , no class in society can wage a determined struggle . ” [ 11 ]
Lenin ’s political machine – predominantly made up of the intelligentsia- was left behind by the creative spontaneity of the Russian workers in the revolution of 1905 .
The Bolshevik leadership in Russia trained in the organisational concepts of WITBD , and One step forward , distrusted spontaneity , were suspicious of strikers and saw the St Petersburg soviet and non-party mass organisations as a rival to the Bolshevik organisation .
Lenin was compelled to attempt to re-educate and reorganise the Bolsheviks to correct his previous distorted view of the relationship between party and class .
“ Lenin was essentially forced to rehabilitate working class spontaneity as a politically important factor of revolution . ” [ 12 ]
But there was no repudiation of previous positions or self - criticism .
Contrary to WITBD workers were instinctively spontaneously social democratic .
Although he added that more than ten years work by social democrats had helped transform spontaneity into consciousness .
He said that he had not intended to give his previous formulations a programmatic status .
Lenin is often seen as separate from other Bolshevik leaders if he had no responsibility for their organisational methods .
Writing in exile in the 1930’s , and trapped in the cult of Lenin , Trotsky described Lenin as a political genius .
Lenin was not so much the machine as the workers in motion .
Yet in 1905 it was Trotsky who had an organic connection with the self - activity of the masses .
Trotsky was one of the first exiles back in Russia to lead the St Petersburg soviet .
By contrast , Lenin ’s less positive relationship with spontaneity resulted in ten months delays in a return to Russia following the outbreak of the revolution .
Following the 1905 revolution , Trotsky described Lenin ’s perspective of dissolving the class struggle into a democratic coalition in a bourgeois republic as hopelessly idealistic . [ 13 ]
For Lenin , politics is an endless chain , but “ the whole art of politics lies in finding and taking a firm grip as we can of the link that is least likely to be struck from our hands , the one that is most important at any given moment . ” [ 14 ]
The problem with this method , as we have seen , is short - termism , inconsistency , and a lopsided view of reality .
Part of the Marxist truth is not the Marxist truth .
As Alan Woods puts it “ it is about the demands of the moment rather than abstract theory . ” [ 15 ]
So for Lenin , a general Marxist truth in some circumstances was the wrong priority .
This flexibility towards Marxist theory was a hallmark of Bolshevism .

Most of us know the sad and destructive history of former widespread pesticide DDT ( dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane for you chemists ) .
It ’s egg shell thining properties have famously taken out many a generation of bald eagle , as well as many other bird species .
The once heralded solution to malaria , DDT was sprayed everywhere without a thought .
This attitude of pesticide being “ a - ok ” lasted into the 1980 ’s , and lead to this most hilarious and sad poster ( seen above ) of two attractive young ladies having a pesticide fight .
Try suggesting that one these days as a fun game for the whole family .
When environmental and health concerns were raised in the scientific community , an out cry called for the banning of DDT , and in 1972 the ban went into effect .
Unfortunately for all of us , the half life of DDT is 30 years .
So for those of us scoring at home , there is still almost half the DDT left floating around in our environment that was sprayed the year of the ban… 37 years ago !
I , perhaps like some of you , have heard of studies linking DDT with cancer .
For many years DDT has been linked with many different types of cancer .
The notion that DDT can cause cancer is well published and seems to have sunk into the public ’s consciousness as just common knowledge .
If nothing else , I think we all associate pesticide as something we do n’t want to be sprayed all over our bodies .
New studies are bringing to light a new health detriment that has not been well publicized .
There is mounting evidence that DDT is linked to diabetes .
New research out of the great lakes area has shown that high levels of the DDT led to a 38 % higher chance of developing diabetes .
As GreenOption ’s resident medical student , I can tell you diabetes has become a very large problem in the United States.
23 million people in the United States suffer from diabetes .
Diabetics cannot produce ( type I ) or use enough ( type II ) insulin , a hormone that allows glucose ( the body ’s fuel ) to enter cells .
The exact mechanism is still unknown , and the study did not differentiate between type I and type II diabetes .
Obviously more research will be needed to nail down the exact link between DDT and diabetes .
I just hope we can all use our past mistakes as a cautionary tale .
Let us not put substances into the environment without , at the very least , understanding all of the consequences .
37 years after the spraying of a once praised pesticide , humans and other animals are still paying the price .

Update : Link to the study in .pdf format from the University of Albany : Environmental Contaminants as Risk Factors for Developing Diabetes
A new study out from the University of Hertforshire discovers the obvious : kids know that piracy is illegal , but they do it anyway .
Only one music service can make them go legit : something that provides unlimited , permanent downloads , not just online streams .
So why are such services so slow to get off the ground ?
Appetite for destruction lots of songs
Kids in the UK certainly keep plenty of music on their personal machines .
The survey found that the average user has 17 days ' worth of music , and given that appetite for volume , it 's no surprise that unlimited download models are popular .
What 's more surprising is that streaming , which would seem to offer similar benefits , is n't a compelling for - pay proposition among the the young .
UK Music , which paid for the survey , has made both detailed results and a summary of the research available .
All told , over 1,800 individuals answered questions , and follow - up interviews were performed with a number of them .
The participants are frequently broken down into two groups ( 14 - 18 and 19 - 24 ) to get a sense for how aging affects the answers .
The data was pretty clear on a number of points .
For one , the CD is n't going away ; over three quarters of those surveyed said they would continue to buy CDs even if they had access to their ideal download service , and the number of CDs owned actually rose in the last year .
There were a variety of reasons for this popularity , from the extras that come with a CD to a sense that it more directly supports the band , but a full 44 percent noted that there was no way a CD could be deleted or deactivated remotely , suggesting that users are very much aware of the cases where companies have planned to pull the plug on DRM servers .
A step down in the musical hierarchy of needs brings us to permanent downloads .
These are n't viewed as positively as CDs , but listeners were willing to pay for guaranteed sound quality and freedom from malware .
iTunes rules the roost here , with Amazon 's service and the local Tesco Digital attracting a bit of attention .
In what 's obviously bad news for music streaming services , piracy was the next most popular option .
Users want a sense of ownership when it comes to their music , and they want guaranteed access to it .
Access to streaming services away from the home was simply considered too unreliable to be a viable option .
When at the computer , the survey population did do some streaming , but it largely did so via established social sites , like YouTube and MySpace , rather than a dedicated streaming service like Spotify or Last. fm .
Over half of respondents said they would continue to pirate even if they were paying for a streaming service , simply because of the appeal of ownership .
Piracy in general remains very common with this group .
They use Limewire to grab singles and some form of BitTorrent for whole albums , but also do a lot of unstructured file sharing , using techniques like swapping commercial CDs , transferring files via Bluetooth and USB flash drives , and using software that extracts the sound track from YouTube videos .
They generally know it 's wrong , although they have a very confused view of both the legal reasons for that and the legal campaigns against piracy — in general , they feel that since everyone 's doing it , the chances of personally winding up on the wrong end of a court case is minimal .
It 's not hard to do the math on the motivation for piracy .
The average music collection is now over 8,000 tracks , all stored on a computer and parceled out to iPods and cell phones .
The vast majority of the survey population spends less than � 100 a month on entertainment , and only a quarter of that on music , some of which goes to live performances .
There 's simply no way of creating a collection of that size on that budget , yet people seem to feel they need the tunes — hence , piracy .
So far , the music industry has largely focused on increasing the deterrents to file sharing , although some artists have found a way to use music sharing as a way of increasing sales , either of their music or related goods , like concert tickets and logo - bearing gear .
But the survey shows that users are ready to pay a monthly fee for the equivalent of what they can get via piracy : unlimited downloads of music that they permanently own .
A full 85 percent of those surveyed said they 're willing to pay for this , and over half said they would stop pirating .
There are some indications that the music business may be ready to give this a try , such as the Choruss program for college campuses and the unlimited download service being readied by the Isle of Man .
Some ISPs also hope to get into the game , offering customers access to unlimited music on local servers as part of their monthly Internet bill .
But the fact that these are only the first , sporadic attempts to give consumers what they actually want suggests that the music business is still in a period of painful transition .
NASA held a press conference today about early scientific results from the Kepler space telescope , a mission designed to detect Earthlike planets orbiting distant stars .
Kepler has not yet detected such a planet -- that will take at least a couple of years to do -- but the good news is that Kepler works !
New results show that should they exist , Kepler has the ability to find such planets .
How do we know ?
Kepler stares at a single spot in the sky , taking many many measurements of the brightnesses of about 100,000 stars all at once .
If a planet is circling one of those stars , and its orbit is edge - on to us , then once every orbit the planet passes directly between us and the star .
This is like an eclipse , and the light we see from the star drops a little bit .
A planet like Jupiter orbiting a star like the Sun will cause a 1 % drop in the light we see , because Jupiter has a radius 1/10th of the Sun's , so the surface area of the planet is 1 % of that of the star ( remember , area = π x the radius squared , so 1/10 x 1/10 = 1/100 or 1 % ) .
Therefore the planet blocks 1 % of the star 's surface , and we see the corresponding drop in starlight .
Earth is smaller than Jupiter , about 1/10th the radius .
That means that an Earth orbiting a star blocks 1/10,000th the light of the star , or 0.01 % .
That 's a tiny fraction !
From the ground , that 's impossible to measure due to fluctuations in Earth 's atmosphere changing the amount of light we see from the star .
But from space -- hey , that 's where Kepler is ! -- we can make far more accurate measurements .
And that 's what the news is from Kepler .
As a test of its abilities , it observed the star known as HAT - P - 7 , which is known to have a roughly Jupiter - sized world orbiting it every 2.2 days .
This planet , called HAT - P - 7 b , is far too close to the star to be seen directly , but every time it passes in front of the star , the light we see drops .
Here 's what Kepler saw after observing this system for 10 days :
The top plot shows the data as the planet circles the star .
The big dip is due to the planet blocking a fraction of the star 's light .
The depth of that dip tells us how much of the star was blocked , and therefore the size of the planet .
But look along the plot a little bit to the right : see that fainter dip ( right under the i in " Magnification " ) ?
What 's that ?
The bottom plot is the same thing but zoomed in to see more detail .
That second dip is a lot more obvious .
It 's not another planet blocking starlight , which is what you might first guess .
It 's actually the light from the planet being blocked by the star !
The planet is reflecting light from the star , just like the Moon reflects sunlight , allowing us to see it .
When the planet passes behind the star , we do n't see that light anymore , so the total light from the system drops a wee bit .
It 's not much , and totally impossible to see from the ground , but Kepler was able to spot it .
And that 's critical , because it turns out this dip is about the same thing we'd expect to see if a planet the size of the Earth were to pass in front of the star .
In other words , the drop in light from a giant planet going behind its star is about the same as we'd expect from a smaller planet passing in front of the star .
The fact that Kepler spied this dip at all means that , if somewhere out there an Earthlike world is orbiting a star , Kepler will be able to detect it !
Incredible .
Another cool thing is in that data too .
See how the light slowly rises and drops over time ?
We 're actually detecting the phases of the planet as it orbits the star !
As the Moon orbits the Earth , we see it going from mostly dark ( new Moon ) to half lit to full , getting brighter over two weeks .
Then once it 's past full we see more and more unlit surface , so it appears to dim over time .
The same thing is happening to the planet HAT - P - 7b as it orbits the star .
Right after the eclipse event we are seeing it as " new " , with the dark side facing us .
As it orbits , we see more and more lit up , until it passes behind the star .
After that secondary eclipse , we see the light from the planet get dimmer .
The Kepler website has a great animation showing this , which I also uploaded to YouTube :
What this means is that the Kepler data are showing us the phases of an unseen planet orbiting a star more than a thousand light years away !
There is some bad news , sadly : if we want to find an actual Earthlike planet we have to be patient .
It takes the Earth a year to orbit the Sun , right ?
So suppose we see a small dip in the light from some star that indicates a planet the size of the Earth is orbiting it .
To confirm that , we'd have to wait a year to see that dip again !
And even that 's not enough , since we do n't know beforehand how long the orbital period of the planet is .
That second dip might be from sunspots , or another planet , or something else entirely .
So we have to wait again , and spot the dip a third time .
If the time interval between the two dips is the same , then we can be pretty sure we 're seeing a small planet eclipsing ( actually , the correct word is transiting ) its star .
In general the orbit could be days long , as it is for HAT - P - 7 b , or it might take months or even a year .
And remember the real prize here is to find a planet like Earth , which means an orbit that takes months or more .
So we really wo n't have those kinds of results from Kepler for a while yet .
It 's only been up and observing for a few weeks .
But come 2011 or 2012 , and we may have our answer .
Imagine !
In just two years we may know if other Earthlike planets are orbiting stars in our galaxy !
Most astronomers , including me , assume that these planets exist , but it 'll be incredible to have the actual data .
And better , Kepler is looking at so many stars that we 'll get actual statistics for these planets .
We 'll be able to guess just how many such planets exist !
Are we a rare specimen , or are there millions of Earths out there in the galaxy ?
At this moment , this exact moment in history , the Earth is a lone habitable rock orbiting one star in the depths of space .
But in just two more of our own orbits , we may suddenly find ourselves located in a planetary metropolis studded with vast numbers of worlds , all of which were just waiting to be found .

The Associated Press has apparently jumped the shark .
In a headlong rush to protect their business model from the Future , the Associated Press has in the past year launched lawsuits against bloggers for posting the full text or excerpts of their articles without advance permission , against Shepherd Fairey for being inspired by an image of Barack Obama that was published by the Associated Press ( though the photographer who took the photo alleges he was not an employee of the Associated Press and thus has independent rights to the photo ) , and against news aggregators for posting the titles and first sentence of Associated Press stories .
Clearly , the Associated Press feels under siege .
So , at some point Associated Press has launched what I think is the most pervasive use of iCopyright by a major news organization .
While a normal web page offers you buttons to format for printing , embedding , emailing , or social bookmarking a news story , if you click on the equivalent link on an ap.org news story , it launches its iCopyright page .
( Given its wariness about this scary web , its of little surprise that the page offers no social bookmarking links . )
For example , here ’s the range of options I found on an article entitled “ Obama challenges GOP critics on health care . ”
Under “ Post , ” it does offer is a handy way to embed the article on your site – or a portion of the article .
Now , I can understand the AP wanting some way to make money off of embedding a whole article on your site – or objecting to people doing so .
This undeniably detracts from their revenues .
But I love the fact that they expect people to pay $ 12.95 to embed an EXCERPT of one of their articles .
Then at the bottom of the page , it warns you against piracy .
The Associated Press seems to be asserting that Fair Use does not exist at all !
But this is where they really jumped the shark .
They offer to allow you to email the article to “ 6 or more recipients ” for a fee .
Seriously :
I ’m a bit surprised that the Associated Press does not have a section on who is allowed to link to their site or this article – demanding some form of payment for incoming links .

Journalists are pretty good at working the scene of a disaster .
They ’ll tell you what happened , who did it , and why .
But when it comes to the disaster engulfing their own profession , their analysis is less rigorous .
An uncharacteristic haze characterizes a lot of the reporting and commentary on the current crisis of the industry .
It could have been brought on by delicacy , perhaps romanticism .
And since it is not just any crisis , but a definitive one — one that seems to mean an end to the physical papers ’ role in American life as we have come to know it — perhaps there ’s a little bit of shell - shock in the mix as well .
Whatever the reasons , I can think of five key aspects of the industry collapse that do n’t get talked about much .
Most of my perspective on the daily newspaper industry comes as a critic , generally safely ensconced in the alternative press , blithely taking for granted the local papers ’ triumphs and charting their mistakes and oversights .
Along the way I ’ve tried both to remember and acknowledge that this was easy work ; coming down after the battle , as the saying goes , and shooting the wounded .
That said , I ’ve also spent a fair amount of time at dailies .
I worked my way through college as a reporter at a local daily — and watched as the family - owned chain it was part of founder and finally shutter during my senior year .
I ’ve freelanced , off and on , for dailies , and spent a year on staff at one , too .
And I ’ve worked as an editor at institutions emblematic of the New Media and the Old .
The issues I delineate below I think are by far the central , salient facts about the vaporization of the daily newspaper industry .
But too often they are elided or ignored .
After 30 years in the industry , I know enough to know I do n’t know what it should be doing .
But if we ’re talking about the state of the industry , and we ’re not acknowledging the issues below , we ’re not fully looking at the roots of the problem .
And if the media does n’t understand the issues that have actually put it into the precarious position it ’s in , how can it survive ?
1. Consumers do n’t pay for news .
They have never paid for news .
The problem of the daily press in the U.S. is exclusively this : the collapse of its business model .
That model used to be , plainly put , making money — a lot of money , oceans of money — delivering advertising on newsprint into peoples ’ homes .
Subscribers did n’t pay for news .
Advertisers did .
Remember “ shoppers , ” the poorly designed throwaway publications filled with tacky little ads ?
Daily newspapers are high - end shoppers .
They spent a lot of money on original content to class up the operation and give people a reason to ask for the ads to be delivered .
Long before the web displayed the power and leverage of critical mass , newspapers benefited from it ; once you got the franchise in your particular locale , you tried not to stir up trouble , because it just distracted you from time better spent cashing checks .
Some people liked the news , sure ; most thought they were paying for it .
And some papers spent more money on news than they had to .
But the papers were n’t selling the news .
They were selling ads and charging a lot of money for them because of one thing only :
They held an informal monopoly on a societal convention whereby they deposited those ads — around which they wrapped some reporting , some of it serious , some of it fluff — on subscribers ’ driveways .
That the model was going to change was obvious for many decades ; even before the Internet age , papers saw their readership grow older , year by year , as longtime subscribers died and were n’t replaced by new , younger ones .
This should have prompted rethinking and change — but it did n’t , really .
Why ?
Because of a quirk in the way the newspaper industry was viewed by investors prevented that .
Wall Street ’s implacable demand for increased returns — ever - improving returns on a traditional net of 20 percent or more — which the papers and their parent companies focused on to the detriment of evolution .
Now , the papers could have used the money they were making to , in essence , buy the future of communications .
Instead , they used it for something else : pleasing Wall Street , and consolidation .
As the parent companies took on more debt , those fabulous returns became not just money to swim around in , but the essential component of the companies ’ day - to - day livelihood — from the perspective of the boardroom , at least .
In other words , the papers were taking their profits and investing in a future not of technological change and institutional challenges , but one defined only by the search for more profits .
What could possibly have gone wrong ?
As I said , I ’ve mostly been a press critic , looking at papers from the outside , a post from which it ’s easy to assign dark motives .
So do n’t take my word for it .
Here ’s Jim Squires , who , as an editor of The Chicago Tribune in the 1990s , got an up - close view of the workings of the Tribune Company :
During the 1980s , the Chicago Tribune , the Orlando Sentinel and the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel were the workhorse profit - makers of the Tribune Company .
Sometimes the Tribune alone contributed 30 percent to 50 percent of the company 's total profits as the broadcast and newsprint holdings faltered .
During the last half of the decade , these newspapers were consistently in the 25 percent to 35 percent range in operating income — profits before depreciation and taxes .
Yet year after year plans for significant editorial investment and circulation promotion to expand their markets and enhance survival were restricted or postponed so the big earnings could fall to the bottom line .
My emphasis .
( More on how they did it in a bit . )
Few paid attention to Squires ’ prescient and merciless analysis in his memoir , Read All About It ! , when it came out in 1993 .
( Tribune was then a fabulously disciplined operation , and not entirely clueless ; it even bought a small early stake in AOL .
But it later bought Times Mirror Co. and got stuck with an unforeseen $ 1 billion tax bill .
Oops .
It is now controlled , of course , by Sam Zell , who put the company $ 11 billion in debt for the privilege of being controlled by Sam Zell . )
It ’s shocking that a fundamental lack of understanding of these aspects of the business has been the basis of some of the most high - profile writing about the state of the industry .
Walter Isaacson was the managing editor of Time and the CEO of CNN ; in a recent cover story for Time on the daily newspaper crisis , he based his argument on the following assertion :
Newspapers and magazines traditionally have had three revenue sources : newsstand sales , subscriptions , and advertising .
The new business model [ i.e. , web publishing ] relies only on the last of these .
That makes for a wobbly stool even when the one leg is strong .
When it weakens , the stool is likely to fall .
Isaacson did n’t provide any figures .
It did n’t occur to him or any of those high - paid Time editors who shepherded his essay into print that the money generated by newspaper subscriptions — $ 5 or $ 6 a week in most cities — could hardly be called a leg on a stool .
Think about it for a moment , and you realize those paltry sums could n’t come close to making up the cost of merely printing a newspaper and then delivering it by hand to a subscriber ’s doorstep seven times during each of those weeks .
Nor can a company make money in 50 - cent increments by sending union employees out in gas - guzzling trucks through gridlocked streets several times a day distributing to hundreds , even thousands , of newspaper boxes over scores , perhaps hundreds , of square miles .
That issue of Time was still on newsstands when the editor of The San Francisco Chronicle , which had been losing $ 1 million a week for years before the current recession hit , was telling his readers that it cost the company $ 10 — 10 dollars — to deliver a Sunday Chronicle to their homes .
He did n’t explain his math , but let ’s give him the benefit of the doubt .
And let ’s say that the smaller average weekday paper costs less , maybe $ 6 , to print and deliver .
In other words , if we can trust his figures , it might cost the Chron at least $ 45 a week just to print and deliver a single subscriber ’s paper .
The paper is currently offering eight weeks ’ delivery to new subscribers for just under $ 8 a week .
Back to Time magazine .
Isaacson ’s logic took him to this assertion :
In an advertising - only revenue model , the incentive is perverse .
It is also self - defeating , because eventually you will weaken your bond with your readers if you do not feel directly dependent upon them for your revenue .
Newspapers will end up producing a lot of sections about gardening and home improvement , which advertisers want , and getting rid of their book review sections , as the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post have done .
Isaacson , thinking he was offering an analysis of the current business situation of newspapers , was actually describing the previous one .
Did n’t newspapers “ end up producing ” sections about gardening and home improvement decades ago ?
As for those book review sections , they were gone as well ; the ones he mentioned were about the last two remaining of the 1400 daily papers in the U.S.
In other words , that “ bond with readers , ” financially speaking , Isaacson talked about never existed .
It was sacrificed to Wall Street .
Those book review sections were early roadkill in the companies ’ drive to cut back content and prop up the industry ’s comically high returns .
Leaving aside the go - go Internet years , newspaper staffs have grown ineluctably smaller for decades .
Beats became consolidated ; feature writers and anyone else on staff who wrote longer - form pieces or offered more in - depth reporting were slowly culled from papers .
The amount of space apportioned to actual journalism — the “ newshole , ” in industry parlance — tightened ; the type got smaller ; designs became cramped .
Listings shrank to agate type and became less comprehensive long before the Internet came along .
Comics — once an entry point for kids — shrank , shrank some more , and then shrank again .
And then everything got even tinier !
One by one , virtually very daily in America made itself physically smaller , reducing the dimensions of its printed page — down to 12 inches , say , from 14 .
The editor ’s notes accompanying the changes assured readers the shrinkage would n’t affect the paper ’s coverage .
( Intellectual honesty was another thing that was cut . )
Now , of course there were exceptions and other ameliorative forces at work .
For one thing , it ’s not often noted that the big - bad media consolidators of the 1970s and 80s , while unquestionably lackadaisical about actual journalism ( hello , USA Today ! ) , also made a lot of crummy papers in smaller cities better .
Still , overall , papers kept cutting to meet financial targets .
Anyway , none of this mattered , because the advertisers kept paying the papers a lot of money , because the papers were good at the business they were really in , which was putting ads , printed on newsprint , on folks ’ doorsteps .
Now , news organizations might find they can create a different business model on the web .
I hope they do .
But let ’s be honest about how different it ’s going to be .
The New York Times Magazine just printed a very long feature about the state of journalism in Philadelphia .
It was n’t an upbeat portrait , of course , but the owner of the town ’s two papers , Brian Tierney , was allowed a lot of space to ululate about “ the public trust ” ( without it being noticed that trust was not the business The Philadelphia Inquirer had been in ) and contend that the papers were making an operating profit outside of their debt obligations .
( Even if that were true , which I can’t imagine , the fact remains that circulation , and advertising income , is going to continue to fall . )
He was never clearly asked :
What does he plan to sell that remotely approximates the monopoly on that strange industry — slapping ads on newsprint and delivering them to peoples ’ houses in the early morning hours — the paper used to have ?
The story never said this :
The value the companies added to the print ads was their de facto hegemony over home delivery .
It did n’t say that that hegemony does n’t exist online .
And the value of that hegemony is gone forever .
One other change .
The papers adopted new design formats that put bigger art and more white space into layouts — the layouts in those smaller newsholes .
Design directors could be seen describing the new look by the use of little hand gestures dispersing imaginary puffs of air onto the pages .
Air instead of content .
Newspapers had struck upon a goldmine previously known only to purveyors of bread , popcorn , and ice cream .
After all , where else could the readers go ?
2. Newspapers are the product of monopolist thinking
The paradigmatic American newspaper , once its competition had been eliminated , settled down into a comfortable monopoly position in most cities ; sometimes there was another paper around , but in most places one newspaper stood dominant and took home most of the ads , not to mention the money .
These monopoly positions created a dynamic by which the only thing a paper could do wrong was to offend or , God forbid , lose a reader .
The prospect of offending readers , or having subscriptions canceled , penetrated deep into papers and became a comic cliché , famously satirized by Berkeley Breathed .
I freelanced at one point for a fairly famous U.S. paper , one whose parent company is currently in bankruptcy proceedings ; among other things I did pop-concert reviews for a “ Overnight ” page .
( Instead of having enough printing presses to print an entire paper overnight , most papers print some sections early the previous day , as this one did ; the reviews that hit subscribers ’ doorsteps on a given morning were therefore actually from two evenings previous , but never mind : “ Overnight ” it was . )
The editor of the page told me , quite explicitly that pans were not allowed .
She did n’t want readers to see something unflattering about their favorite artist over breakfast .
That ’s anecdotal , but I ’ve got a lot of anecdotes like that , and the pervasiveness of this attitude has been obvious in papers for decades .
The New York Times does better work than most papers , but even it is not immune .
One of its managing editors , Jill Abramson , just began a weekly series on her adoption of a new puppy .
Now , all of this is an intelligent tack for papers to take in the short term , given their business model .
I disagree with it professionally , but I do n’t mean to criticize it .
I just want to make the case that it exists .
The commentators most caught up in the romanticized notion of newspaper cite the potential loss of the newspapers ’ “ watchdog ” function .
Let ’s be honest .
Most newspapers in the U.S. are n’t watchdogs , and most of the rest do n’t spend an inordinate amount of time being watchdogs .
Most papers are instead lapdogs , and the metaphorical lap they sit in is n’t even that of powerful interests like their advertisers .
( Though they definitely have their moments . )
The real tyrant the papers served was the tender sensibilities of their readers .
Did some critics write negative reviews ?
Of course .
Did some local papers do occasional good work , embarrass a public official now and again , tell its readers things they did n’t want to hear ?
Yes .
Did they also provide some useful health news , give some ink to deserving local art or cultural endeavors ?
Yes to that as well .
Now , the national daily newspaper industry is so broad in the U.S. that , with selective citing , you can make just about any case for or against it .
But me , I ’ve lived in five major American cities and , as I said , often either written on the media or oversaw my organization ’s media coverage , so I feel that I can claim some confidence in my impressions .
So , sure , an average newspaper did print some serious journalism .
But is that most of what they did , or even anything more than a tiny part ?
Did newspapers crusade from early in the morning to late at night to right wrongs ?
Did the typical reporter spend the majority of her or her time ferreting out information that the local powers - that - be kept hidden ?
Did their critics focus a gimlet eye on all manner or art and pop culture , shoot from the hip , provoke dialogs about its meaning and import ?
Did the papers really afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted ?
Did each department , each day , have at least one story that took an extra step to find out some information that others did n’t want public , that did n’t come from a press release or a government official , that did n’t merely repeat warmed - over developments that had happened the day before ?
No on all counts .
My experience lies more with arts and features ; I ’d guess that the average paper ’s coverage of arts and entertainment , for example , runs at least 80 - plus percent promotional ( meaning that it was “ coverage ” tied to the release of some product ) , with the remainder split between the rare other - than - upbeat critical review and some fairly minuscule percentage of actual original reporting .
I once analyzed two weeks of the arts and features sections of a well - known American newspaper and found exactly one feature published over that period that contained original reporting .
Even good papers ’ arts coverage is largely promotional ; look at the cute little features that dot the inside of The Wall Street Journal ’s Friday feature section ; it offers pages of fluff , each bit of it pegged to some product release .
Even a top - tier critic like Joe Morgenstern will fill out his columns with random little plugs for new DVDs — with no information about special features , say , or the quality of the restoration of a classic film .
Whose interest , other than that of the home video departments of the movie studios , do those squibs serve ?
When extolling their own benefits to society , newspapers and their partisans will point to the work of the Journal , or The New York Times , Washington Post or Los Angeles Times .
That ’s exactly four papers out of about 1500 .
Asked to cite their own achievements , they will point to this or that story from the past year that made a splash , or a big investigative series .
Why , they even thought it worthy of being nominated for a Pulitzer Prize !
Ask them to cite some examples from that day , however , or that week , or even that month , and the person will struggle .
Now , again , my point is n’t really to bash the papers for this failing , though they deserve to be .
The point is a slightly extended one :
This timidity is a product of a tendency inside papers that has essentially become genetic .
The tendency is doubly sad when one considers the resources available .
A typical newspaper , 10 or 20 years ago , was a vast operation , with deputies to the top editor holding enormous sway over their respective armies .
There was plenty of staff there to make an impact , every week , every day .
But the power , helped along both by a need to fill those lucrative ad - based sections and that concern not to shake the boat , was inevitably diffused : Home & Garden , Living , Food , Escapes , whatever .
The Sunday travel section , Monday Health page , the Tuesday home section , the Wednesday dining insert , the Thursday Buyer ’s guide , the movie coverage on Friday , the faith section on Saturday .
All nice , all largely promotional , all inoffensive … all a drain on resources , and all an excuse not to do something harder , more … watchdog - like .
Each of those features , you will note , were imagined to provide some supposedly cherished service to readers but most were there to make money .
( Sports and business were obvious exceptions , though as we ’ve seen , the amount the paper earned from subscriptions from sports and business enthusiasts could n’t come close to paying for the cost of the coverage . )
And some of it was useful to readers .
But let ’s be honest .
It was n’t the information the republic needs to govern itself .
A very large percentage of it was based , one way or another , on information from press releases , either physical or de facto , from organizations with products to sell .
Press releases contain dated information , the release of which is valuable only to the companies involved ; in most cases , they ’d actually pay to advertise it , and in that sense it has a negative news value .
But vast swaths of a typical American daily is filled with news whose primary source is a press release of one form or another , from entities governmental , political , or corporate .
It was part of an unspoken but implicit agreement the papers had with advertisers — that the vast majority of what the paper printed would be complementary with the advertising .
( It would be complimentary too , of course . )
So a large part of what we called “ newsgathering ” was basically providing additional promotional coverage for its advertisers .
That ’s what the advertisers were paying for .
One of the things the digital convergence is doing is exposing that fact .
Newspapers have to understand that the value that they could as a consequence offer to advertisers just does n’t exist any more .
Another thing : since that delivery monopoly is gone , you can see how much of the production of the American newspaper was not only promotional , but redundant .
Let ’s face it ; the America will stand even if 1500 critics are n’t around to tell us that Taken is an efficient thriller , if 1500 lifestyle writers are n’t there to tell us Moen has a new line of classy kitchen fixtures , or , in the end , if 1500 White House correspondents do n’t cover the same presidential press conference .
The irony is that this all was n’t as corrupt as it sounds .
The primary cause of this was n’t , paradoxically , to curry favor with advertisers , though they certainly liked it .
That was just a lagniappe .
The big attraction of a press release ?
It was safe .
No one has ever canceled a newspaper subscription ( and no one has ever gotten into trouble internally ) because of the publication of material contained in a press release .
Anyway , I argue this genetic evolution made timidity the hallmark of most daily American newspapers .
It manifested itself in myriad ways .
Here ’s another anecdote .
You ’re familiar with the stories papers trot out to mark this or that anniversary .
At another paper , I happily worked with a younger writer on what I thought was a pretty juicy story pegged to just one such event .
It was a classic “ talker ” article — one that was designed to make people say , “ Hey , did you read that story in The Daily Blatt today ? ”
It was well reported and sensitively handled , but dealt with race and an American icon and was presented quite dramatically .
Intellectually , I ’ve always understood the economics of newspapering , but I ’m a romantic , too .
I also think that an outlet that presents new and original and provocative information will always have a leg up .
Anyway , I was anxious to show the higher - ups the sort of work my writer was doing , and so passed it along via email to two or three of my bosses as we worked on it .
As publication approached , they each professed not to have read it , and looked a little vague when I asked them about it .
I ’m not saying that it was necessarily a great story ; I ’m saying the editors were n’t even interested in the possibility of its being a great story .
This odd predisposition was bred into newspaper editors in a Darwinian style , over many generations .
It ’s obvious why they ducked reading it .
( Or , let ’s be honest , ducked admitting having read it . )
They wanted to be able to have deniability if for some reason it blew up in our faces .
Subordinate editors get the message : Higher - ups were n’t interested in hot stories , and you ’d be out on a limb if things went wrong .
Now , that story does n’t gibe with the Ben Bradlee you saw portrayed in All the President ’s Men .
Lets go back to those 1500 dailies , of varying sizes , left in the U.S. ; how many have Ben Bradlees , or anything close to a Ben Bradlee ?
Not too many .
You can see the evidence of it in the pages of virtually every daily in the U.S.
I live now in one of the very largest cities in the U.S. , but it ’s in classic flyover territory , a sociological light year away from a major media center .
Here ’s a list of the headlines that appeared on a recent day on the front cover of the paper ’s feature section , including both stories and news squibs :
“ Wooden Memories ”
“ Test your hearing ”
“ Free burrito for teachers ”
“ Post office food drive ”
“ Fight Crohn ’s and colitis ”
“ Mom and Estában ”
“ Healthful salsa non -guilty pleasure ”
“ Great gifts for teachers ”
The first of those — “ Wooden Memories ” — was the compelling headline of a big feature about folks who keep old wood - shop projects around the house because … they just ca n’t bring themselves to get rid of them .
“ Wooden Memories ” !
“ Healthful salsa ” !
It ’s obvious from reading down that list of headlines that there was nothing there of remote interest of just about any sentient being .
But that ’s not what the paper ’s editors were aiming for .
The point is that there was nothing there that could possibly offend anyone .
Any editor who presided over such a sorry collection of non stories and journalistic Malt - o - Meal at a time when papers should have been fighting to make themselves relevant to readers should of course have been fired .
But , inside newspapers , that ’s what is , paradoxically , regarded .
Indeed , the top editor of that paper just got a new job :
He was stolen away by another well - known American newspaper , one of the ones currently facing bankruptcy and closure .
You ’d think a paper in that position would be fighting back .
Instead , they turned to a guy who ’d overseen the publication of sections like that .
Part 2 : Are n't reporters partly to blame ?
Production jobs in developed countries are moving to lower cost locations such as South America and China .
Globalization and the relocation of production allows for lower - cost production which benefits the consumer with lower prices and thus leading to an increase in purchasing power which the American dream is all about is n't it ?
It comes at the cost of lost jobs in the production sector in home countries which leaves people with a lack of options for other employment .
' Economic growth ' is based on a paradigm that we live on a planet with infinite resources .
Corporations spend great effort into setting up stranglehold trade agreements with 3rd world countries .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank ensure that third world countries have to open their markets , while the ' free market western economies ' set up fences around theirs .
The set up is such that NO jobs are available in third world industries , apart from the ones created by western companies , who pay scarcely over cost - price to the producers , while making record profits on selling their goods to rich westerners .
In a true free - market , those third world countries would have an equal change at exporting their OWN products to the West , which would result in profit being made by the third world producers .
However , there are tax - barriers where it's okay for the third world to export their raw materials ( hence all the oil - export , fruits and vegetables ) but where the amount of import - tax on end - products ( such as phones , computers , cars , etc. ) is so high that it makes their products by default noncompetitive .
The only exceptions to this rule are companies that have head - quarters in the US or the EU region .
The current struggle within the EU is actually quite a good example of how badly globalization works .
It works for Capital ( which can move freely and generate profits wherever they are to be made ) but it leaves weaker countries with enormous trade - deficits .
IMF and World Bank politics and demands are destroying local industries and they 're introducing true poverty .
The ' globalism works ' argument comes from sources that benefit from cheap labor and resources and who try hard to down - play the true consequences .
As Mr. Obama begins his eighth month in office , Republicans show no signs of wanting to work with him , having lost whatever fear they may have had after his impressive victory last year .
And Democrats are split over the next step for health care .

His political base , which offered a well of political and spiritual nourishment during the darkest times in his primary and general election battles , shows at least some signs of being disillusioned by his handling of not only the health care issue , but also of the issue of gay men and lesbians in the military and his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan .
David Axelrod , a senior adviser to the president , said in an interview Friday that Mr. Obama ’s experience through a bruising two - year political campaign provided a dose of perspective .
“ We have the advantage of having been through so many political storms that have sent Washington into a frenzy , ” Mr. Axelrod said .
“ What we ’ve learned from that is that you have to look to the distant shore .
You ca n’t panic from the choppy waves around you .
He ’s got his eye on that . ”
But the White House also has its eye on public opinion polls , along with the administration ’s own extensive political research , which show that confidence in Mr. Obama ’s leadership has fallen throughout the summer largely because of the health care debate .
At several points in recent weeks , including during a retreat for members of the cabinet and senior advisers , Mr. Obama has expressed frustration that his message has not been as sharp as he believes it should have been .
As he did through the campaign , he pressed members of his team to learn as they go and not to repeat mistakes .
“ He does n’t like being off track , ” Mr. Plouffe said .
“ He works to get people on track . ”
The White House is still discussing how to present the president ’s health care agenda when Congress returns in September .
A speech before a joint session of Congress is a possibility , aides said , as is an address to the nation from the Oval Office .
The president is also expected to hold more town - hall - style meetings across the nation .
A new paper ( well , not “ new ” , it ’s from June , but I ’m just now reading it ) in Science by Samuel Bowles : Did warfare among ancestral hunter - gatherers affect the evolution of human social behaviors ?
( Science , 324 : 1293-1298 , 5 June 2009 ) .
He makes an interesting paradoxical observation , or at least hypothesis : Did altruistic behavior arise from intergroup conflict ?
Or rather , did cooperative behavior become a trait positively affecting fitness because of competitive behaviors between groups ?
It ’s paradoxical because we usually think of “ altruism ” or “ cooperation ” as peaceful concepts : we cooperate instead of compete and everything is nice and friendly .
What Bowles is arguing for is that perhaps competition in the form of organized warfare between groups led to selection for groups whose cooperation in the form of fighting was greater than those of other groups .
Here ’s the abstract :
Since Darwin , intergroup hostilities have figured prominently in explanations of the evolution of human social behavior .
Yet whether ancestral humans were largely “ peaceful ” or “ warlike ” remains controversial .
I ask a more precise question :
If more cooperative groups were more likely to prevail in conflicts with other groups , was the level of intergroup violence sufficient to influence the evolution of human social behavior ?
Using a model of the evolutionary impact of between - group competition and a new data set that combines archaeological evidence on causes of death during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene with ethnographic and historical reports on hunter - gatherer populations , I find that the estimated level of mortality in intergroup conflicts would have had substantial effects , allowing the proliferation of group - beneficial behaviors that were quite costly to the individual altruist .
And the key explanation of the mechanism he ’s arguing for :
The primary behaviors thought to have been spread by war are what Darwin termed the “ social and moral qualities ” and other forms of altruism .
This paradoxical role of war arises because , in the absence of within - group positive assortment , altruism will suffer adverse within - group selection .
But it might be sustained by the between - group selection pressures that warfare introduces if altruists willingly fight on behalf of others in their group so that otherwise comparable groups with many altruists tend to prevail in intergroup contests .
In game theoretic terms , defense or predation is a public good ( participating is an n- person prisoner ’s dilemma ) in which those who participate confer benefits on their fellow group members at a cost to themselves .
While I treat the case of the altruist as warrior as paradigmatic , willingness to take mortal risks as a fighter is not the only form of altruism that contributes to prevailing in intergroup contests ; more altruistic and hence more cooperative groups may be more productive and sustain healthier , stronger , or more numerous members , for example , or make more effective use of information .
The two key determinants of the effect of warfare on the evolution of social behaviors are the extent of genetic differences between the winners and losers of conflicts and the effect of the number of altruists in a group on group members ’ average fitness .
Warfare affects the second by making the presence of altruists in a group critical to the members ’ survival ( and hence their fitness ) .
There are two ways in which the outcome of a conflict may affect the average fitness of its members .
The first is that members of losing groups are more likely to perish , and those who die may either produce no offspring or leave children who suffer high mortality due to inadequate parental care .
The second is that , as with chimpanzees ( 18 ) , weaker groups cede territory , thereby redistributing fitness - relevant resources between the groups .
He acknowledges that genetic or cultural evolution may be operating ( I tend to think the latter is probably a more productive avenue ) and his model is based on genetic differences .
The biggest weakness from an empirical view is the archaeological samples , which he readily describes .
It ’s a very small subset of archaeological samples and he only includes those with skeletal evidence ( burials ) .
Not every site contains burials and sites with burials are often ( especially in earlier literature ) more publishable .
Also , most burials are never found , not all bones from a given burial are found , and many violent causes of death do not leave traces on the bones .
Nevertheless , he finds in the positive : that “ the levels of warfare mortality observed in many populations would offset substantial costs of altruism . ”
Actually , you can get a lot of background info here ( he ’s got quite a few links to papers and commentary , although some of it is sub only ) .
I like the idea , although data limitations only make it a viable contender , not anything slam dunk .
I wonder if the genetic differences are all that profound enough to actually affect behavior or if the behaviors themselves as cultural traits are a more appropriate model .
In that case , you would have to consider transmission both across and within generations .
Still , worthwhile taking a longer look at .
Pierre Mai released his new deflate inflating library yesterday , so I did little bit of testing against Chipz .
On my Core 2 Duo system with 64 - bit SBCL , Chipz is about 25 % faster at inflating .
Pierre says his program is " ... for those who need something with a less restrictive license or better performance than is currently freely available " , but it seems to me that the main advantage over Chipz is that it has a very simple interface and lives in a single file .
I did n't try it against inflate.cl because that file was recently updated and uses Allegro CL - specific code now .

Synonyms Rorschach inkblot test , the Rorschach technique , inkblot test MeSH
The Rorschach test is a psychological test in which subjects ' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation , complex algorithms , or both .
Some psychologists use this test to examine a person 's personality characteristics and emotional functioning .
It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder , especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly . [ 4 ]
The test is named after its creator , Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach .
The Rorschach can be thought of as a psychometric examination of pareidolia , the active pattern of perceiving objects , shapes , or scenery as meaningful things to the observer 's experience , the most common being faces or other pattern of forms that are not present at the time of the observation .
[ 5 ]
In the 1960s , the Rorschach was the most widely used projective test . [ 6 ]
Although the Exner Scoring System ( developed since the 1960s ) claims to have addressed and often refuted many criticisms of the original testing system with an extensive body of research , [ 7 ] some researchers continue to raise questions .
The areas of dispute include the objectivity of testers , inter - rater reliability , the verifiability and general validity of the test , bias of the test 's pathology scales towards greater numbers of responses , the limited number of psychological conditions which it accurately diagnoses , the inability to replicate the test 's norms , its use in court - ordered evaluations , and the proliferation of the ten inkblot images , potentially invalidating the test for those who have been exposed to them . [ 8 ]
History
Using interpretation of " ambiguous designs " to assess an individual 's personality is an idea that goes back to Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli.[ citation needed ]
Interpretation of inkblots was central to a game , Gobolinks , [ 9 ] from the late 19th century .
Rorschach's , however , was the first systematic approach of this kind . [ 10 ]
The ink blots were hand drawn by Rorschach . [ 11 ]
It has been suggested that Rorschach 's use of inkblots may have been inspired by German doctor Justinus Kerner who , in 1857 , had published a popular book of poems , each of which was inspired by an accidental inkblot . [ 12 ]
French psychologist Alfred Binet had also experimented with inkblots as a creativity test , [ 13 ] and , after the turn of the century , psychological experiments where inkblots were utilized multiplied , with aims such as studying imagination and consciousness . [ 14 ]
After studying 300 mental patients and 100 control subjects , in 1921 Rorschach wrote his book Psychodiagnostik , which was to form the basis of the inkblot test ( after experimenting with several hundred inkblots , he selected a set of ten for their diagnostic value ) , [ 15 ] but he died the following year .
Although he had served as Vice President of the Swiss Psychoanalytic Society , Rorschach had difficulty in publishing the book and it attracted little attention when it first appeared . [ 16 ]
In 1927 , the newly founded Hans Huber publishing house purchased Rorschach 's book Psychodiagnostik from the inventory of Ernst Bircher . [ 17 ]
Huber has remained the publisher of the test and related book , with Rorschach a registered trademark of Swiss publisher Verlag Hans Huber , Hogrefe AG . [ 18 ]
The work has been described as " a densely written piece couched in dry , scientific terminology " . [ 19 ]
After Rorschach 's death , the original test scoring system was improved by Samuel Beck , Bruno Klopfer and others . [ 20 ] John E. Exner summarized some of these later developments in the comprehensive system , at the same time trying to make the scoring more statistically rigorous .
Some systems are based on the psychoanalytic concept of object relations .
The Exner system remains very popular in the United States , while in Europe other methods sometimes dominate , [ 21 ] [ 22 ] such as that described in the textbook by Evald Bohm , which is closer to the original Rorschach system and rooted more deeply in the original psychoanalysis principles .[ citation needed ]
Rorschach never intended the inkblots to be used as a general personality test , but developed them as a tool for the diagnosis of schizophrenia .
It was not until 1939 that the test was used as a projective test of personality , a use of which Rorschach had always been skeptical . [ 23 ]
Interviewed in 2012 for a BBC Radio 4 documentary , Rita Signer , curator of the Rorschach Archives in Bern , Switzerland , suggested that far from being random or chance designs , each of the blots selected by Rorschach for his test had been meticulously designed to be as ambiguous and " conflicted " as possible . [ 24 ]
Method
The Rorschach test is appropriate for subjects from the age of five to adulthood .
The administrator and subject typically sit next to each other at a table , with the administrator slightly behind the subject .
Side - by - side seating of the examiner and the subject is used to reduce any effects of inadvertent cues from the examiner to the subject .
In other words , side - by - side seating mitigates the possibility that the examiner will accidentally influence the subject 's responses . [ 25 ]
This is to facilitate a " relaxed but controlled atmosphere " .
There are ten official inkblots , each printed on a separate white card , approximately 18 by 24 cm in size . [ 26 ]
Each of the blots has near perfect bilateral symmetry .
Five inkblots are of black ink , two are of black and red ink and three are multicolored , on a white background . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
After the test subject has seen and responded to all of the inkblots ( free association phase ) , the tester then presents them again one at a time in a set sequence for the subject to study : the subject is asked to note where they see what they originally saw and what makes it look like that ( inquiry phase ) .
The subject is usually asked to hold the cards and may rotate them .
Whether the cards are rotated , and other related factors such as whether permission to rotate them is asked , may expose personality traits and normally contributes to the assessment . [ 30 ]
As the subject is examining the inkblots , the psychologist writes down everything the subject says or does , no matter how trivial .
Analysis of responses is recorded by the test administrator using a tabulation and scoring sheet and , if required , a separate location chart . [ 25 ]
The general goal of the test is to provide data about cognition and personality variables such as motivations , response tendencies , cognitive operations , affectivity , and personal / interpersonal perceptions .
The underlying assumption is that an individual will class external stimuli based on person - specific perceptual sets , and including needs , base motives , conflicts , and that this clustering process is representative of the process used in real - life situations . [ 31 ]
Methods of interpretation differ .
Rorschach scoring systems have been described as a system of pegs on which to hang one 's knowledge of personality . [ 32 ]
The most widely used method in the United States is based on the work of Exner .
Administration of the test to a group of subjects , by means of projected images , has also occasionally been performed , but mainly for research rather than diagnostic purposes . [ 25 ]
Test administration is not to be confused with test interpretation :
The interpretation of a Rorschach record is a complex process .
It requires a wealth of knowledge concerning personality dynamics generally as well as considerable experience with the Rorschach method specifically .
Proficiency as a Rorschach administrator can be gained within a few months .
However , even those who are able and qualified to become Rorschach interpreters usually remain in a " learning stage " for a number of years . [ 25 ]
Features or categories
The interpretation of the Rorschach test is not based primarily on the contents of the response , i.e. , what the individual sees in the inkblot ( the content ) .
In fact , the contents of the response are only a comparatively small portion of a broader cluster of variables that are used to interpret the Rorschach data : for instance , information is provided by the time taken before providing a response for a card can be significant ( taking a long time can indicate " shock " on the card ) . [ 33 ] as well as by any comments the subject may make in addition to providing a direct response . [ 34 ]
In particular , information about determinants ( the aspects of the inkblots that triggered the response , such as form and color ) and location ( which details of the inkblots triggered the response ) is often considered more important than content , although there is contrasting evidence . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] " Popularity " and " originality " of responses [ 37 ] can also be considered as basic dimensions in the analysis . [ 38 ]
Content
The goal in coding content of the Rorschach is to categorize the objects that the subject describes in response to the inkblot .
There are 27 established codes for identifying the name of the descriptive object .
The codes are classified and include terms such as " human " , " nature " , " animal " , " abstract " , " clothing " , " fire " , and " x- ray " , to name a few .
Content described that does not have a code already established should be coded using the code " idiographic contents " with the shorthand code being " Idio . " [ 39 ]
Items are also coded for statistical popularity ( or , conversely , originality ) . [ 40 ]
More than any other feature in the test , content response can be controlled consciously by the subject , and may be elicited by very disparate factors , which makes it difficult to use content alone to draw any conclusions about the subject 's personality ; with certain individuals , content responses may potentially be interpreted directly , and some information can at times be obtained by analyzing thematic trends in the whole set of content responses ( which is only feasible when several responses are available ) , but in general content cannot be analyzed outside of the context of the entire test record . [ 41 ]
Location
Identifying the location of the subject 's response is another element scored in the Rorschach system .
Location refers to how much of the inkblot was used to answer the question .
Administrators score the response " W " if the whole inkblot was used to answer the question , " D " if a commonly described part of the blot was used , " Dd " if an uncommonly described or unusual detail was used , or " S " if the white space in the background was used .
A score of W is typically associated with the subject 's motivation to interact with his or her surrounding environment .
D is interpreted as one having efficient or adequate functioning .
A high frequency of responses coded Dd indicate some maladjustment within the individual .
Responses coded S indicate an oppositional or uncooperative test subject . [ 26 ] [ 39 ]
Determinants
Systems for Rorschach scoring generally include a concept of " determinants " :
These are the factors that contribute to establishing the similarity between the inkblot and the subject 's content response about it .
They can also represent certain basic experiential - perceptual attitudes , showing aspects of the way a subject perceives the world .
Rorschach 's original work used only form , color and movement as determinants .
However currently , another major determinant considered is shading , [ 42 ] which was inadvertently introduced by poor printing quality of the inkblots .
Rorschach initially disregarded shading , [ 43 ] since the inkblots originally featured uniform saturation , but later recognized it as a significant factor . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
Form is the most common determinant , and is related to intellectual processes .
Color responses often provide direct insight into one 's emotional life .
Movement and shading have been considered more ambiguously , both in definition and interpretation .
Rorschach considered movement only as the experiencing of actual motion , while others have widened the scope of this determinant , taking it to mean that the subject sees something " going on " . [ 47 ]
More than one determinant can contribute to the formation of the subject 's perception .
Fusion of two determinants is taken into account , while also assessing which of the two constituted the primary contributor .
For example , " form - color " implies a more refined control of impulse than " color - form " .
It is , indeed , from the relation and balance among determinants that personality can be most readily inferred . [ 47 ]
Symmetry of the test items
A striking characteristic of the Rorschach inkblots is their symmetry .
Many unquestionably accept this aspect of the nature of the images but Rorschach , as well as other researchers , certainly did not .
Rorschach experimented with both asymmetric and symmetric images before finally opting for the latter . [ 48 ]
He gives this explanation for the decision :
Asymmetric figures are rejected by many subjects ; symmetry supplied part of the necessary artistic composition .
It has a disadvantage in that it tends to make answers somewhat stereotyped .
On the other hand , symmetry makes conditions the same for right and left handed subjects ; furthermore , it facilitates interpretation for certain blocked subjects .
Finally , symmetry makes possible the interpretation of whole scenes . [ 49 ]
The impact of symmetry in the Rorschach inkblot 's has also been investigated further by other researchers . [ 48 ]
Exner scoring system
The Exner scoring system , also known as the Rorschach Comprehensive System ( RCS ) , [ 50 ] is the standard method for interpreting the Rorschach test .
It was developed in the 1960s by Dr. John E. Exner , as a more rigorous system of analysis .
It has been extensively validated and shows high inter-rater reliability . [ 7 ] [ 51 ]
In 1969 , Exner published The Rorschach Systems , a concise description of what would be later called " the Exner system " .
He later published a study in multiple volumes called The Rorschach : A Comprehensive system , the most accepted full description of his system .
Creation of the new system was prompted by the realization that at least five related , but ultimately different methods were in common use at the time , with a sizeable minority of examiners not employing any recognized method at all , basing instead their judgment on subjective assessment , or arbitrarily mixing characteristics of the various standardized systems . [ 52 ]
The key components of the Exner system are the clusterization of Rorschach variables and a sequential search strategy to determine the order in which to analyze them , [ 53 ] framed in the context of standardized administration , objective , reliable coding and a representative normative database . [ 54 ]
The system places a lot of emphasis on a cognitive triad of information processing , related to how the subject processes input data , cognitive mediation , referring to the way information is transformed and identified , and ideation . [ 55 ]
In the system , responses are scored with reference to their level of vagueness or synthesis of multiple images in the blot , the location of the response , which of a variety of determinants is used to produce the response ( i.e. , what makes the inkblot look like what it is said to resemble ) , the form quality of the response ( to what extent a response is faithful to how the actual inkblot looks ) , the contents of the response ( what the respondent actually sees in the blot ) , the degree of mental organizing activity that is involved in producing the response , and any illogical , incongruous , or incoherent aspects of responses .
It has been reported that popular responses on the first card include bat , badge and coat of arms . [ 32 ]
Using the scores for these categories , the examiner then performs a series of calculations producing a structural summary of the test data .
The results of the structural summary are interpreted using existing research data on personality characteristics that have been demonstrated to be associated with different kinds of responses .
With the Rorschach plates ( the ten inkblots ) , the area of each blot which is distinguished by the client is noted and coded — typically as " commonly selected " or " uncommonly selected " .
There were many different methods for coding the areas of the blots .
Exner settled upon the area coding system promoted by S. J. Beck ( 1944 and 1961 ) .
This system was in turn based upon Klopfer 's ( 1942 ) work .
As pertains to response form , a concept of " form quality " was present from the earliest of Rorschach 's works , as a subjective judgment of how well the form of the subject 's response matched the inkblots ( Rorschach would give a higher form score to more " original " yet good form responses ) , and this concept was followed by other methods , especially in Europe ; in contrast , the Exner system solely defines " good form " as a matter of word occurrence frequency , reducing it to a measure of the subject 's distance to the population average . [ 56 ]
Performance assessment system
Rorschach performance assessment system ( R - PAS ) is a scoring method created by several members of the Rorschach Research Council .
They believed that the Exner scoring system was in need of an update , but after Exner 's death , the Exner family forbade any changes to be made to the Comprehensive System . [ 57 ]
Therefore , they established a new system : the R - PAS .
It is an attempt at creating a current , empirically based , and internationally focused scoring system that is easier to use than Exner 's Comprehensive System . [ 58 ]
The R - PAS manual is intended to be a comprehensive tool for administering , scoring , and interpreting the Rorschach .
The manual consists of two chapters that are basics of scoring and interpretation , aimed for use for novice Rorschach users , followed by numerous chapters containing more detailed and technical information . [ 59 ]
In terms of updated scoring , the authors only selected variables that have been empirically supported in the literature .
To note , the authors did not create new variables or indices to be coded , but systematically reviewed variables that had been used in past systems . [ 60 ]
While all of these codes have been used in the past , many have been renamed to be more face valid and readily understood .
Scoring of the indices has been updated ( e.g. utilizing percentiles and standard scores ) to make the Rorschach more in line with other popular personality measures .
In addition to providing coding guidelines to score examinee responses , the R - PAS provides a system to code an examinee 's behavior during Rorschach administration .
These behavioral codes are included as it is believed that the behaviors exhibited during testing are a reflection of someone 's task performance and supplements the actual responses given .
This allows generalizations to be made between someone 's responses to the cards and their actual behavior .
The R - PAS also recognized that scoring on many of the Rorschach variables differed across countries . [ 60 ]
Therefore , starting in 1997 , Rorschach protocols from researchers around the world were compiled . [ 61 ]
After compiling protocols for over a decade , a total of 15 adult samples were used to provide a normative basis for the R - PAS .
The protocols represent data gathered in the United States , Europe , Israel , Argentina and Brazil .
Cultural differences
Comparing North American
Exner normative data with data from European and South American subjects showed marked differences in some features , some of which impact important variables , while others ( such as the average number of responses ) coincide . [ 62 ]
For instance , texture response is typically zero in European subjects ( if interpreted as a need for closeness , in accordance with the system , a European would seem to express it only when it reaches the level of a craving for closeness ) , [ 63 ] and there are fewer " good form " responses , to the point where schizophrenia may be suspected if data were correlated to the North American norms . [ 64 ]
Form is also often the only determinant expressed by European subjects ; [ 65 ] while color is less frequent than in American subjects , color - form responses are comparatively frequent in opposition to form - color responses ; since the latter tend to be interpreted as indicators of a defensive attitude in processing affect , this difference could stem from a higher value attributed to spontaneous expression of emotions . [ 63 ]
The differences in form quality are attributable to purely cultural aspects : different cultures will exhibit different " common " objects ( French subjects often identify a chameleon in card VIII , which is normally classed as an " unusual " response , as opposed to other animals like cats and dogs ; in Scandinavia , " Christmas elves " ( nisser ) is a popular response for card II , and " musical instrument " on card VI is popular for Japanese people ) , [ 66 ] and different languages will exhibit semantic differences in naming the same object ( the figure of card IV is often called a troll by Scandinavians and an ogre by French people ) . [ 67 ]
Many of Exner 's " popular " responses ( those given by at least one third of the North American sample used ) seem to be universally popular , as shown by samples in Europe , Japan and South America , while specifically card IX 's " human " response , the crab or spider in card X and one of either the butterfly or the bat in card I appear to be characteristic of North America . [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
Form quality , popular content responses and locations are the only coded variables in the Exner systems that are based on frequency of occurrence , and thus immediately subject to cultural influences ; therefore , cultural - dependent interpretation of test data may not necessarily need to extend beyond these components . [ 69 ]
The cited language differences mean that it 's imperative for the test to be administered in the subject 's native language or a very well mastered second language , and , conversely , the examiner should master the language used in the test .
Test responses should also not be translated into another language prior to analysis except possibly by a clinician mastering both languages .
For example , a bow tie is a frequent response for the center detail of card III , but since the equivalent term in French translates to " butterfly tie " , an examiner not appreciating this language nuance may code the response differently from what is expected . [ 70 ]
Inkblots
Below are the ten inkblots printed in Rorschach Test – Psychodiagnostic Plates , [ 71 ] together with the most frequent responses for either the whole image or the most prominent details according to various authors .
Card Popular responses [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Comments [ 75 ] [ 76 ]
Beck : bat , butterfly , moth Piotrowski : bat ( 53 % ) , butterfly ( 29 % ) Dana ( France ) : butterfly ( 39 % )
When seeing card I , subjects often inquire on how they should proceed , and questions on what they are allowed to do with the card ( e.g. turning it ) are not very significant .
Being the first card , it can provide clues about how subjects tackle a new and stressful task .
It is not , however , a card that is usually difficult for the subject to handle , having readily available popular responses .
Beck : two humans Piotrowski : four - legged animal ( 34 % , gray parts ) Dana ( France ) : animal : dog , elephant , bear ( 50 % , gray )
The red details of card II are often seen as blood , and are the most distinctive features .
Responses to them can provide indications about how a subject is likely to manage feelings of anger or physical harm .
This card can induce a variety of sexual responses .
Beck : two humans ( gray ) Piotrowski : human figures ( 72 % , gray ) Dana ( France ) : human ( 76 % , gray ) Card III is typically perceived to contain two humans involved in some interaction , and may provide information about how the subject relates with other people ( specifically , response latency may reveal struggling social interactions ) .
Beck : animal hide , skin , rug Piotrowski : animal skin , skin rug ( 41 % ) Dana ( France ) : animal skin ( 46 % ) Card IV is notable for its dark color and its shading ( posing difficulties for depressed subjects ) , and is generally perceived as a big and sometimes threatening figure ; compounded with the common impression of the subject being in an inferior position ( " looking up " ) to it , this serves to elicit a sense of authority .
The human or animal content seen in the card is almost invariably classified as male rather than female , and the qualities expressed by the subject may indicate attitudes toward men and authority .
Because of this Card IV is often called " The Father Card " . [ 77 ]
Beck : bat , butterfly , moth Piotrowski : butterfly ( 48 % ) , bat ( 40 % ) Dana ( France ) : butterfly ( 48 % ) , bat ( 46 % ) Card V is an easily elaborated card that is not usually perceived as threatening , and typically instigates a " change of pace " in the test , after the previous more challenging cards .
Containing few features that generate concerns or complicate the elaboration , it is the easiest blot to generate a good quality response about .
Beck : animal hide , skin , rug Piotrowski : animal skin , skin rug ( 41 % ) Dana ( France ) : animal skin ( 46 % ) Texture is the dominant characteristic of card VI , which often elicits association related to interpersonal closeness ; it is specifically a " sex card " , its likely sexual percepts being reported more frequently than in any other card , even though other cards have a greater variety of commonly seen sexual contents .
Beck : human heads or faces ( top ) Piotrowski : heads of women or children ( 27 % , top ) Dana ( France ) : human head ( 46 % , top ) Card VII can be associated with femininity ( the human figures commonly seen in it being described as women or children ) , and function as a " mother card " , where difficulties in responding may be related to concerns with the female figures in the subject 's life .
The center detail is relatively often ( though not popularly ) identified as a vagina , which makes this card also relate to feminine sexuality in particular .
Beck : animal : not cat or dog ( pink ) Piotrowski : four - legged animal ( 94 % , pink ) Dana ( France ) : four - legged animal ( 93 % , pink )
People often express relief about card VIII , which lets them relax and respond effectively .
Similar to card V , it represents a " change of pace " ; however , the card introduces new elaboration difficulties , being complex and the first multi-colored card in the set .
Therefore , people who find processing complex situations or emotional stimuli distressing or difficult may be uncomfortable with this card .
Beck : human ( orange ) Piotrowski : none Dana ( France ) : none Characteristic of card IX is indistinct form and diffuse , muted chromatic features , creating a general vagueness .
There is only one popular response , and it is the least frequent of all cards .
Having difficulty with processing this card may indicate trouble dealing with unstructured data , but aside from this there are few particular " pulls " typical of this card .
Beck : crab , lobster , spider ( blue ) Piotrowski : crab , spider ( 37 % , blue ) ,
rabbit head ( 31 % , light green ) ,
caterpillars , worms , snakes ( 28 % , deep green ) Dana ( France ) : none Card X is structurally similar to card VIII , but its uncertainty and complexity are reminiscent of card IX : people who find it difficult to deal with many concurrent stimuli may not particularly like this otherwise pleasant card .
Being the last card , it may provide an opportunity for the subject to " sign out " by indicating what they feel their situation is like , or what they desire to know .
Usage
United States
The Rorschach test is used almost exclusively by psychologists .
Forensic psychologists use the Rorschach 36 % of the time . [ 78 ]
In custody cases , 23 % of psychologists use the Rorschach to examine a child . [ 79 ]
Another survey found that 124 out of 161 ( 77 % ) of clinical psychologists engaging in assessment services utilize the Rorschach , [ 80 ] and 80 % of psychology graduate programs teach its use . [ 81 ]
Another study found that its use by clinical psychologists was only 43 % , while it was used less than 24 % of the time by school psychologists . [ 78 ]
During World War II , United States Army Medical Corps chief psychiatrist Dr. Douglas Kelley and psychologist Gustave Gilbert administered the Rorschach test to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first Nuremberg trials . [ 82 ]
United Kingdom
Many psychologists in the United Kingdom do not trust its efficacy and it is rarely used . [ 83 ]
Although skeptical about its scientific validity , some psychologists use it in therapy and coaching " as a way of encouraging self - reflection and starting a conversation about the person 's internal world . " [ 23 ]
It is still used , however , by some mental health organisations such as the Tavistock Clinic . [ 84 ]
In a survey done in the year 2000 , 20 % of psychologists in correctional facilities used the Rorschach while 80 % used the MMPI . [ 85 ]
Japan
Shortly after publication of Rorschach 's book , a copy found its way to Japan where it was discovered by one of the country 's leading psychiatrists in a second - hand book store .
He was so impressed that he started a craze for the test that has never diminished . [ 86 ]
The Japanese Rorschach Society is by far the largest in the world and the test is " routinely put to a wide range of purposes " . [ 24 ]
In 2012 the test was described , by presenter Jo Fidgen , for BBC Radio 4's programme Dr Inkblot , as " more popular than ever " in Japan . [ 84 ]
Controversy
Some skeptics consider the Rorschach inkblot test pseudoscience , [ 8 ] [ 87 ] as several studies suggested that conclusions reached by test administrators since the 1950s were akin to cold reading . [ 88 ]
In the 1959 edition of Mental Measurement Yearbook , Lee Cronbach ( former President of the Psychometric Society and American Psychological Association ) [ 89 ] is quoted in a review : " The test has repeatedly failed as a prediction of practical criteria .
There is nothing in the literature to encourage reliance on Rorschach interpretations . "
In addition , major reviewer Raymond J. McCall writes ( p. 154 ) : " Though tens of thousands of Rorschach tests have been administered by hundreds of trained professionals since that time ( of a previous review ) , and while many relationships to personality dynamics and behavior have been hypothesized , the vast majority of these relationships have never been validated empirically , despite the appearance of more than 2,000 publications about the test . " [ 90 ]
A moratorium on its use was called for in 1999 . [ 91 ]
A 2003 report by Wood and colleagues had more mixed views : " More than 50 years of research have confirmed Lee J. Cronbach 's ( 1970 ) final verdict : that some Rorschach scores , though falling woefully short of the claims made by proponents , nevertheless possess ' validity greater than chance ' ( p. 636 ) . [...]
Its value as a measure of thought disorder in schizophrenia research is well accepted .
It is also used regularly in research on dependency , and , less often , in studies on hostility and anxiety .
Furthermore , substantial evidence justifies the use of the Rorschach as a clinical measure of intelligence and thought disorder . " [ 92 ]
Test materials
The basic premise of the test is that objective meaning can be extracted from responses to blots of ink which are supposedly meaningless .
Supporters of the Rorschach inkblot test believe that the subject 's response to an ambiguous and meaningless stimulus can provide insight into their thought processes , but it is not clear how this occurs .
Also , recent research shows that the blots are not entirely meaningless , and that a patient typically responds to meaningful as well as ambiguous aspects of the blots .
[ 7 ]
Reber ( 1985 ) describes the blots as merely " .. the vehicle for the interaction .. " between client and therapist , concluding : " .. the usefulness of the Rorschach will depend upon the sensitivity , empathy and insightfulness of the tester totally independently of the Rorschach itself .
An intense dialogue about the wallpaper or the rug would do as well provided that both parties believe . " [ 93 ]
Illusory and invisible correlations
In the 1960s , research by psychologists Loren and Jean Chapman showed that at least some of the apparent validity of the Rorschach was due to an illusion . [ 94 ] [ 95 ]
At that time , the five signs most often interpreted as diagnostic of homosexuality were 1 ) buttocks and anuses ; 2 ) feminine clothing ; 3 ) male or female sex organs ; 4 ) human figures without male or female features ; and 5 ) human figures with both male and female features . [ 95 ] [ 96 ]
The Chapmans surveyed 32 experienced testers about their use of the Rorschach to diagnose homosexuality .
At this time homosexuality was regarded as a psychopathology , and the Rorschach was the most popular projective test .
[ 6 ]
The testers reported that homosexual men had shown the five signs more frequently than heterosexual men . [ 95 ] [ 97 ]
Despite these beliefs , analysis of the results showed that heterosexual men were just as likely to report these signs , which were therefore totally ineffective for determining homosexuality . [ 94 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ]
The five signs did , however , match the guesses students made about which imagery would be associated with homosexuality . [ 96 ]
The Chapmans investigated the source of the testers ' false confidence .
In one experiment , students read through a stack of cards , each with a Rorschach blot , a sign and a pair of " conditions " ( which might include homosexuality ) .
The information on the cards was fictional , although subjects were told it came from case studies of real patients . [ 94 ]
The students reported that the five invalid signs were associated with homosexuality , even though the cards had been constructed so there was no association at all . [ 96 ] [ 97 ]
The Chapmans repeated this experiment with another set of cards , in which the association was negative ; the five signs were never reported by homosexuals .
The students still reported seeing a strong positive correlation . [ 6 ] [ 97 ]
These experiments showed that the testers ' prejudices could result in them " seeing " non-existent relationships in the data .
The Chapmans called this phenomenon " illusory correlation " and it has since been demonstrated in many other contexts . [ 94 ] [ 95 ]
A related phenomenon called " invisible correlation " applies when people fail to see a strong association between two events because it does not match their expectations . [ 95 ]
This was also found in clinicians ' interpretations of the Rorschach .
Homosexual men are more likely to see a monster on Card IV or a part- animal , part - human figure in Card V . [ 6 ] [ 96 ]
Almost all of the experienced clinicians in the Chapmans ' survey missed these valid signs . [ 6 ] [ 94 ]
The Chapmans ran an experiment with fake Rorschach responses in which these valid signs were always associated with homosexuality .
The subjects missed these perfect associations and instead reported that invalid signs , such as buttocks or feminine clothing , were better indicators . [ 94 ]
In 1992 , the psychologist Stuart Sutherland argued that these artificial experiments are easier than the real - world use of the Rorschach , and hence they probably underestimated the errors that testers were susceptible to .
He described the continuing popularity of the Rorschach after the Chapmans ' research as a " glaring example of irrationality among psychologists " . [ 94 ]
Tester projection
Some critics argue that the testing psychologist must also project onto the patterns .
A possible example sometimes attributed to the psychologist 's subjective judgement is that responses are coded ( among many other things ) , for " Form Quality " : in essence , whether the subject 's response fits with how the blot actually looks .
Superficially this might be considered a subjective judgment , depending on how the examiner has internalized the categories involved .
But with the Exner system of scoring , much of the subjectivity is eliminated or reduced by use of frequency tables that indicate how often a particular response is given by the population in general .
[ 7 ]
Another example is that the response " bra " was considered a " sex " response by male psychologists , but a " clothing " response by females . [ 98 ]
In Exner 's system , however , such a response is always coded as " clothing " unless there is a clear sexual reference in the response . [ 7 ]
Third parties could be used to avoid this problem , but the Rorschach 's inter - rater reliability has been questioned .
That is , in some studies the scores obtained by two independent scorers do not match with great consistency . [ 99 ]
This conclusion was challenged in studies using large samples reported in 2002 . [ 100 ]
Validity
When interpreted as a projective test , results are poorly verifiable .
The Exner system of scoring ( also known as the " Comprehensive System " ) is meant to address this , and has all but displaced many earlier ( and less consistent ) scoring systems .
It makes heavy use of what factor ( shading , color , outline , etc. ) of the inkblot leads to each of the tested person 's comments .
Disagreements about test validity remain : while the Exner proposed a rigorous scoring system , latitude remained in the actual interpretation , and the clinician 's write - up of the test record is still partly subjective .
[ 101 ] Reber ( 1985 ) comments " .. there is essentially no evidence whatsoever that the test has even a shred of validity . " [ 93 ]
Nevertheless , there is substantial research indicating the utility of the measure for a few scores .
Several scores correlate well with general intelligence .
One such scale is R , the total number of responses ; this reveals the questionable side - effect that more intelligent people tend to be elevated on many pathology scales , since many scales do not correct for high R : if a subject gives twice as many responses overall , it is more likely that some of these will seem " pathological " .
Also correlated with intelligence are the scales for Organizational Activity , Complexity , Form Quality , and Human Figure responses . [ 102 ]
The same source reports that validity has also been shown for detecting such conditions as schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders ; thought disorders ; and personality disorders ( including borderline personality disorder ) .
There is some evidence that the Deviant Verbalizations scale relates to bipolar disorder .
The authors conclude that " Otherwise , the Comprehensive System does n't appear to bear a consistent relationship to psychological disorders or symptoms , personality characteristics , potential for violence , or such health problems as cancer " .
[ 103 ]
( Cancer is mentioned because a small minority of Rorschach enthusiasts have claimed the test can predict cancer . ) [ 104 ]
Reliability
It is also thought [ by whom ? ] that the test 's reliability can depend substantially on details of the testing procedure , such as where the tester and subject are seated , any introductory words , verbal and nonverbal responses to subjects ' questions or comments , and how responses are recorded .
Exner has published detailed instructions , but Wood et al . [ 98 ] cites many court cases where these had not been followed .
Similarly , the procedures for coding responses are fairly well specified but extremely time - consuming leaving them very subject to the author 's style and the publisher to the quality of the instructions ( such as was noted with one of Bohm 's textbooks in the 1950s [ 105 ] ) as well as clinic workers ( which would include examiners ) being encouraged to cut corners . [ 106 ] [ 107 ]
United States courts have challenged the Rorschach as well .
Jones v Apfel ( 1997 ) stated ( quoting from Attorney 's Textbook of Medicine ) that Rorschach " results do not meet the requirements of standardization , reliability , or validity of clinical diagnostic tests , and interpretation thus is often controversial " .
[ 108 ]
In State ex rel H.H. ( 1999 ) where under cross-examination Dr. Bogacki stated under oath " many psychologists do not believe much in the validity or effectiveness of the Rorschach test " [ 108 ] and US v Battle ( 2001 ) ruled that the Rorschach " does not have an objective scoring system . " [ 108 ]
Population norms
Another controversial aspect of the test is its statistical norms .
Exner 's system was thought to possess normative scores for various populations .
But , beginning in the mid-1990s others began to try to replicate or update these norms and failed .
In particular , discrepancies seemed to focus on indices measuring narcissism , disordered thinking , and discomfort in close relationships .
[ 109 ]
Lilienfeld and colleagues , who are critical of the Rorschach , have stated that this proves that the Rorschach tends to " overpathologise normals " .
[ 109 ]
Although Rorschach proponents , such as Hibbard , [ 110 ] suggest that high rates of pathology detected by the Rorschach accurately reflect increasing psychopathology in society , the Rorschach also identifies half of all test - takers as possessing " distorted thinking " , [ 111 ] a false positive rate unexplained by current research .
The accusation of " over- pathologising " has also been considered by Meyer et al. ( 2007 ) .
They presented an international collaborative study of 4704 Rorschach protocols , obtained in 21 different samples , across 17 different countries , with only 2 % showing significant elevations on the index of perceptual and thinking disorder , 12 % elevated on indices of depression and hyper-vigilance and 13 % elevated on persistent stress overload — all in line with expected frequencies among non-patient populations . [ 112 ]
Applications
The test is also controversial because of its common use in court - ordered evaluations .[ citation needed ]
This controversy stems , in part , from the limitations of the Rorschach , with no additional data , in making official diagnoses from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV ) . [ 113 ]
Irving B. Weiner ( co- developer with John Exner of the Comprehensive system ) has stated that the Rorschach " is a measure of personality functioning , and it provides information concerning aspects of personality structure and dynamics that make people the kind of people they are .
Sometimes such information about personality characteristics is helpful in arriving at a differential diagnosis , if the alternative diagnoses being considered have been well conceptualized with respect to specific or defining personality characteristics " .
[ 114 ]
In the vast majority of cases , anyway , the Rorschach test was n't singled out but used as one of several in a battery of tests , [ 115 ] and despite the criticism of usage of the Rorschach in the courts , out of 8,000 cases in which forensic psychologists used Rorschach - based testimony , the appropriateness of the instrument was challenged only six times , and the testimony was ruled inadmissible in only one of those cases .
[ 81 ]
One study has found that use of the test in courts has increased by three times in the decade between 1996 and 2005 , compared to the previous fifty years .
[ 115 ]
Others however have found that its usage by forensic psychologists has decreased . [ 116 ]
Exner and others have claimed that the Rorschach test is capable of detecting suicidality .
[ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ]
Protection of test items and ethics
Psychologists object to the publication of psychological test material out of concerns that a patient 's test responses will be influenced ( " primed " ) by previous exposure .
The Canadian Psychological Association takes the position that , " Publishing the questions and answers to any psychological test compromises its usefulness " and calls for " keeping psychological tests out of the public domain . " [ 120 ]
The same statement quotes their president as saying , " The CPA 's concern is not with the publication of the cards and responses to the Rorschach test per se , for which there is some controversy in the psychological literature and disagreement among experts , but with the larger issue of the publication and dissemination of psychological test content " .
From a legal standpoint , the Rorschach test images have been in the public domain for many years in most countries , particularly those with a copyright term of up to 70 years post mortem auctoris .
They have been in the public domain in Hermann Rorschach 's native Switzerland since 1992 ( 70 years after the author 's death , or 50 years after the cut - off date of 1942 ) , according to Swiss copyright law . [ 121 ] [ 122 ]
They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law [ 123 ] [ 124 ] where all works published before 1923 are considered to be in the public domain . [ 125 ]
This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose .
William Poundstone was , perhaps , first to make them public in his 1983 book Big Secrets , where he also described the method of administering the test .[ citation needed ]
The American Psychological Association ( APA ) has a code of ethics that supports " freedom of inquiry and expression " and helping " the public in developing informed judgments " .
[ 126 ]
It claims that its goals include " the welfare and protection of the individuals and groups with whom psychologists work " , and it requires that psychologists " make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity and security of test materials " .
The APA has also raised concerns that the dissemination of test materials might impose " very concrete harm to the general public " .
It has not taken a position on publication of the Rorschach plates but noted " there are a limited number of standardized psychological tests considered appropriate for a given purpose " . [ 127 ]
A public statement by the British Psychological Society expresses similar concerns about psychological tests ( without mentioning any test by name ) and considers the " release of [ test ] materials to unqualified individuals " to be misuse if it is against the wishes of the test publisher . [ 128 ]
In his 1998 book Ethics in Psychology , Gerald Koocher notes that some believe " reprinting copies of the Rorschach plates ... and listing common responses represents a serious unethical act " for psychologists and is indicative of " questionable professional judgment " .
[ 129 ]
Other professional associations , such as the Italian Association of Strategic Psychotherapy , recommend that even information about the purpose of the test or any detail of its administration should be kept from the public , even though " cheating " the test is held to be practically impossible . [ 130 ]
On September 9 , 2008 , Hogrefe attempted to claim copyright over the Rorschach ink blots during filings of a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization against the Brazilian psychologist Ney Limonge .
These complaints were denied . [ 131 ]
Further complaints were sent to two other websites that contained information similar to the Rorschach test in May 2009 by legal firm Schluep and Degen of Switzerland . [ 132 ] [ 133 ]
Psychologists have sometimes refused to disclose tests and test data to courts when asked to do so by the parties citing ethical reasons ; it is argued that such refusals may hinder full understanding of the process by the attorneys , and impede cross-examination of the experts .
APA ethical standard 1.23 ( b ) states that the psychologist has a responsibility to document processes in detail and of adequate quality to allow reasonable scrutiny by the court . [ 134 ]
Controversy ensued in the psychological community in 2009 when the original Rorschach plates and research results on interpretations were published in the " Rorschach test " article on Wikipedia . [ 135 ]
Hogrefe & Huber Publishing , a German company that sells editions of the plates , called the publication " unbelievably reckless and even cynical of Wikipedia " and said it was investigating the possibility of legal action .
[ 135 ]
Due to this controversy an edit filter was temporarily established on Wikipedia to prevent the removal of the plates . [ 136 ]
James Heilman , an emergency room physician involved in the debate , compared it to the publication of the eye test chart : though people are likewise free to memorize the eye chart before an eye test , its general usefulness as a diagnostic tool for eyesight has not diminished .
[ 135 ]
For those opposed to exposure , publication of the inkblots is described as a " particularly painful development " , given the tens of thousands of research papers which have , over many years , " tried to link a patient ’s responses to certain psychological conditions . " [ 135 ]
Controversy over Wikipedia 's publication of the inkblots has resulted in the blots being published in other locations , such as The Guardian [ 137 ] and The Globe and Mail . [ 138 ]
Later that year [ when ? ] two psychologists filed a complaint against Heilman with the Saskatchewan medical licensing board , arguing that his uploading of the images constituted unprofessional behavior . [ 139 ]
In 2012 two articles were published showing consequences of the publication of the images in Wikipedia .
The first one studied negative attitudes towards the test generated during the Wikipedia - Rorschach debate , [ 140 ] while the second suggested that reading the Wikipedia article could help to fake " good " results in the test . [ 141 ]
Publication of the Rorschach images is also welcomed by critics who consider the test to be pseudoscience .
Benjamin Radford , editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine , stated that the Rorschach " has remained in use more out of tradition than good evidence " and was hopeful that publication of the test might finally hasten its demise . [ 142 ]

Notes
According to the L.A
Times late last year , nearly 70 percent of Californians drink bottled water .
And by the end of this year , bottled water will have moved past milk , coffee and beer to become the second most popular beverage behind soft drinks , according to the Beverage Marketing Corp .
I did write some time last year about the sheer insanity of transporting bottled water across the globe and apart from the trail of fossil fuels burned and greenhouse gases emitted , the most spectacular result is that manufacturing and transporting that 1 - kg bottle uses 6.74 kg of water ( 7 times more than the content of the bottle ! )
So much for careless wastefulness , and if that does not convince you then BPA will .
University of Missouri - Columbia researcher Frederick vom Saal , a professor of reproductive biology and neurobiology , is quoted in Missouri Resources ( Winter 2008 , p. 15 ) that traces of Bisphenol - A have been found " in nearly every American tested for it and that tests on laboratory animals found it produces a long list of ailments . "
Aluminum bottles are also a danger , as they require a special chemical coating that often peels off into the water you drink .
That chemical ?
None other than our old fiend , bisphenol A. Bottled water 's popularity is fueled in part by suspicions over the quality of tap water .
Frankly , I think local authorities should blitz the media with a barrage of advertising spots on the true qualities of tap water .
Let me state a few known facts , taken from various Eco sites such as the Earth911.com , us.oneworld.net , commondreams.org , web.md.com , filterforgood.com , earthpolicy.org , and a host of others such as Grist , Greenpeace et all : the average price of a liter of bottled water varies from $ 1.50 to $ 2.50 , more for luxury brands such as Fiji , which means that it is roughly 2,000 times more expensive than tap water ( depending on your water rates ) .
The average person in the US spends $ 400 per year ( $ 300 in the EU ) .
The latest bottled water " census " tells us that 26,000,000,000 units are sold in the North America each year ( I can't find reliable figures for the entire world and I 'm certain that it would make our heads spin !
Check this pdf for bottled water consumption country by country , from 1999 to 2004 )
Of these 26,000,000,000 bottles , 86 % find their way into landfills ( and quite a fews get thrown into the sea ) .
According to the Earth Policy Institute 1,500 bottles are discarded every effing second !
26,000,000,000 plastic bottles mean that it took 17,000,000 barrels of oil to produce , enough to power 100,000 automobiles for a year .
26,000,000,000 also means that at least 2,550,000 tons of carbon dioxide were emitted on top of other pollutants .
Oh , and by the way , bottled water is not safer than tap water .
You should read this article from the good folks at Food &WaterWatch .
“ It took us many years to acquire this product catalog and we offer it to all enthusiasts like ourselves who value the research and details into our past .
I hope the information can be useful to the many Brunswick Bar owners looking for details and specifics ”

The Miraculous Effects of Cutting Back on Meat BY : KATHY FRESTON
Apr 24 , NEW YORK ( HUFFINGTON POST )  Arguments against meat - eating .
My first post on the effect of eating meat on the environment ( see below ) provoked quite a bit of discussion , so in honor of Earth Day , I thought I should follow up with more information about how our natural resources ( e.g. , air , water , and soil ) are depleted and devastated by animal agriculture .
Of course , Earth Day is also a good time to remember that animal agriculture only exists at these levels because people are purchasing vast quantities of chicken , beef , pork , and fish .
The market for meat ( i.e. , we , the consumers ) drives the depletion and destruction .
* Excrement produced by chickens , pigs , and other farm animals : 16.6 billion tons per year -- more than a million pounds per second ( that 's 60 times as much as is produced by the world 's human population -- farmed animals produce more waste in one day than the U.S. human population produces in 31Z2 years ) .
This excrement is a major cause of air and water pollution .
According to the United Nations : " The livestock sector is ... the largest sectoral source of water pollution , contributing to eutrophication , ' dead ' zones in coastal areas , degradation of coral reefs , human health problems , emergence of antibiotic resistance and many others . "
*
Water used for farmed animals and irrigating feed crops : 240 trillion gallons per year -- 7.5 million gallons per second ( that 's enough for every human to take 8 showers a day , or as much as is used by Europe , Africa , and South America combined ) .
According to the UN : " [t ] he water used by the sector exceeds 8 percent of the global human water use . "
As just one example , " [ O ] n average 990 litres of water are required to produce one litre of milk . "
So drinking milk instead of tap water requires almost 1,000 times as much water .
* Emissions of greenhouse gases from raising animals for food :
The equivalent of 7.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , according to the UN report .
Concludes the UN : " The livestock sector is ... responsible for 18 % of greenhouse gas emissions .. "
That 's about 40 percent more than all the cars , trucks , planes , trains , and ships in the world combined ( transport is 13 % ) .
And " The sector emits 37 % of anthropogenic methane ( with 23 times the global warming potential -- or GWP - - of CO2 ) ...
It emits 65 % of anthropogenic nitrous oxide ( with 296 times the GWP of CO2 ) .
These figures are based on the power of these gases over 100 years ; in fact , over 20 years -- a more important timeframe for dealing with global warming -- methane and nitrous oxide are 72 times and 289 times more warming than CO2 .
And Dr. Rajendra Pachauri , Chair of the IPCC ( which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore ) has been saying that the 18 % figure is probably an underestimate .
*
It takes more than 11 times as much fossil fuel to make one calorie of animal protein as it does to make one calorie of plant protein .
* Soil erosion due to growing livestock feed : 40 billion tons per year ( or 6 tons / year for every human being on the planet -- of course if you do n't eat meat , none of this is attributed to you ; if you 're in the U.S. where we eat lots more meat than most of the world , your contribution is many times greater than 6 tons / year ) .
About 60 % of soil that is washed away ends up in rivers , streams and lakes , making waterways more prone to flooding and to contamination from soil 's fertilizers and pesticides .
Erosion increases the amount of dust carried by wind , polluting the air and carrying infection and disease .
* Land used to raise animals for food : 10 billion acres .
According to the UN : " In all , livestock production accounts for 70 percent of all agricultural land and 30 percent of the land surface of the planet . "
And " 70 percent of previous forested land in the Amazon is occupied by pastures , and feedcrops cover a large part of the remainder . "
And " About 20 percent of the world 's pastures and rangelands , with 73 percent of rangelands in dry areas , have been degraded to some extent , mostly through overgrazing , compaction and erosion created by livestock action . "
* According to the UN , animal agriculture is a leading case of water pollution .
The main water pollutants in the US are sediments and nutrients ..
Animal agriculture is responsible for 55 percent of the erosion that causes sedimentation , and for a third of the main nutrient pollutants , nitrogen and phosphorous .
On top of that , animal agriculture is the source of more than a third of the United States ' water pollution from pesticides , and half of its water pollution from antibiotics .
* Livestock are also responsible for almost two - thirds of anthropogenic ammonia emissions , which contribute significantly to acid rain and acidification of ecosystems .
* Grain and corn raised for livestock feed that could otherwise feed people , according to the UN : 836 million tons per year ( note that the more commonly used figure , 758 million tons , is metric ) .
That 's more than 7 times the amount used for biofuels and is much more than enough to adequately feed the 1.4 billion humans who are living in dire poverty , and the number does n't even include the fact that almost all of the global soy crop ( about 240 million tons of soy ) is also fed to chickens , pigs , and other farmed animals .
*
An American saves more global warming pollution by going vegan than by switching their car to a hybrid Prius .
* Razing the Amazon rainforest for pasture and feed crops : 5 million acres of Amazon per year .
Former Amazon rainforest converted to raising animals for food since 1970 is more than 90 % of all Amazon deforestation since 1970 .
* According to the UN : " Indeed , the livestock sector may well be the leading player in the reduction of biodiversity . .. "
And " [ l ] ivestock now account for about 20 percent of the total terrestrial animal biomass , and the 30 percent of the earth 's land surface that they now pre-empt was once habitat for wildlife . "
And " Conservation International has identified 35 global hotspots for biodiversity , characterized by exceptional levels of plant endemism and serious levels of habitat loss .
Of these , 23 are reported to be affected by livestock production .
An analysis of the authoritative World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) Red List of Threatened Species shows that most of the world 's threatened species are suffering habitat loss where livestock are a factor . "
United Nations scientists , in their 408 - page indictment of the meat industry , sum up these statistics , pointing out that the meat industry is " one of the ... most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems , at every scale from local to global , " including " problems of land degradation , climate change and air pollution , water shortage and water pollution , and loss of biodiversity .
" Perhaps it 's time to explore vegetarianism .

RED MEAT VS CHICKEN : AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE FALSE DISTINCTION By Kathy Freston
Huffington Post April 14 , 2009 Nicholas Kristof 's column on Wednesday discusses the recent work by animal activists on behalf of chickens and pigs , and the degree to which " animal rights are now firmly on the mainstream ethical agenda " in the United States , as they have been for some years in Europe .
I am delighted to see from Mr. Kristof yet another thoughtful essay about a moral issue that is , until recently , not widely discussed , and even more pleased that in discussing the cruelties of modern intensive farms , he is focusing on birds .
You see , people often tell me that they 've given up eating red meat out of concern for animals , the environment , or their health ( or all three ) .
Of course all efforts to make the world a kinder and less polluted place should be applauded .
But here 's the thing : cutting out red meat while still eating chicken does n't address the whole problem .
Here 's why : Both choices -- beef and chicken -- badly damage the environment , so choosing one or the other is sort of like the difference between driving a huge SUV and a Hummer .
That 's also why I 'm a little baffled when some environmental organizations say that cutting out beef is advisable , but eating other meats is " relatively " ok .
It 's really not .
On the issue of global warming , all animal agriculture is a nightmare , relative to producing grains and beans .
In a 400 page report from the United Nation 's Food and Agricultural Organization , Livestock 's Long Shadow , scientists conclude that the business of raising animals for food is responsible for about 18 percent of all warming -- in fact meat causes about 40 percent more warming than all cars , trucks , and planes combined .
That is in part because turning animals into meat requires many stages of ( energy intensive and polluting ) production ( i.e. , transporting feed , animals , and meat ; running feed mills , factory farms , and slaughterhouses ; refrigerating carcasses during transport and in grocery stores -- chickens are at least as energy consumptive as cattle for all these stages ) , compared to plant foods .
Environmental Defense calculated that if every American skipped one meal of chicken per week and substituted vegetarian foods instead , the carbon dioxide savings would be the same as taking more than half a million cars off of U.S. roads .
Imagine if we dropped all meat from our diets altogether .
And it 's not just global warming , of course :
In a story about chicken waste pollution , the New York Times reported in November that " [ a ] lthough the dairy and hog industry in states near the bay produce more pounds of manure , poultry waste has more than twice the concentration of pollutants per pound . "
I assume that 's in part because poultry are given a lot more drugs than pigs and cattle -- because they 're kept in even worse conditions and thus require more drugs .
When you have the attorney general of a state like Oklahoma battling poultry producers over the industry " wreak[ing ] havoc in the 1 - million - acre Illinois River watershed , turning it into a murky , sludgy mess , " it seems pretty clear ( to me ) that environmentalists might want to think again about putting that product into even a " relatively " favorable category .
So it makes more sense to cut down on meat altogether , in favor of a more plant based diet , rather than trying to sort out which meats are relatively better or worse .
And we can do so in stages .
For example , after looking at the health and environmental problems associated with chicken , beef , and pork , New York Times food writer Mark Bittman ( in his superb new book Food Matters ) suggests eating exclusively plant - based foods until 6 p.m. , and then eating whatever you want for dinner .
I know people who have tried this sort of plan , and they find -- quickly -- that they 're eating more and more vegetarian food , even during the times when they eat whatever they want .
Writes Bittman , " By reducing the amount of meat we eat , we can grow and kill fewer animals .
That means less environmental damage , including climate change ; fewer antibiotics in the water and food supplies ; fewer pesticides and herbicides ; reduced cruelty ; and so on .
It also means better health for you . "
Similarly , the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health leads the " Meatless Mondays " campaign , which is supported by 28 other public health schools .
Their goal is to cut Americans ' meat - consumption , in order to lessen our risk for heart disease , cancer , diabetes , obesity , and so on .
And of course , they rightly impugn all meat , not just " red " meat .
Although he vigorously advocates vegetarianism , the much adored Buddhist monk and Zen master , Thich Nhat Hanh , writes in his latest book that " [ i ] f you 're not able to entirely stop eating meat , you can still decide to make an effort to cut back .
By cutting meat out of your diet ten or even five days a month , you will already be performing a miracle -- a miracle that will help solve the problem of hunger in the developing world and dramatically reduce greenhouse gases . "
These suggestions from Bittman , Johns Hopkins , and Thich Nhat Hanh strike me as much better half - measure alternatives to picking between various meats .
For those who want to do well by the environment , have more robust health , and consider the welfare of animals , the solution is not to just give up eating red meat , but rather lean away from eating animal products - chicken included - altogether .
A few things to remember : * for animals the poultry industry is much worse than the beef or pork industries ; * for your health , it 's a toss up at best ; * and for the environment , the poultry industry may not be quite as bad on global warming , but it 's still bad , and it appears to be even worse in categories like water and air pollution .

July 4 , 2009 -- Green Left Weekly --
On July 1 , the Rupert Murdoch - owned national daily the Australian carried an extraordinary attack by Ilan Grapel on Green Left Weekly and its monthly Arabic - language insert the Flame titled “ A willing ally to Hamas ’s hatred ” .
The Flame and Green Left Weekly are guilty of a “ radical anti-Israel stance ” , Grapel said .
Grapel is a researcher with the Australian / Israel and Jewish Affairs Council .
Grapel alleges that the Flame , “ unbeknown to its English readers ” , also “ supports terrorist groups and promotes violence ” , and through the Flame , GLW is “ openly promoting extremism ” .
Grapel relies on a few selected quotes from the Flame that defend the right of Palestinians to resist Israel ’s illegal occupation — a right recognised by international law — to argue the Flame promotes “ terrorism ” .
The issue of the Flame he takes these quotes from was produced in January , as Israel ’s bombs , including banned chemical weapons , rained down on Gazan civilians .
Apparently , this is not “ terrorism ” to Grapel .
The Flame and GLW both disagree .
Grapel relies on selected quotes , minus their context , in a language most readers of the Australian do n’t speak to suggest something sinister .
He is playing on anti-Arab sentiment that exists in some quarters to feed suspicions that anything in Arabic is likely to promote fundamentalist extremism .
In fact , the team of Sudanese refugees who produce the Flame themselves fled from persecution at the hands of the repressive Islamic regime in Sudan .
They are victims of the sort of Islamic fundamentalism Grapel disingenuously accuses them of supporting in Palestine .
The Flame ’s only crime is to support the Palestinian people against oppression and occupation .
This is the same position that GLW holds .
This is not “ extremism ” .
Israel ’s illegal occupation is in violation of international law and hundreds of United Nations resolutions .
Supporters of Israel regularly seek to deflect legitimate criticism of Israel ’s appalling human rights record by labelling detractors as supporters of terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism .
Such tactics are designed to intimidate and stifle dissent .
But the big problem is that these tactics are not working .
Israel is more isolated than ever .
A worldwide boycott , sanctions and divestment campaign against Israel — inspired by similar tactics employed against the South African apartheid regime — is beginning to hurt the Israeli economy .
Sympathy with the Palestinian cause is growing in Australia .
A June 2009 Roy Morgan poll commissioned by the Sydney - based Coalition for Justice and Peace in Palestine and the Adelaide - based Australian Friends of Palestine found many more Australians consider the Israeli military action in Gaza in January unjustified ( 42 % ) than justified ( 29 % ) .
More respondents sympathised with Palestine ( 28 % ) than Israel ( 24.5 % ) .
The barefaced brutality of Israel ’s December - January war on Gaza , in which more than 1300 civilians were killed , shifted world opinion further away from Israel .
Record numbers , in the millions , protested Israel ’s war in cities around the world .
Contrary to the claims of its defenders , Israel is no more a democracy than apartheid South Africa was .
It was founded on the ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians .
Those Palestinians who remain in Israel are second - class citizens , while those driven out are denied the right to return .
Israel ’s deputy prime minister Avigdor Lieberman said in an October 2006 interview that , “ when there is a contradiction between democratic and Jewish values , the Jewish and Zionist values are more important ” .
Lieberman spoke aloud what has been the unspoken policy of successive Israeli governments .
In January , Israeli academic Ilan Pappe wrote : “ It seems that even the most horrendous crimes , such as the genocide in Gaza , are treated as desperate events , unconnected to anything that happened in the past and not associated with any ideology or system …
Very much as the apartheid ideology explained the oppressive policies of the South African government , this ideology — in its most consensual and simplistic variety — has allowed all the Israeli governments in the past and the present to dehumanise the Palestinians wherever they are and strive to destroy them . ”
Finding it hard to defend such actions , Israel ’s supporters , like Grapel , resort to attempts to demonise opponents of Israel ’s crimes .
However , Grapel clearly had difficulty in finding evidence in GLW or the Flame to back up his allegations .
He failed to quote a single sentence from the Flame advocating terrorism .
Rather , he offered his own interpretations of a few selected words and phrases .
A reference in support of the Palestinian resistance to what Amnesty International called a “ wanton and deliberate ” assault on Gaza is really a “ euphemism for terrorist violence ” , Grapel decided .
Criticism of the region ’s US - allied Arab dictatorships for collaborating with Israel in its siege and war on Gaza somehow becomes “ implicit calls for other Arab states to expand the Gaza war ” .
GLW and the Flame stand for peace in Palestine .
It is Israel that prevents peace by denying freedom and justice for the long - suffering Palestinian people .

In the company 's quarterly financial results briefing , Nintendo boss Satoru Iwata confessed that , yeah , internally no one believes that Nintendo 's E3 2009 briefing was anything to shout about , either .
Advertisement
Says Iwata :
As for the media briefing at E3 , of course we had many internal discussions after that .
Honestly speaking , none of us at Nintendo thought that our presentation at E3 was as good as it could have been .
It is apparent that we could not fully convey the charm of our products .

Iwata singles out the new Super Mario Bros .
Wii demonstration as especially less - than - whelming .
This year , however , with the New Super Mario Bros .
Wii , four people lined up with Wii Remotes was not a scene that no one had ever seen .
Those who actually had the chance to play understood how the game would change with four people playing simultaneously , but we could not address that fun sentiment at the media briefing .
Iwata goes on to say that , in the future , Nintendo 's press briefing strategy may be fine - tuned to deliver impact to those watching online - in other words , you , the interested consumer , and not the media per se .
Wonder if they noticed this ?
Now we strongly feel that we need to look into finding a better way to demonstrate the products ' appeal better at E3 in these times where more people are watching it online via web cast not only in the U.S. but all around the world , than the number of audience who actually watch it in the theatre .

Recapping : Golden Sun DS , Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid : Other M were really the only big splashes for Nintendo this year - Wii Sports Resort and its sales since notwithstanding .
The Vitality Sensor was an absolutely bottom - out dud that left many people wondering , almost seriously , if Nintendo was trolling the press .
The briefing still was an improvement above the ghastly presser from 2008 , although the lack of any gamechanger during a show that featured heavyweight bombs dropped by Microsoft and Sony seems almost , comparatively speaking , worse .
Iwata 's candor , for a chief executive , is refreshing .
Whether it results in , next year , his company coming off like something better than the hip - to - it parent of video games , we shall see .

With just a few weeks of training , you can learn to " see " objects in the dark using echolocation the same way dolphins and bats do .
Ordinary people with no special skills can use tongue clicks to visualize objects by listening to the way sound echoes off their surroundings , according to acoustic experts at the University of Alcalá de Henares in Spain .
" Two hours per day for a couple of weeks are enough to distinguish whether you have an object in front of you , " Juan Antonio Martinez said in a press release .
" Within another couple weeks you can tell the difference between trees and pavement . "
To master the art of echolocation , all you have to do is learn to make special clicks with your tongue and palate , and then learn to recognize slight changes in the way the clicks sound depending on what objects are nearby .
Martinez and his colleagues are developing a system to teach people how to use echolocation , a skill that could be particularly useful for the blind and for people who work under dark or smoky conditions , like firefighters — or cat burglars .
Most animals that use echolocation have organs that are specifically adapted to emit and receive sonar signals , but we humans have to rely on our rather clumsy mouth and ears .
For instance , while dolphins use a special structure in their nose to generate up to 200 clicks per second , people can make only three or four clicks per second .
By studying the physical properties of the many different sounds the human mouth can produce , the Spanish researchers hope to maximize the power of human echolocation .
In their latest study , published in a recent issue of the journal Acta Acustica united with Acustica , the group taught 10 of their students and colleagues to use basic echolocation .
Then they compared different noises and clicks to determine the best type of sound for " seeing " your surroundings .
" The almost ideal sound is the ' palate click , ' " said Martinez in a press release , " a click made by placing the tip of the tongue on the palate , just behind the teeth , and moving it quickly backwards . "
The palate click is better than other sounds , because it can be made in a uniform way , works at a lower intensity , and does n't get drowned out by ambient noise .
But there are a few drawbacks to human echolocation – like cotton mouth .
" The quality of the sound tends to degrade after a few minutes of constant performance , " the researchers wrote , " due to progressive dryness of the mouth . "
Luckily , clicks cause less dryness than other sounds , because you do n't have to exhale to make a click – which also means the sound does n't interfere with breathing .
Martinez is n't the first to recognize the potential for echolocation in humans .
At least two examples of blind people who have taught themselves to echolocate have made headlines in the past few years , and audiologist Peter Scheifele of the University of Cincinnati has studied these unusual cases .
" Acoustically , according to laws of physics , it ’s certainly possible to make a pulse that will tell you something about objects in front of you , such as fences , garbage cans or basketballs , " Scheifele said .
How much detail a person can " see " with echolocation depends not only on the speed of their clicks , he said , but also on the frequency .
The higher the frequency , the more precise details you can see .
Scheifele has only worked with blind people who can echolocate , but he agrees that others could probably learn the skill .
" My gut tells me if you can do it if you ’re blind , you can do it if you can see , " he said .
" Half the battle is really trying to get yourself in the groove of ' I can do this if I try . '
We tend to be more visual animals than acoustic , and people do n’t usually do it because there 's not a need for it . "

Introducing the Game of Life screensaver with the highest system requirements in history !
But it may be one of the fastest ....
This Life screensaver runs almost entirely on your graphics card .
The logic is written as an OpenGL shader , with just a bit of extra programming to glue it all together .
This screensaver gets 22 fps on my PowerBook G4 running at a 1 x zoom fullscreen at 1280x854 while using only 10 % of the CPU .
Because it 's a shader , and a rather complicated shader , it needs a hefty graphics card to work .
Almost anything made since 2005 or so should work fine .
So far , it 's been tested and known to work on these cards :
ATI Mobility Radeon 9700
ATI Mobility Radeon 9600
ATI Mobility Radeon 9200
ATI Radeon 9200
ATI Radeon 9600 Pro
ATI Radeon 9600 XT
ATI Radeon X800
NVIDIA GeForce FX Go5200
NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200
NVIDIA GeForce 6200A/NV44A
ATI x1600
MacBook integrated graphics ( very slow )
If you have one of these cards , or something better , it will probably work fine .
If you do n't , it may not .
However , the worst that can happen is that it wo n't work .
If your screen comes out pure black , or pure white , or never changes , it 's probably because of the graphics card .
GPULife runs on all Intel Macs , although the integrated graphics in the MacBook , Mini , and low - end iMac do not perform well .
It runs with great blazing speed on all of the others .
If it works on your older ( PowerPC pre -G5 ) video card and your card is not on this list , please e-mail me so I can update the list .
Download
Download GPULife ( 26 kB ) - Requires Mac OS X 10.4 ( possibly higher ) and a hefty video card .
After downloading , double - click the GPULife . saver file .
It will open System Preferences and prompt you to install the screensaver .
Open Source
• Adds full compatibility with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard .
GPULife is open source .
To check out the current source code you will need a copy of Subversion , then execute this command : svn co http://www.mikeash.com/svn/GPULife .
You can also browse the source code .
GPULife is released under the MIT License .
For questions , comments , support , etc. , e-mail Michael Ash .
Options
Limit framerate :
This option allows you to limit the rate at which the screensaver updates , to keep from using 100 % of your graphics card 's power .
If unchecked , the screensaver will run as fast as your hardware will allow .
If checked , you can set a maximum framerate using the slider and textbox to the right .
Show framerate :
If checked , the current framerate will be displayed in the lower left corner of your screen .
Zoom :
This allows you to control the zoom factor of the screensaver ; at 1 , one pixel is one Life cell .
Initial fill :
When the screensaver starts , the field is filled with a random assortment of live and dead cells .
This slider control the proportion of live cells .
Both extremes are likely to rapidly result in a very dead space ; best results are found in the middle .
Add random cells ( per step ) :
The screensaver will add the given number of live cells to the grid at every step .
A small number of random cells can keep the grid from stagnating into still or repeating forms .
Corner colors : Liven up your screensaver by setting custom colors for the live cells .
Dead cells are always black .
Colors that are too close to black can confuse the engine , so dark are automatically brightened slightly .
What is Life ?
More properly called Conway 's Game of Life , Life is a cellular automaton .
It 's a computer simulation which takes place on a grid ; each square in the grid is a cell which is either alive or dead .
In Life , each cell counts its eight neighbors ( four cardinal directions plus diagonals ) .
If a live cell has two or three neighbors , it stays alive , otherwise it dies .
If a dead cell has three neighbors , it is born , otherwise it stays dead .
Through these simple rules , complex patterns evolve .

At a time when water supplies are scarce in many areas of the United States , scientists in Minnesota are reporting that production of bioethanol -- often regarded as the clean - burning energy source of the future -- may consume up to three times more water than previously thought .
Their study appeared in ACS ' journal Environmental Science & Technology .
Sangwon
Suh and colleagues point out in the study that annual bioethanol production in the U.S. is currently about 9 billion gallons and note that experts expect it to increase in the near future .
The growing demand for bioethanol , particularly corn- based ethanol , has sparked significant concerns among researchers about its impact on water availability .
Previous studies estimated that a gallon of corn - based bioethanol requires the use of 263 to 784 gallons of water from the farm to the fuel pump .
But these estimates failed to account for widely varied regional irrigation practices , the scientists say .
The scientists made a new estimate of bioethanol 's impact on the water supply using detailed irrigation data from 41 states .
They found that bioethanol 's water requirements can be as high as 861 billion gallons of water from the corn field to the fuel pump in 2007 .
And a gallon of ethanol may require up to over 2,100 gallons of water from farm to fuel pump , depending on the regional irrigation practice in growing corn .
However , a dozen states in the Corn Belt consume less than 100 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol , making them better suited for ethanol production .
" The results highlight the need to take regional specifics into account when implementing biofuel mandates , " the article notes .

TOKYO ( AP )  Tomoji Tanabe , the world 's oldest man , died in his sleep at his home in southern Japan on Friday , a city official said .
He was 113 .
" He died peacefully .
His family members were with him , " said Junko Nakao , a city official in Miyakonojo on Japan 's southern island of Kyushu .
Tanabe died of heart failure , she said .
Tanabe , who was born on Sept. 18 , 1895 , had eight children — five sons and three daughters .
The former city land surveyor also had 25 grandchildren , 53 great - grandchildren , and six great - great - grandchildren , according to a statement from Miyakonojo city .
He was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world 's oldest man when he was 111 years old .
Guinness said Briton Henry Allingham , whose 113th birthday was June 6 , is now the world 's oldest man .
Allingham , one of only two surviving World War I veterans in Britain , lives in a nursing home near Brighton in southern England .
Tanabe lived with his fifth son and daughter - in - law .
His favorite meals were fried shrimp and Japanese miso soup with clams , the city statement said .
Tanabe drank milk every morning and read the newspaper .
He also avoided alcohol and did not smoke , it said .
The city 's mayor , Makoto Nagamine , said Tanabe was " the symbol of the Miyakonojo known as a city of long life . "
" I feel very saddened by his death , " Nagamine said in a statement .
" He cheered many citizens . "
Japanese people have among the world 's longest life expectancies — nearly 86 years for women and 79 years for men — which is often attributed to the country 's healthy diet , rich in fish and rice .
The number of Japanese living past 100 has more than doubled in the last six years , reaching a record 36,000 people in 2008 .
The centenarian ranks are dominated by women , who make up 86 % of the total .
Japan 's centenarian population is expected to reach nearly 1 million — the world 's largest — by 2050 , according to U.N. projections .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Commercial real estate is the new Achilles heel for the U.S. banking sector , said Janet Yellen , the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank on Tuesday .
" The next area of significant vulnerability for the banking system , particularly for community and regional banks with real estate concentrations , is income - producing office , warehouse and retail commercial property , " Yellen told a bankers conference in Idaho .
" Our biggest concern now is with maturing loans on depreciated commercial properties , " Yellen said .
Borrowers are going to have trouble coming up with additional equity to refinance the properties , Yellen said .
And underwriting and pricing must be adjusted to reflect current market conditions , she said .
Heartbreak of Foreclosure for Hotels
" The economic forces hammering commercial property are unlikely to reverse anytime soon , " Yellen said .
The sector is just one more example of regulatory failure .
Washington has been talking to banks about commercial real estate for years with little to show for it .
Many banks failed to implement risk management steps outlined by regulators in 2006 , Yellen said .
Yellen urged banks to " plan for the worst and use caution . "
But they should continue to make loans to creditworthy borrowers .
Inflation
Concern that the massive federal budget deficit will cause inflation is misplaced , Yellen said .
Deficits do n't cause inflation , she said .
Instead , the worry is that they will cause higher interest rates .
" Right now , private investment spending is extremely weak , so financing for the large federal deficits is readily available .
But once private spending recovery , the competitions for funds between the government and private sectors could drive interest rates up , " Yellen said .
" I expect core inflation to remain below 2 % for several more years , " Yellen said .
Australia 's leading criminologist thinks online scams have escalated to such a point that first - time users of computers should have to earn a licence to surf the web .
Russel Smith , principal criminologist at the Australian Institute of Criminology said the concept of a " computer drivers licence " should be taken seriously as an option for combating internet - related crime .
" There 's been some discussion in Europe about the use of what 's called a computer drivers licence - where you have a standard set of skills people should learn before they start using computers , " Dr Smith told iTnews .
" At the moment we have drivers licences for cars , and cars are very dangerous machines .
Computers are also quite dangerous in the way that they can make people vulnerable to fraud .
" In the future we might want to think about whether it 's necessary there be some sort of compulsory education of people before they start using computers , " he said .
The Australian Computer Society launched computer driver 's licences in 1999 .
It aimed to give users a basic level of competency before they started using PCs .
But the growth in cybercrime has led to IT security experts such as Eugene Kaspersky to call for more formalised recognition of a user 's identity so they can travel the net safely .
Last week Dr Smith sat in front of a Federal Government Inquiry into cyber crime and advised Australia 's senior politicians on initiatives in train to fight cybercrime .
He said that education was secondary to better technology solutions .
" I think at the starting point of it you need manufacturers of both hardware and software to devise technology that makes it difficult or impossible for people to be defrauded , " Dr Smith said .
" And the main development in that area , I suppose , is the use of biometrics where you have fingerprint scanners or some biometric linked in with the authentication processes on computers " .
Dr Smith said that the use of chip and pin credit cards had been a " very effective development " in Europe .
" I think when that happens in Australia we will be much better off , " he said .
The banks are " being kind "
Dr Smith also said that Australia 's banks were " being kind " when they bore the costs of cyber crime .
" There 's a code of conduct for electronic transactions and under that code if people suffer a loss through an electronic transaction and there 's no evidence that they 've been implicated in anyway , then the banks undertake to compensate that individual , " he said .
" Some people probably are partially responsible to what happens to them if they 've done something very silly or negligent .
" What that really means is that the banks are suffering a loss and eventually that money will be put on the cost of running the banking system .
Consumers probably end up paying at the end of the day . "
It was a beautiful night for XFO ’s “ Outdoor War ” .
The temperature was perfect , coupled with a slight , soothing breeze as MMA fans sat on chairs in the sand to watch 2 full cards for XFO 31 .
Big Poppa
Schnake was on the mic and in rare form as many MMA luminaries came out to see the action .
Tim Sylvia , Jeff Curran , Clay Guida and Stephan Bonnar were all in attendance , and the card did not disappoint .
WEC and KOTC vet Dave Terrel looked dominant in his first fight in more than a year .
There was n’t a hint of ring rust as he battered around Team No Ego ’s Brent Mehrhoff , needing less than a minute to win by TKO .
The biggest cheers of the night were for hometown favorite and current XFO heavyweight champion Mike Marrello .
Marrello was in control for round 1 , spending most of the round on top of Rich Lictawa and effectively landing strikes .
Round 2 was a different story as Lictawa came out and quickly landed a few punches .
Marrello got the fight to the ground but the ref stood up the fighters after some inactivity .
Lictawa landed some power shots and Marrello wobbled a bit on his feet .
But he moved in and landed a big knee from the clinch which made the crowd roar .
Lictawa waved Marrello in a few times as if to say it the knee did n’t faze him .
He then landed a few quick punches , scooped Marrello up and laid him on his back .
From there he mounted Marrello and started landing a barrage of strikes .
Marrello stayed active , trying to roll out and change positions .
But Lictawa got his back and after several powerful right hands the ref stepped in and stopped the fight at 4:19 of round 2 .
MTC ’s Tony Marti had Clay Guida as one of his cornermen , but needed no assistance in a quick submission of Danny Rodriguez .
Marti immediately took the fight to the ground .
Rodriguez got up but Marti had one arm locked in for a guillotine .
He quickly got the other arm around Rodriguez ’s neck and got the tap .
Local fighter Ryan Sturdy also was met with huge cheers and support from the fans .
Tough veteran and current TFC 185 champ Bill Hill gave Sturdy a good fight .
Hill looked impressive in round 1 turning a quick single - leg into a takedown and landing some strikes .
From there the action stalled and the ref stood the fighters up .
Hill tried smothering Sturdy against the cage but Sturdy landed some nice elbows and body shots .
Round 2 was much of the same .
But round 3 was an exciting back and forth in the clinch , with both fighters landing solid knees .
Sturdy also had the shot of the round , a right uppercut that hammered Hill .
Sturdy was a unanimous decision winner .
MTC fighter and current XFO lightweight champ Jon Murphy entered the ring with Clay Guida behind him holding his belt high above his head .
But he ended up on the losing side of a tough 3 round battle with IFL and XFO vet Mike Corey , who won by split decision .
The main event featured Team Curran ’s Pat Curran against Lucas Gwaltney .
Curran opened up with a big right and then got Gwaltney to the ground .
From there he mounted him and fired a barrage of big shots , one of which opened a huge gash on Gwaltney ’s forehead .
The ref called time and brought in the doc to check out the cut .
The doctor stopped the bout and Curran won via TKO .
Curran has lightning - fast hands that are full of power .
Do n’t be surprised if he soon makes the leap to a bigger promotion .

Cuban says ' idiot '
Trump once told him to run for president
On Monday , President Obama restated his support for Mexican President Felipe Calderón 's aggressive tactics in the fight against drug trafficking .
He also reiterated his support for a drug security plan with Mexico that is similar to the failed drug plans of past administrations .
Before Washington ramps up yet another losing war on drugs , it should take a clear - eyed look at how its current strategies are affecting the supply and demand of drugs .
Congressman Eliot Engel ( D ) of New York has introduced a bill to do just that .
Washington would be wise to back Congressman Engel 's initiative because there has not been a thorough , frank evaluation of the fight against drugs in decades .
The drug czar office 's annual report is not enough .
Recommendations by an independent commission , however , could generate the consensus and strategy we sorely need .
The cornerstone of US drug policy at home and abroad is to reduce the drug supply ( from crop eradication to border seizures ) in order to increase the domestic price of drugs .
The idea is to deter both potential consumers and producers from entering the drug market .
It has n't .
Since May 1971 , when President Richard Nixon proclaimed a " war on drugs , " Washington and the Western Hemisphere have been unable to win it .
Every claimed victory has turned out to be , in the end , a fiasco .
Consider Mexico and Jamaica in the 1970s and early ' 80s .
Mexico cracked down on marijuana production .
But that simply shifted production to Colombia and then to the US , while allowing heroin production and cocaine trafficking to rise .
Jamaica 's effort against marijuana similarly backfired and today , drug - related violence is at a high .
Colombia has been the most high - profile , high - stakes test case of the hemisphere 's struggle against drugs .
A decade ago , the Clinton administration launched the multiyear , billion - dollar Plan Colombia .
The Bush administration then expanded Plan Colombia and provided even more funding .
With those funds , Bogotá has spent the past 10 years eradicating illicit crops over an area that is 2 - 1/ 2 times the size of the state of Delaware .
It has extradited more than 600 Colombian nationals to the United States .
It has dismantled the large , brutal , Medellín and Cali cartels ; has criminalized all the phases of this illicit business ; and has launched an attack on both guerrillas and paramilitary - linked drug emporiums .
And yet , after all that , production of cocaine in Colombia actually increased , and the drug network remains intact .
So why is the Obama administration extending a similar plan – the Mérida Initiative – for Mexico ?
Plan Colombia did n't work for a number of reasons .
It was based on a lopsided policy of shared responsibility that did not work in this case .
The emphasis was on supply control and not on demand reduction .
What good does cutting back on coca leaf production do if there are still people addicted and willing to pay high sums for cocaine ?
It relied too heavily on short - term benchmarks instead of long term implications .
Then there were the negative effects on human rights , civil - military relations , the environment , and the rule of law – all very fragile in Latin America .
If Mr. Obama intends to avoid a potentially catastrophic scenario in a bordering country , then he should support Engel 's initiative .
The establishment of a Western Hemisphere Commission could be a rather inexpensive , short study .
The commission would be required to submit recommendations on future US drug policy to Congress , the secretary of State , and the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy 12 months after its first meeting .
Gathering the reports and analysis and putting the minds together of leading experts from the Americas , nongovernmental organizations , policymakers , and the media would produce a more nuanced understanding of the situation .
It is only by analyzing our current and past problems that we can make true progress now .

An image from CCTV footage of two smartly - dressed armed robbers entering Graff Jewellers in London 's West End
A raid on a Mayfair jeweller is believed to be the biggest gems heist in British history , it emerged today .
Two smartly - dressed armed robbers stole jewellery worth almost £ 40 million from Graff Jewellers in London 's West End last Thursday .
Scotland Yard issued CCTV images of the duo today as they conned their way past a security guard at the prestigious New Bond Street shop .
Once inside they pulled out two handguns and threatened staff before snatching expensive rings , bracelets , necklaces and watches .
After arriving in a black taxi , they fired two warning shots into the ground as they escaped in a series of vehicles across Soho .
Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace , of the Flying Squad , said the pair are " extremely dangerous " .
She said : " This was a well planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape .
" These men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy London streets as they made their getaway .
Someone knows who these men are .
" They would undoubtedly have spoken about it beforehand or boasted about it afterwards .
" I would urge anyone who recognises them , knows the whereabouts of the jewellery or has any other information to contact us . "
The heist dwarfs what is thought to be Britain 's previous biggest jewellery robbery , a £ 23 million raid at the same store in 2003 .
Police also released images of some of the 43 items of jewellery stolen in the raid , including a pair of white round diamond double hoop earrings .
Other items to be taken included a yellow diamond flower necklace , platinum white Marquise diamond ring and a Chronograph men's 45 mm watch .
The robbery took place at 4.20 pm last Thursday after the men got out of a black taxi in New Bond Street .
After grabbing the jewellery , the men took a woman staff member outside with them and fired a shot into the ground as they got into a blue BMW .
The car was driven into Old Bond Street , and on to Stafford Street before smashing into a taxi in Dover Street .
A second shot was fired into the ground as they abandoned the car and switched to a silver Mercedes , which continued towards Berkeley Square .
The car then drove into Farm Street , where police suspect the men got into a black vehicle , possibly a Ford Galaxy or VW Sharan .
Police said both men were well - dressed , aged in their 30s and spoke with London accents .
The first was about 6ft tall , of slim build , with dark hair and a well - combed side parting .
He was wearing a grey suit , white shirt and tie .
The second man is black , about 6ft tall , more well - built than the first suspect , with very short Afro hair .
He was also wearing a grey suit , white shirt and tie .
The same store lost jewellery worth £ 23 million in a robbery in 2003 when two Serbians armed with a wig , a revolver and a scooter held up staff .
The robbery was carried out by a gang of gem thieves dubbed the Pink Panther gang .
One Serbian criminal was wrestled to the ground as he fled and was later jailed .
In 2007 , jewellery worth up to £ 10 million was stolen from a branch of Graffs Diamonds in London 's Sloane Street by two men posing as customers .
The men arrived in a chauffeur - driven Bentley Continental Flying Spur before threatening staff at gunpoint .
Anyone with information should contact Barnes Flying Squad on 0208 247 4804 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 .

This research is also leading some scientists to dabble in urban design , as they look for ways to make the metropolis less damaging to the brain .
The good news is that even slight alterations , such as planting more trees in the inner city or creating urban parks with a greater variety of plants , can significantly reduce the negative side effects of city life .
The mind needs nature , and even a little bit can be a big help .
This research arrives just as humans cross an important milestone :
For the first time in history , the majority of people reside in cities .
For a species that evolved to live in small , primate tribes on the African savannah , such a migration marks a dramatic shift .
Instead of inhabiting wide - open spaces , we 're crowded into concrete jungles , surrounded by taxis , traffic , and millions of strangers .
In recent years , it 's become clear that such unnatural surroundings have important implications for our mental and physical health , and can powerfully alter how we think .
One of the main forces at work is a stark lack of nature , which is surprisingly beneficial for the brain .
Studies have demonstrated , for instance , that hospital patients recover more quickly when they can see trees from their windows , and that women living in public housing are better able to focus when their apartment overlooks a grassy courtyard .
Even these fleeting glimpses of nature improve brain performance , it seems , because they provide a mental break from the urban roil .
" The mind is a limited machine , " says Marc Berman , a psychologist at the University of Michigan and lead author of a new study that measured the cognitive deficits caused by a short urban walk .
" And we 're beginning to understand the different ways that a city can exceed those limitations . "
Now scientists have begun to examine how the city affects the brain , and the results are chastening .
Just being in an urban environment , they have found , impairs our basic mental processes .
After spending a few minutes on a crowded city street , the brain is less able to hold things in memory , and suffers from reduced self - control .
While it 's long been recognized that city life is exhausting -- that 's why Picasso left Paris -- this new research suggests that cities actually dull our thinking , sometimes dramatically so .
And yet , city life is n't easy .
The same London cafes that stimulated Ben Franklin also helped spread cholera ; Picasso eventually bought an estate in quiet Provence .
While the modern city might be a haven for playwrights , poets , and physicists , it 's also a deeply unnatural and overwhelming place .
THE CITY HAS always been an engine of intellectual life , from the 18th - century coffeehouses of London , where citizens gathered to discuss chemistry and radical politics , to the Left Bank bars of modern Paris , where Pablo Picasso held forth on modern art .
Without the metropolis , we might not have had the great art of Shakespeare or James Joyce ; even Einstein was inspired by commuter trains .
The subjects were then run through a battery of psychological tests .
People who had walked through the city were in a worse mood and scored significantly lower on a test of attention and working memory , which involved repeating a series of numbers backwards .
In fact , just glancing at a photograph of urban scenes led to measurable impairments , at least when compared with pictures of nature .
In a study published last month , Berman outfitted undergraduates at the University of Michigan with GPS receivers .
Some of the students took a stroll in an arboretum , while others walked around the busy streets of downtown Ann Arbor .
" It 's not an accident that Central Park is in the middle of Manhattan , " says Berman .
" They needed to put a park there . "
Imagine a walk around Walden Pond , in Concord .
The woods surrounding the pond are filled with pitch pine and hickory trees .
Chickadees and red-tailed hawks nest in the branches ; squirrels and rabbits skirmish in the berry bushes .
Natural settings are full of objects that automatically capture our attention , yet without triggering a negative emotional response -- unlike , say , a backfiring car .
The mental machinery that directs attention can relax deeply , replenishing itself .
Natural settings , in contrast , do n't require the same amount of cognitive effort .
This idea is known as attention restoration theory , or ART , and it was first developed by Stephen Kaplan , a psychologist at the University of Michigan .
While it 's long been known that human attention is a scarce resource -- focusing in the morning makes it harder to focus in the afternoon -- Kaplan hypothesized that immersion in nature might have a restorative effect .
The reason such seemingly trivial mental tasks leave us depleted is that they exploit one of the crucial weak spots of the brain .
A city is so overstuffed with stimuli that we need to constantly redirect our attention so that we are n't distracted by irrelevant things , like a flashing neon sign or the cellphone conversation of a nearby passenger on the bus .
This sort of controlled perception -- we are telling the mind what to pay attention to -- takes energy and effort .
The mind is like a powerful supercomputer , but the act of paying attention consumes much of its processing power .
Consider everything your brain has to keep track of as you walk down a busy thoroughfare like Newbury Street .
There are the crowded sidewalks full of distracted pedestrians who have to be avoided ; the hazardous crosswalks that require the brain to monitor the flow of traffic .
( The brain is a wary machine , always looking out for potential threats . )
There 's the confusing urban grid , which forces people to think continually about where they 're going and how to get there .
Related research has demonstrated that increased " cognitive load " -- like the mental demands of being in a city -- makes people more likely to choose chocolate cake instead of fruit salad , or indulge in a unhealthy snack .
This is the one - two punch of city life :
It subverts our ability to resist temptation even as it surrounds us with it , from fast - food outlets to fancy clothing stores .
The end result is too many calories and too much credit card debt .
" I think cities reveal how fragile some of our ' higher ' mental functions actually are , " Kuo says .
" We take these talents for granted , but they really need to be protected . "
But the density of city life does n't just make it harder to focus :
It also interferes with our self - control .
In that stroll down Newbury , the brain is also assaulted with temptations -- caramel lattes , iPods , discounted cashmere sweaters , and high - heeled shoes .
Resisting these temptations requires us to flex the prefrontal cortex , a nub of brain just behind the eyes .
Unfortunately , this is the same brain area that 's responsible for directed attention , which means that it 's already been depleted from walking around the city .
As a result , it 's less able to exert self - control , which means we 're more likely to splurge on the latte and those shoes we do n't really need .
While the human brain possesses incredible computational powers , it 's surprisingly easy to short - circuit : all it takes is a hectic city street .
" We 've constructed a world that 's always drawing down from the same mental account , " Kuo says .
" And then we 're surprised when [ after spending time in the city ] we can't focus at home . "
Kuo and her colleagues compared women randomly assigned to various apartments .
Some had a view of nothing but concrete sprawl , the blacktop of parking lots and basketball courts .
Others looked out on grassy courtyards filled with trees and flowerbeds .
Kuo then measured the two groups on a variety of tasks , from basic tests of attention to surveys that looked at how the women were handling major life challenges .
She found that living in an apartment with a view of greenery led to significant improvements in every category .
Studies have found that even a relatively paltry patch of nature can confer benefits .
In the late 1990s , Frances Kuo , director of the Landscape and Human Health Laboratory at the University of Illinois , began interviewing female residents in the Robert Taylor Homes , a massive housing project on the South Side of Chicago .
This also helps explain why , according to several studies , children with attention - deficit disorder have fewer symptoms in natural settings .
When surrounded by trees and animals , they are less likely to have behavioral problems and are better able to focus on a particular task .
" We see the picture of the busy street , and we automatically imagine what it 's like to be there , " says Berman .
" And that 's when your ability to pay attention starts to suffer . "
City life can also lead to loss of emotional control .
Kuo and her colleagues found less domestic violence in the apartments with views of greenery .
These data build on earlier work that demonstrated how aspects of the urban environment , such as crowding and unpredictable noise , can also lead to increased levels of aggression .
A tired brain , run down by the stimuli of city life , is more likely to lose its temper .
Long before scientists warned about depleted prefrontal cortices , philosophers and landscape architects were warning about the effects of the undiluted city , and looking for ways to integrate nature into modern life .
Ralph Waldo Emerson advised people to " adopt the pace of nature , " while the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted sought to create vibrant urban parks , such as Central Park in New York and the Emerald Necklace in Boston , that allowed the masses to escape the maelstrom of urban life .
Although Olmsted took pains to design parks with a variety of habitats and botanical settings , most urban greenspaces are much less diverse .
This is due in part to the " savannah hypothesis , " which argues that people prefer wide - open landscapes that resemble the African landscape in which we evolved .
Over time , this hypothesis has led to a proliferation of expansive civic lawns , punctuated by a few trees and playing fields .
However , these savannah - like parks are actually the least beneficial for the brain .
In a recent paper , Richard Fuller , an ecologist at the University of Queensland , demonstrated that the psychological benefits of green space are closely linked to the diversity of its plant life .
When a city park has a larger variety of trees , subjects that spend time in the park score higher on various measures of psychological well - being , at least when compared with less biodiverse parks .
" We worry a lot about the effects of urbanization on other species , " Fuller says .
" But we 're also affected by it .
That 's why it 's so important to invest in the spaces that provide us with some relief . "
When a park is properly designed , it can improve the function of the brain within minutes .
As the Berman study demonstrates , just looking at a natural scene can lead to higher scores on tests of attention and memory .
While people have searched high and low for ways to improve cognitive performance , from doping themselves with Red Bull to redesigning the layout of offices , it appears that few of these treatments are as effective as simply taking a walk in a natural place .
Given the myriad mental problems that are exacerbated by city life , from an inability to pay attention to a lack of self - control , the question remains :
Why do cities continue to grow ?
And why , even in the electronic age , do they endure as wellsprings of intellectual life ?
Recent research by scientists at the Santa Fe Institute used a set of complex mathematical algorithms to demonstrate that the very same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory -- the crowded streets , the crushing density of people -- also correlate with measures of innovation , as strangers interact with one another in unpredictable ways .
It is the " concentration of social interactions " that is largely responsible for urban creativity , according to the scientists .
The density of 18th - century London may have triggered outbreaks of disease , but it also led to intellectual breakthroughs , just as the density of Cambridge -- one of the densest cities in America -- contributes to its success as a creative center .
One corollary of this research is that less dense urban areas , like Phoenix , may , over time , generate less innovation .
The key , then , is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis while still preserving its unique benefits .
Kuo , for instance , describes herself as " not a nature person , " but has learned to seek out more natural settings :
The woods have become a kind of medicine .
As a result , she 's better able to cope with the stresses of city life , while still enjoying its many pleasures and benefits .
Because there always comes a time , as Lou Reed once sang , when a person wants to say : " I 'm sick of the trees / take me to the city . "

This morning I 'll be escorting my wife to the hospital , where the doctors will perform a caesarean section to remove our first child .
She did n't want to do it this way  neither of us did  but sometimes the Fates decide otherwise .
The Fates or , in our case , government employees .
On the morning of October 26th Mary and I entered Portland International Airport , en route to the Las Vegas wedding of one of my best friends .
Although we live in Los Angeles , we 'd been in Oregon working on a film , and up to that point had had nothing but praise to shower on the city of Portland , a refreshing change of pace from our own suffocating metropolis .
At the security checkpoint I was led aside for the " inspection " that 's all the rage at airports these days .
My shoes were removed .
I was told to take off my sweater , then to fold over the waistband of my pants .
My baseball hat , hastily jammed on my head at 5 AM , was removed and assiduously examined ( " Anything could be in here , sir , " I was told , after I asked what I could hide in a baseball hat .
Yeah .
Anything . )
Soon I was standing on one foot , my arms stretched out , the other leg sticking out in front of me la a DUI test .
I began to get pissed off , as most normal people would .
My anger increased when I realized that the newly knighted federal employees were n't just examining me , but my 7 months pregnant wife as well .
I 'd originally thought that I 'd simply been randomly selected for the more excessive than normal search .
You know , Number 50 or whatever .
Apparently not though  it was both of us .
These are your new threats , America : pregnant accountants and their sleepy husbands flying to weddings .
After some more grumbling on my part they eventually finished with me and I went to retrieve our luggage from the x-ray machine .
Upon returning I found my wife sitting in a chair , crying .
Mary rarely cries , and certainly not in public .
When I asked her what was the matter , she tried to quell her tears and sobbed , " I 'm sorry … it 's … they touched my breasts … and … "
That 's all I heard .
I marched up to the woman who'd been examining her and shouted , " What did you do to her ? "
Later I found out that in addition to touching her swollen breasts  to protect the American citizenry  the employee had asked that she lift up her shirt .
Not behind a screen , not off to the side  no , right there , directly in front of the hundred or so passengers standing in line .
And for you women who 've been pregnant and worn maternity pants , you know how ridiculous those things look .
" I felt like a clown , " my wife told me later .
" On display for all these people , with the cotton panel on my pants and my stomach sticking out .
When I sat down I just lost my composure and began to cry .
That 's when you walked up . "
Of course when I say she " told me later , " it 's because she was n't able to tell me at the time , because as soon as I demanded to know what the federal employee had done to make her cry , I was swarmed by Portland police officers .
Instantly .
Three of them , cinching my arms , locking me in handcuffs , and telling me I was under arrest .
Now my wife really began to cry .
As they led me away and she ran alongside , I implored her to calm down , to think of the baby , promising her that everything would turn out all right .
She faded into the distance and I was shoved into an elevator , a cop holding each arm .
After making me face the corner , the head honcho told that I was under arrest and that I would n't be flying that day  that I was in fact a " menace . "
It took me a while to regain my composure .
I felt like I was one of those guys in The Gulag Archipelago who , because the proceedings all seem so unreal , does n't fully realize that he is in fact being arrested in a public place in front of crowds of people for …for what ?
I did n't know what the crime was .
Did n't matter .
Once upstairs , the officers made me remove my shoes and my hat and tossed me into a cell .
Yes , your airports have prison cells , just like your amusement parks , train stations , universities , and national forests .
Let freedom reign .
After a short time I received a visit from the arresting officer .
" Mr. Monahan , " he started , " Are you on drugs ? "
Was this even real ?
" No , I 'm not on drugs . "
" Should you be ? "
" What do you mean ? "
" Should you be on any type of medication ? "
" No . "
" Then why 'd you react that way back there ? "
You see the thinking ?
You see what passes for reasoning among your domestic shock troops these days ?
Only " whackos " get angry over seeing the woman they 've been with for ten years in tears because someone has touched her breasts .
That kind of reaction  love , protection  it 's mind - boggling !
" Mr. Monahan , are you on drugs ? "
His snide words rang inside my head .
This is my wife , finally pregnant with our first child after months of failed attempts , after the depressing shock of the miscarriage last year , my wife who'd been walking on a cloud over having the opportunity to be a mother …and my anger is simply unfathomable to the guy standing in front of me , the guy who earns a living thanks to my taxes , the guy whose family I feed through my labor .
What I did was n't normal .
No , I reacted like a drug addict would 've .
I was so disgusted I felt like vomiting .
But that was just the beginning .
An hour later , after I 'd been gallantly assured by the officer that I would n't be attending my friend 's wedding that day , I heard Mary 's voice outside my cell .
The officer was speaking loudly , letting her know that he was planning on doing me a favor … which everyone knows is never a real favor .
He was n't going to come over and help me work on my car or move some furniture .
No , his " favor " was this :
He 'd decided not to charge me with a felony .
Think about that for a second .
Rapes , car - jackings , murders , arsons  those are felonies .
So is yelling in an airport now , apparently .
I had n't realized , though I should have .
Luckily , I was getting a favor , though .
I was merely going to be slapped with a misdemeanor .
" Here 's your court date , " he said as I was released from my cell .
In addition , I was banned from Portland International for 90 days , and just in case I was thinking of coming over and hanging out around its perimeter , the officer gave me a map with the boundaries highlighted , sternly warning me against trespassing .
Then he and a second officer escorted us off the grounds .
Mary and I hurriedly drove two and a half hours in the rain to Seattle , where we eventually caught a flight to Vegas .
But the officer was true to his word  we missed my friend 's wedding .
The fact that he'd been in my own wedding party , the fact that a once in a lifetime event was stolen from us  well , who cares , right ?
Upon our return to Portland ( I 'd had to fly into Seattle and drive back down ) , we immediately began contacting attorneys .
We are n't litigious people  we wanted no money .
I 'm not even sure what we fully wanted .
An apology ?
A reprimand ?
I do n't know .
It does n't matter though , because we could n't afford a lawyer , it turned out .
$ 4,000 was the average figure bandied about as a retaining fee .
Sorry , but I 've got a new baby on the way .
So we called the ACLU , figuring they existed for just such incidents as these .
And they do apparently … but only if we were minorities .
That 's what they told us .
In the meantime , I 'd appealed my suspension from PDX .
A week or so later I got a response from the Director of Aviation .
After telling me how , in the aftermath of 9/11 , most passengers not only accept additional airport screening but welcome it , he cut to the chase :
" After a review of the police report and my discussions with police staff , as well as a review of the TSA 's report on this incident , I concur with the officer 's decision to take you into custody and to issue a citation to you for disorderly conduct .
That being said , because I also understand that you were upset and acted on your emotions , I am willing to lift the Airport Exclusion Order… . "
Attached to this letter was the report the officer had filled out .
I 'd like to say I could n't believe it , but in a way , I could .
It 's seemingly becoming the norm in America  lies and deliberate distortions on the part of those in power , no matter how much or how little power they actually wield .
The gist of his report was this :
From the get go I was n't following the screener 's directions .
I was " squinting my eyes " and talking to my wife in a " low , forced voice " while " excitedly swinging my arms . "
Twice I began to walk away from the screener , inhaling and exhaling forcefully .
When I 'd completed the physical exam , I walked to the luggage screening area , where a second screener took a pair of scissors from my suitcase .
At this point I yelled , " What the %*&$ % is going on ?
This is &*# &$ % ! "
The officer , who 'd already been called over by one of the screeners , became afraid for the TSA staff and the many travelers .
He required the assistance of a second officer as he " struggled " to get me into handcuffs , then for " cover " called over a third as well .
It was only at this point that my wife began to cry hysterically .
There was nothing poetic in my reaction to the arrest report .
I did n't crumple it in my fist and swear that justice would be served , promising to sacrifice my resources and time to see that it would .
I simply stared .
Clearly the officer did n't have the guts to write down what had really happened .
It might not look too good to see that stuff about the pregnant woman in tears because she 'd been humiliated .
Instead this was the official scenario being presented for the permanent record .
It does n't even matter that it 's the most implausible sounding situation you can think of .
" Hey , what the …godammit , they 're taking our scissors , honey ! "
Why did n't he write in anything about a monkey wearing a fez ?
True , the TSA staff had expropriated a pair of scissors from our toiletries kit  the story was n't entirely made up .
Except that I 'd been locked in airport jail at the time .
I did n't know anything about any scissors until Mary told me on our drive up to Seattle .
They 'd questioned her about them while I was in the bowels of the airport sitting in my cell .
So I wrote back , indignation and disgust flooding my brain .
" [ W ] hile I 'm not sure , I 'd guess that the entire incident is captured on video .
Memory is imperfect on everyone 's part , but the footage wo n't lie .
I realize it might be procedurally difficult for you to view this , but if you could , I 'd appreciate it .
There 's no willful disregard of screening directions .
No explosion over the discovery of a pair of scissors in a suitcase .
No struggle to put handcuffs on .
There 's a tired man , early in the morning , unhappily going through a rigorous procedure and then reacting to the tears of his pregnant wife . "
Eventually we heard back from a different person , the guy in charge of the TSA airport screeners .
One of his employees had made the damning statement about me exploding over her scissor discovery , and the officer had deftly incorporated that statement into his report .
We asked the guy if he could find out why she 'd said this  could n't she possibly be mistaken ?
" Oh , ca n't do that , my hands are tied .
It 's kind of like leading a witness 
I could get in trouble , heh heh . "
Then what about the videotape ?
Why not watch that ?
That would exonerate me .
" Oh , we destroy all video after three days . "
Sure you do .
A few days later we heard from him again .
He just wanted to inform us that he'd received corroboration of the officer 's report from the officer 's superior , a name we did n't recognize .
" But …he was n't even there , " my wife said .
" Yeah , well , uh , he 's corroborated it though . "
That 's how it works .
" Oh , and we did look at the videotape .
Inconclusive . "
But I thought it was destroyed ?
On and on it went .
Due to the tenacity of my wife in making phone calls and speaking with relevant persons , the " crime " was eventually lowered to a mere citation .
Only she could have done that .
I would 've simply accepted what was being thrown at me , trumped up charges and all , simply because I 'm wholly inadequate at performing the kowtow .
There 's no way I could have contacted all the people Mary did and somehow pretend to be contrite .
Besides , I speak in a low , forced voice , which does n't elicit sympathy .
Just police suspicion .
Weeks later at the courthouse I listened to a young DA awkwardly read the charges against me 
" Mr. Monahan … umm … shouted obscenities at the airport staff … umm … umm…oh , they took some scissors from his suitcase and he became … umm … abusive at this point . "
If I was reading about it in Kafka I might have found something vaguely amusing in all of it .
But I was n't .
I was there .
Living it .
I entered a plea of nolo contendere , explaining to the judge that if I 'd been a resident of Oregon , I would have definitely pled " Not Guilty . "
However , when that happens , your case automatically goes to a jury trial , and since I lived a thousand miles away , and was slated to return home in seven days , with a newborn due in a matter of weeks … you get the picture .
" No Contest " it was .
Judgment : $ 250 fine .
Did I feel happy ?
Only $ 250 , right ?
No , I was n't happy .
I do n't care if it 's twelve cents , that 's money pulled right out of my baby 's mouth and fed to a disgusting legal system that will use it to propagate more incidents like this .
But at the very least it was over , right ?
Wrong .
When we returned to Los Angeles there was an envelope waiting for me from the court .
Inside was n't a receipt for the money we 'd paid .
No , it was a letter telling me that what I actually owed was $ 309  state assessed court costs , you know .
Would n't you think your taxes pay for that  the state putting you on trial ?
No , taxes are used to hire more cops like the officer , because with our rising criminal population  people like me  hey , your average citizen demands more and more " security . "
Finally I reach the piece de rsistance .
The week before we'd gone to the airport my wife had had her regular pre-natal checkup .
The child had settled into the proper head down position for birth , continuing the remarkable pregnancy she 'd been having .
We returned to Portland on Sunday .
On Mary 's Monday appointment she was suddenly told , " Looks like your baby 's gone breech . "
When she later spoke with her midwives in Los Angeles , they wanted to know if she 'd experienced any type of trauma recently , as this often makes a child flip .
" As a matter of fact … " she began , recounting the story , explaining how the child inside of her was going absolutely crazy when she was crying as the police were leading me away through the crowd .
My wife had been planning a natural childbirth .
She 'd read dozens of books , meticulously researched everything , and had finally decided that this was the way for her .
No drugs , no numbing of sensations  just that ultimate combination of brute pain and sheer joy that belongs exclusively to mothers .
But my wife is also a first - time mother , so she has what is called an " untested " pelvis .
Essentially this means that a breech birth is too dangerous to attempt , for both mother and child .
Therefore , she 's now relegated to a c-section  hospital stay , epidural , catheter , fetal monitoring , stitches  everything she did n't want .
Her natural birth has become a surgery .
We 've tried everything to turn that baby .
Acupuncture , chiropractic techniques , underwater handstands , elephant walking , moxibustion , bending backwards over pillows , herbs , external manipulation  all to no avail .
When I walked into the living room the other night and saw her plaintively cooing with a flashlight turned onto her stomach , yet another suggested technique , my heart almost broke .
It 's breaking now as I write these words .
I can never prove that my child went breech because of what happened to us at the airport .
But I 'll always believe it .
Wrongly or rightly , I 'll forever think of how this man , the personification of this system , has affected the lives of my family and me .
When my wife is sliced open , I 'll be thinking of him .
When they remove her uterus from her abdomen and lay it on her stomach , I 'll be thinking of him .
When I visit her and my child in the hospital instead of having them with me here in our home , I 'll be thinking of him .
When I assist her to the bathroom while the incision heals internally , I 'll be thinking of him .
There are plenty of stories like this these days .
I do n't know how many I 've read where the writer describes some breach of civil liberties by employees of the state , then wraps it all up with a dire warning about what we as a nation are becoming , and how if we do n't put an end to it now , then we 're in for heaps of trouble .
Well you know what ?
Nothing 's going to stop the inevitable .
There 's no policy change that 's going to save us .
There 's no election that 's going to put a halt to the onslaught of tyranny .
It 's here already  this country has changed for the worse and will continue to change for the worse .
There is now a division between the citizenry and the state .
When that state is used as a tool against me , there is no longer any reason why I should owe any allegiance to that state .
And that 's the first thing that child of ours is going to learn .

Climate change is melting America 's glaciers at the fastest rate in recorded history , exposing the country to higher risks of drought and rising sea levels , a US government study of glaciers said today .
The long - running study of three " benchmark " glaciers in Alaska and Washington state by the US geological survey ( USGS ) indicated a sharp rise in the melt rate over the last 10 or 15 years .
Scientists see the three - Wolverine and Gulkana in Alaska and South Cascade in Washington - as representative of thousands of other glaciers in North America .
" The observations show that the melt rate has definitely increased over the past 10 or 15 years , " said Ed Josberger , a USGS scientist .
" This certainly is a very strong indicator that climate change is occurring and its effects on glaciers are virtually worldwide . "
The survey also found that all three glaciers had begun melting at the same higher rate - although they are in different climate regimes and some 1,500 miles apart .
For South Cascade , the average surface loss rate grew to 1.75 to 2 m a year from about 1 m a year .
USGS researchers have been measuring the three glaciers for more than 50 years , drawing on photographs and a network of stakes driven into the glaciers to gauge the accumulation of snow during winter , and the resulting melt each spring .
It is the oldest such record of glacier activity .
In a sign of the Obama administration 's focus on climate change , this year 's survey was promoted by the interior secretary , Ken Salazar , who called it an important contribution to dealing with climate change .
" This information is helpful in tackling the effects of climate change and it is exactly the kind of science we need to invest in to measure and mitigate the dangers impacts of climate change , " he said .
Shrinking glaciers have led to a reduction in spring run-off which is intensifying the effects of drought in California and other states , especially later in the summer when other water sources dry up .
Glacier loss has also contributed to rising sea levels , which has put low - lying coastal areas - such as New Orleans - at greater risk of storm surges .
A French security guard says he received a face full of glass when the screen of his iPhone exploded , the second such reported incident in France .
Yassine Bouhadi , a 26 - year - old supermarket watchman from the south - eastern town of Villevieille , said he was typing a text message on Monday afternoon when the screen exploded .
Mr Bouhadi , who says he was hit in the eye with a glass shard , said he was " very angry " and planned to consult a doctor and file a suit for damages .
" I want an explanation about this damned telephone , " said Mr Bouhadi , who bought the hugely - popular smartphone device for 600 euros ( $ 1,025 ) three months ago and now wants his money back .
France 's official competition , consumer affairs and fraud watchdog , the DGCCRF , said it had opened an investigation after a French teenager suffered an eye injury in a similar iPhone incident earlier this month .
" An investigation is under way .
We have been alerted to the problem and we are looking into it closely , " said a spokesman from the agency .
The US technology giant Apple , which makes the iPhone and the iPod music player , assured the European Union on August 14 that the exploding screen cases reported so far were " isolated incidents . "
The French cases come a few weeks after an uproar in Britain over an exploding iPod owned by an 11 - year - old girl .
And a US television station reported last month that an " alarming number " of iPods had burst into flames , though without causing serious injury , a problem apparently caused by overheated lithium ion batteries .
A spokesman for France 's consumer rights group , UFC - Que Choisir , called on Apple to " communicate a bit more with its customers " about reported glitches with its iPod and iPhone devices .
" We want to know if this is an isolated incident as they claim , or a real problem involving the iPhone - in which case , what are they planning by way of compensation and to prevent it happening again ? "

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc said on Monday that it would host a media event next week , when the company is widely expected to unveil an updated line of iPod media players .

Apple declined to say what products would be featured at the September 9 event , which was announced in an invitation emailed to members of the media .
The invitation featured an iPod and the tagline : “ It ’s only rock and roll , but we like it . ”
In recent years , the company has used splashy media events in September to showcase new and refreshed iPod models for the holiday period .
Apple launched the iPod touch model in 2007 and the iPod nano in 2005 .
This time around , analysts expect the nano and touch to be updated with digital cameras , and they say the touch may also get a video camera .
Apple dominates the media player category , although growth has slowed considerably as the market has matured .
The company sold 10.2 million iPods in the June quarter , down 7 percent from a year ago .
The company is also expected to unveil the ninth generation of its iTunes media management software .
Apple product launches are some of the most high - profile events on the technology calendar , and expectations around the gathering next week are running particularly high as it could feature the first public appearance by Chief Executive Steve Jobs since he returned from medical leave .
The company declined to say whether Jobs would appear at the event .
Jobs returned in late June after a nearly 6 - month leave , during which he underwent a liver transplant .
Many Apple watchers are also eagerly awaiting the company ’s launch of its much - rumored , but never confirmed , tablet device .
But analysts say the so - called “ iPad ” wo n’t be unveiled until later this year or next .
The event next Wednesday will be held in San Francisco at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater .

The Martian surface is very hostile to organics say scientists
Methane on Mars is being produced and destroyed far faster than on Earth , according to analysis of recent data .
Scientists in Paris used a computer climate model for the Red Planet to simulate observations made from Earth .
It shows the gas is unevenly distributed in the Martian atmosphere and changes with the seasons .
The presence of methane on Mars is intriguing because its origin could either be life or geological activity - including volcanism .
Writing in the journal Nature , Franck Lefevre and Francois Forget from the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris describe how they used a computer model of the Martian climate to reconstruct observations made by a US team .
If the measurements are correct , we must be missing something quite important
Franck Lefevre , Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Dr Lefevre says the chemistry of the Martian atmosphere is still a mystery .
He told BBC News : " We put the dynamics and chemistry as we know it in the model and tried to match the measurements , to reproduce the uneven distribution they saw from Earth . "
" The problem is if we just take into account the photochemistry as we know it on Earth and if we put it in the model , then we cannot reproduce the model and that was a surprise . "
" The current chemistry as we know it is not consistent with the measurements of methane on Mars . "
" There is something else going on , something that lowers the methane lifetime by a factor of 600 .
So if the measurements are correct , we must be missing something quite important . "
MSL is Nasa 's next rover mission to the Red Planet Dr Lefevre says the work shows that if there is a much faster loss for methane on Mars there must also be a much stronger production of methane .
But he urges caution : " It 's a real challenge to measure methane on Mars from Earth and we 've got only one example of this uneven distribution . "
The results the French team used were published in January this year in the journal Science .
They were gathered by an American team using a technique called infrared spectroscopy at three different ground - based telescopes to monitor about 90 % of the planet 's surface .
In 2003 " plumes " of methane were identified .
At one point , the primary plume of methane contained an estimated 19,000 tonnes of the gas .
Dr Michael Mumma , director of Nasa 's Goddard Center for Astrobiology and lead author on the previous paper , told BBC News it was vital to understand how methane was destroyed on Mars and to explain how so much of the gas is produced and destroyed so quickly on the Red Planet .
Dr Mumma does not rule out a biological explanation for the phenomenon but says it is possible that geology alone could be responsible .
The source of Martian methane might be biological or geological
If the methane is produced by geological activity , it could either originate from active Martian volcanoes or from a process called serpentinisation .
The latter process occurs at low temperatures when rocks rich in the minerals olivine and pyroxene react chemically with water , releasing methane .
In December , Dr Mumma 's team will begin another study of the Martian surface using the new technique of adaptive optics at the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile .
They hope to replicate their earlier results .
Dr Lefevre says that if the variations are confirmed it would mean the Martian surface is very hostile for organics .
But this would not necessarily exclude the possibility that life or the remnants of past life persist below ground , where conditions could be more benign .
Nasa is due to launch a $ 2.3 bn nuclear - powered rover known as Mars Science Laboratory ( also called " Curiosity " ) to the planet in 2011 .
Under one possible scenario , the European and US space agencies would then send a European orbiter to the Red Planet in 2016 to track down the sources of methane .
A subsequent 2018 launch opportunity would be taken by the European ExoMars rover , launching on a US Atlas rocket .
The proposal currently being discussed is that ExoMars should be joined by a slightly smaller rover in the class of the US Spirit and Opportunity vehicles that are on the surface today .
ExoMars and its smaller cousin could be targeted at the Methane sources identified by the 2016 orbiter .

Iranian officials interviewed an alleged victim of jailhouse rape at the hands of security personnel .
But instead of consoling him , they asked him embarrassing questions and blamed him for the violence .
They said it was the young man 's own fault for protesting the results of Iran 's June 12 presidential elections , according to a fresh account of the alleged rape published on the website of a prominent reformist politician .
" I asked them why I and others were raped in prison , " the young man says he asked two interrogators and a judge who had agreed to hear his story , according to the website of former parliamentary speaker Mehdi Karroubi .
One of the three replied , " ' When the supreme leader confirmed the election result , everyone should have recognized it . "
The young man 's tale of rape , the latest in a series of gruesome stories emerging from Iran 's detention centers , was published today on the website of Karroubi 's political party , Etemad Melli .
( The website is in Persian . )

Now you are n't buying tomatoes grown by a farmer in another state , so he does n't make as much money and does n't owe as much in taxes .
If lots of people grow their own tomatoes , the tomato farmer might not be able to sell his crop at all , so the government has to regulate the growing of tomatoes .
( Or wheat : [ link edited for length ] )
There is also some current legislation ( HR 2749 ) that seeks to track where a given serving of food ( or its ingredients ) come from , to protect public health .
I have n't read the bill .
Examples of government control of food are common .
But government does not stop its interest in control with food .
Let 's say you decide to try an extreme sport and you hurt yourself , so you need health care .
Well , actually using health care instead of just paying the insurance premiums results in potentially higher costs for you .
If a lot of people start to actually use their insurance , then the insurance premiums go up .
Maybe some people do n't try extreme sports , but they are “ weekend warriors ” who get sprains and strains , or maybe they overeat and put too much stress on their joints and internal organs .
Maybe they travel to foreign countries and become ill after they return .
Maybe they just get old .
Chaos theory is applied ( not by name ) to grab control of everything in the interest of keeping things affordable .
The government overlooks or ignores the irony of this being the alleged motivation for an organization famous for buying $ 400 hammers and building modern airports that only 20 people a day use .
The argument is that this or that action , which used to be a personal decision tolerated by society because everybody wanted the tacit societal authorization to make some personal decisions of their own , should now be regulated by the government for the “ good ” of society , to keep insurance premiums affordable and health care costs low .
When the government talks of taxing soda and other “ unhealthy ” food choices , you may not care because you are an odd woman in Oregon who quit eating unhealthy food a year ago and now plans to wander around totally naked , with the permission of the police department who can find no law to use to stop her ( “ Naked Truth ” , [ link edited for length ] ) .
When the government decides that , since most medical costs are incurred in the last year of life , this is a good area in which to cut costs by encouraging people to consider alternatives ( e.g. hospice or palliative care instead of extreme medical intervention ) , you may not care because you are young , healthy , eat only organic food and live in the country where that carcinogenic smog can't get to you .
When the government decides that the pregnancies of women should be terminated whenever the women want , you may not care because you are not a woman , not pregnant , and you are safely out of the womb by twenty - one years or more .
Maybe you will care if these abortions are paid for using taxpayer dollars , but maybe you 'll feel better about it when you consider the carbon footprint avoided for another human beings
You might even wonder why they are n't all terminated .
After all , we have plenty of people and not enough jobs .
But why should the government stop there ?
Why not tell you how to exercise , how much , and when ?
What to eat , how much , when ?
What to spend , how much , and when ?
After all , the government ( well , GM ) is on track to build cars that no one is clamoring for , and there are lots of other cars not selling because people are worried about the economy .
It would be much simpler if the government could just mandate that you buy a new car every five years .
Consumers lack confidence ?
Pass a law to get them to buy stuff anyway .
After all , the cars are made in another state , so failure to buy one would violate the commerce clause .
Where would it end ?
Not where the Founders thought when they put the commerce clause into the Constitution .
Their goal for the Constitution was to limit what the government could do to the people , but 220 years of lawyers and other liberals have separated us from the original intent to the point that one day we will wake up , take a water - saving shower and use the low - flush toilet , put on our eco-friendly organic cotton coveralls , eat our government - mandated guaranteed - healthy kibble , and sit down at the computer to telecommute to our jobs ( sparing the government the cost of maintaining road and bridge infrastructure and inhibiting the spread of disease ) .
We will have no one to talk to because free speech websites will have been shut down ( too many people experienced raised blood pressure ) and we will live alone ( avoiding disease and population increases ) .
We wo n't have guns because they give off toxic fumes when used , not to mention the lead poisoning for the victim .
( That 's a joke . )
The 2nd Amendment will be construed to apply to “ arms ” in general , e.g. mace and pepper spray .
With the use of the commerce clause to justify universal health care legislation , and then to control everything else , there will be no powers covered by the 10th Amendment .
And if someone discovers that our kibble is people , there will be no one within earshot to hear him say so ( movie reference : Soylent Green ) .
Besides , the dead will have legally been declared non-human , like fetuses , so it 's just recycled chemicals , okay ?
Sheesh .
O , Brave New World , that has such features in it ….
A shooting incident occurred at a meeting place for the GLBT community in Tel Aviv late Saturday evening , and paramedics have reported two people dead .
At least ten people have been wounded , six of them seriously .
The incident took place at a time during which teenagers belonging to the GLBT community were holding a meeting .
At around 10:40 pm shots were heard at the meeting place in central Tel Aviv .
A man dressed in black was spotted by eyewitnesses fleeing the scene , and he was later spotted again on a nearby street .
The police 's Tel Aviv district commander , Major - General Shahar Ayalon , said the incident had not been preceded by threats to members of the community .
" For 15 years this place has served as a club belonging to the union for private rights .
Today a teen meeting was taking place , " he said .
" At some point someone walked in and began firing left and right .
The shooter escaped and we are searching for the suspect .
We have no specific description of the suspect or the circumstances . "
One eyewitness to the shooting said , " The place looked like a slaughterhouse . "
Another witness said the shooter had worn a mask .
Civilians were warned to stay away from the area .
Eyal Amit , a member of the GLBT organization , told Ynet that many of the teens who met at the clubhouse had not yet informed their loved ones of their sexual orientation .
" It 's a very sensitive situation .
What we know is that in order to get here one must come here especially .
This was not some random shooting , " he said .
Yaniv Weizmann , an activist for the GLBT community , told Ynet that " according to the assessments , this was a planned and deliberate act against the gay community " .
Police have cleared the surrounding roads in order to allow ambulances to evacuate the wounded .
Charlize Theron has revealed she used to have to get directors drunk to get films roles .
The Oscar - winning actress is now an established Hollywood star , but when she fist moved to Los Angeles she insists many people were reluctant to hire her .
Theron claims she only got her role in ' The Yards ' alongside Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix because she softened - up director James Gray over a few drinks .
She said : " I got him drunk - that 's when my manipulation really works well . "
Meanwhile , Theron has confessed that some of her films are so bad she has felt suicidal after finishing them .
The 31 - year - old star won the 2004 Best Actress Oscar for her gripping portrayal of serial - killer Aileen Wuornos in ' Monster ' .
Although the South African star had a good feeling the movie , directed by Patty Jenkins , would be a success , she admits she has often chosen bad projects and felt the consequences .
She said : " There was nothing Patty had done to convince me she was a good director .
I just had a feeling .
But I have been wrong before .
Very wrong .
I 've been in situations when I 've said to myself , ' Can I have a rope please ?
Or some blades ? ' "
