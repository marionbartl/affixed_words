^ HDTR of the Vancouver Skyline on 19 July 2007 .
Images from 5.30 pm to 9 pm and were blended using the HDTR software .
Time flows non-uniformly , left to right .
The composite is blended spatially and temporally ( zoom ) ( movie ) .
still photography and the passage of time
There are several ways to record the passage of time in a photograph , an inherently static medium .
One is to use long exposure , a process in which the shutter remains open for seconds , or even minutes .
Moving objects appear as blurrs .
The contrast between moving and still objects can be striking .
In long exposure photography each part of the image records light from the entire exposure - time stacks on the photo like sheets of acetate .
Another way is to use a strobe light and illuminate the scene periodically , while the shutter is open .
This is usually done in a dark field with a single moving subject , such as a dancer , person swinging a tennis racket or a dog lunging for its favourite toy .
Rather than the motion blur seen in long exposures , instances are frozen sharply in an image .
The art of scanner photography takes a different approach to recording a time interval in a single image .
A scanner is used as the recording medium , in place of film or a digital sensor .
The motion of the scanner 's head progressively samples the scene across the width of the frame and over a short period of time .
One side of the image is digitized later than the other .
The results are fascinating .
The method described here takes a new approach to depicting the passage of time .
Images shown here are called High Dynamic Time Range ( HDTR ) images and are a composite of many photos taken over a long period of time , such as a day or even longer .
Each part of the HDTR image is sampled from a different photo , either by column or row .
Thus , the very left part of the HDTR image might show the scene from 7 am and the very right from 8 pm , capturing the variation in light across an entire day .
what is HDTR ?
An HDTR image is an image in which multiple frames taken over an arbitrary time interval are blended together .
The images in the time - lapse set are merged together by progressively sampling time - adjacent images horizontally or vertically .
The difference between an HDTR image and a single - frame long exposure is that the contribution to any region of an HDTR image is primarily from a single image from the time - lapse set , rather than an average of all images .
Depending on how the blending is done , the result is an image in which a strip , row or column , is derived from a specific point in time .
If a long exposure frame is a stack of acetates of time , an HDTR is a series of strips of time .
An HDTR is generated from a set of time - lapse images .
Here , a simple HDTR is created from 5 images taken at different times .
From each image , a strip representing 20 % of the image is extracted and the strips are blended to reduce banding artefacts .
The strips can be blended in a variety of ways ( see below ) , generally to limit banding artifacts and produce a smoother time gradient .
In principle you can sample the images along any path , such as a diagonal line .
You can also create a composite mosaic in which progressively spaced squares are sampled from the stack of time - lapsed images .
Last week 's content - theft complaint ( Huffington Post ) was interesting , because it raised a legitimate question about how much aggregation is too much .
This week 's is just pathetic :
David Kaplan , Paidcontent : The New York York Times Company is being sued for copyright infringement over its Boston Globe local sites linking with headlines and ledes to another publisher ’s articles .
GateHouse Media , which publishes 125 community papers in Massachusetts , filed suit in U.S. District Court there Monday .
The company claims that the Globe sites lifted headlines and ledes word - for - word and therefore infringed its copyright , even though the items were credited to and linked back to the Gatehouse pubs , according to Boston.com , which is owned by NYTCo ( NYSE : NYT ) ...
In the complaint , Gatehouse says it wants NYTCo to shutter Your Town Newton , one of Boston . com ’s new local sites , reports GateHouse ’s Newton TAB .
GateHouse says that Boston. com ’s month - old Newton site used content belonging to The TAB ’s online counterpart — called WickedLocalNewton.com — and its sister pubs .
Specifically , GateHouse charges that Boston.com both through advertising and its direct aggregation is confusing readers about where the articles actually originated .
And even though Boston.com does link back to GateHouse sites , the publisher is frustrated that the links do an end - run around the ads on its homepage ...
Read More >
Does GateHouse Media understand that NYTCo is sending it traffic ?
That NYTCo is alerting readers who might otherwise have no knowledge of or interest in Gatehouse articles to their existence ?
That NYTCo is helping to improve GateHouse 's Google ranking ?
That headline and excerpt linking has been common practice since the dawn of Internet time ( and is usually beloved by both parties ? )
We hereby give the New York Times permission to aggregate any or all of our headlines and ledes anytime they feel like it .
We 'll even give GateHouse Media the same permission .
We can't wait to welcome their readers to our sites .

Call for Essays , The Isaac Roet Prize is an international essay contest about the promotion of world peace through economic interaction .
Morgan A. sent in a photo of this poster , seen in the Paris Metro in 2002 :
The text says , more or less , “ No women ’s bodies were exploited in this ad . ”
Looking around online , I was able to find another version ( found here ) with the same text :
Both are ads for Eram , a French shoe company .
One way to read them would be as a clever way of criticizing the use of women ’s bodies in ads .
But it ’s also possible they ’re ridiculing concerns about how women ’s bodies are used , rather than trying to undermine such objectification .
What do you think ?
Thanks , Morgan A .!
A Synopsis of the Current Situation in Israel / Palestine Fortunately , the American media cover many events in Israel with great detail and thoroughness .
Therefore , we are not repeating that coverage here .
Instead , we are attempting to fill in the many important news items – most of them about incidents in the Palestinian territories – that are not available in the U.S. media .
For more thorough daily coverage of the region , view “ Israel - Palestine News , ” and our recommended sources of daily news .
To read archived articles on the subject from 10 or more years ago , visit our older site , view “ The Missing Headlines . ”
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip live in an odd and oppressive limbo .
They have no nation , no citizenship , and no ultimate power over their own lives .
Since 1967 , when Israel conquered these areas ( the final 22 percent of mandatory Palestine ) , Palestinians have been living under Israeli military occupation .
While in some parts Israel has allowed a Palestinian “ autonomous ” entity to take on such municipal functions as education , health care , infrastructure and policing , Israel retains overall power .
According to international law , an occupying force is responsible for the protection of the civilian population living under its control .
Israel , however , ignores this requirement , routinely committing violations of the Geneva Conventions , a set of principles instituted after World War II to ensure that civilians would “ never again ” suffer as they had under Nazi occupation .
Israel is one of the leading violators of these conventions today .
Israeli forces regularly confiscate private land ; imprison individuals without process – including children – and physically abuse them under incarceration ; demolish family homes ; bulldoze orchards and crops ; place entire towns under curfew ; destroy shops and businesses ; shoot , maim , and kill civilians – and Palestinians are without power to stop any of it .
When a child is arrested , for example – often by a group of armed soldiers in the middle of the night – parents can do nothing .
Knowing that their son is most likely being beaten by soldiers on the way to the station , stripped and humiliated in prison , quite likely physically abused in multiple additional ways , and destined to be held – perhaps in isolation – for days , week , or months ( all before a trial has even taken place ) , parents are without the ability to protect their child .
Quite often , in fact , they can not even visit him .
Finally , when the military trial under which their son is to be sentenced – often to years ( sometimes decades ) in prison – all they can do is hire a lawyer whose efforts , at best , will reduce the ultimate sentence by a few months .
Rarely , if ever , can even the most skilled lawyer do more than afford the child a friendly face in court and be an outside witness to the injustice of the proceedings .
Meanwhile , the presence of such a lawyer provides Israel cover for its “ judicial system . ”
Perhaps most significant – and rarely understood by people in the outside world – is the fact that Palestinians live , basically , in a prison in which Israel holds the keys .
They cannot leave Gaza or the West Bank unless Israeli guards allow them to .
If they have been allowed out , they cannot return to their homes and families unless Israeli guards permit it .
Frequently , in both cases , Israel refuses such permission .
Academics invited to attend conferences abroad , high school students given US State Department scholarships to study in the United States , mothers wishing to visit daughters abroad , American citizens returning to their families , humanitarians bringing wheelchairs – the list goes on almost without limit – have all been denied permission by Israel to leave or enter their own land .
The “ Intifada ” Living under such hardship and humiliation , in the year 2000 the Palestinian population began an uprising against Israeli rule called the “ Intifada . ”
This term – rarely translated in the American media – is simply the Arabic word for uprising or rebellion – literally , it means “ shaking off . ”
The American Revolutionary War , for example , would be called the American intifada against Britain .
This is the second such uprising .
The first began in 1986 and ended in 1993 when the peace negotiations offered hopes of justice .
( Sadly , in the following years these hopes were crushed after Israel , rather than withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza , as promised , actually doubled its expansion in these areas . )
During this first uprising , which consisted largely of Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli troops ( very few Palestinians had weapons ) , Palestinians were killed at a rate approximately 7 - 10 times that of Israelis .
One of the ways Israeli forces attempted to put down this rebellion was through the “ break the bones ” policy , implemented by Yitzhak Rabin , in which people who had been throwing stones – often youths – were held down and their arms broken .
On the first day of this policy alone , one hospital in Gaza treated 200 People for fractures .
1
Today ’s uprising – termed the “ Second Intifada ” – was sparked when an Israeli general , Ariel Sharon , known for his slaughter of Palestinian civilians throughout his career , visited a Jerusalem holy site , accompanied by over a thousand armed Israeli soldiers .
When some Palestinian youths threw stones , Israeli soldiers responded with live gunfire , killing 5 the first day , and 10 the second .
This uprising has now continued for over five years , as Israel periodically mounts massive invasions into Palestinian communities , using tanks , helicopter gunships , and F - 16 fighter jets .
Palestinian fighters resisting these forces possess rifles and homemade mortars and rockets .
A minute fraction strap explosives onto their own bodies and attempt to deliver their bombs in person ; often they kill only themselves .
While the large majority of Palestinians oppose suicide bombings , many feel that armed resistance has become necessary – much as Americans supported war after the attack at Pearl Harbor .
Nevertheless , only a small portion take an active part in the resistance , despite the fact that virtually all support its aim : to create a nation free from foreign oppression .
Most Palestinians attempt – with greater or lesser success – to go on with their lives , raise their children , attend school , go to work , celebrate festivals , organize weddings , raise their crops , provide for their families – all the things that preoccupy people around the world .
As Israel constructs a wall around them , however , prevents them at checkpoints from traveling from town to town , destroys their crops , prevents children from traveling to schools and the sick and injured from getting to the hospitals , it is becoming increasingly difficult to live even an approximation of a normal life .
Most Palestinians feel that the Israeli government ’s intention is to drive them off the land , and there is a great deal of evidence that this is the goal of many Israeli leaders .
At the same time , however , there is a small but determined minority of Israelis , joined by citizens from throughout the world , who are coming to the Palestinian Territories to oppose Israeli occupation .
These “ internationals , ” as they are often called , take part in peaceful marches , attempt to help Palestinian farmers harvest their crops despite Israeli military closures , live in refugee camps in the hope that their presence will prevent Israeli invasions and shelling , and walk children to school .
They are sometimes beaten , shot , and killed .
Some Israeli soldiers are refusing to serve in the West Bank or Gaza , stating : “ We shall not continue to fight beyond the 1967 borders in order to dominate , expel , starve and humiliate an entire people . ”
Meanwhile , the semblance of Palestinian autonomy continues .
Elections held in January , 2005 , resulted in new Palestinian leadership that will govern under occupation and will attempt to negotiate eventual Palestinian liberation .
Yet even this election demonstrated Israel ’s power , as various Palestinian candidates were arrested , detained , and sometimes beaten by Israeli forces .
This aspect , however , like so much else , was rarely reported by the American media .
End Notes
“ Under orders from Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin , ‘ Soldiers armed with cudgels beat up those they could lay their hands on regardless of whether they were demonstrators , or not , breaking into homes by day and night , dragging men and women , young and old , from their beds to beat them .
At Gaza ’s Shifa Hospital 200 people were treated during the first five days of the new policy , most of them suffering from broken elbows and knees .
Three had fractured skulls . ’”

Advertisement Celebrations have taken place around the world to mark the end of 2008 and usher in the new year .
From Sydney to New York and Auckland to London , revellers greeted 2009 with pyrotechnic shows and street parties .
Some 400,000 people braved freezing temperatures in London for a fireworks display beside the Thames .
In New York almost a million people packed a freezing Times Square as the famous Waterford crystal ball descended to cheers at midnight .
Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton - picked as the next US secretary of state - helped New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lower the glittering orb for the midnight countdown , as confetti rained from skyscrapers and fireworks filled the sky .
A number of Arab nations - including Egypt , Jordan and Syria - cancelled their planned celebrations in solidarity with Palestinians in the Hamas - run Gaza Strip after a fifth day of Israeli air - strikes on the coastal enclave .
Muted festivities Kiritimati , or Christmas Island , in the Pacific Ocean became the first inhabited place on Earth to celebrate the new year at 1000 GMT .
In pictures : New year festivities
An hour later residents in Auckland , New Zealand , watched a dramatic fireworks display from the city 's Sky Tower .
In Australia , huge crowds turned out to watch multi-million dollar fireworks displays in Sydney and Melbourne .
In Sydney , a record crowd of up to 1.5 million people watched fireworks explode over the iconic Harbour Bridge .
The display , featuring thunder , rain and lightning effects , was the largest ever staged in the city .
About 5,000kg of fireworks were used .
Organisers of the Sydney festivities said they were hoping it would offer revellers a brief respite from the economic gloom of 2008 .
In the Philippines , President Gloria Arroyo described 2008 as a " tumultuous " year .
" I hope that we can all work together as a global community to weather these storms , " she said .
New Yorkers and tourists welcomed the new year in Times Square In Malaysia , the government is not sponsoring any new year events because of the economic downturn .
Celebrations were also muted in the Indian city of Mumbai , following November 's deadly attacks on the city .
Tight security was planned , with special measures in place along the city 's waterfront - where the militants involved in the attacks slipped ashore .
But some Asian cities did opt to mark the end of 2008 in style .
Fireworks shot from the 101 - storey Taipei Tower as midnight struck in Taiwan .
In Singapore , more than 250,000 people attended a display in Marina Bay .
And in Hong Kong , half a million people watched - some on the shore , some from boats - as fireworks shot into the sky from 10 skyscrapers surrounding Victoria Harbour .
' Help each other '
At a year 's end Vespers prayer in Rome , the splendour of St Peter 's Basilica contrasted with Pope Benedict XVI 's call for " soberness and solidarity " in 2009 .
He urged people not to be afraid during these uncertain times but to help each other .
In London , hundreds of thousands gathered for a spectacular fireworks display by the Thames , and Mayor Boris Johnson set an upbeat tone for the year .
Tight security was in place in Mumbai , India , following November 's attacks " There are those who say we should look ahead to 2009 with foreboding , " said Mr Johnson in his New Year 's address .
" I want to quote Col Kilgore in Apocalypse Now when he says ' Someday captain , this war is going to end ' ; and someday , this recession is going to end . "
" Let 's go forward into 2009 with enthusiasm and purpose , " he added .
Meanwhile , engineers adjusted the Houses of Parliament 's historic clock , Big Ben , to allow an extra second before it struck midnight .
Astronomers added the extra second to allow for a slight slowing in the Earth 's rotation .
In Greece , Palestinian protesters staged a demonstration near an outdoor concert in Athens during New Year celebrations , chanting slogans and burning Israeli , US and EU flags .
As France handed over the EU 's rotating six - month presidency to the Czech Republic , French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for Europe to remain strong in 2009 .
He said the bloc had proved its strength through its reaction to such challenges as the financial crisis , conflict in Georgia and an ambitious greenhouse gas agreement .
" I remain convinced that the world needs a strong , independent , imaginative Europe , " he said .
' Tough times '
Hard on the heels of celebrations in Asia and Europe , revellers packed New York 's Times Square , where Mayor Bloomberg said economic woes promised " tough times " for the city in 2009 .
US president - elect Barack Obama was on holiday in Hawaii , but in his new home of Washington , heavy winds were blamed for at least one death in the area and forced the cancellation of fireworks in two suburbs .
New Year 's
Eve celebrations were also cancelled in Colorado 's famed ski resort , Aspen , after suspicious packages were found at two banks .
Wool scarves gave way to bikinis in South America , however , where as many as two million people squeezed onto Brazil 's Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro despite rainy skies and economic storm clouds .

During Apple 's earnings conference call yesterday , Apple COO Tim Cook fielded a wide variety of questions , but two answers in particular helped shed a bit of light on the likelihood that Apple would enter the netbook market or release a lower end iPhone .
i Phone Nano
The origins of a rumored iPhone Nano stretch back to July 2007 when a JP Morgan analyst essentially made it up out of thin air ( citing " sources " in the supply channel ) .
Since then , other analysts have chimed in and noted that if Apple truly wants to garner significant market share in the smartphone market , it needs to offer a variety of iPhone models at different price points .
Over the past few months , rumors about a cheap iPhone Nano have taken various forms .
Some predicted an iPhone with a smaller screen , while others speculated that Apple would release an iPhone Nano with limited functionality ( i.e , no access to the App Store ) .
Adding fuel to the flames of speculation were case renderings for an iPhone Nano like device that were recently posted online by case manufacturers .
Tim Cook , however , squashed any notion of an iPhone Nano at Apple 's conference call .
In response to a question about iPhone pricing , Cook stressed that Apple will not be producing low - end phones , and that Apple has no desire to be the market leader in terms of units sold .
Instead , Cook emphasized that Apple will continue to focus on building the " world 's best phone . "
This makes perfect sense in light of the fact that the iPhone 3G has n't even been out yet for a year , and that the iTunes App Store continues to grow at an astounding rate .
It makes more sense for Apple to continue pushing the feature - rich iPhone 3G instead of trying to introduce and market a new iPhone model with comparatively limited functionality and lower margins .
As a final nail in the coffin , Cook , in response to a question about iPhone competitors , put to rest any ideas that a smaller form factor iPhone is something Apple would even consider :
Software is the key ingredient , and we believe that we are years ahead of our competitors .
Having different screen sizes , different input methods , and different hardware makes things difficult for developers .
Netbooks
Cook also put to rest the rumor that Apple would soon be ( or should be ) entering the increasingly popular netbook market .
Netbooks are extremely popular right now , and have even eroded some of Apple 's market share in the overall notebook market .
Nevertheless ,
Cook noted that the majority of netbooks ship with less than impressive software and hardware , which makes for an overall inferior user experience .
That , according to Cook , is n't something Apple consumers want .
At Apple 's last earnings conference call , Steve Jobs had some colorful remarks about the potential for an Apple - branded netbook when he stated , " We do n't know how to build a sub - $ 500 computer that is not a piece of junk . "
Cook did mention , though , that Apple will continue to watch the growing netbook market , and while an Apple netbook might happen a ways down the road , do n't expect to see it at your local Apple Store anytime soon .
For the time being , though , Apple seems to be doing just fine without an iPhone Nano or a netbook .
This past quarter , Apple recorded over $ 10 billion in revenue for the first time in its history , while also recognizing its largest quarterly profit in company history .
Analysts who steadfastly argue that Apple needs to release either of the above - mentioned products need to remember that more market share does not always equal greater profits .

As shown on my master page of Ice Flowers and Ice Ribbons I look at many examples that have formed on the stalks of selected species of plants .
The assumption has always been that these types of ice formations are related to plants .
It is well known that needle ice that emerges from soils under certain conditions .
And , I have photos of ice formations that grow on decaying wood .
The nature of the ice in these flowers seems to be coarse hair - like , somewhere between needle ice and the ice ribbons that form on plant stems .
Then I received an email from The Weather Doctor pointing me to his web page showing two photos of ice ribbons emerging from a metal fence in British Columbia .
I got in contact with Sheryl Terris who had taken the photos and received more examples of her photography .
The images below are based on her photos .
In early 2007 I was able to replicate ice formations similar to these .
In early 2008 I was able to extrude more such ice .
I feel I have demonstrated how the ice formed on the fence .
But , I was not able to reproduce some of the more intricate displays of ice shown here .
The two ribbons of ice below extend well over 6 inches ( 15 cm ) in uniform thickness , with striations that appear to reflect the thickness of the slit from which they were extruded .
The ribbons above are relatively thicker than the ribbon below .
This ribbon is quite fine as is evident by the tight loops that fold back on themselves .
But , in both of these formations there are those parallel striations that must have been imposed by the nature of the slit through which these ice ribbons emerged .
The pair of ribbons below are much thicker and more massive than are the ribbons above , but still they are ribbons of ice and have those characteristic striations .
And , this photo gives a good view of welded junction from which the ice emerges .
Obviously , the welder did not seal all of the cracks , thankfully .
But not all of the ice on this fence formed as flat ribbons with nice , parallel striations .
There is only one photo of this ice formation .
What is it ?
It appears there are three different pieces of ice shown in this photo .
On the base of the fence is a block of ice that has dirt on the surface .
There are two long rods of clear ice .
The rod on the right extends up , then becomes more horizontal and the continues up and then down .
Along its length it becomes ever thinner .
By contrast , the rod that emerges on the left seems to be uniform in thickness throughout its length as it extends up , flattens out , turns in a counter - clockwise loop to wrap around itself and extend towards us and form into another complete loop before extending up to its terminus .
On top of these two rods are frozen pieces of snow or hoar frost , which give a fuzzy texture to portions of the rods .
What process forms a rod of ice to emerge in this form ?
How can a thin rod of ice maintain its strength and not break as it loops around itself ?
How long did it take for these rods of ice to form , or those ribbons of ice to form into what looks like holiday candy ?
Below are two ice formations that are more believable , in that I can imagine how these formed .
Obviously , the vertical pipes have gotten filled with rainwater , and there are gaps where the pipes are attached to the railing above .
So , as the water in the vertical pipes froze , it expanded , rose and was extruded out of the gaps .
As in the photos of ribbons above , these more massive ice formations show striations .
Thanks to the sharp eye of Sheryl we have a photographic record of some very exotic ice formations .
I have never seen anything like these ice formations and have never read about anything like this .
Ice is considered to be rigid and is not known to have a plastic form that can be extruded like toothpaste .
Based on the two examples above , I decided to try to grow my own ice formations .
With a few cold days and many cold nights , I tried to gain some insights into the way water freezes in containers of different configurations .
I have broken some plastic pipes and ruptured a metal pipe , but I have grown some ice .
To see what I have done , check out my failures and successes .
Gaze upon the rolling deep
( Fish is plentiful and cheap )
As the sea my love is deep !
Said the Yonghy - Bonghy - Bó .
Edward Lear
THE sea is still deep , and fish may still be relatively cheap , but it costs much more than it used to .
And it is far from plentiful .
This has become a commonplace .
People have long been told that the North Sea is fished out and that the waters of the North Atlantic closest to Europe now produce only a fraction of the bounty of the 1940s .
Books , articles and reports regularly record the decline .
In 2004 , for instance , a British royal commission described in bleak detail the collapse of north - east Atlantic cod , of North Sea hake and plaice , and of other species discarded as “ bycatch ” and thrown back dead into the sea in huge numbers .
Americans have heard similar stories .
An authoritative report from the Pew Oceans Commission told them in 2003 that , of the American fish populations that had been assessed , 30 % were being overfished , many of them unsustainably .
Books like “ Cod ” , by Mark Kurlansky , have eloquently described how the fishing grounds that stretch from the shallow waters off Newfoundland south to Georges Bank , once considered the richest in the world , have come to be commercially moribund .
Governments , though slow to respond , have not been wholly blind to the changes .
Canada 's closed the Grand Banks in 1992 .
Fishermen themselves have seen the evidence , and not just there .
In the 1970s , for instance , West Coast trawlers were landing 11,000 tonnes of bocaccio a year .
In 2001 , just before the fishery was closed , the catch was 214 tonnes .
It will take at least 90 years , say scientists , for the stocks to recover .
And overfishing is not just a problem of northern fisheries .
A paper published in Nature in 2003 carried 13 charts showing the catch per 100 hooks in different fisheries from the temperate Pacific to South Georgia in the southern Atlantic , and from the Gulf of Thailand to the St Pierre Bank off Labrador .
Each chart displayed a similar precipitous descent in the catch from the start of industrial fishing , some time before 1960 , to a virtual plateau between 1980 and 2000 .
“ Our analysis ” , said the authors , Ransom Myers and Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Canada , “ suggests that the global ocean has lost more than 90 % of large predatory fishes . ”
These are the ones , cod , groupers , salmon , tuna and so on , that everyone likes to eat .
An even gloomier assessment came in an article by 14 academics in Science in 2006 .
The accelerating erosion of biodiversity , often associated with overfishing , presaged a “ global collapse ” to the point , in 2048 , where all species currently fished would be gone , they said .
The mackerel - crowded seas ?
Even many scientists who are alarmed by the evidence of overfishing find such conclusions controversial .
Most non-scientists are unmoved .
For a start , fish appears to be in plentiful supply .
Even cod is available ; over 7 m tonnes of cod-family ( Gadidae ) fish are caught each year .
Sushi bars have spread across the world .
To cater for the aversion to red meat , and a new - found need for omega - 3 fatty acids , fish dishes are on every menu , even in steak houses .
Supermarkets and restaurants boast of “ sustainable ” supplies , and sandwiches are reassuringly labelled “ dolphin - friendly ” , however threatened the tuna within them may be .
Best of all , for the ethical consumer , fish are now farmed ( see article ) .
Salmon has become so plentiful that people weary of its delicate taste .
Moreover , fishermen themselves seem sceptical of any long - term scarcity .
They clamour for bigger quotas and fewer restrictions ( except on foreign competitors ) , and complain that the scientists are either ignorant or one step behind the new reality .
Those with long memories can cite previous collapses that have been followed by recoveries .
And , in truth , not all collapses are due solely to overfishing : the sudden crash of California 's sardine industry 60 years ago is now thought to have been partly caused by a natural change in the sea temperature .
Plenty of figures seem to support the optimists .
Despite the exploitation round its coasts , Britain , for instance , still landed 750,000 tonnes of Atlantic fish in 2006 , two - thirds of what it caught in 1951 ; even cod is still being hauled from the north - east Atlantic , mostly by Norwegians and Russians .
Some British fishing communities — Fraserburgh , for example — are in a sorry state , but others still prosper : the value of wet fish landed in Shetland , for example , rose from £ 21 m in 1996 to £ 54 m ( $ 33 m - 99 m ) in 2006 .
Earnings from fishing in Alaska , in whose waters about half of America 's catch is taken , rose from less than $ 800 m in 2002 to nearly $ 1.5 billion in 2007 .
And for the world as a whole , the catch in 2006 was over 93 m tonnes , according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation , compared with just 19 m in 1950 ( see chart ) .
Its value was almost $ 90 billion .
The main reason was that fishermen were still able to exploit their relatively new ability to find and catch their prey .
Most underwater creatures had little to fear from man until 1873 , when the first steam - powered whaling ships , armed with explosive harpoons , were launched .
Whales were then ruthlessly pursued , several species almost to extinction , until hunting was banned in the 1980s .
The steam - powered trawler came next , in 1881 .
When fitted with an otter trawl , invented in 1892 , it enabled fishermen to haul in six times the catch of a sailing ship .
Soon came filleting machines , echo - sounders and spotter planes .
Then Clarence Birdseye , an American fur - trapper turned inventor , developed a system for freezing fish .
This gave the world the fish finger and launched the factory ship that sailed far from home and processed the catch from huge trawlers on the high seas .
Next came the cold war , whose main casualty may have been fish .
The technology designed by America 's Office of Naval Research developed to find the Soviet Union 's submarines and hide NATO 's was soon put to use in the pursuit of haddock , herring and every other kind of underwater prey .
After that came satellites and with them global positioning systems and thermal images , enabling fishermen to find the places where warm and cold waters collide , which is where plankton flourish and fish gather .
Now an array of technology — acoustic fish - finders , broad - swathe mapping of the seabed , computerised track plotters and so on — make it possible to find most fish bigger than a man 's forearm .
There goes that Leviathan
The biggest ones have been the first to go .
As a result , in over - exploited waters the fish tend to be smaller and younger .
Among those caught in the Pacific , the average length of an English sole fell from about 34cm in the 1960s to 30cm in 2002 , a Pacific barracuda from nearly 80 cm in the 1950s to 65 cm in 1970 , a bocaccio from over 50cm in the 1970s to nearer 45 cm in the 1990s .
Whereas record - sized cod 2 metres long and up to 96kg ( 211 lb ) in weight were recorded in Massachusetts in the 19th century , and an average of 4.5 kg per fish was common in living memory , a big cod is now a rarity in the north - west Atlantic .
And when the big fish are gone , smaller varieties become the new catch .
“ Fishing down ” the food web , as the practice is known , resulted in the average length of fish caught off the west coast of Newfoundland falling by a metre between 1957 and 2000 , according to an article by Daniel Pauly and Reg Watson , of the University of British Columbia 's Fisheries Centre , in Scientific American in July 2003 .
When stocks of familiar fish are exhausted in familiar fishing grounds , man turns towards new fish in new places .
Distant - water ships from such countries as Taiwan , South Korea and Russia have been ploughing far - flung oceans ever since the art of freezing fish became simple .
“ Klondikers ” , huge factory ships from eastern Europe , started to turn up in foreign waters in the 1990s .
Spanish boats , following the traditions of the medieval Basques , fish all over the world .
Ships from Bulgaria , China , Japan , Mexico , Poland and Romania can all be found far from home .
Magnum Photos
Ever smaller , ever rarer
There they set about repeating what they have done in their own waters .
Having caught almost all the northern bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and many of the fish off other coasts , the countries of the European Union , for example , have negotiated rights to fish in coastal waters off west Africa .
Now stocks of octopus , lobsters , tuna and other fish in this part of the Atlantic are dangerously low , contributing to the impoverishment of local fishermen .
As a result , many are said to be driven to such desperate measures as eating bushmeat from endangered animals and setting sail in open boats in the hope of illegally settling in Europe .
Rich - country consumers of Senegalese shrimps or Omani lobsters are no doubt delighted with their entrées .
Others may need a little encouragement to buy fish hitherto unknown to them .
Many species are therefore renamed for the retail trade : bocaccio , a kind of rockfish , becomes Pacific red snapper , Patagonian toothfish becomes Chilean , or Australian , sea bass , and dogfish becomes rock salmon .
Creeping things innumerable
In British fish - and - chip shops pollock and coley are increasingly used in place of cod , and in American fast - food outlets Alaska pollock has become the staple .
But in 2008 stocks of Alaskan pollock shrank by half , leaving what is believed to be the world 's largest food fishery poised on the brink of collapse .
This could be a natural fluctuation .
So could the disappearance of chinook salmon from the waters off California and Oregon last year ; the population during the spawning season was 88 % below its all - time high in 2003 .
Most fish - watchers , however , are uneasy .
They see too many signs of overfishing , and too few of recovery .
One of the most recent objects of concern is a small , shrimp - like creature called krill , which is now being fished in a big way .
Krill spend their days in the depths of the sea , rising at night in what they believe to be the safety of darkness to snack on phytoplankton .
In fact , they are likely to be hauled out by fishermen , especially if they are in the waters of Antarctica .
Krill do not end up on plates in restaurants , except perhaps in Japan or Russia , but they are increasingly in demand for their fatty acids , for their enzymes ( used in medicine ) , for feeding to farmed fish , especially to give the flesh of salmon a pink appearance , and for use as fish meal .
And now a technique has been developed that enables trawlermen to process them at sea before their enzymes decompose .
This means ships can stay longer away from port and multiply the size of their annual catch many times .
What are the wild waves saying ?
No one thinks krill are yet endangered , but no one fully understands them .
It is known , however , that many whales and seals and penguins live on them .
And it is known that the plankton they eat cling to the underside of packed ice , ice that may start melting as temperatures rise .
The fear is that devastating the krill population will set in train a series of changes that will affect other creatures .
This is , after all , what is happening in other places , though usually the changes start at the apex of the food web .
Typically , this is a fish - eat - fish affair , with vegetarians like krill taking their place at the bottom ( phytoplankton are plants , whereas zooplankton are animals ) .
Thus the relentless hunting of big sharks off the United States '
Atlantic coast has rendered them unable to “ perform their ecosystem role as top predators ” , in the words of Julia Baum of Dalhousie University .
The upshot is a huge increase in the numbers of their prey , notably ray , skate and smaller sharks .
Cownose ray , which may grow to be over a metre in width , are increasing by about 8 % a year .
With some 40 m of them now looking for food off the East Coast , the shellfish they eat , such as scallops , oysters and clams , have been devastated .
One lesson here is that no species should be fished to the point where the ecosystem is unbalanced .
That conclusion hardly requires the fish - fed brain of Jeeves .
Another is that , to maintain a balance , big “ apex ” fish may be as important as small .
Many fish take years before they are mature enough to spawn : cod , three or four , sturgeon 20 , orange roughy 32 .
And they may be long - lived : cod can survive to 30 , if they are lucky , and sturgeon to 100 .
Kill the fish at the top and you may get an explosion of smaller ones below , gobbling up much more food than would be eaten by a few big fish of the same total weight .
And big fish provide more and better - quality fry .
Take the big and leave the young , a common principle of fisheries managers eager to rebuild stocks , may therefore be a mistake .
If so , it is not their only one .
Saving energy , finding environmentally friendly source of energy is being actively discussed around the world .
For developed nations and their developing counterparts , energy is quickly turning out to be one of “ the ” issues .
Fear of energy starved future is now being seriously discussed - from Washington to Riyadh .
Nepal , one of the poorest nations in the world which is facing acute energy crisis , the dreaded future has arrived .
Government has declared a “ national power crisis ” and the country could face blackouts for 16 hours per day .
Minister for Water Resources commented on the situation to AFP :
“ We had no other alternatives than to declare national power crisis because there is a severe shortage of electricity ” .
Although the scale of recent power cuts is very high , Nepal has been facing shortage for couple of years now .
I remember as a student in Kathmandu in late 1990s working on home assignments under candlelight .
During the dry winter , blackouts were fairly common .
Residents of capital Kathmandu , where Nepal ’s service industry is centered are expressing frustration over the power cuts and its effect on the already suffering economy .
Comment by a reader - Ujwal - at NowPublic voices a regular citizen ’s concerns about the power crises .
“ It has been almost impossible to operate any service industry based on electricity in Kathmandu now .
I see a big upheaval in the coming days .
I suspect the economy of the country might collapse if this is coupled with the collapse of remittance based economy which is dependent on the Middle Eastern economies … ”

Maoist lead Nepalese government is trying to come up ideas to face this situation , but some of its decisions seem too little too late .
For example : banning electricity on hoarding boards .
Chandan Sapkota lists other measures announced by the government :
“ The government has encouraged use of compact fluorescent lamp ( CFL ) .
It has also given subsidies on import of such lamps , initiated generation of 200 MW electricity from thermal plants , and is trying to import electricity from India …… why so late ?
Why did not the leaders heed to this impending crisis earlier ?
Corruption ?
Lack of visionary leaders ? ”
Thermal plants as an alternative power source is generating lot of interest in Nepal where hydro electricity is the “ traditional ” source .
Blogger Utsav Maden comments on the government ’s plan , expressing skepticism .
“ Investments of a reported Rs 9.6 billion and more , into a technology which has received condemnation because of its connections with climate change and others , by a government strapped for funds , does seem rather unusual .
Green signaling the plan against advice from energy experts and the operating institution ( Nepal Electricity Authority ) themselves does question the motive . ”
Amidst the debate over alternative way to generate power and why the country is facing the crises , concern over the effect power cuts is having on the most vulnerable is being highlighted at My Republica .
Sangeeta Rijal says that energy shortage is affecting critical hospital services :
Beware Of Bogus National Broadband Plans Op / Ed : ISPs that spent millions stifling deployment , now want more subsidies ...
With the Obama campaign planning an economic stimulus package that includes spending at least some of our apparently unlimited trillions on infrastructure ( including broadband ) , lobbyists from all carriers are assaulting Washington with their hands out .
Qwest is the latest , writing a love letter to the Obama transition team asking for money to be doled out to the states , who would in turn request bids from companies proposing to achieve 95 % statewide availability of broadband that 's 7 M bps or faster .
Laments Qwest : quote : " ... while many urban areas have multiple broadband service providers , competitive prices , and speeds in excess of 7 Mbps , many rural areas lack even the most basic broadband offerings . "
Qwest 's letter probably did n't mention how they were part of the problem .
This is the same company that spent millions to prevent municipal fiber efforts from succeeding in Qwest 's letter probably did n't mention how they were part of the problem .
This is the same company that spent millions to prevent municipal fiber efforts from succeeding in Seattle and specifically Utah , where the company said it was on " the other side of municipally backed telecom projects " mostly because " of the long - term harm to consumers " caused by wholesale municipal fiber networks offering 50 M bps symmetrical connections .
A Qwest executive once asked the question : " Why provide a Rolls - Royce when a Chevrolet will do ? "
Why provide a Rolls - Royce when a Chevrolet will do ?
- Qwest 's Utah President , Jerry Fenn Years later , once many of those " Rolls Royce " efforts were struggling under Qwest legal assault , the telco finally began offering their slightly faster ADSL2 + service , in limited markets , at speeds of 12 M bps / 896 kbps or 20 M bps /896 kbps .
Years later , once many of those " Rolls Royce " efforts were struggling under Qwest legal assault , the telco finally began offering their slightly faster ADSL2 + service , in limited markets , at speeds of 12 M bps / 896 kbps or 20 M bps /896 kbps .
ADSL2 +'s inherent 896 kbps upstream limitation is considered " next generation " by Qwest , and is as good as it gets for millions of Qwest customers .
Most Qwest customers do n't see those speeds .
Many can't get DSL at all because Qwest , like most carriers , wo n't deploy into the nation 's less profitable corners .
That 's their right as publicly traded companies -- but the problem has been they do n't want anybody else to , either .
Obama�s team is supposedly considering a $ 20 - billion to $ 30 - billion plan to expand broadband , centered largely around providing tax breaks to companies willing to extend broadband where it currently is n't available .
While that might work ( assuming there 's adequate followup and follow through ) , it would make sense to remember that many of these companies already spent millions trying to keep under - served areas from wiring themselves .
Most of them also spent millions fighting efforts to accurately map broadband in this country .
Should they be rewarded ?
You should also ask yourself who , in Qwest 's dream scenario , will map broadband coverage , pick the carriers , and mind the taxpayer money doled out to the States .
It will likely be Connected Nation , a group supported by most major incumbents .
Connected Nation has come under fire for being little more than a dog and pony show , designed by AT&T and others to gobble up State funds while protecting incumbent ISP interests .
All the while , making legislators feel good by falsely reporting that their state 's broadband infrastructure is just rosy .
You 'll soon see a flurry of different ideas about how to improve the nation 's broadband fortunes , most of them sophisticated ruses , designed by incumbent think tanks and lobbyists .
Politicians , technology pundits and individuals need to study these proposals carefully , as carriers have been working very had to design national broadband plans that look good on paper , but are little more than taxpayer money pits .
Many of these proposals have broad , bi-partisan support , but are designed by incumbent lobbyists to derail real , substantive telecom reform .
If the same skepticism applied by " free market " fans to taxpayer - funded municipal broadband is squarely levied upon these taxpayer - funded incumbent slush funds -- carrier lobbyists should n't be able to pull the wool over our collective Ethernet ports .
We might make it through 2009 with a real , consumer - friendly national broadband plan , but it 's going to be a steep uphill climb .
Only with increased consumer awareness and a more skeptical press will we collectively get our Rolls Royce .
If things remain the same ?
Enjoy your Chevy .

Don't expect anything to really change
There is just a new corrupt sheriff running the town and the major players who bought his campaign victory will expect to be paid back in favors - as it has been for over 200 years .
Politicians are all for sale and the new one with his mantra of " change " is no different .
So Washington will dump billions in to the pipeline , but only millions will come out the other end .
You have in GM's Volt a perfect car of the Age of Obama -- or at least the Honeymoon of Obama , before the reality principle kicks in .
Even as GM teeters toward bankruptcy and wheedles for billions in public aid , its forthcoming plug - in hybrid continues to absorb a big chunk of the company 's product development budget .
This is a car that , by GM 's own admission , wo n't make money .
It 's a car that can't possibly provide a buyer with value commensurate with the resources and labor needed to build it .
It 's a car that will be unsalable ...
Last night I noticed Firefox did n't yet have " Gizmodo " in its dictionary .
Curiosity led me to right - click over the red line to see what words it suggested I use instead .
All four were awesome :
Yes , Firefox thinks that , instead of typing the name of our beloved publication , I should instead choose from Gizzard , Quasimodo , Commodore and Sodomize .
While they 're not necessarily the four words I would immediately choose to sum up the wild , at times off - color yet always authoritative spirit that exudes from these pages , I could n't help but be impressed at what may have been the Firefox dictionary AI 's first successful attempt at humor .
Gizmodo :
Is it a chicken part , a tragic hunchback , a top - ranking naval officer or a sex act named after a damned Biblical town ?
Ca n't it be all of these things , Firefox ?
Four men were shot dead and more than 400 died from dehydration and drowning after the Thai army intercepted migrant workers from Bangladesh and Burma and left them to drift at sea , according to survivors ' testimonies seen by the Guardian .
Indian coastguard ships have rescued about 400 dehydrated people and taken them to the Andaman and Nicobar islands .
This week a survivor and three bodies were found on an uninhabited island .
A boatload of 193 people was rescued by the Indonesian navy near Aceh .
According to survivors , whose accounts were recorded in coastguard and security reports in Port Blair , in the Andaman islands , they were brutalised , towed out to sea and left to drift , with little food and water , in boats with no engines .
Officials in Port Blair estimate that the Thai army could have had 1,000 " boat people " in its sights .
The travellers had started out at Teknaf , a town south of Cox 's Bazar and close to the Bangladesh - Burma border .
Reports say only 600 survived .
" All the survivors tell the same story .
They say they were kept on an island , they were beaten up , some were shot dead , and then they were pushed out to sea , " said Andaman 's police chief , Ranjit Narayan .
" But we have no way of verifying their story . "
Thailand has denied the accusations , but has agreed to launch an inquiry .
Police will not let journalists meet the survivors held in Port Blair .
But the Guardian has seen coastguard and security agency joint interrogation reports on the migrants , who set out in groups starting in November .
According to these documents , most are Bangladeshi Muslims , but there are Muslims of the Rohingya ethnic group , from Burma 's western Arakan state , who have been persecuted by the junta .
All were heading for Malaysia to find work .
Thailand was a transit destination .
One account was provided by Abdul Malik , 22 , an unemployed scrap steel cutter from Bangladesh .
Late last year a " job agent " promised him work in Malaysia .
Malik , who can speak English , paid the agent 15,000 takas ( about £ 150 ) , and was put on a boat with 43 others .
After the group was caught , in the presence of Thai soldiers , the members were approached by " a Muslim middleman " who offered to take them to Malaysia if they paid 2,500 takas each .
But no one had money and they ended up on a " forested island inside a barbed wire enclosure " .
According to the South China Morning Post , the island was Koh Sai Daeng , in the Andaman sea , off Thailand 's western coast .
A tourist 's photographs showed migrants alongside holidaymakers .
The migrants were pictured lying in rows on the beach , and a wooden fishing boat was near the shore among the pleasure craft .
" We first thought they were seals , not human beings , " said a tourist .
" Some of them were trying to sit up and looked like they were complaining but were answered with a whip on the back or head .
They were whipped at least eight or nine times . "
The interrogation report says that " Thai army personnel used to torture them physically " .
It states : " Their hands were tied and they were beaten mercilessly several times and they were not even properly provided food and water . "
On about 17 or 18 December " some senior Thai officials " went to the island .
The report says : " In front of them , around 9 pm on the same day , the uniformed personnel started shifting all the Bangladeshis / Myanmarese [ Burmese ] to one big wooden barge which had neither engines nor sails / oars .
During this time four persons were shot dead randomly and their bodies thrown into the sea , and one juvenile aged around 14 - 15 yrs whose hands were tied was also thrown into the sea . "
According to Indian officials , survivors said the teenager had protested loudly after being put in the wooden boat .
The vessel was moved off at about 9 pm , with no engine , no oars and just two sacks of boiled rice and two gallons of boiled water .
It was carrying more than 400 people .
" It was towed for 18 hours in [ a ] north - east direction , " says the report .
The boat was then abandoned .
Days later , on 24 December , about 300 dehydrated men jumped into the sea to swim after seeing a light on the horizon .
Only 11 made it to shore , on Little Andaman Island , after a two - day swim .
Malik was one of them .
The others drowned .
A coastguard ship rescued the 88 still on the boat .
" Any delay and the hull would have sunk , " said Satya Prakash Sharma , the coastguard inspector general for the Andaman and Nicobar islands .
" It was taking in water and was badly waterlogged . "
Kailash Negi , a coastguard commandant , said : " These are all poor people who were looking for work .
But they were treated very harshly , inhumanely , and they were in a horrible condition . "
Posted by modderfreak Basically a nice idead ( as discussed on the forums ) , but absolutely horrible executed .
Seriously , I wonder how so many people can be blind .
The face texture is just a blurry photo you overlayed at the middle of the face .
It looks like you did n't even try to fit the UVMaps of the model ; nose , mouth and eyes are anywhere but at the right places .
You only replaced a small piece of the whole face texture ; the glasses are cut off at the place where the photo you used ends , the texture and coloration of the default skin does not match the one of your photo .
You did n't even change the colour of the hair to Gabe Newells , to be excact you did not edit anything except for the face .
Sorry , but if the option was still there , I would disapprove this submission for lacking in effort .

Judge turns down adoption bid , says couple too educated
STAFF WRITER
A highly educated US couple was seeking reconsideration from Taiwanese judges on their adoption of a developmentally delayed baby girl after a Kaohsiung District Court last week rejected their case , fearing the couple would be unsatisfied with the child once she grows up , local media reported .
The Apple Daily reported that the Marks , who both have Harvard doctoral degrees , came to Taiwan to plead with the judges for another chance when the court rejected their adoption of eight - month - old Ju-yi ( 如意 ) .
The court based their decision on fear the couple , who agreed to adopt the baby without ever spending time with her , could end up being disappointed because of their high educational background .
The judges , however , said the couple were welcome to appeal after spending time with the child .
At a press conference in Kaohsiung on Wednesday in the company of Democratic Progressive Party Councilor Huang Shu-mei ( 黃淑美 ) , the couple said they decided to adopt when they could not have their own children .
The couple saw a picture of the child in July through a Kaohsiung - based charity organization .
Without seeing the baby and after consulting with doctors , the couple agreed to the adoption with full knowledge of her developmental problems .
The couple said their hearts were shattered when the court ruled against them .
They were quoted in the report as saying that after spending time with Ju-yi in the last few days , they felt she was an “ angel ” and desperately wanted to take her home .
Kuo Liang - ling ( 郭亮伶 ) , the head of the charity organization , said the Marks were the best candidates they had seen and hoped the judges would give them a chance .
Kaohsiung City Bureau of Social Welfare chief Hsu Chuan - sheng ( 許傳盛 ) said if not adopted , Ju-yi might end up in an orphanage , adding that adoption by the Marks would be the best arrangement because most Taiwanese do not like adopting developmentally challenged children .
Each year , approximately 3,000 Taiwanese children are adopted , 10 percent of them by foreign families , most from the US .

ROME  Mother Teresa recited the simple prayer of St. Francis every day .
Margaret
Thatcher cited it upon becoming prime minister of Britain , and Alcoholics Anonymous included it in its “ 12 steps ” book .
But something else is notable about the prayer that begins : “ Lord , make me an instrument of thy peace ; where there is hatred , let me sow love ; where there is injury , pardon ; where there is doubt , faith . ”
St. Francis of Assisi , who was born in the 12th century , probably had nothing to do with it .
An article published this week in L’Osservatore Romano , the Vatican newspaper , said the prayer in its current form dates only from 1912 , when it appeared in a French Catholic periodical .
And it became wildly popular only after it was reprinted in L’Osservatore Romano in 1916 at the behest of Pope Benedict XV , who wanted a prayer for peace in the throes of World War I .
Construction of Florida 's Largest Solar Plant Begins
December 2nd , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
[ social_buttons ]
Florida Power &
Light , the state ’s biggest utility , broke ground today on what it says will be the first utility - scale solar investment in the state — and the first hybrid solar facility in the world to combine a solar - thermal field with a combined - cycle natural gas power plant .
Consisting of 180,000 mirrors spread out over 500 acres , FPL ’s 75 - megawatt Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center is situated on the Atlantic coast just north of Palm Beach County .
FPL ’s new facility is The Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center will use less fossil fuel when heat from the sun is available to help produce the steam needed to generate electricity .
It also matches solar power with an existing combined - cycle natural gas plant , so that when the sun is not shining , the natural gas can take over the work of powering the turbines .
Florida ’s Governor Charlie Crist , a big advocate of renewable energy and environmental protection , lauded the ground - breaking .
“ Florida ’s future growth and economic strength depends on how we address climate change , and we know we can reduce greenhouse gases by using fewer fossil fuels and more natural energy sources like solar , ” said Gov. Crist .
“ This solar facility is a significant step in that direction . ”
The plant is the first of three FPL solar facilities state regulators have approved in Florida , which , according to the utility , will make the state the second - largest solar energy producer in the country .
In addition to the Martin facility , FPL will also build two other solar projects in Florida – one at NASA ’s Kennedy Space Center and the other in Desoto County .
These facilities will add 35 megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity to the state .
Combined , these projects help strengthen FPL Group ’s position as the nation ’s clean energy leader .
The Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center will provide enough power to serve about 11,000 homes .
Over 30 years , the solar facility will prevent the emissions of more than 2.75 million tons of greenhouse gases .

Osama bin Laden is Dead Bob Moriarty

Nov 13 , 2008
I 'm pleased to see Barak Obama hit the ground running after his election on the 4th .
The US needs change .
I 'd like to see him announce the death of Osama bin Laden as one of his first official duties .
Bin Laden often better known as bin Forgotten died in December of 2001 .
There is nothing I am saying that is news to anyone who has actually spent any time thinking .
Osama bin Laden had serous kidney disease that required him to have dialysis treatment twice a week .
There are n't any dialysis machines floating around in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
A few months back a reporter finally asked the question that should have been asked years ago at a White House press conference .
How is it that a guy who was seriously ill seven years ago is getting treatment for end - stage renal disease in some cave in Afghanistan ?
The woman conducting the press conference panicked at the thought of answering that most basic question and immediately canceled the rest of the briefing .
The United States does not need a boogieman living in a cave in Asia .
Osama bin Laden is dead .
Barak Obama should be honest enough with the American people to declare him dead .
Here are the facts .
The last intelligence intercept of Osama bin Laden was on December 14 of 2001 .
He has not been heard from since .
President Bush and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld hinted in late December of 2001 that they knew Osama bin Laden was dead .
President Musharraf of Pakistan announced in January of 2002 that Osama bin Laden was probably dead of kidney disease .
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan was quoted in October of 2002 as saying , " The more we do n't hear of him , and the more time passes , there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere . "
But the actions of the US Military are the most telling .
There is n't a single soldier , sailor or Marine tasked with chasing down Osama bin Laden , dead or alive .
Because we know exactly where he is .
He 's dead .
So the US military is either totally or absolutely incompetent or Osama bin Laden died years ago and we 've been fighting the boogieman .
As early as July of 2002 , even the FBI 's counterterrorism chief was quoted as saying ; Osama bin Laden is " probably " dead .
The US does not need a boogieman ; we have real challenges ahead of us .
We need a President who will not lie to us on a constant basis .
While you are at it Mr President Elect , you may want to mention that Iran never threatened to wipe Israel off the map and 16 US Intelligence agencies all agree [ pdf ]
Iran does not have a nuclear weapons program .
But you knew that , did n't you ?
Iran is neither the enemy of the United States nor Israel .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A court Thursday rejected an appeal filed by a former administrative law judge who sued a dry cleaners for $ 54 million over a missing pair of pants .
An unidentified man talks on a cell phone in front of the Chung family 's shop , Custom Cleaners .
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals " ruled resoundingly in favor of the Chung family and denied Mr. Roy Pearson 's appeal of the case completely , " said Christopher Manning , an attorney for the Chung family , who own Custom Cleaners .
" The D.C. Court of Appeals held that the trial court correctly ruled that Mr. Pearson 's claims had no merit whatsoever , " he added .
The Chungs have " some level of relief , " Manning told CNN , " but they wo n't count Mr. Pearson out for at least trying to torment them further " with future appeals .
" We are very happy with the result and thank everyone for supporting us , " Jin Chung said in a statement issued by Manning .
" The past three years have been very difficult , but we hope this nightmare is finally over . "
Pearson initially sought $ 67 million from the Chungs , calculating the amount by estimating years of legal violations , adding nearly $ 2 million in common law claims for fraud .
The saga began in May 2005 , when Pearson took several pairs of pants to Custom Cleaners for alteration as he prepared to start his new job as an administrative law judge .
He alleged that among them was a pair of pants from a blue and maroon suit .
When he came to collect his clothing , he said , the Chungs tried to give him a pair of charcoal gray pants that were not his .
During a two - day trial , Pearson , who represented himself , said that when he took the pants to the cleaners , his financial situation was precarious :
He had just been ordered to pay $ 12,000 in attorney 's fees to his ex-wife , and his credit cards were at their limit .

He claimed millions of dollars in attorney fees and millions more in punitive damages for what he called fraudulent advertising under the law .
He also claimed that a sign in the store 's window promising " satisfaction guaranteed " was an unconditional warranty that required the defendants to honor any claim by any customer without limitation .
The Chungs ' attorney argued that no reasonable person would interpret the signs to mean an unconditional promise of satisfaction .
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Judith Bartnoff agreed , ruling that Custom Cleaners did not violate the city 's Consumer Protection Act .
Do n't Miss FindLaw : Read the opinion
Manning , whose law firm handled the appeal on a pro bono basis for the Chungs , said the Chungs hope the " vague and often unfair " act will be changed " so that others do not suffer like they did . "
In August 2007 , the Chungs dropped their bid to recover legal costs in the hopes that Pearson would drop his appeal .
Pearson may request that the appeal be heard again by the entire panel of D.C. Court of Appeals judges , Manning said .
He also could petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for an appeal .
" It is the Chungs ' hope that Mr. Pearson will not attempt to appeal any further and will end his frivolous and baseless attacks on the Chung family , " Manning wrote in the statement .
" The 3 ½ years this case has been pending and appealed have been very difficult for the Chungs , " he said .
" They lost two of their dry cleaning stores and their realization of the American dream . "
He said the family wants to " quietly return to their one remaining small dry- cleaning store ... to rebuild their lives . "
Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007 while the lawsuit was pending and was not reappointed as an administrative law judge when his term expired .
He filed a federal lawsuit in May 2008 to get his government job back , accusing city government and others of an " unlawful demotion and subsequent termination . "
That suit remains pending .

GOP insiders and party activists are excited about today ’s RNC chairman debate hosted by Grover Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform .
Norquist will moderate the debate beginning at 1 pm Eastern this afternoon at the National Press Club in Washington DC .
The event will be broadcast on C - SPAN and streamed at RNCDebate.org .
And lots of conservative Twitter users will be in attendance .
HA round - up here .
Questions ostensibly will come from grass - roots conservatives , though a heated battle broke out between Ron Paul supporters who want to focus on policy and electoral - driven Beltway strategists like Patrick Ruffini who only want “ good ” questions that focus on strategy .
Chastises Ruffini :
Whether it ’s Ron Paul Republicans or movement conservatives or moderates , my message to all is one and the same : the RNC is not a policymaking body — nor should it be .
It cannot make Republicans in Congress spend less , worthy a goal as that might be .
The RNC ’s job is to win elections — period .
That means the RNC is made up of good political people — not policy wonks — who with all due respect , you would n’t want making policy .
All the candidates for RNC Chairman are good conservatives .
RNC members should choose the one who will win elections .
As I ’ve written over the last few days , technology , strategy , and tactics are not the only things — and success in these areas is inextricably linked to having a Republican message “ we can believe in . ”
I ’ve had my disagreements with Ron Paul supporters , but I see nothing wrong with their desire to grill RNC candidates on issues that matter to them .
The RNC may not be a “ policymaking body , ” but its policy positions drive “ strategy ” and “ tactics ” and donor outreach efforts .
Which brings us back to Grover Norquist and the unpleasant realities that these strategists and rebranding gurus and RNC candidates do n’t want to talk about .
Party power player Norquist and the ATR propose to help fix the GOP ’s problems .
Norquist is part of the problem .
Some of us have not forgotten how Norquist made common cause with the left - wing zealots at People for the American Way in a forum bashing the Patriot Act — and how he forged even more dangerous alliances in the name of Muslim GOP outreach .
Flashback from my column in October 2003 :
Alec “ the Bloviator ” Baldwin has a new bosom buddy : Beltway Republican strategist Grover Norquist .
The Bush - bashing actor - turned - activist and the Muslim vote - courting political organizer joined together at a Washington , D.C. - area conference last weekend to perpetuate bald lies about the Patriot Act and to oppose the “ repressive ” War on Terror ( repressing terrorist suspects apparently being a bad thing ) .
Baldwin and Norquist ’s panel , titled “ Strange Bedfellows , ” was sponsored by the ultraliberal group , People for the American Way ( PFAW ) .
When PFAW head and panel participant Ralph Neas ranted about the lack of judicial and Congressional oversight of the Justice Department ’s terror investigations , the audience applauded passionately .
According to National Review Online reporter Byron York , Baldwin ( the “ moderator ” ) then turned to Norquist for comment .
“ Ditto , ” Norquist replied .
Never mind the flat - out falsity of Neas ’ claim .
The smarmy Baldwin looked at his panelists and proudly remarked : “ Ca n’t you feel the love ? ” … Norquist ’s kissy - kissy partnership with a washed - up Hollywood Clintonite is the least of his unseemly alliances .
Consider :
The conference they attended last weekend was hosted by the National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom ( NCPPF ) , which was co-founded in 1997 by Sami Al - Arian — the former University of South Florida professor charged earlier this year as a fund raiser and organizer for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group .
The money Al - Arian allegedly raised went to terrorist operations overseas that killed at least two Americans .
In 2001 , Al - Arian ’s NCPPF gave Norquist an award for his work to abolish the use of secret intelligence evidence in terrorism cases .
Al - Arian was the keynote speaker .
Insight investigative reporter Ken Timmerman says Norquist told the magazine he remains “ proud ” of the award .
Among other major participants and sponsors of the NCPPF conference was the American Muslim Council ( AMC ) .
In January , the group accused President Bush of “ calling on God to kill innocent Iraqi children . ”
The next day , the group instructed mosque directors to block FBI counterterrorism efforts .
Late last month , AMC founder Abdurahman Alamoudi was charged with illegally accepting money from Libya for his efforts to persuade the United States to lift sanctions against that nation .
He also allegedly attempted to smuggle hundreds of thousands of dollars to Syria , which federal officials say was intended for delivery to Damascus - based terrorist groups .
Alamoudi ’s arrest is part of a larger Justice Department investigation of terrorism funding focused on Saudi - backed Islamic foundations and businesses based in Herndon , Va . ( Alamoudi is also responsible for founding the American Muslim Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs Council to “ certify Muslim chaplains hired by the military , ” including Capt .
James “ Youssef ” Yee — charged last week with taking classified information home from Guantanamo Bay . )
A so - called “ moderate , ” Alamoudi is on record praising the terrorist group Hezbollah and proclaiming : “ We are all followers of Hamas . ”
Norquist ’s lobbying firm is registered as a lobbyist for Alamoudi .
Alamoudi provided seed money for Norquist ’s Islamic Institute , which shares space with Norquist ’s Americans for Tax Reform group .
The institute is run by Alamoudi deputy and former AMC government relations director Khaled Saffuri .
Saffuri and Norquist have worked closely with Bush senior adviser Karl Rove to give radical Muslim activists access to the White House .
No doubt because of their efforts , Alamoudi was invited to a White House prayer service after the Sept. 11 attacks .
If any Democrat activist had such shady connections , conservatives would be on him like white on rice .
Instead , Norquist has gotten away with smearing his critics — most notably , former Reagan official Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy , one of the most decent and patriotic Republicans I ’ve had the honor of meeting — as hatemongers .
Alamoudi pleaded guilty in 2004 to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars from Libya in violation of U.S. law and attempting to hide it from the government .
Another reminder from Insight magazine of how Norquist tried to silence those who questioned his reckless strategic decisions by branding them as racists and bigots :
Norquist was Alamoudi ’s most influential Washington facilitator , authorities believe , noting that Norquist reminds friend and foe alike that he is close to the president ’s powerful political strategist , Karl Rove .
Norquist , who previously has denied any suggestion that his work facilitated any wrongdoing , not only introduced Alamoudi to Washington GOP power circles but also Sammy Al Arian , whom prosecutors arrested earlier this year for alleged terrorist activities .
Federal law - enforcement sources say they are focusing on some of Norquist ’s associates and financial ties to terrorist groups .
ORDER IT NOW Alamoudi ran , directed , founded or funded at least 15 Muslim political - action and charitable groups that have taken over the public voice of Islamic Americans .
Through a mix of civil - rights complaints , Old Left - style political coalitions and sheer persistence , Alamoudi helped inch the image of U.S. - based Islamists toward the political mainstream and induced politicians to embrace his organizations .
He sought to secure the support first of the Clinton administration in seeking to repeal certain antiterrorist laws , but when Bill Clinton failed to deliver , Alamoudi defected to Bush , then governor of Texas .
Alamoudi and other Muslim leaders met with Bush in Austin in July [ 2000 ] , offering to support his bid for the White House in exchange for Bush ’s commitment to repeal certain antiterrorist laws .
That meeting , sources say , began a somewhat strained relationship between the self - appointed Muslim leaders and the Bush team .
Some senior Bush advisers voiced caution to Rove , who is said to have disregarded such concerns , seeing instead an opportunity to bring another ethnic and religious group into the GOP big tent .
A photo of the Austin event shows Bush with Alamoudi standing over his left shoulder , flanked by the former head of the Pakistani Communist Party , several open supporters of the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups and other individuals Insight is trying to identify .
Canceled checks obtained by Insight show Alamoudi provided seed money to start a GOP - oriented Muslim group called the Islamic Institute , which Norquist originally chaired and now is led by former Alamoudi aide and former AMC staffer Khaled Saffuri .
A White House memo obtained by Insight prepared for coordinating Muslim and Arab - American “ public - liaison ” events with the White House shows that the Islamic Institute was instrumental in establishing the connection .
The memo , from early 2001 , provides lists of invitees and the name , date of birth and Social Security number of each .
Norquist , as the first chairman of the Islamic Institute , tops the list .
Alamoudi and others , including Norquist , tried to keep critics at bay by branding them as “ racists ” and “ bigots . ”

Will the next RNC chairman remain silent about Norquist ’s security - undermining strategic alliances ?
Will the next RNC chairman openly reject the same race - card - playing strategies that have corrupted a money - grubbing party establishment ?
Or will the field of candidates kiss the ring and hold their tongues ?
The guaranteed silence on these issues today will speak volumes .

The RNC debate is over .
There was much pandering and kowtowing and pledging to increase minority outreach efforts .
What no RNC candidate would say :
I will never engage in “ outreach ” efforts at the cost of our security and sovereignty .

It ’s easy to lay the destruction of Wall Street at the feet of the CEOs and directors , and the bulk of the responsibility does lie with them .
But some of it lies with shareholders and the whole model of public ownership .
Wall Street never has been — and likely never will be — paid primarily for capital preservation .
However , in the days when Wall Street firms were funded primarily by capital contributed by individual partners , preserving that capital in the long run was understandably a higher priority than it is today .
Now Wall Street firms are primarily owned not by partners with personal capital at risk but by demanding institutional shareholders examining short - term results .
When your fiduciary duty is to manage the firm for the benefit of your shareholders , you can easily persuade yourself that you ’re just balancing risk and reward — when what you ’re really doing is betting the firm .
As we work our way through the wreckage of this latest colossal bust , our government — at our urging — will go to great lengths to try to make sure such a bust never happens again .
We will “ fix ” the “ problems ” that we decide caused the debacle ; we will create new regulatory requirements and systems ; we will throw a lot of people in jail .
We will do whatever we must to assure ourselves that it will be different next time .
And as long as the searing memory of this disaster is fresh in the public mind , it will be different .
But as the bust recedes into the past , our priorities will slowly change , and we will begin to set ourselves up for the next great boom .
A few decades hence , when the Great Crash of 2008 is a distant memory and the economy is humming along again , our government — at our urging — will begin to weaken many of the regulatory requirements and systems we put in place now .
Why ?
To make our economy more competitive and to unleash the power of our free - market system .
We will tell ourselves it ’s different , and in many ways , it will be .
But the cycle will start all over again .
So what can we learn from all this ?
In the words of the great investor Jeremy Grantham , who saw this collapse coming and has seen just about everything else in his four - decade career : “ We will learn an enormous amount in a very short time , quite a bit in the medium term , and absolutely nothing in the long term . ”
Of course , to paraphrase Keynes , in the long term , you and I will be dead .
Until that time comes , here are three thoughts I hope we all can keep in mind .
First , bubbles are to free - market capitalism as hurricanes are to weather : regular , natural , and unavoidable .
They have happened since the dawn of economic history , and they ’ll keep happening for as long as humans walk the Earth , no matter how we try to stop them .
We ca n’t legislate away the business cycle , just as we ca n’t eliminate the self - interest that makes the whole capitalist system work .
We would do ourselves a favor if we stopped pretending we can .

Through some reverse engineering , the two developers produced firmware for at least three Broadcom wireless cards ( 4306 , 4318 and 4320 ) and announced their release under GPLv2 .
They based their work explicitly on their own experience and assembler / disassembler software developed by the b43 community " as a starting point to implement other MAC [ Medium Access Control ] algorithms for research purposes . "
It can spare Linux users who use wireless cards with the chips from having to access the Broadcom website .
Previously users needed to run a special b43 - fwcutter ( firmware cutter ) script that extracted the firmware from the website .
Broadcom has recently supported Linux only via proprietary drivers without providing free access to the firmware .
The open drivers from the Open Firmware for WiFi ( OpenFWWF ) project are meanwhile still based on the initval data from Broadcom 's firmware .
Users extract this data by following the b43 driver installation process .
The OpenFWWF project firmware is available for download from the University of Brescia ( Italy ) website .
A few caveats : unsupported in the firmware are RTS / CTS handshakes , hardware cryptography acceleration and dot11 quality of service ( QoS ) .
Most users will have to wait some time before the drivers go into a distro .
The b43 tools to compile the firmware are available here and the source code here .
The project website also shows how to use the downloaded firmware .
Since the dawn of history , mankind has been plagued by an unnecessary burden whilst grocery shopping at their neighborhood supermarket : telling the cashier whether they prefer a paper or plastic bag .
Precious moments are squandered .
Moments better spent reading the collected works of Spinoza , curing cancer , building shelters for the homeless , or leveling Night Elf druids in World of Warcraft .
IBM may have discovered a solution to this most grievous of conditions with a US patent approved only yesterday .
Let bells ring and the annals of history show that August 5 , 2008 was a great day indeed .
Patent 7,407,089 ( available here ) is a method and system for identifying a customer and displaying whether they like paper or plastic bags without the need for uncomfortable questioning .
From the patent 's description :
" However , at conventional retail locations , the customer is likely to be asked for their packaging preference each time the customer passes through a cashier station , resulting in unnecessary inconvenience for both the customer and the cashier .
What is needed is a more flexible system and method for determining packaging preference that overcomes some of these limitations . "
Welcome to the stage of history
Shhh !
No more words , only knowledge
According to our admittedly rough calculations , implementation of the system could have a major impact on the grocery business .
Consider :
If a customer is standing 3 feet away from the cashier , it would take approximately 0.002665 for the words " paper or plastic ? " to reach him at the speed of sound .
Factor in a generous one second pause to process the question , it would take roughly 1.0053317 seconds for the full round trip conversation .
But using IBM 's technology and assuming the cashier is standing about 1 foot away from her register , it would take a mere 0.000000001016703 seconds for the information to reach her at the speed of light .
( Dear pedantic readers : yes , this model takes place in a vacuum .
And you know what ?
I 'm not even sorry . )
The point is that about 1.00533169999 seconds are saved per transaction .
This could be further improved if IBM were to develop a speedier way for the cashier to communicate the information to the bagger .
We 're thinking some sort of neural link between all grocery store employees .
Oh , and maybe a death ray for all those charity solicitors standing outside the store .
Might as well reach for the stars here . ®
WASHINGTON , Jan. 22 ( UPI ) --
At least 30 U.S. banks since 2000 have sidestepped federal directives by switching to state supervision , a Washington Post study found .
Over the past eight years 240 banks have chosen to make the switch from federal oversight to state charters .
Of those 240 , it is difficult to assess how many anticipated federal action they wanted to avoid , the Post reported Thursday .

The various standards between federal regulations and the 50 different state systems creates what former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns once called , " a competition in laxity . "
" A bank that 's under an enforcement order may be trying to just get out from under that enforcement order .
We do n't think as a matter of public policy that that 's prudent bank regulation , " said attorney Robert Lamont at the West Virginia Division of Banking .
About 1,550 banks operate under national charters , which places them under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
About 5,600 banks are state - chartered .
Similarly , the Office of Thrift Supervision oversees federally chartered savings - and - loans in competition with state systems .
The systems also include a fallback federal regulator , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner at his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill called for a " stronger , more resilient system . "
Inhuman Calculations Did Israel Commit War Crimes in Gaza ?
Did Israel violate international law in Gaza ?
The immense number of Palestinian civilian casualties suggests that it did .
But can the laws of war really be applied to asymmetrical conflicts such as Israel 's war with Hamas ?

There 's nothing quite like taking a cool trip down the water slide at the Atlantis Resort in The Bahamas , plunging into the refreshing pool at the end , and ...
HOLY CRAP !!
THAT'S A SHARK !
But it was all too real when hotel staff saw that one of the sharks from the famous resort aquarium had somehow jumped out of its tank and onto a nearby water slide -- where it managed to slide down into the pool .
It all went down before the pool opened Tuesday -- so nobody was in the water -- but here 's where it gets tragic :
A rep for the Atlantis tells TMZ the shark died a short time after swimming in the chlorinated water .
Here 's the heartbreaking statement :
" Yesterday morning at around 9:30 AM , prior to the resort 's waterscape opening to guests , a 12 + - year - old female reef shark jumped over an 18 inch wide and 1 foot high sustaining structure into the resort 's Leap of Faith water slide .
The Atlantis Aquarists believe the shark was startled by an unusual circumstance that we have no way of defining completely .
In the over ten years guests have experienced the Leap of Faith , the reef shark itself , harmless to humans as it is fed regularly by our staff , had shown no previous incidences of leaping out of the water in the marine habitat ...
...
The habitat itself is part of the resort 's open system which filters water from the Atlantic Ocean and is completely separated from the chlorinated water system on the slides .
Once the shark fell onto the slide and into the chlorinated water , it was in significant distress .
The Marine Aquarium Operations team responded immediately and was able to retrieve the animal at the bottom of the slide and return the animal to the main marine habitat in an attempt to resuscitate her .
Despite the team 's best efforts to recover the animal , it died shortly after the occurrence .
There was no danger to our guests or staff , both of whom interact with these sharks daily in our various interactive programs ( we have guests enter the shark habitat to swim and interact with the sharks in bathing attire only ) .
Madoff Fund was Bust NOT a Fraud , but Fraud Entitles Investors to Compensation international | crime and justice | other press Friday December 26 , 2008 00:24 Friday December 26 , 2008 00:24 by Terence by Terence Madoff pulls the wool over everyones ' eyes .
In a brilliant piece of detective work and logic reasoning , writer Muhammad Rafeeq has exposed what Madoff is really at by pleading guilty to the $ 50 billion so called fraud .
Rafeeq worked for many years in large investment firms and knows how the system works .
On reading that banks like HSBC and Santander and others have lost billions , he says there is absolute no way that these banks would commit money to a single institute like Madoff without an extensive history of accounts going back at least 3 years and investigation and analysis of the investment model , assets and other data .
There are teams of specialists in these banks to do this all the time .
Rafeeq suggests that Madoff fund simply went bust in which case the investors would not be entitled to get any money back .
But by claiming it is a fraud and Madoff has pleaded guilty , and the state accepts it , it means all the so called defrauded investors are entitled to be fully compensated under the US government 's financial fraud protection scheme .
In this brilliant article Rafeeq brings to the fore what any of us should know as obvious if we think about it and Madoff has deceived us all twice .
There is no way that so many people and so many institutes , banks and pension funds would have invested billions with Madoff with absolutely zero oversight or prior investigation .
The more likely scenario is that is hedge fund went bust as are up to 30 % of hedge funds are expected to do so .
But by pleading guilty , the entire corrupt and criminal system has gone along with his deceit and accepted .
It means that the tax payer will ultimately be bailing out these losses .
Expect more " frauds " like Madoff to be come to light and the CEOs to strangely plead guilty because they now all want to get on the bailout gravy train .
Here 's some choice quotes from the article :
The first caught his attention
.... So a truly heartwarming confession .
And it was apparently made to his 2 sons , both of whom who worked for the fund and who had absolutely no idea that this fraud was being perpetrated , until such time as this astounding confession .
But then I started to look more closely at the mix of investors who have lost money .
About half of them are professional investing institutions ....
... Spanish bank Santander had £ 2.1 billion of client money with Madoff .
HSBC has admitted to lending about £ 600 million to funds who wanted to use debt to gear up their positions with Madoff .
Then the dots begin to join ...
I have acted as a professional consultant to major EC and US financial institutions on corporate and institutional credit risk and the idea that anyone in HSBC or Santander could authorise large investment without the internal checks and controls being employed is almost impossible .
To try and believe that EVERY institution that invested in Madoff circumvented their internal control procedures IS impossible .
....
....
When the credit committee are called together to review an application , everything is ready prepared for them ..... ..... the lower levels of credit approval process will have prepared a summary of all the application documentation , included in the meeting bundle , with the strengths , weaknesses , and other important credit risk points .
This application will usually contain a set of audited accounts going back a minimum of 3 years and most likely 5 years .
There will be a full credit breakdown of the investment profile of the business , Madoff 's hedge fund , looking at how the fund obtains its returns ; investment assets and investment methodology .
After the committee is satisfied that all the issues and concerns have been addressed they will vote on the approval or otherwise .
The article provides even more compelling evidence ....
So why plead guilty ?
The answer is simple .
Look on the net and you will see that because this case is being labelled a fraud , it would appear that investors are going to be able to claim their investment back under the US government 's financial fraud protection scheme .
A judge has already given his approval in principle for compensation , without any evidence having been presented and financial fraud being demonstrated in a court of law .
And it would appear that there will never be such a demonstration in a court of law .
Why ?
It would appear that all the funds financial records are mostly " missing " ( rather like Dov Zakheim 's US $ 1.4tn ) and those few records that do survive are in a terrible mess .
However , since the guy has pleaded guilty we do not need to demonstrate the fraud , because he says he is guilty .
And look further on the net and you will see that these " victims " have also been told by the US tax authorities that they will probably also be entitled to claim back some taxes on these defrauded sums .
Rather than saying this hedge fund has gone bust , due to its choice of investment assets and investment methologies , a scenario which is highly probable in the current financial paradigm , since all the professionals are predicting that at least 30 % of all hedge funds are about to fail , more than 700 of them , the CEO chooses to fess up to fraud .
If the CEO admits the fund has gone bust , then all those wealthy members of the Jewish community get nothing , but if the CEO admits to fraud they get their money back as compensation from the US tax payer , just as they are also drawing money back from the tax payers with the other hand .
The lesson to learn from this article and relatively simple logical reasoning about the facts of the case is how shallow all the other coverage has been and how easily the public even in a huge swindle like this is distracted from the key kernel of truth that common sense thinking about the facts demonstrate .
It should also be quite clear that all the investors and institutes that will get their money back , know that Madoff is falsely pleading guilty and carrying out a fraud by pretending it to be a fraud .
Thus they are essentially parties to the crime too .

Advertisement African leaders have called for an immediate ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for UN peacekeepers to get greater powers .
After a summit in Nairobi on the crisis , they urged the creation of humanitarian corridors to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has meanwhile warned that the conflict could engulf the wider region .
Unnamed UN officials say Angolans are fighting with government troops .
New clashes between government and rebel forces have broken out near Goma .
Thousands of displaced people have fled in panic from a nearby camp , as the clashes continue .
The UN force , Monuc , has deployed helicopters to try to contain the violence .
See detailed map of the area DR Congo has accused UN peacekeepers of failing to stop rebels from killing civilians in the east of the country .
' Heightened crisis '
Reading out a communique by the seven leaders present at the summit , Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula said the peacekeepers ' mandate should be amended to give them " peace - making " capabilities and rebel groups in the region should be disarmed according to existing agreements .
The government has denied launching a counter - offensive " There should be an immediate ceasefire by all the armed men and militias in North - Kivu , " he added .
" There should be establishment of a humanitarian corridor throughout the area to ensure immediate address of the humanitarian situation and tragedy . "
Earlier , Mr Ban criticised the recent offensive by Gen Laurent Nkunda 's CNDP rebels .
" The recent military offensives by the CNDP have radically compounded the situation , led to severe humanitarian consequences and thrust the eastern DRC once more into a phase of heightened crisis .
This crisis could engulf the broader sub-region , " Mr Ban said , quoted by AFP news agency .
" As leaders of Africa , you have a historic responsibility , it is a critical moment for the Great Lakes region , and for Africa as a whole .
We must put the cycle of violence behind us . "

However , in a separate development a Uruguayan officer serving with the UN peacekeepers in DR Congo said the government side was being reinforced by Angolan troops .
The officer spoke to international news agencies in Goma , saying the Angolans had arrived there four days ago .
Two eye - witnesses have told the BBC they have seen Angolan troops in the area .
Angola is an ally of the Congolese government and has been invited by Mr Kabila to provide military assistance .
But its government has said it will not intervene directly .
Angola and Zimbabwe both supported DR Congo with troops during the 1998 - 2003 war .
Gen Nkunda is not attending the talks , but former Nigerian President and UN special envoy Olesegun Obasanjo said he would be given a copy of the communique and his reaction would determine the international community 's next move .
However , AFP quoted a CNDP spokesman as saying that the summit had turned out to be " for nothing " .
Kiwanja investigation UN peacekeepers said gunfire erupted on Friday just north of the city of Goma , where rebel forces halted their offensive last week .

In pictures : Rebel advance Thousands of refugees in the nearby town of Kibati are said to have fled towards Goma when the mortar and small arms fire broke out .
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the fighting had interrupted the distribution of aid in the town .
Meanwhile , the UN said it was investigating reports that rebels led by Gen Nkunda had killed civilians in their homes in the eastern town of Kiwanja on Thursday .
At least 12 bodies were found in the town , which was retaken by rebels loyal to him earlier this week .
Gen Nkunda claimed his fighters , who have also seized control of the town of Nyanzale , about 80 km ( 50 miles ) north - west of Goma , had attacked armed pro-government militia .
A spokesman for the UN in DR Congo , Madnodje Mounoubai , told the BBC that the UN was doing its best to help civilians , but that peacekeepers could not fire at rebels when they were surrounded by civilians .
" You cannot fire when you have civilians on the road running in all directions .
If you start firing in that situation you end up killing a lot of civilians , " he said .
The situation in DR Congo has been described as a humanitarian catastrophe , and an estimated 250,000 people have been made homeless by the conflict .
The UN has 17,000 peacekeepers in DR Congo , making Monuc its largest mission in the world .
But only a few hundred peacekeepers are in the areas affected by the latest violence , and human rights groups have also criticised the UN for failing to prevent the killings .
Gen Nkunda says he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attack by Rwandan Hutu rebels , who fled to Congo after the 1994 genocide .

The Campusist web site offers up that key component of collegiate life : cheap movies .
Well , free movies , in this case , all of them offsite links to obviously illegal copies of popular films .
According to Quantcast , an Internet measurement firm , people do n't end up at the site by accident ; the most popular keyword searches from those who visit Campusist are " watch movies online free , " " free movie downloads , " " free movies , " " free online movies , " etc .
And it 's not even moderately difficult to access them , like it used to be in the primitive P2P days .
Now , camcorded films like Twilight are offered up in Flash by sites that splay advertisements across the screen and pop them up repeatedly along the bottom of the video in question .
Even those who do n't see anything wrong with " noncommercial " sharing between a couple of thousand friends can't see such solutions as anything other than piracy .
But the key question is whether sites like Campusist are engaged in that piracy , or whether the fact that they simply link to other sites grants them immunity .
This latter argument is the one routinely advanced by The Pirate Bay and other torrent trackers .
But , when every link on a site leads to an infringing copy of a film , does the " Hey , I 'm just linking to some stuff ! " argument still carry weight ?
The MPAA does n't think so , and yesterday it filed suits against three websites : Campusist , Movies - on - demand.tv , and Sswarez.com .
The move is part of MPAA 's continuing legal campaign to target distribution sites , and the film business has yet to engage in the sort of widespread suing of individuals that has characterized the music industry 's approach .
Hollywood can at least take cold comfort in the fact that its product is popular — so popular , in fact , that China 's official news agency picked up the lawsuit news immediately , and it's also of interest to Russians .

That pretty much sums up how I feel about the whole thing .
Black folks are often called the cousins of the Jewish people and many , many books have been written about the complex histories intertwining our two diasporas .
So it ’s in the spirit of a family discussion that I just have to say something .
It ’s like watching your favorite uncle drunkenly , angrily stomp another , smaller guy to death .
It ’s a touchy subject where many , including me , fear to tread .
All of the talk about Israel ’s having a right to defend herself and to exist is something I , of course , agree upon under general principle .
Who does n’t these days except wild - eyed extremists ?
However , when one side has lost over 900 people , one - third of whom are children and the other side has lost 13 people ?
I ’m sorry but that just does n’t look much like self - defense , prima facie .
That looks like punitive bullying & retribution .
I ai n’t the only one asking WHASSUP ?
From HuffPo via AlterNet :
But while Israel ’s PR machine cranked its Mighty Wurlitzer to full blast , drowning out all opposing voices with its droning sound , a surprisingly substantial portion of the American public decided to dance to its own tune .
According to a December 31 Rasmussen poll ( so far the only measure of US opinion on the Gaza assault ) , while Americans remained overwhelmingly supportive of Israel , they were split almost evenly on the question of whether Israel should attack Gaza — 44 % in favor of the assault and 41 % against it .
The internals are even more remarkable .
While Republicans supported the assault on Gaza by a large margin , a predictable finding , only 31 % of Democrats did .
Members of the Democratic base thus stood in sharp contrast to most of their elected representatives ( freshman Rep. Donna Edwards is a notable exception ) , who backed the latest Israeli assault in lockstep , and seem to support Israel no matter what it does .
The rift between the progressive base and the party played out on Barack Obama ’s Change.gov site , which was deluged in recent days with demands for a statement condemning Israel ’s assault on Gaza .
Killing kids ?
Shooting at ambulance drivers ?
Bombing entire apartment buildings because a Hamas official might live there ?
Shelling the UN headquarters in Gaza presumably because they ’ve been less than cheerleading this effort and oh , destroying thousands of pounds of food and humanitarian supplies intended for Palestinian refugees in the process ?
Not cool .
Even inside Israel , there ’s questions being asked .
Above , peep a video of young Israelis who are refuseniks — they have decided not to participate in the crushing of Palestine and some have even gone to jail to protest their own government ’s brutality .
A new generation with clear eyes and flipcams is emerging .
Ghetto-izing the Palestinians into a socio-economic system reminiscent of South African apartheid and in which Palestinians stay poor , powerless and as unthreatening as possible is n’t the answer .
A relationship based on hatred , fear & suspicion is not the answer .
I ’m not excusing Hamas – their actions have only exacerbated the situation and have been largely counter - productive , heaping misery on the people they promised to uplift and protect .
Israel has long been the US ’ top recipient of foreign aid and received something like $ 2.4 billion in 2008 .
Since 1979 and the Israeli - Egyptian peace treaty , Israel has annually received up to $ 3 billion in aid .
There was a time when the fledgling country needed that kind of money .
When our support was a vital and important lifeline .
But Israel is prosperous now and all growns up .
Big and bad enough to bomb the UN , apparently .
You know , who ’s actually , like , totally broke right now ?
Yeah , us — the U.S. I can think of some places we could spend at least some of the chedda we ’ve been handing Israel .
Like , how about health care for uninsured kids or increased benefits for their unemployed parents ?
How about increased salaries for our under - paid teachers or money to fix our broke - down roads and bridges ?
I could go on .
I ’m just saying that it sickens me to think that somehow my hard - earned tax pennies ( they ai n’t really dollars per se ) helped to kill a bunch of kids in Gaza far away today .
It ’s time for moral & political leadership ( paging Barack Obama ) to call a spade a spade and right from wrong , no matter our relationship with the perpetrator .
That ’s how family does .
Dear Cecil :
Once again I feel compelled to solicit your enlightenment .
Your answer to my inquiry regarding my childhood slaughter of houseflies was most impressive .
While it did not drive me to racquetball , neither did it repress what appears to be a deeply rooted psychotic desire to decimate the insect population .
I have killed again .
Last week I visited my cousin , who is at least as deviate as myself , and whose domicile is infested with cockroaches .
We conceived the notion of putting one of the verminous creatures into the microwave oven .
When one strolled conspicuously onto the counter top , we seized it , imprisoned it in a bottle , and inserted it into the death chamber .
Two minutes passed without result .
Four minutes .
Five .
Disgruntled , we persevered for ten more minutes before it became apparent that we had a corpse on our hands .
Our question is this : if water boils in three minutes , what took so long for our odious deed to be accomplished ?
Two Malefactors in Suspense , Chicago
Cecil replies :
The study of the effects of microwave ovenry on bugs is still in its infancy , unfortunately , so we ca n’t provide a definitive answer to this inquiry .
However , several possible explanations come to mind .
(1) You did not have the microwave plugged in .
In the end the cockroach may simply have died of boredom .
Many worthwhile experiments have come to grief because of carelessness with the scientific apparatus .
(2) The insect you were attempting to incinerate was not really a cockroach .
Your basic member of the Blattidae ( cockroach ) family goes into a heat stupor at about 105 degrees Fahrenheit and expires a couple degrees above that .
The larvae of certain West African midges , though , will recover at least briefly from five - minute exposures to 392 degrees Fahrenheit .
Possibly , therefore , what you thought was a cockroach was really a West African midge traveling incognito .
(3) Your cousin has a Popeil pocket microwave or some similar inexpensive brand that heats unevenly .
Uneven heating to some extent is inherent in microwave cookery .
Most manufacturers provide various methods to eliminate the problem , but some ovens have cold spots .
Your intended victim may have been the beneficiary of one .
Alternatively , if there was a metal cap on the bottle you trapped the cockroach in — metal in microwaves , incidentally , is definitely contraindicated — the metal may have deflected the lethal radiation , delaying death .
(4) What you took to be evidence that the cockroach was still alive was really its death throes .
Permanent nerve damage generally results early on in tests of this nature .
If you had administered an IQ test to the cockroach at the three - minute mark possibly you would have discovered that it had been reduced to imbecility .
(5) Seriously ( well , as seriously as you can get under the circumstances ) , it ’s generally agreed that microwave energy interacts most strongly with water .
The best candidate for microwaving is something that ’s uniformly moist .
Cockroaches contain very little moisture —
OK , very little of anything — and their external body parts are quite dry , making them less susceptible to microwaves .
They do contain some moisture , of course , but given their small size and the unevenness of microwave radiation already alluded to , they can simply dodge bullets for a time .
Finally , lads , while one appreciates your efforts , I feel compelled to point out that using a 1,000 - watt microwave to snuff bugs is a bit … Vietnamesque , if you take my meaning .
What ’s wrong with a good shot to the exoskeleton with a shoe ?

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) --
Some of Zimbabwe 's children are " wasting away " as political turmoil and economic crisis have caused a severe food shortage , according to a report from Save the Children .
Children sleep in rough conditions on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa .
The number of acute child malnutrition cases has risen by almost two - thirds in the past year , the report from the UK - based agency said in its appeal to world donors for help .
" There is no excuse for failing to provide this food , " program director Lynn Walker said .
" The innocent people of Zimbabwe should not be made to suffer for a political situation that is out of their control . "
Five million Zimbabweans -- out of a population of about 12 million -- are in need of food aid now , the report said .
The group is appealing for 18,000 tons of food for next month .
" We have already been forced to reduce the rations of emergency food we are delivering because there is n't enough to go around , " the report said .
" If , as we fear , the food aid pipeline into Zimbabwe begins to fail in the new year the millions of people who rely on emergency food aid will suffer . "
Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since its independence from Great Britain 28 years ago .
There is an acute shortage of all essentials such as cash , fuel , medical drugs , electricity and food .
President Robert Mugabe blames the crisis on the sanctions imposed on him and his cronies by the West for allegedly disregarding human rights .
But Mugabe 's critics attribute the crisis to his economic policies .
As the economy has faltered for almost a decade now , a cholera epidemic is raging , fueled by the collapse of health , sanitation and water services in Zimbabwe .
The epidemic has claimed more than 1,100 lives and infected more than 20,000 people since its outbreak in August .
Health experts have warned that the water - borne disease could infect more than 60,000 unless its spread is halted .
The political crisis rose to a boil in this year when the opposition party claimed that it won the presidential election , but Mugabe 's government refused to recognize the result .
Instead , the race was thrown to a runoff , which was boycotted by the opposition .
Mugabe signed an agreement with the opposition in September to form a unity government , but a bitter dispute over the division of cabinet seats has prevented its formation .
Inflation is so severe that the government was forced to print $ 10 billion currency notes last week , with each expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread .

Reports reveal devastation wreaked by Israeli military in Gaza
By Patrick O’Connor
20 January 2009
With the ceasefire in Gaza now in effect , for the time being at least , many international journalists are now able to enter the Palestinian territory for the first time since the Israeli military offensive began last month .
Initial reports have highlighted the utter destruction inflicted upon the population by Israel 's armed forces .
At least 5,000 homes have been destroyed and more than 20,000 damaged , with many urban centers reduced to nothing more than rubble .
Gaza 's limited social infrastructure has been largely obliterated , as have numerous factories and agricultural centers .
The picture emerging from Gaza puts paid to the Israeli government 's lies — that its military assault was a defensive response to Hamas rockets , and that those leading " Operation Cast Lead " were taking great care to avoid civilian casualties .
The offensive was in fact a war crime — an act of collective punishment aimed at demoralizing and intimidating the Palestinian population , thereby suppressing all resistance to the ongoing Israeli occupation .
The Zionist state also no doubt intended to send a warning to Iran , Syria , Lebanon and other potential opponents of its expansionist strategy .
Journalists in Gaza struggled to find appropriate metaphors or historical precedents to describe the devastation .
From Gaza City , Reuters ' Douglas Hamilton wrote : " The destruction is total , as if a terrible earthquake had struck .
But this was no natural disaster ...
[ D ] rive up into the suburb that once sat proudly on the ridge , and it's as if one had turned a corner of Stalingrad , a dark scene from some World War Two battle of annihilation . "
Associated Press : " Destruction in some areas left streets that resembled a moonscape . "
The Financial Times spoke with Jaber Wishah , deputy director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights .
" This reminds us of the film The Day After , " he said , referring to a film about a nuclear catastrophe .
" People are in compete shock . "
Buildings and sites associated with any form of Palestinian autonomy were among those targeted .
The parliament and cabinet buildings in Gaza City were destroyed , as was the city 's police headquarters , the Bank of Palestine building , the main university , and several mosques .
Israeli shells and tanks ruined acres of olive and fruit groves .
Major shopping centers and markets were hit .
Many of the small number of factories previously able to operate in Gaza were also targeted .
" Gaza 's only cement packing factory is now a giant scrap heap , its towering silo tilting precariously , " Associated Press reported .
" The owner 's villa , pounded by Israeli tank shells , looks like Swiss cheese . "
Residential areas , including a large number of apartment buildings , were badly damaged and in many cases entirely destroyed by mortars and bombs .
The UN has reported that more than 50,000 Palestinians are homeless and are crowding into 50 emergency shelters .
The exact number of people made homeless by the Israeli assault is likely to increase as the full scale of the damage becomes better known .
According to an initial estimate issued by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics , the structural damage will cost at least $ 1.9 billion .
Reuters reported : " Municipal bulldozers pushed aside crushed cars and fallen chunks of concrete from the streets , but nothing could conceal the scale of destruction wrought by Israel 's military machine .
‘ Some people can't even recognize the place where their house used to be , ' one policeman radioed to his commander from the northern town of Beit Lahiya . "
Several journalists reported on the racist graffiti left by Israeli troops on the walls of bombed - out apartment buildings and mosques .
" Hamas whores " in Hebrew and " Hamas is dead " in English was sprayed onto one mosque in Gaza City 's Zeitoun suburb .
The Guardian reported that a nearby home had slogans including , " Arabs need to die " and " Arabs : 1948 to 2009 . "
Such taunts are evidence of the fascistic sentiments being cultivated within the Israeli Defense Forces .
The humanitarian crisis now confronting the Palestinian people has been made worse by Israel 's targeting of Gaza 's water and electricity networks .
People in Gaza City have reportedly been forced to light fires and cook in pots on the side of rubble - littered roads .
Even before the war , water and power infrastructure had already been damaged by the Israeli siege , with the main power station operating only intermittently and fuel shortages affecting water pumps .
The military assault saw six major water wells damaged or destroyed , disrupting water supplies to an additional 200,000 of Gaza 's 1.4 million people , according to a senior water authority official cited by the Washington Post .
The UN has reported that 400,000 Gazans now have no access to running water .
In Gaza City , 80 percent of the electricity grid was damaged , including power lines .
Palestinian technicians said that restoring water and electricity services would take weeks , but only if Israel permits the entry of necessary spare parts and equipment .
The terrible casualties inflicted on the Palestinian population underscores the barbarism of the Israeli military assault .
At least 1,300 people were killed , including hundreds of children .
The toll is likely to rise , as many families are still discovering decomposing bodies beneath the rubble of what were their homes and businesses .
An estimated 5,300 people were wounded , many seriously .
Medical personnel in Gaza have reported an unusually high proportion of limb amputations .
Dr. Jan Brommundt , a German doctor working for Medecins du Monde in the south Gazan city of Khan Younis , told Al Jazeera that the injuries he had seen were " absolutely gruesome . "
He said surgeons had reported many cases where casualties had lost both legs rather than one , raising suspicions that the Israeli military was using Dense Inert Metal Explosives ( Dime ) , an experimental explosive device that expels charged tungsten dust that acts as micro-shrapnel , burning and destroying everything within a four - meter radius .
" Victims will present within one to five hours with an acute abdomen which looks like appendicitis , but it turns out on operation that dozens of miniature particles can be found in all of their organs , " Dr. Brommundt explained .
" It seems to be some sort of explosive or shell that disperses tiny particles at around 1x1 or 2x1 millimeters that penetrate all organs .
These miniature injuries , you are not able to attack them surgically . "
Another doctor corroborated these reports .
Dr. Erik Fosse , a Norwegian surgeon who worked at the Al - Shifa hospital in northern Gaza during the Israeli attack , told Al Jazeera that there was a significant increase in double amputations .
" We suspect they used Dime weapons because we saw cases of huge amputations or flesh torn off the lower parts of the body , " he said .
" The pressure wave [ from a Dime device ] moves from the ground upwards and that 's why the majority of patients have huge injuries to the lower part of the body and abdomen ...
The problem is that most of the patients I saw were children .
If they [ the Israelis ] are trying to be accurate , it seems obvious these weapons were aimed at children . "
Reports continue to emerge of Israeli war crimes committed during its offensive .
Amnesty International yesterday said the deployment of white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas of Gaza was indiscriminate and illegal .
The Israeli military has claimed it was using phosphorous for illumination purposes , but Amnesty found evidence that the incendiary and corrosive substance had been used as a chemical weapon .
There have also been reports of the Israeli army firing bullets and shells tipped with depleted uranium .
Arab ambassadors yesterday delivered a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency asking Director General Mohamed ElBaradei to " carry out a radiological and physical assessment in order to verify the presence of depleted uranium in the weaponry used by Israel in the Gaza Strip . "
According to Israeli officials , ground forces are expected to be withdrawn from Gaza by the time Barack Obama is inaugurated as US president .
These cynical political calculations point to the fragility of the ceasefire .
There are already voices within the Israeli political and military establishment warning that renewed military action is only a matter of time .
Opposition Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the military " has dealt Hamas a severe blow , but unfortunately the job has not been completed . "
There remains the danger that the firing of rockets from Gaza will provide the pretext for Israel to launch a broader regional offensive , potentially involving an attack on Iran .
Both the Jerusalem Post and Haaretz have published reports today claiming that Tehran plans to smuggle long - range missiles into the Palestinian territories .
Neither article included any supporting evidence for this claim , and instead cited " intelligence reports , " indicating that the stories were Israeli intelligence - military plants .
1 ) It 's man size
Remember the islands from GTA IV ?
Well , scratch Alderney and you 've got the Chinatown Wars map .
No , we do n't mean the approximate size of that area , actually the GTA IV map .
We 've been driving around a fully reproduced Broker , Bohan and Algonquin on a DS .
In 3D .
While we did n't see the subway stations during our hands - on ( we were too busy trying to lose the cops ) , above - ground looks spot -on .
There are stalls and coloured bins on the pavement , straight out of GTA IV , and the roads are instantly recognisable .
Do you remember laughing at a Chinese restaurant in GTA IV called ' Sum Yung Gai ? '
Well , that was n't just comic street furniture – it belongs to Kenny , the uncle of your character Huang ( pictured ) and you 'll be picking up several of your early missions there .
This is n't a compromised GTA – it 's simply GTA .
2 ) The touch screen is used for criminal activities
Every DS owner has used their stylus for too many cutesy minigames .
Not so here .
Instead , you 'll be using it to smash the rear windshield of a car to get out when you 're submerged in water , assembling a sniper rifle from the parts in a case and even to hotwire a car .
Not to mention building your own molotovs at petrol stations or looking through bins for discarded weapons .
It does n't feel like you 're doing it all for the sake of it , either .
Rockstar Leeds has gone to town with the DS ' feature set , using it all in ways that arguably immerse you more in the experience than any other edition in the series .
And we 're promised that at no point in the game will you have to blow on the microphone to put out a candle .
Phew .

With the release of Seaside 2.9 Alpha 2 there comes a new way to conveniently load the Seaside packages you want to use in your development , testing and deployment images : The Seaside Builder .
Remember , previous versions of Seaside used to be a single huge monolithic package .
With Seaside 2.9 one of the goals was to split the code into small and manageable packages .
We ’ve spent a lot of time in finding a good package structure and we are sure people will appreciate not to be forced to always load and use all the code .
This also greatly improves the portability between Smalltalk dialects .
The drawback was that it is not exactly easy to choose and load the numerous packages in the right order , that all depended on internal and external packages in one way or the other .
The Seaside Builder tries to solve this problem .
It lets you either select a predefined configuration of Seaside packages or manually choose the packages you need .
The builder automatically ensures that all prerequisites are selected and loaded in the right order .
For the first time it is possible to conveniently choose between the MIT licensed Comanche or the LGPL licensed Swazoo web server .
At the bottom of the page there are two download options available : " Load Script " creates a change - set that can be dragged onto any image causing it to load the selected Seaside packages .
There is also the possibility to download a " Monticello Configuration " of the selected packages .
In the future more download options might become available .
Btw , the Seaside Builder itself is running on a minimal Pharo Core image with a Seaside 2.9 installation built using a load script produced by itself .
The deployment image has no tests or development tools loaded , just the necessary Canvas and Component API , the Kom Web Server , the JQuery package that is used for the AJAX interaction , and all the required dependencies .
There are no facts , only interpretations .
— Friedrich Nietzsche , The Will to Power
If relativism signifies contempt for fixed categories and [ for ] men who claim to be bearers of an external objective truth , then there is nothing more relativistic than fascist attitudes .
— Benito Mussolini
As a rule , only very learned and clever men deny what is obviously true .
Common men have less brains , but more sense .
— William T. Stace
It was n’t that long ago that a responsible educated person in the West was someone who entertained firm moral and political principles .
When those principles were challenged , he would typically rise to defend them .
The more serious the challenge , the more concerted the defense .
Today , as the Canadian writer William Gairdner reminds us in his little - noticed but excellent new study of relativism , [ 1 ] the equivalent educated person is likely to have a very different attitude towards whatever moral and political ideas — “ principles ” is no longer the right word — he lives by .
When those ideas are challenged , deference to the challenger rather than defense of the principles is the order of the day .
“ While perhaps more broadly learned ” than his less forgiving predecessor , such a person , Gairdner writes ,
is more likely to think of him or herself as proudly distinguished by the absence of “ rigid ” opinions and moral values , to be someone “ tolerant ” and “ open . ”
Such a person will generally profess some variation of relativism , or “ you do your thing and I ’ll do mine , ” as a personal philosophy .
Many in this frame of mind privately consider themselves exemplars of an enlightened modern attitude that civilization has worked hard to attain , and if pushed , they would admit to feeling just a little superior to all those sorry souls of prior generations forced to bend under moral and religious constraints .
The institutionalization of this amalgam of attitudes — blasé tolerance shading into moral indifference underwritten by that giddy sense of self - righteousness and superiority — has precipitated what Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( now Pope Benedict XVI ) called “ the dictatorship of relativism . ”
I understand that , for those enthralled by this dictatorship , the fact that an orthodox Catholic provided a rubric for the servitude is reason enough to dispute its relevance .
But considered simply as a sociological datum , the triumph ( if that is a less opprobrious word than “ dictatorship ” ) of relativism describes , in Anthony Trollope ’s phrase , “ the way we live now ” — “ we ” being the beneficiaries of that “ enlightened modern attitude ” that Gairdner described in the passage just quoted .
It was to explore the lineaments and limitations of modern relativism that The New Criterion collaborated with London ’s Social Affairs Unit in organizing a conference on the subject last autumn .
The papers that follow explore various facets of the vertiginous moral and epistemological inheritance we sum up in the word “ relativism . ”
I hasten to acknowledge that this is well - trodden ground .
One could go back at least to Aristotle ’s dissection of Protagoras ’s “ man - is - the - measure - of - all - things ” philosophy to find a warning flag about the species of intellectual incontinence concentrated in the doctrine of relativism .
In our own day , the English historian Paul Johnson located the modernity of modern times in its embrace of relativism .
In Modern Times , his magisterial procession through the political and moral history of the twentieth century , Johnson even announced the exact birthday of the era he set out to describe .
The Modern World , Johnson wrote in his opening flourish , began on May 29 , 1919 .
That was the day Einstein ’s theory of relativity was experimentally confirmed , thus shattering the complacent confidence of the Newtonian world view .
Of course , the theory of relativity is not the same thing as relativism .
Johnson acknowledges this .
And yet …
As with the second law of thermodynamics ( which popularized the term “ entropy ” ) or Heisenberg ’s “ Uncertainty Principle , ” the theory of relativity was a piece of science that cast a large metaphorical shadow .
Was it misunderstood — even un-understood ?
It did n’t matter .
Johnson was right that the popular appropriation of Einstein ’s theory provided a good illustration of the “ dual impact ” of scientific innovators :
Their theories change our understanding of the physical world , “ but they also change our ideas .
The second effect is often more radical than the first . ”
The embrace of relativism was a harbinger , a symptom of a seismic shift in the way people view the world .
People ?
Well , those educated people , anyway , of which Gairdner spoke .
Of them we have a greater and greater supply .
( I say “ educated ” ; I mean “ schooled ” — a difference that makes all the difference . )
More and more , however , relativism has assumed the role of civil religion in the West .
There are , of course , pockets of resistance .
There are even some indications that the confident spread of relativism may be faltering .
But there can be little doubt that the values and assumptions of relativism , e.g. multiculturalism , have made great inroads , penetrating from elite to demotic culture .
This is a fact that Madison Avenue has recognized and sought to capitalize on .
I ’ve written before about the popular campaign undertaken by HSBC bank .
At many large airports these days , one cannot process down the gangway to one ’s plane without confronting their clever , insinuating series of ads dedicated to encouraging travelers to congratulate themselves on their lack of principle .
In recent months , the campaign opened a new beachhead on trains , buses , and other venues .
It ’s a catchy , if semantically troubling , promotion .
In the original series , each ad consists of two pairs of identical pictures boldly labeled with opposite one - word descriptors .
For example , an image of a serious - looking young businessman in suit and tie bears the label “ Leader ” while next to it is an image of legs in ratty jeans and scuffed boots bearing the legend “ Follower . ”
The same images are then repeated with the words reversed : the leader becomes the follower and vice versa .
Other image - pairs come labelled “ Good / Bad , ” “ Trendy / Traditional , ” “ Pain / Pleasure , ” “ Perfect / Imperfect , ” etc .
And in case you are slow on the uptake , the Aesop behind the ad includes a helpful moral : “ If everyone thought the same , nothing would ever change , ” for example , or “ An open mind is the best way to look at the world , ” or “ Is n’t it better to be open to other people ’s points of view ? ”
The question , of course , is meant to be rhetorical , what Latinists call a nonne question , i.e. , one that expects the answer “ Yes . ”
Indeed , the latest series of ads dispenses with the question mark and has moved from two to three alternatives .
Thus we might see a cordon of power - generating windmills .
Whether we think “ Nature , ” “ Future , ” or “ Eyesore , ” we are meant to agree with the declarative assertion : “ Different values make the world a richer place . ”
( Do they ?
Does n’t it depend on the values being promulgated ? )
What HSBC proudly calls its “ yourpointofview.com ” campaign is doubtless a successful bit of huckstering .
But it is also a wearisome bit of propaganda .
Propaganda for what ?
There ’s an irony here .
The whole rhetorical machinery of the ads communicates the presumption that we are dealing with the spirit of bold openness and a healthy tolerance for diversity .
The incidental beneficiary of that happy thought is HSBC .
But the reality of the message is simply the biggest unexamined cliché of our time : that differences among people are simply so many “ points of view ” and therefore ( note the logic ) that discriminating among those points of view with an eye to favoring one over another is to be guilty of an intellectual incapacity that is at the same time a moral failing ( narrowness , intolerance , elitism , ethnocentrism — the whole menu of politically incorrect vices ) .
It is often said that an anthropologist is someone who respects the distinctive values of every culture but his own .
We in the West are all anthropologists now .
It is curious , though , that proponents of relativism and multiculturalism should use ethnocentrism as a stick with which to beat the West .
After all , both the idea and the critique of ethnocentrism are quintessentially Western .
There has never in history been a society more open to other cultures than our own ; nor has any tradition been more committed to self - criticism than the Western tradition : the figure of Socrates endlessly inviting self - scrutiny and rational explanation is a definitive image of the Western spirit .
Moreover , “ Western ” science is not exclusively Western : it is science plain and simple .
It was , to be sure , invented and developed in the West , but it is as true for the inhabitants of the Nile Valley as it is for the denizens of New York .
That is why , outside the precincts of the humanities departments of Western universities , there is a mad dash to acquire Western science and technology .
The deepest foolishness of multiculturalism shows itself in the puerile attacks it mounts on the cogency of scientific rationality , epitomized poignantly by the Afrocentrist who flips on his word processor to write books decrying the parochial nature of Western science and extolling the virtues of the “ African way . ”
In part , HSBC ’s campaign is a certification of how far the assumptions of cultural relativism have penetrated .
But what makes the ad campaign a significant emblem of the zeitgeist is the way it insinuates a consistent prejudice into its brief against prejudice .
The smartly attired young chap and the slob in jeans are not so much equals as competitors .
The moral burden of the campaign ( as distinct from its aim of benefiting its client ) is not to encourage us to think more carefully about what it means to be a leader or follower , to be good or bad , to be trendy or traditional , but rather to blur the distinction between those contraries altogether .
The aim is to short - circuit , not refine , our powers of discrimination .
And the goal of that disruption is always at the expense of one side of the equation .
( Yet another irony : were the transvaluation implicit in the “ point - of - view ” campaign really to succeed , one of the first casualties would be competitive enterprises like HSBC . )
The ostensible tenet of this catechism is that all cultures are equally valuable and , therefore , that preferring one culture , intellectual heritage , or moral and social order to another is to be guilty of ethnocentrism .
It ’s actually not quite as egalitarian as it looks , however , for you soon realize that the doctrine of cultural relativism is always a weighted relativism : Preferring Western culture or intellectual heritage is culpable in a way that preferring other traditions is not .
It is often said that relativism is the conviction that , when it comes to morals , there are no such things as absolute values and , when it comes to knowledge , there is no such thing as absolute truth .
It is worth meditating on the use of the word “ absolute ” here .
If there were a law against abusing innocent words , we would be justified in contacting OSHA about this unfair exploitation of “ absolute . ”
What a relativist really believes ( or believes he believes ) is that 1 ) there is no such thing as value and 2 ) there is no such thing as truth .
The word “ absolute ” is merely an emollient , a verbal sedative intended to forestall unhappiness .
What after all is the difference between saying “ There is no such thing as absolute truth ” and saying “ There is no such thing as truth ” ?
Take your time .
Relativism is a Cole Porter view of the world : “ The world has gone mad today / And good ’s bad today , / And black ’s white today .
. . .
Anything Goes . ”
The first upsurge of relativism can seem like fun .
It ’s a Cole Porterish , jazz - age tipsiness : a moral and epistemological holiday from the stuffy concerns of … well , of everything that has nailed things down and inhibited one .
The hangover is not long in coming , however .
At bottom , relativism is a religious problem .
“ God is dead , ” Nietzsche proclaimed in the 1880s .
What he observed was an emotional , not a historical fact .
The unspoken allegiance to something transcending the vicissitudes of human desire had been ( among the elites , anyway ) shattered .
“ If there is no God , ” Dostoyevsky said , “ everything is permissible . ”
Meaning what ?
Paul Johnson ’s long book is in part an illustration of and a commentary on those pronouncements of Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky .
“ Among the advanced races , ” Johnson notes , “ the decline and ultimately the collapse of the religious impulse would leave a huge vacuum .
The history of modern times is in great part the history of how that vacuum has been filled . ”
Relativism is the theme of Modern Times ; the moral of which might be indexed thus : “ Utopianism , dangers of .
See Communism , ideology , professional politicians , socialism . ”
It is a sobering thought that Lenin ( for example ) was a committed humanitarian — Johnson speaks of his “ burning humanitarianism , akin to the love of the saints for God . ”
Yes , and here ’s the rub : “ But his humanitarianism was a very abstract passion .
It embraced humanity in general but he seems to have little love for , or even interest in , humanity in particular .
He saw the people with whom he dealt , his comrades , not as individuals but as receptacles for his ideas . ”
The paterfamilias of this brand of sentimental humanitarian was Jean - Jacques Rousseau : “ I think I know man , ” Rousseau said mournfully toward the end of his life , “ but as for men , I know them not . ”
( Nor did he know any of his five illegitimate children , all of whom he abandoned to the orphanage . )
It ’s a short step from Rousseau and his celebration of the emotion ( as distinct from the reality ) of virtue to Robespierre and his candid talk about “ virtue and its emanation , terror . ”
Lenin was a utopian .
Hitler was a utopian .
Ditto Stalin , Pol Pot , and … you can extend the list .
All were adept practitioners of what Johnson calls the twentieth century ’s “ most radical vice : social engineering — the notion that human beings can be shovelled around like bags of cement . ”
And this brings us to yet another irony : that relativism and tyranny , far from being in opposition , are in fact regular collaborators .
This surprises many people , for it seems at first blush that relativism , by loosening the sway of dogma , should be the friend of liberty .
In fact , as Mussolini saw clearly , in its “ contempt for fixed categories ” and “ objective truth , ” “ there is nothing more relativistic ” than fascism .
And it is not only fascism that habitually makes use of relativism as a moral softening - up agent .
Modern liberal democracies champion reason in the form of a commitment to science and technology , but there , too , relativism shows itself as the friend of various strains of dehumanization .
As Gairdner notes ,
wherever the materialist attitude of modern science is combined with relativism , we can predict that moral and political statements will soon emerge about the worthlessness of some forms of human life and how we ought to be eliminating certain classes of unworthy people such as “ unwanted ” children by abortion , or the very old , or Jews , or the infirm by outright genocide or euthanasia .
Why does relativism , which begins with a beckoning promise of liberation from “ oppressive ” moral constraints , so often end in the embrace of immoral constraints that are politically obnoxious ?
Part of the answer lies in the hypertrophy or perversion of relativism ’s conceptual enablers — terms like “ pluralism , ” “ diversity , ” “ tolerance , ” and the like .
They all name classic liberal virtues , but it turns out that their beneficence depends on their place in a constellation of fixed values .
Absent that hierarchy , they rapidly degenerate into epithets in the armory of political suasion .
They retain the aura of positive values , but in reality they are what Gairdner calls “ value - dispersing terms that serve as an official warning to accept all behaviours of others without judgment and , most important , to keep all moral opinions private . ”
In this sense , the rise of relativism encourages an ideology of non-judgmentalism only as a prelude to ever more strident discriminations .
“ Where conditions permit , ” Gairdner writes , the strong step in :
either to impose a new regime or , as in the Western democracies , where overt totalitarianism is still unthinkable , to further permeate ordinary life with the state ’s quietly overbearing , regulating role .
Relativism is the natural public philosophy of such regimes because it repudiates all natural moral or social binding power , replacing these with legal decrees and sanction of the state .
Tocqueville did not , I believe , use the term “ relativism , ” but he vividly delineated its political progeny in his description of democratic despotism .
Taken together , the essays that follow offer an anatomy of relativism and its conceptual cousins .
Do they also offer an answer to the question that forms the second part of our conference title : “ Who will stand up for Western values now ? ”
In the sense that criticizing a problem is part of solving a problem , the answer is Yes .
But in a deeper sense this is a question to which the answer remains unknown .
In his essay , Daniel Johnson , in opposing the relativist Jürgen Habermas to Pope Benedict XVI , offers one possible response .
But — my final irony — it is worth noting that prominent in the inventory of “ Western values ” are various subversive agents .
Lucretius , Hobbes , Hume , Nietzsche — these names are as central to the tradition of the West as any .
But so — and this is the point to bear in mind — are such names as Aeschylus , Aristotle , Augustine , Aquinas ( just to stick with the A’s ) .
Part of the strength of the West has been its intellectual and moral capaciousness .
Relativism pushes that capaciousness to absurdity .
This , indeed , is a common temptation — one might even say a logical concomitant — of liberalism : to degenerate into its opposite by absolutizing its defining virtues .
William Gairdner may be optimistic in thinking that the era of relativism is nearing an end — that “ we are tired of that now . ”
But he is surely correct — it is a point made by several of the essays below — that “ life without some foundation in reason and morality is in the end unbearable ” and that “ the recurring hunger for universals seems to be universal . ”
That is less a consolation than a call to action , but recognizing so was part of the point of our deliberations .

“ The Dictatorship of Relativism : Who Will Stand Up for Western Values Now ? , ” a symposium organized jointly by The New Criterion and London ’s Social Affairs Unit , took place on September 26 , 2008 in Winchester , England .
Participants were James W. Ceaser , Anthony Daniels , Christie Davies , Daniel Johnson , Roger Kimball , Herbert London , Andrew C. McCarthy , Kenneth Minogue , Michael Mosbacher , John O’Sullivan , James Piereson , David Pryce - Jones , Marc Sidwell , and David Yezzi .
Discussion revolved around earlier versions of the essays printed in this special section .

“ This is where we come to forget why we ’re stationed here , ” said Andrey Korivitsky , 28 , a legionnaire from Belarus who resembles Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma City bomber .
The boredom legionnaires complain about in Kourou contrasts with the scene back at Camp Szuts , where the barracks are named for distant battles of decades past , like Vauxaillon and Stuttgart .
Instructors at the camp operate one of the most grueling courses in jungle warfare and survival , opening it to Special Forces from around the world , like the Navy Seals .
But its main purpose is preparing legionnaires for hardships in places where France still uses them for military intervention , like Chad , Djibouti or Ivory Coast .
“ We are the grunts who are supposed to suffer , like your marines , at the hands of sadists , ” said Sgt. Ivan Grezdo , 33 , a Slovakian forced to exit the course after cracking two ribs .
The course offers a window into the culture of the legion , long dominated by Germans who flooded its ranks after World War II .
Now , enlistees from former Soviet bloc countries constitute most of the legion ’s 7,700 men ( no women can join ) , with the number of Latin Americans , particularly Colombians and Brazilians , rising fast .
Officers say Interpol background checks weed out most undesirables .
Americans account for only about 1 percent of legionnaires .
“ Americans in the legion tend to be the Beau Geste types , the idealists , making them easy pickings for the bullies and malcontents , ” said Jaime Salazar , 34 , a man from Indiana who joined the legion , deserted , then recounted it all in a book , “ Legion of the Lost . ”

Indeed , the Americans in the legion seem a bit less hard - boiled than other enlistees .
“ Pick an area on the map where there ’s been a recent crisis , and that area will be a good source of legionnaires , ” said Cpl. Buys Francois , 43 , a South African who joined 11 years ago .

It ’s undebatable , AI brings enormous benefits to us .
While AI does have limitations and risks that are driven by the fear of the unknown , reality proves that artificial intelligence can improve our quality of life .
It makes everything relatively easier for us .
A few decades ago , only the top organizations in the world had access to it .
But nowadays , almost every internet user has it on the thumb .
Not convinced yet ?
Well , here ’s the top artificial intelligence benefits .
Reliable and Accurate Prediction
AI is not just about automation .
Given a data set , it can provide rational predictions and preempt outcomes .
Weather apps predicting the humidity or heat index in your area is a simple example of this .
But on a larger scale , AI can be capitalized to gain insights on business outcomes .
For instance , companies can use AI to analyze employee data and predict the attrition tendency .
This particular technology saved IBM millions of dollars in retention costs .
In other instances , companies use AI to extract sales data from cloud servers then analyze them to come up with targeted marketing plans .
Enhances Work Accuracy
With machine learning capability , automated systems can be more intelligent and carry out tasks with high accuracy .
That is the ultimate goal of AI ─ to minimize , or possibly eradicate human errors .
We have already discussed how AI tools help in medical diagnosis and in the reduction of medical accidents .
But , AI can also be applied in other industries that require high - level accuracy .
AI machines are widely used in manufacturing , eliminating the need for human operators in the assembly line .
Similarly , AI systems are also being deployed for space exploration instead of humans .
We all know how critical these industries are that if you even miss a clause can lead to accidents .
Increases Overall Work Efficiency
AI system ’s predictive capabilities and high accuracy make them efficient to use .
They reduce manpower , produce more output , and cut off costs .
They execute repetitive tasks that might require higher costs when done by humans .
That is not to say that AI could replace manpower , but it is a good alternative so human workers can focus on more critical tasks .
This way , they also become more efficient since they no longer have to do a particular task over and over again .
When efficiency is hit , better return on investment can come along .
Boost Customer Satisfaction
Unlike humans , AI systems take little time to rest .
No matter what the time is , they can work endlessly without falter .
Just take a look at virtual assistants , as long as they have power and are connected to the internet , they can operate 24/ 7 .
Similarly , chatbots are very beneficial , especially to customer service providers .
Instead of having human agents round - the - clock , they now utilize chatbots to answer common queries from customers .
On a grander scale , chatbots analyze human tone so customer care providers can think of the best way to deal with them .

The rapid advancement of technology on all fronts has yielded some fascinating mash - ups to make life easier for small groups of people with specific needs and the US$ 15 KAC Bullet Flight 1.0.0 iPhone app and rifle iPhone mount are a case in point – they are just perfect for the sniper / hunter .
Bullet Flight turns the iPhone into a handy , touch screen , ballistics computer using the iPhone ’s accelerometer to calculate angles , providing highly detailed , very quick solutions .
The KAC mounting attaches an off - the - shelf Otterbox ruggedising case .
You can also download different weapon and ammunition profiles ( it comes with three ) and even subscribe to highly detailed weather and forecast information , not to mention listen to music whilst you await your quarry .
The snipe is a wading bird renowned for being the hardest of all birds to hunt due to being difficult to locate , impossible to approach without flushing , or to hit once in the air due to its erratic flight .
In the days of market hunting , those who brought snipes to market were regarded as the best of the best and earned the term snipers .
The verb snipe originated in the 1770s among soldiers in British India applying similar skills in wartime with a human quarry .
A sniper occasionally takes the one , well - aimed shot that , if done properly , will save lives and turn the course of battle .
One of the many skills of a modern days sniper is mathematics – to measure or estimate the range , cross winds , and calculate the allowances needed for one shot to hit its target after travelling up to 2000 yards .
The longest confirmed sniper kill of the Gulf War was made by a Barrett Model 82A1 sniper rifle at a range of 1,800 meters ) and the all - time record kill is accredited to a Canadian Special Forces sniper in Afghanistan at 2430 meters using a McMillan Bros Tac - 50 .
Of course , there could be even longer confirmed kills that have not become public knowledge as this type of feat rarely makes the newspapers - the Canadian record was only disclosed after word - of - mouth about the prodigeous accomplishment reached a newspaper reporter .
The transit police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black man on New Year 's Day has pleaded not guilty to murder .
Johannes Mehserle entered the plea Thursday in a packed Alameda County courtroom with supporters and family members of both the officer and the victim , 22 - year - old Oscar Grant .
Prosecutors say Mehserle was standing over Grant , who was lying facedown and restrained on a train platform , when the Bay Area Rapid Transit officer fired one shot into the man 's back .
Cell phone videos of the shooting have gone viral on the Internet , sparking outrage by many Oakland residents and African American community leaders .
The shooting at the Fruitvale station in Oakland occurred shortly after 2 a.m. on Jan. 1 when Mehserle and other officers stopped a train at the station in Oakland after receiving reports that two groups of men were fighting on board .
The shooting , which is under investigation by multiple agencies , has prompted protests in the Bay Area , including a violent demonstration last week in Oakland .
The Alameda County District Attorney 's Office has filed murder charges against Mehserle .
A Bay Area man came forward this week alleging that he was beaten up by Mehserle .
He said the officer was arrogant and " thought he could not be touched because he had a badge . "
Kenneth Carrethers said Mehserle abused him after he stepped off a train because " he did not agree with them . "
Carrethers told CNN on Thursday that he got off the BART train with a woman when he made a comment about officers being lazy .
" I was having a conversation with another passenger ( and ) I stated to another passenger you see that 's why they stand around with their hands in their pockets , " he said .
But a police report said that Carrethers was abusive towards the officers and they feared he was going to strike one of them .
Carrethers refuted the report .
" The police officers that night seemed to have an attitude , " he said .
" I was beaten up because I did n't agree with them ... Another officer came up and got in my face and said I think you 're drunk . "
The police report said that the officers only grabbed Carrethers left arm after he became abusive .
Mehserle 's attorney said Carrethers allegations against his client are false .
" The allegations are ridiculous and they did n't occur , " Mehserle 's attorney Christopher Miller said in a statement .
" We question the timing of the allegations of Mr. Carrethars to come forward at this time . "
But Carrethars said he came forward shortly after the incident but no one listened to him .
" I 've been trying to get help for the longest , " he said .
" And I truly believe had someone listened to me at the time I tried to get help I think Oscar Grant might still be alive .
The former BART police officer was due to appear in an Oakland court Thursday afternoon .
After spending the night in an Alameda County jail , Mehserle was scheduled to be arraigned at 2 p.m .
Mehserle was extradited from Nevada on Wednesday and he spent the night in Santa Rita Jail in Dublin .
I came up with the idea for these star ornaments a couple of years ago after seeing some instructions for making a star book .
They are very simple to make .
Last year my daughter and I made a bunch of them and hung them up in our front window from the beginning of Advent until Valentine ’s Day .
Here are the step - by - step instructions :
Supplies needed are simply pieces of cardstock , a glue stick , and ribbon or thread for hanging .
First , cut cardstock into 1 inch wide strips .
These strips will then be cut into pieces that are 4 inches tall and 3 inches tall .
You will need a minimum of 5 pieces of each .
The ornaments pictured above used 6 pieces for the left ornament and 8 for the one on the right .
When I prepared these for a large group , I was able to have a college print shop cut up an entire ream of cardstock for me into these sizes with some fancy cutting machine that they have .
I suspect that other print shops have something similar .
After the paper pieces have been cut , fold all of them in half .
Then , take the longer pieces and apply glue with the glue stick to the last half - inch or so as pictured here :
Apply glue to opposite side , as well .

ro·bot
( rō′bŏt′ , - bət )
n. 1 . A mechanical device that sometimes resembles a human and is capable of performing a variety of often complex human tasks on command or by being programmed in advance .
2 . A machine or device that operates automatically or by remote control .
3 . A person who works mechanically without original thought , especially one who responds automatically to the commands of others .
4 . A form of urban dance involving a succession of separate movements executed with precision in imitation of a robot .
ro·bot′ic adj .
Word History : Robot has been in English since 1923 , when Karel Čapek 's 1921 play R.U.R. was translated into English from Czech and presented in London and New York .
The play 's title , R.U.R. , is an abbreviation of Rossum 's Universal Robots , the name of a corporation in the play that makes robots to serve as slave labor for humanity .
However , Čapek 's robots — the original robots — are quite different from the standard - issue robots of later 20th - century science fiction , such as C3PO and R2D2 of Star Wars , that seem to be assembled from metal , silicon , and other non-biological materials .
Čapek 's robots are assembled out of something like flesh and blood , made according to a secret formula .
Their flesh is mixed like dough in mixing machines and their nerves and veins are spun out on spinners .
Eventually , during the course of the play , the robots grow tired of their subservient position and stage a rebellion that places the very future of humanity in peril .
The robots take over the world , but it becomes clear that they also feel emotions like love and are worthy successors to humanity .
Robot and robotka , the words Čapek uses in Czech for the male and female versions of these sentient biological automatons , are derived from the Czech word robota , " servitude , forced labor . "

From “ 200 Laptops Break a Business Model ” in the pages of the New York Times :
So whoâ€™s up , whoâ€™s down and whoâ€™s out this time around ?
Microsoftâ€™s valuable Windows franchise appears vulnerable after two decades of dominance .
Revenue for the companyâ€™s Windows operating system fell for the first time in history in the last quarter of 2008 .
The popularity of Linux , a free operating system installed on many netbooks instead of Windows , forced Microsoft to lower the prices on its operating system to compete .
Mene , mene , tekel , upharsin !
Clayton Christensen , author of The Innovator ’s Dilemma concluded six years ago that Linux and open source seemed to be executing a classic low - end disruption on Windows and closed - source technology .
But it hardly took the man who formulated the concept of “ disruptive technology ” to notice this ; it seemed obvious to me as well on reading his book , and not in the least controversial to the many business audiences I later exposed to the idea .
What Christensen could have added , but did n’t , is that the crisis moment when an incumbent ’s market collapses is more likely to occur during an economic downturn when all potential buyers are feeling increasing pressure to cut costs .
The NYT article marshals the evidence that , for Microsoft ( and possibly for other tech companies like Intel dependent on high - margin flagship products with low - margin competitors ) , that moment may be arriving now .
In normal or boom conditions , the Vista debacle might have mattered much less to Microsoft .
In the days when the company was sitting on a $ 60 billion dollar cash reserve Bill Gates used to boast that he could run the company for five years with zero revenue .
That would have been enough coding time to write a new OS core from scratch , if need be .
But that hoard is now mostly gone , spent on stock buybacks and acquisitions that have proved uniformly unsuccessful and a net drag on the company ’s core Windows and Office business .
Thus , MSFT is running out of room to maneuver .
If today were still normal or boom conditions , a collapse in Microsoft ’s market share might benefit Apple as much or more than the open - source community .
But downturns hurt high - cost , high - margin products more than commodity equivalents .
Apple is paying the price for its luxury - good positioning now as it reports that revenue from its desktop line fell 31 percent this last year , and its laptop share is being hurt by cheap netbooks .
The one benefit of recessions is that they squeeze inefficiencies out of the market .
As cost pressures mount , paying the license fees to shoehorn Vista or XP onto netbooks is going to look less attractive to the vendors and Linux will probably regain much of the the 100 % share of that segment it had when this class of machines was first introduced .
Microsoft will only be able to forestall this the way it pried loose the netbook market a year ago , by subsidizing the netbook vendors to the point where the net cost of an XP or Vista license is effectively zero .
But that tactic can only be sustained for as long as Microsoft can afford to make no actual profit on the only market segment that is actually showing growth .
Extrapolating from Gates ’s implication of about a $ 12B - per - year burn rate , MSFT ’s cash reserve gives it about 20 months of burn time at this point .
Adding what it can make on per-seat corporate licenses and the Vista - boggle during that time obviously is n’t coming up with a figure that makes the company ’s financial mandarins happy , or MSFT would n’t have announced its first round of layoffs ever – and , of course , it missed their earnings - per - share target for the first time , too .
I know how these people are trained to think and what kind of discount on future outcomes they apply , having been a director of a publicly - held company myself , so I ’m pretty certain from their recent behavior that Microsoft ’s own planners are n’t giving the company more than 30 months to live without one of ( a ) a major product success , ( b ) a return to market conditions that make customers much less price sensitive , or ( c ) a harsh restructuring of MSFT to cut its costs and run rate .
Right now , there is absolutely nobody who thinks the IT or consumer market is going to be back to anything like boom conditions in 30 months – and even if it did , price ceilings would have been reset by the expectation consumers are re-forming around $ 200 netbooks .
There ’s simply not enough room in a $ 200 bill of materials to sustain Microsoft ’s business model .
as I ’ve been pointing out for nearly a decade and the NYT has just noticed .
Therefore , the scenario MSFT has to pin their hopes on combines major success for Windows 7 with a drastic downsizing of Microsoft so it can run on the seriously compressed revenue stream that is all netbook - land will afford .
Viewed from this angle , Microsoft ’s recent behavior makes complete sense .
But there is no certainty that this strategy will land MSFT with a sustainable business model within its burnout time .
And , even if we assume that it can , there is zero margin for error on the way there .
Even one serious shock , such as a Vista - like failure of Windows 7 to gain traction , will sink them .
It ’s also worth bearing in mind that if my model is wrong it ’s likely to be because MSFT ’s cash reserve and sustaining revenue streams both continued to erode after the most recent date for which I have solid information ( November 2008 ) .
Under plausible but less optimistic assumptions ( e.g. assuming their cash hoard has continued to decline since November at the same rate it did over the last two years , they keep missing earnings targets , and cutting operating costs proves difficult ) they may not have 30 months to recover but as little as 18 .
This is how empires fall .
Until the last minute it is difficult to see what ’s coming , because they tend to hollow out from within long before the damage becomes obvious from outside .
Microsoft lost its battle of the Teutoburger Wald when it failed to prevent Linux from going mainstream in enterprise computing around 2003 .
Now , with the layoffs and the first - time fall in Windows revenues , we ’re seeing the retreat from the Antonine Wall to Hadrian’s .
As the final collapse nears , each successive retrenchment will come faster .
If history repeats itself exactly , the splitting of the eagle into a Western ( Windows ) and an Eastern ( Office ) empire may be the next major step , with the Western Empire collapsing shortly afterwards and periodic attempts by Easterners to recapture the OS market coming to nothing .
But here I veer off into fancy …
Woohoo here is the comic !
Have a lovely weekend and I will see you on Monday .( ps you should totally check out the QC Twitter pages if you have n't already )
Some dude who is accused of sexually assaulting a 4 - year - old girl allegedly tried to kill himself by driving his van off a ledge in Colorado .
And it almost worked ...
In what has to be one of the craziest twists of fate ever , the perp 's van caught a ledge -- and a search and rescue team got to the guy before karma did .
Dude went to the hospital , but as soon as he gets out , cops say he 'll be immediately arrested .
I ’ve mentioned in several articles how important I feel it is to reach out to what Michael Shermer calls fence sitters : the people who have no strong opinion on skeptical topics .
These are people who are neither skeptics nor believers .
If we can reach these people before they ’ve been swayed by a “ believer ” , we can educate them about what science has to say about the topic areas of skepticism .
An obvious way to do this is through search engine results .
Build a website on a particular topic , and do your best to get it ranked highly by Google .
Then when “ fence sitters ” reach out for information on that topic , you ’ll be ready for them .
Needless to say this takes a bit of effort .
For some topics it is very difficult to elbow your way into that crucial first page of search engine results , due to huge amounts of competition .
But what if there were a way to post good science - oriented material on an existing website that is almost guaranteed to be in the first page of search engine results ?
Then you could focus on the material itself , and not even have to worry about setting up your own site and optimizing it for searches .
Such a website exists , and it is called Wikipedia .
Many are skeptical of Wikipedia .
This user - edited web encyclopedia has existed since 2001 .
It allows anyone in the world to edit any article , and the changes they make are reflected instantly in the live copy of the web site .
Editing is done collaboratively , there is no strict chain of editing authority .
As you would imagine , this system certainly opens it up to abuse , and there have been several prominent incidents that have called attention to this .
But perhaps surprisingly , most vandalism on Wikipedia does n’t last very long .
The site keeps complete logs of all changes , and allows any editor to automatically monitor a list of pages for recent changes , and to undo vandalism with one click .
Like it or not , Wikipedia is a major source of information for millions who use the web .
It is famous in and of itself , but more importantly its pages often rank very highly in search engine results .
Because of this , it can be easy for a random Internet user to get an introduction to a skepticism - related topic from a Wikipedia article rather than from a skeptical website .
Further , because the content of Wikipedia is freely licensed for re-use , it reappears in other venues such as various third - party web sites and even printed in books .
As a result , we could greatly improve our outreach efforts by monitoring these articles for their correctness .
It would also behoove us to do a better job of documenting the scientific skepticism movement itself in Wikipedia .
This will help members of the public become aware of what we are doing and get involved .
In both cases , the 80/20 rule ( or long tail ) rears its familiar head .
Often the highlights of the movement ( James Randi , CSICOP , etc ) and popular topics ( homeopathy , UFOs , etc ) are well documented , but other key topics or figures in our movement go completely unmentioned on Wikipedia .
For example , while researching another skeptic - related project , I recently discovered that Dr. Robert A. Baker ( a Past Fellow of CSICOP who wrote several books on how paranormal events can be explained with psychology ) had no biography in Wikipedia .
He had been named one of the top skeptics of the 20th century in a 1999 poll , so needless to say this surprised me .
I spent an afternoon in Google digging up information on him from the CSICOP web site and other web sites .
Now he has a biography and is listed in several skeptical categories .
His work on ghosts , UFO abduction cases and other skeptical investigations is now documented in a way that is much easier to find for an average Internet user .
Further , on December 7th , 2008 , some Wikipedia editor pulled out a fact from the biography I wrote and featured it in the “ Did you know … ” box on the main page of Wikipedia !
This might not seem like a big deal , unless you know that Google ranks the Wikipedia main page as Page Rank 8 .
That ’s huge .
The highest ranked skeptic websites have ranks that translate to traffic levels 10 to 1000 times lower than that .
So that little factoid about Robert A. Baker probably got more far more page views any skeptic site on that day .
Where To Start
The practice of editing Wikipedia could fill many blog posts , indeed whole books have been written about it .
So I encourage you to read more before you dive in head first , but I will give you a few tips here .
You can edit Wikipedia anonymously , but I recommend you avoid this and instead create an account .
When you edit using an account , the site can track your changes for you and help you with other features .
Also , your edits will be taken a bit more seriously by other editors .
Most importantly , with an account set up you will be able to use the watchlist feature of Wikipedia to monitor pages for changes .
This is a good way to help prevent pseudoscientific nonsense from creeping into Wikpedia .
Simply find some articles about skeptical topics you have interest or expertise in , and click the “ watch ” tab at the top of the screen .
Then you can choose “ my watchlist ” at the very top at any time , and see the last few edits made to pages you are watching .
When it comes to editing , I recommend you start slowly , at first making only small changes to existing articles .
This will help you get accustomed to the tools provided , and minimize the chances you will make a change someone might dislike .
Look for grammar errors or broken links in existing skepticism - related articles , and find ways to fix them .
Always provide a short summary of each edit in the box provided so people can see your intent .
Editing is quite easy , as the MediaWiki software used by Wikipedia supports a simplified form of markup that does n’t require you to know HTML .
For instance , to create a section header with a bulleted item that links to my web sites , you would use the following :
==Skeptical Websites==
# [ http://whatstheharm.net
What 's The Harm ] is Tim 's skeptical web project .
# [ http://skeptools.com
Skeptical Software Tools ] is Tim 's blog .
When viewed in Wikipedia , the above text would become the following HTML :
< h2 > Skeptical Websites </h2 >
< ol >
< li >< a href = " http://whatstheharm.net " class = " external text " title = " http://whatstheharm.net " rel= " nofollow " > What 's The Harm < /a > is Tim ’s skeptical web project .
</li >
< li >< a href = " http://skeptools.com " class = " external text " title = " http://skeptools.com " rel= " nofollow " > Skeptical Software Tools </a > is
Tim ’s blog .</li >
</ol >
( Actually its worse than that , I ’ve edited that down a little ) .
So as you can see Wikipedia saves from having to know HTML and lets you focus more on the content .
When you are ready to make large edits , I recommend you find an article that has content similar to what you want to do .
( Make sure to find one that does n’t have any cleanup warning boxes at the top , these indicate the article has problems in the view of the editors ) .
Click the edit button on that article to see the actual wiki markup that was used , and perhaps copy and paste it into your article .
What To Remember
Cite your sources : Back in the early days of Wikipedia , the race was on to fill it with useful information , and they were n’t so strict about sourcing .
These days they are more strict and ask everyone to cite sources .
You should always use the < ref > tag and probably one of the {{cite}} templates to create an inline citation that backs up your material .
The software will automatically turn your citation into a properly numbered footnote .
If you need to reference a source in more than one place in the article , give it a name like this :
< ref name = " myFirstSource " >
Some interesting citation info goes here .</ ref >
You can reference that source in other locations in the article like this :
< ref name= " myFirstSource " />
Follow the rules :
There are other rules for editing Wikipedia aside from “ cite your sources ” .
The gist of this is covered in an article titled “ Five Pillars . ”
One thing to always remember is Wikipedia topics must meet a notability requirement .
So do n’t go rushing off to write a biography of your favorite drinking buddy from the last Amazing Meeting ( unless of course it was Ben Goldacre ) .
If your article does not meet the notability requirement , it will be deleted and your time will have been wasted .
Another key rule to remember is that uploaded material must be freely licensable .
Photos really enhance an article , but make sure the photo you upload is your own or you know for sure it is not copyrighted .
Read the talk pages :
Almost every page in Wikipedia has a link marked “ discussion ” at the top .
This is the “ talk page ” for that topic .
This is where you go to discuss controversies regarding that topic , defend changes you made which someone else deleted , and so on .
Be aware of the talk pages and keep an eye on them .
Even your user page has a talk page , which is where you may be contacted .
Unlike many more modern web sites which have threaded conversations , private messages and so on , talk pages work exactly like a normal Wikipedia page .
That is , they are just big blobs of text that anyone can edit .
Learn the templates :
You ’ll find that in addition to the simple markup shown above , many parts of Wikipedia use templates to semantically mark up certain types of content and automatically generate others .
There are hundreds of these templates , but again by peeking at the edit page of existing articles , you can get a good idea of which ones you need to know .
Three notable ones include :
Infobox ( for those quick - reference boxes at the upper right of articles )
Cite ( to cite sources using standardized formats )
Coord ( for locations on earth , including this with display=title for articles about a place can make your article visible on Google Maps ) .
Using the right templates can make the information you add to wikipedia much more accessible to non-standard uses , such as in research projects or derivative web sites , improving its visibility .
Focus on the Long Tail : I ’m probably sounding like a broken record at this point on “ the long tail , ” but I recommend you focus on smaller topics and less known people in skepticism ( at least at first ) .
There are lots of opportunities here to have a huge effect without running afoul of other editors who might second - guess your every move .
Seek out topics that are not properly covered , and remedy that .
But always keep in mind the notability requirement and find plenty of good reliable sources you can cite such as newspapers and books .
( Did you know you can search the contents of books , including copyrighted ones , using Google Books ?
Very handy for finding good citations ) .
The best way to recognize an existing long tail article is to look at the talk page and history .
If the history is short , and the talk page is empty or nearly empty , few are paying much attention to that article .
Dive in !
( As a counter - example , have a look at the talk pages for articles such as Carl Sagan or CSICOP .
Here be dragons . )
Link generously : Linking to other content is the backbone of the web , and perhaps doubly so for Wikipedia articles .
Part of the charm of Wikipedia is how it can draw you in and encourage you to read more about other topics .
We can use this to our advantage in our outreach efforts .
By creating many links both to and from skeptical articles on wikipedia ( within the encyclopedia itself ) we increase the likelihood that our content will be found by “ fence sitters ” and read .
Have the titles of key skeptical articles handy and link them where appropriate .
One such article is Scientific skepticism which defines our movement .
When you first use the word “ skeptic ” or “ skepticism ” in an article , you should link it there .
The WikiMedia syntax for linking an article while controlling the link text looks like this : Tim Farley is a [ [ Scientific skepticism|skeptic ] ] .
That will display as : Tim Farley is a skeptic .
Many articles have a See Also section heading which can be a good place to put relevant links that do n’t obviously fit in elsewhere in the article .
Also , you can use the “ what links here ” item in the toolbox on the left side , to find other articles that link to the article you are working on .
If there are obvious topics that should link to your article that you do n’t see here , fix that .
These are other fantastic ways to encourage people to find our content .
Do n’t forget to look for relevant Wikipedia categories , both skeptical and otherwise , to include on the page .
These go at the bottom of the article and display in a box .
Here are the categories I added to the bottom of my article on Robert A. Baker , in Wiki syntax :
{{Lifetime |1921|2005 |Baker , Robert A.}}
[ [ Category : American atheists ] ]
[ [ Category : American science writers ] ]
[ [ Category : American skeptics ] ]
[ [ Category : People from Kentucky ] ]
[ [ Category : People from Crittenden County , Kentucky ] ]
[ [ Category : Psychologists ] ]
[ [ Category : Psychology educators ] ]
[ [ Category : University of Kentucky alumni ] ]
[ [ Category : University of Kentucky faculty ] ]
[ [ Category : Stanford University alumni ] ]
Not only do these provide other ways for people to find your article , but they can also elicit help in maintaining it .
Because I ( correctly ) tagged Dr. Baker as being a person from Kentucky , the page got the attention of WikiProject Kentucky .
This is a group of people who help edit and update articles about Kentucky and the people in it .
So now I know others will help me keep Dr. Baker ’s biography up to date as Wikipedia advances .
And of course , add hyperlinks to relevant skeptical websites in the External Links section that usually appears at the bottom of a Wikipedia article .
That helps draw people into skepticism from Wikipedia .
( It is worth noting that Wikipedia uses rel= ” nofollow ” on all its external links , as a matter of policy .
So do n’t bother linking just to boost your skeptical site in Google .
That wo n’t work ) .
Where To Focus
So where should you start ?
That of course depends on your specialty within skepticism and your interests or expertise .
But here are a few ways to explore .
Explore existing articles :
There are a number of good articles on skepticism already such as the aforementioned scientific skepticism article and the following :
Each of these articles provide many links that will help you explore the skeptical content on Wikipedia .
As you explore , think about what you see but also what appears to be missing .
The latter represents an opportunity for you to contribute .
Explore via categories : Wikipedia tries to group articles into categories to encourage horizontal exploration .
Some relevant existing categories in Wikipedia where you can find good content are listed below .
Be sure to explore the sub - categories within as well .
Again , when exploring here think about what you see as well as what ’s missing .
The latter could be good topics you could contribute .
Join a WikiProject : WikiProjects are groups of people who cooperate in editing a particular group of articles within Wikipedia .
They usually maintain a “ to do ” list of articles that need attention , and have procedures to carefully review content that fits their topic area .
There are at least two such groups that relate to skepticism .
One is called WikiProject Rational Skepticism and the other is WikiProject Pseudoscience .
Get involved with one or both of them .
I would avoid the Alternative Medicine WikiProject , as it seems to be populated by believers who will probably not be amenable to the edits you would make .
Summary
Wikipedia has tremendous visibility on the web , appearing in the first page of many search results .
Skeptics should strive to ensure that Wikipedia contains the best and most scientific information possible in topic areas we care about .
This helps us reach out to “ fence sitters ” with good information as well as publicize the skeptic movement .
Thanks to Reed Esau of Skepticamp for reminding me of the importance of this in a previous comment .
When a city like Ashland , Oregon passes laws targeting the homeless it sends a clear message that they are not welcome .
It sends another message that beneath the thin veneer ; society considers them worthless .
Instead of lending a helping hand , most people cross to the other side of the street to avoid them .
As if they have something that is contagious .
This lack of empathy I find to be heartbreaking .
McCain ’s home state of Arizona is one of the places were 32 homeless people died on the streets of Phoenix , in the summer of 2005 .
Four homeless men died of heat exposure , in one weekend , in the summer of 2006 .
Sad statistics that I ’m sure did not even get a mention in the local paper .
When cities like Phoenix and Ashland could solve the problem easily by building homeless shelters .
The ACLU of Oregon is challenging Ashland ’s anti-camping ordinance .
The Southern Oregon Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon calls upon the City of Ashland to amend its “ Prohibited Camping ” ordinance from one that punishes poverty and homelessness into one that prods the city to provide housing for the homeless .
The city ’s inhumane anti-camping law is inconsistent with the values of the Ashland , and the ACLU calls for immediate reform .
“ The poor should not be punished simply for being poor , and that ’s what this law does in Ashland , ” said the ACLU of Oregon Executive Director David Fidanque .
“ The city of Ashland and all cities should seek to address the underlying issues of homelessness and poverty , rather than enacting and enforcing laws that target those who are homeless . ”
In a report released today , the Southern Oregon Chapter calls on the Ashland City Council to make the specific revisions to the Prohibited Camping Ordinance , Municipal Code Section 10.46 , and to the related “ Sleeping Prohibited ” ordinance , Section 10.68.230 : Section 10.46.020 ( “ Camping Prohibited ” ) should be amended to provide that , except as set forth in Section 10.46.030 , the prohibitions in this ordinance shall not apply between the hours of 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. , unless and until at least 50 units of permanent supportive housing are created within the City of Ashland , at least 50 percent of which are centrally located .
These units must be created for current or chronically homeless persons .
Section 10.46.050 ( “ Penalties ” ) should be amended to lower the offense in Subsection A to a “ violation , ” to correct the erroneous reference in Subsection B to Section 1.08.010 , and to correct the next to last word in Subsection B from “ rebuttal ” to “ rebuttable .
Section 10.68.230 ( “ Sleeping Prohibited ” ) should be repealed .
The “ Sleeping Prohibited ” is way over the top .
Ashland is by far not the worse for their poor treatment of the homeless ; actually that goes to Florida .
Florida historically is “ one of the worst states for criminalizing homelessness . ”
Stoops points out an Orlando ordinance that limits feeding homeless people in public places .
In April 2007 , undercover cops were sent to Orlando ’s Lake Eola Park , to arrest Eric Montanez for feeding 30 homeless people – five more than the city ’s 25 - person limit .
“ You can feed pigeons , dogs and squirrels , but God forbid you try to feed the homeless , ” Stoops says .
In many cases , ours laws protect animals better than they do people .
It makes me yearn for the stories my grandmother use to tell me about – during the depression – when her family of 11 , use to feed the homeless that would come to their back door for a meal .
They did n’t have any money but they never turned away a single person that came to the door hungry .
It was the worst of times that brought out the best in people .
Wherein everybody flip - flops , Coleman makes a successful argument , but may have blown it with a ' phony ' website crash and an horrendous argument for Internet voting ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/30/2009 , 3:41 pm PT
This afternoon , Day 5 of the U.S. Senate election contest between former Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) and apparent winner of the '08 election Al Franken ( D ) , Coleman offered another reason , just in case you needed one , to oppose his return to the Senate :
In a press conference outside the courtroom held just a short while ago , Norm Coleman announced that if he gets back into the Senate , he 'll work on ways to make it easier for young people to vote online .
While we 're in favor of " young people , " and as many other legal voters who wish to vote , actually getting to cast their votes and have them accurately counted , if you like our currently unreliable electronic vote counting systems , which employ untested , unsecured , hackable garbage , then you 'll love seeing that system opened up to the Internet !
All that said , however , where Coleman 's case began on Monday as little more than a comedy of one error after another , as we explained in some detail earlier this week , over Days 4 ( yesterday ) and 5 ( today ) , his legal team seems to have found a bit of footing , even if they 've had to counter most of their own legal arguments that they 'd made previously to keep ballots from being counted during the post-election hand - counting of ballots .
At the end of that process , Franken was found , by the state canvassing board , to have defeated Coleman by 225 votes , out of 2.9 million cast , even though Coleman was slightly ahead in the vote count during most of that time , and thus , argued adamantly against including as many previously rejected absentee ballots as he could .
But that was then , when he thought he was winning , and this is now , when he seems to be losing ...
The Slow - Motion Comedy Show
Many of these details are distilled from the excellent coverage by TPM's Eric Kleefeld , who has been reporting , since the start of the trial , from the courtroom in MN , where he 's been filing a number of small , as - they - occur items .
As previously , we 'll try to both tie together key points of that reportage , from him and others , as well as contextualize the whole mess a bit for you , from what Kleefeld smartly described yesterday as " The slow - motion comedy show that is the Minnesota Senate trial . "
Coleman 's new - found support for Internet voting came following the testimony of his witness , Peter DeMuth , a college student who goes to school in Fargo , ND , who " drove several hours to St. Paul " on Thursday " just so that he could get his vote counted , " according to Kleefeld 's description of the testimony .
But like several of the six witness called by Coleman earlier this week to testify that their absentee ballot should n't have been rejected --- one of whom admitted that his girlfriend forged his signature on his absentee ballot application --- DeMuth 's ballot was rejected because the signature on it did not match his application .
In DeMuth 's case , rather than printing out the absentee ballot application he received online , and simply signing it before mailing it in , he converted the PDF , as available from the state website , into a graphic JPG file , used his mouse to initialize ( rather than sign ) the application , and then emailed it back and received his absentee ballot by mail in return .
The signature on the ballot he sent back in then failed to match the moused initials on the application , and his ballot was rejected , as per state law .
The case was another one where procedural failures resulted in a legitimately cast vote being rejected , and Coleman is now outraged by it , despite the fact that both Coleman and Republicans across the land have long argued for the rejection of such ballots on equally flimsy grounds , often arguing --- loudly in the media and lawfully in courtrooms --- that such ballots amount to " voter fraud . "
But , as we said , that was then and this now .
As we pointed out yet again earlier this week , ballots like DeMuth's , and some of the others who took the stand on Coleman 's behalf earlier this week , are often too easily rejected by election officials .
Though much of that is directly due to arguments from the GOP --- who generally benefit from as few votes as possible being counted --- that such ballots constitute " voter fraud . "
The onus in such cases , we 've argued , should be on election officials to prove that those ballots are , indeed , fraudulent , rather than relying on judgment calls by election officials that signatures do n't match .
Voters ought to be notified when that happens , and given the right to prove that their votes were legitimately cast or not .
Otherwise , if ballots are rejected on the basis they are fraudulent , then voter fraud charges should be brought where possible .
It 's nice --- if amusing , and extraordinarily hypocritical --- that Republicans , at least in this cherry - picked case , suddenly agree with the premise that votes should n't be so easily tossed on the basis of such technicalities .
Even if they have to counter their own arguments , even during the course of this very election in MN , in order to do it .
Along those same lines yesterday , when Joe Friedberg , an attorney for Coleman , was trying to make the case that their witness --- the one whose girlfriend forged his signature on the absentee application , which then did n't match the real signature on the ballot --- the following extraordinary admission was made during the questioning of MN Deputy SoS Jim Gelbmann :
Friedberg :
In point of fact , even though I did something I was n't supposed to do with the application , my ballot should still count because my signature is genuine .
Deputy Secretary of State Jim Gelbmann :
Not according to the procedures we use to determine whether the signature is genuine .
Friedberg : I do n't care about your procedures .
( Franken lawyer calls an objection , is sustained . )
Friedberg : Okay , I do care ...
Oy .
And Speaking of Cherry Picking
Franken 's team has been making the case that Coleman has been individually selecting , for political reasons , many of the witnesses they 've been calling to the stand .
They 've carefully brought only the voters whose ballots were rejected that they wanted to bring in , because those voters happened to support Coleman , while avoiding bringing others whose absentee ballots were rejected by Coleman himself during the hand - count phase , after the MN Supreme Court 's controversial decision to allow the campaigns to agree which previously rejected ballots should or should n't be counted .
As Kleefeld describes ...
Upon cross-examination by Franken attorney Kevin Hamilton , DeMuth said he was contacted by the Republican Party and told about the problem .
" They asked me if I knew my absentee ballot had been rejected .
I said no , " said DeMuth .
" They asked me if I was a supporter of Norm Coleman , and I said yes , and they proceeded to ask me if I would like to go further . "
Let 's think about this for a moment :
Over the last several days , the Coleman camp has said repeatedly that they are not cherry - picking who they 're helping out , that they do n't know who the people they 're advocating for actually supported , and for all they know they 're helping out Franken - voters .
So much for that argument .
Flip - Flop , Flip - Flop , Flip - Flop
On Wednesday , we quoted Coleman 's attorney , Ben Ginsberg --- he of the successful Bush v. Gore FL 2000 strategy of fighting to not count votes , due to cherry - picked Equal Protection arguments --- as admitting that " both campaigns have taken positions in the past that are not entirely consistent with what they are now . "
He claimed , at the time , " that is frankly irrelevant . "
But Franken 's team argued yesterday that it is n't .
His attorneys have been arguing that the Coleman team has been arguing in favor of inclusion of ballots now , during the contest phase , based on reasoning that they are on record as having previously rejected them during the hand - count phase .
They can't , Franken 's team argued , have it both ways , according to the legal doctrines of estoppel and invited error which , essentially say ( we welcome attorneys who wish to explain it better in comments ) that if they did not make the argument previously , they can't now do so now that they 've discovered such an argument might benefit them .
Franken 's team details some of the Coleman team 's flip - flops on ballots that they 'd previously rejected during the hand - count phase , as summarized by Kleefeld thusly :
• A ballot was rejected [ by Coleman , during the hand - count phase ] because the witness failed to fill in their address .
This past Monday , Coleman attorney Joe Friedberg was arguing that a lighter standard should be used to include ballots such as these .
•
A ballot was affirmed by the Coleman camp as being properly rejected because the voter failed to sign their absentee application , but were given the ballot anyway .
Yesterday , Friedberg was saying this sort of state negligence was n't a specific legal reason to throw out a vote .
•
The voter included their registration card inside the special secrecy envelope for the ballot , rather than outside that envelope .
Friedberg was arguing yesterday that these ballots should be included .
•
The signature on the ballot envelope did n't match the one on the application .
The Coleman team now believes extra leniency should be applied in matching up signatures --- even going so far as to advocate for a man who admits that someone else forged his signature on the application .
Yesterday , however , Coleman 's lawyers seem to have effectively made a similar case against Franken , arguing that his team is now doing the exact same thing , and arguing against the inclusion of certain ballots , rejected due to technical procedural failures by voters , that they had previously argued should not disqualify such ballots from being counted .
Coleman Finally Gains Some Ground
In regards the Equal Protection strategy now being applied by Coleman 's camp to argue that more ballots should be counted now ( in contradiction to Ginsberg 's 2000 argument , which contended that was reasoning for counting none of them ) , Keefeld notes that today they may finally be making some headway in that regard , as an election official has admitted on the stand that there may be some ballots out there which were rejected in some counties due to a procedural problem , while in other counties , such ballots were eventually accepted and counted .
As well , there is one other area where Coleman may be finding some purchase , according to Kleefeld 's late afternoon report , following the close of Day 5 today .
" After a week of one comedic misstep after another , the Coleman legal team seems to have finally gotten its act together and managed to score some points , " he reports .
He 's referring to the other key element , beyond the rejected ballots , in Coleman 's legal case .
That is , the claim that several hundred ballots from Election Night were improperly counted twice during the post-election hand - count , " thanks to a duplication process for damaged ballots and a failure to label them properly . "
We 'll try to offer more details on that issue in the future , though while Coleman may have made some headway in his case on that point , it is , as Kleefeld notes , a potentially risky strategy for him to take , given the number of votes involved , and given that Franken may be able to toss it right back at them .
" Listen , " Coleman is quoted as having said at a presser , stating the obvious , " there 's a lot of irony in this process . "
Calling All Rejected Voters
Finally , for the moment , on the heels of the " cherry - picked voters " allegations from Franken , Coleman has launched a new strategy which may --- as with several of his witnesses earlier this week --- end up backfiring on him , eventually .
He has now posted the name , and in many cases , the precise city , of every voter in MN whose ballot was rejected , online at his Coleman for Senate website .
That new strategy , however , has also opened up several new cans of worms .
The webpage claims that Coleman is fighting to ensure " that no voter is disenfranchised in the process or has their vote improperly rejected . "
It further says , in full , unabashed hypocrisy mode : " Unfortunately , the Franken campaign continues their efforts to block any additional votes from being counted .
In fact , the Franken campaign has now filed a legal motion asking that no additional absentee votes be reviewed , opened or counted .
This from a campaign that used to make ' count every vote ' their mantra–at least until it was no longer politically convenient for them . "
But that strategy may backfire , as Kleefeld explains :
By including every last rejected ballot , regardless of backstory or merit , they are including ballots they themselves earlier objected to counting , under the state Supreme Court 's controversial decision that gave the candidates a veto power over improperly - rejected absentees --- and they 're now saying it 's the Franken campaign who is disenfranchising these people .
...
And remember , the Coleman campaign 's position until the last few weeks was that none of these ballots should ever be counted
But that 's not the only way the strategy may have backfired ...
Crashed , Burned and Hacked
A controversy --- several of them actually --- erupted earlier this week , following the publishing of Coleman 's new database of rejected voters which he claimed , was " inundated by tens of thousands of hits today – temporarily crashing the website . "
But the site did n't crash , according to Aaron Landry at MN Publius .
" The stunt is a completely fabricated lie , " meant only to raise attention to his list of rejected voters , said Landry , who offered evidence that Coleman 's IT specifically set the site in order to make it appear that it had crashed .
Paul Schmelzer at Minnesota Independent has more technical details on the allegedly phony website crash .
Ironically enough --- in consideration of where today 's report began , with Coleman 's assertion that he was eager to get back to the Senate to " work on ways to make it easier for young people to vote online , " the brouhaha over the supposed crash has also revealed how stupid that would likely be .
According to another Minnesota Independent article , investigation into the website crash , has revealed " a database of campaign donors ( complete with names , email addresses , phone numbers and donation amounts ) in a publicly accessible , unprotected directory . "
Moreover , " the database included the usernames of registered site users , along with their unencrypted passwords , a potentially serious security concern for users who , like many of us , have a master password for various online accounts , " according to Schmelzer .
Heckuva job , Normie !
Let 's get those voters casting ballots online as soon as possible !
You think this election contest is a mess ?!
Let 's go to the Internet !
What could possibly go wrong ?!!
Economist Robert Higgs writes that a number of economists who have called themselves “ free market ” endorsed one statist scheme after another that lead the U.S. economy into the tank .
Although he wo n’t mention names , nonetheless , they are legion , including one of Ronald Reagan ’s chief economic advisors who now believes falling home prices have caused the recession .
Higgs writes that while he understands why Wall Street executives might have no problem grabbing loot made available by Congress , the economists who have endorsed some of these schemes are another matter :
But why have free - market economists and other commentators expressed approval of this blatant piracy ?
It now appears … that these free - market experts were not so expert after all .
Indeed , many of them seem to have failed to understand how markets work and how government actions can hobble or kill those workings .
Many have talked as if they actually believe in vulgar Keynesianism or other crackpot ideas – about “ systemic risk ” where none exists or about “ missing markets ” for poor - quality assets that only a fool would try to sell privately when the alternative of a munificent government buyout shimmers on the horizon .
While many economists have declared some real howlers , I should point out that many economists simply do not have the theoretical and analytical tools by which to logically analyze the present situation .
Yes , I know that is a shocking statement , for many of these people have doctorates from the most competitive and highly - ranked graduate programs in the world .
Furthermore , while I have a Ph.D. in economics , it was not earned in a program that garners the academic respect of a Harvard or Stanford doctorate .
Supposedly , that means I cannot criticize anything that the “ high - level ” economists say .
Yet , for all the calculus and the hard - to - comprehend statistical techniques they learn in graduate school and use in their “ A ” journal papers , many economists do not know economics .
They might know academic economics , but they cannot comprehend economic logic , and that makes all of the difference .
Although I realize that this sounds arrogant , nonetheless it is accurate .
The problems are not limited to “ macroeconomics , ” the study of the overall economy ; difficulties also abound in “ microeconomics , ” which analyzes individual markets , consumer behavior and business firms .
For example , according to standard microeconomic theory , unless an industry is dominated by tiny firms with small production capacity and all goods sold in that market are exactly the same , there exists a market failure .
That is right ; according to the economics canon , any product differentiation is “ proof ” that the market has failed , and only can be set right by outside ( read that , government ) action .
In the real world , competition is defined by heterogeneity ; people seek to demonstrate that their products are better than others , that there is a quality difference .
Academic economists , however , hold that such differences demonstrate that markets are less competitive than what is socially optimal .
( Joan Robinson , a student of Alfred Marshall and a developer of “ imperfect competition ” theory , wrote that such differences provided a “ spatial monopoly ” to producers and should be regulated by government . )
Nor do they have a workable theory of capital , and they ignore the role of time and time preference .
On the macro side , things are even worse .
Most economists receive Keynesian training in graduate school , and it dominates academic textbooks .
Money is said to be a state - created quantity variable , and texts declare market economies are prone to collapse unless government intervenes .
Thus , the present foolishness we see from policymakers – that the government literally will spend its way out of this recession – comes right from the academic texts .
Ironically , even though these policies defy economic logic , nonetheless most economists claim that the criticisms of the Austrian School , which dismantle these crackpot theories , are “ discredited . ”
( Henry Hazlitt never even went to college , yet he was a better economist than most Nobel Prize winners . )
Why ?
Because academic economists said so , and according to them , that is the “ market test . ”
That present government policies will lead only to more unemployment and more economic misery is irrelevant .
As long as the mathematical theories claim government can “ fix ” an economy , government always is successful , even when it is n’t .

NASHVILLE , Jan. 21 ( UPI ) --
Human male fertility may be impacted by long - term exposure to marijuana , researchers in the United States and Japan suggest .
The researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and colleagues said the findings show that genetic loss of fatty acid amide hydrolase -- an enzyme -- results in elevated levels of anandamide , an endocannabinoid , in the male reproductive system , leading to compromised fertilizing capacity of sperm .
The endocannabinoid system refers to a group of lipids and their receptors that are involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite , pain - sensation , mood and memory .

Retention of fatty acid amide hydrolase on an egg provides evidence that the sperm 's capacity to penetrate is dampened by elevated anandamide levels .
These findings , published in the Biology of Reproduction , point to previously unsuspected pathways regulating sperm function .
But perhaps more importantly , the results are of great clinical significance because sperm of chronic marijuana users , as well as sperm in fatty acid amide hydrolase - mutant males are exposed to enhanced cannabinoid / endocannbinoid signaling , the researchers said .
The Bush administration had signaled its intention to issue the measures , which are part of a flurry of regulations it is announcing before President - elect Barack Obama takes office .
The new president will be able to undo the regulations , and is virtually certain to , given his previous comments on the issue .
But undoing them will be a time - consuming process .
The measures announced on Thursday , sometimes described collectively as the “ conscience rule , ” were issued just in time to take effect before the start of the new administration .
They will go into effect 30 days after their publication in the Federal Register on Friday .
Recipients of funds from the Department of Health and Human Services are required to certify their compliance with the rule by October 2009 .
“ If , despite the department ’s efforts , compliance is not achieved , H.H.S. officials will consider all legal options , including termination of funding and the return of funds paid out in violation of the non-discrimination provisions , ” Mr. Leavitt said .
Opponents of abortion , including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Catholic Health Association , which represents Catholic hospitals , support the new regulations and say they are needed to protect health - care providers from being forced to perform abortions and sterilizations .
They are opposed by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores , the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association , among others .
Opponents contend that the regulations are a threat to a woman ’s right to choose to have an abortion , and that they are not needed in any event because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already prohibits employment discrimination based on religion .
I have run a few simulations of a space elevator breaking .
This page summarizes some results , and gives you access to animations .
The elevator that is simulated is an equatorial uniform stress elevator with Brad Edwards ' standard parameters .
Length is 91000 km , density is 1300 kg / m^3 , strength is 130 GPa with a factor of safety of 2 , Young 's modulus is 1 TPa .
The elevator is broken up into 200 pieces and simulated by a springs and masses model .
Heavy damping is added by placing dampers in parallel with the springs , this eliminates spurious high frequency noise caused by the discrete pieces of elevator hitting the Earth .
Moreover , it is plausible that there will be a certain amount of longitudinal damping in the real material ( it could even be engineered in ) .
A time step of 0.5 seconds was used .
A simple Euler algorithm is used for solving the differential equation .
The simulation is done in a geocentric reference frame rotating with the Earth .
Only gravity , centrifugal force and coriolis forces are taken into account .
In addition , the Earth is modeled as an impenetrable body with friction on its surface .
The code is in a horrible state of disarray .
It uses glut / openGL for the graphics and the giflib for saving the animation .
Use at your own risk .
I intend to rewrite it nearly from scratch .
Get it here .
The animations do 800 time steps per frame ( 6 minutes and 40 seconds ) , the first frame where the elevator is intact is missing ( sorry ) .
The color of the tether indicates the amount of stress .
It goes from blue to red to yellow to white to snap !
The Earth is in blue , and the red sphere is at the geosynchronous altitude .
Here are some comments I can make about the animations and some further playing I have done .
( Note : Since writing this , I have considered that the simulations I did do not actually prove that the top piece always leave the Earth , I simply know that they are thrown very far away .
More careful simulation and analysis are needed before I can distinguish between a very elongated ellical orbit and one that truly leaves the Earth 's influence .
In any case , I can say with confidence that the upper fragment does get past the moon , at which point the Earth - centric assumptions of this simulation can be considered crude at best . )
The epic collapse of Wall Street titan Lehman Brothers , combined with the virtual demise of Merrill Lynch and fears for the world ’s largest insurance company , sent stocks into a frenzied freefall yesterday as Wall Street grappled with financial chaos not seen since the Great Depression .
The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 504 points by the market close – a loss of nearly 4.5 percent – to 10,917.51 , the sixth - largest drop in history and the worst since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .

A stunning $ 700 billion in investor wealth was erased – a direct hit on retirement plans , government pension funds and other investment portfolios .
The Standard & Poors 500 , a broader stock market indicator , fell 59 points – or 4.71 percent – to 1,192 .
At the top of investors ’ minds were fears insurance powerhouse American International Group could be the next to fall .
AIG shares plummeted by 61 percent as it desperately sought funding to shore up its balance sheet amid worries it would be downgraded by several credit rating agencies .
That anxiety was well - founded : Standard & Poor ’s , Moody ’s and Fitch Ratings all downgraded the company ’s long - and short - term ratings one notch , which still leaves it at investment grade .
But they warned that further downgrades could follow .
“ We have a very , very nervous market , and folks hate uncertainty , ” said Alfred E. Goldman , chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities .
“ They ’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop , and two of them dropped on Sunday . ”

CRUDELE : Wall Street ’s Stormy Week
Among the day ’s fast - moving developments :
* Gov. Paterson loosened the borrowing rules for AIG to stave off crisis as the Federal Reserve leaned on the last major Wall Street investment banks standing – Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley – to lend the insurer up to $ 75 billion .
* Bank of America became the biggest bank in the country by far as it began to digest Merrill Lynch , a $ 50 billion shotgun marriage that stunned Merrill ’s employees but likely saved many of their jobs .
* Washington Mutual Inc. showed signs it could be the next failure , with stocks plunging 73 cents a share , or 26.7 percent , to close at $ 2 .
* Paterson said as many as 30,000 New York jobs could be lost on Wall Street .
* Mayor Bloomberg said the job losses could drastically impact tax revenue .
“ It ’s generally believed that one Wall Street job helps create two or three other jobs .
This multiplier effect will have a serious impact .
. . on many New York families who are indirectly affected by those job losses . ”
* Asian stock markets tumbled .
Japan ’s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng were down 5.3 percent and 5.7 percent respectively by mid-day today .
Yesterday ’s turmoil – the biggest ripple yet from the subprime lending crisis that began a year ago – started overnight Sunday .
Lehman lawyers electronically filed the company ’s bankruptcy papers at 1:45 a.m. , a move that culminated three tense days of negotiations that failed to produce a buyer for the firm and was essentially the final nail in the 158 - year - old company ’s coffin .
Within six hours , the brokerage house ’s Midtown headquarters was abuzz with activity , mostly downtrodden workers cleaning out offices and cubicles .
With that firm ’s fate sealed , the status of other financial giants remained in limbo .
Paterson gave AIG permission to post $ 20 billion in investor assets to use as collateral as it tries to stave off crisis .
It had already approached the federal government about $ 40 billion in short - term financing .
The tumultuous day saw the technology - heavy Nasdaq Composite fall by 81.36 points – 3.6 percent – its biggest skid since Jan .
4 .
The dire day on Wall Street came just a week after the federal government ’s $ 200 billion bailout of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Despite a 3.3 percent second - quarter jump in the country ’s gross domestic product , the housing market remains depressed , , and unemployment , which is at 6.1 percent , remains on the rise .
At Lehman , 25,000 distraught employees fearing for their futures got few assurances from company officials .
“ It ’s a madhouse up there , ” said one battered broker .
“ Everyone is praying for the best but expecting the worst . ”

Alisa Bowman from projecthappilyeverafter.com shares some tips on writing fast .
So you have n’t quite monetized your blog .
That means you ’re still working 8 or so hours in the non-virtual world for that paycheck .
You may also have many other time commitments .
They are called marriage , parenthood , friendships and Twitter .
With all of these variables vying for the same 24 hours , how do you follow Darren ’s advice and blog at least every day ?
You have a few choices .
You could stop sleeping .
You could give up the family and friends .
You could learn how to write really fast .
If you ’re tempted by option # 2 , I ca n’t help you , but I wish you the best of luck with that .
If you want to know more about option # 3 , keep reading .
I first learned how to write fast when I was on deadline as a newspaper reporter .
I , at times , had just ten or so minutes to crank out at least 800 words .
These days I blog 4 to 5 times a week at projecthappilyeverafter.com , twice a week at Capessa.com and two more times a week at savorthesuccess.com .
I also write guest blogs and magazine articles , and I ghost and co-author books .
All told , I ’m typing somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 words a week .
Yet , I spend only 6 to 7 daily hours in my desk chair .
Over the years I ’ve developed this 6 - step system for writing fast .
Step 1 : Know what you want to say before you sit down .
As soon as you finish any blog , start thinking about your next one .
Think it over as you walk the dog , while washing dishes , or even while staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m .
What will it be about ?
What do you have to say ?
Go over lines in your head .
For instance , at 3 a.m. last night , I heard the line , “ Throw up on the screen . ”
You ’ll hear it again , too .
Real soon .
Promise .
Step 2 : Pick the basic format you will use to organize your blog .
Most blogs fall into one of the following organizational templates :
Q & A – Someone poses a question and then you answer it .
Tips :
You start with a couple paragraphs of explanation followed by a list of tips .
This “ how to write fast ” blog follows this format , only the “ tips ” are “ steps . ”
Story :
Once upon a time something happened to me , I learned someone from it , and now we ’re at the end .
List :
This might be a list of great websites , great books , or great people to follow on Twitter .
Quiz or Test :
You pose a series of questions or offer a check off list that allows the reader to figure something out .
There are other formats , too , but the key to writing fast is knowing and perfecting a few .
That way you can create them quickly and easily .
Step 3 : Throw up on the screen .
( Told you . )
Start writing and do n’t stop until there are no words left in your head .
Do n’t stop for typos .
Do n’t stop for grammar .
Do n’t stop because you lose your train of thought .
Insert quick notes as you write , such as CHECK NAME SPELLING , FIND URL , or WHAT IS THE WORD I WANT HERE ?
I use that last one quite frequently .
Step 4 : Read your blog from beginning to end .
Fill in holes .
Tinker .
Replace your all caps notes with real text .
Step 5 : Read out loud once or twice .
This will help you catch typos , pinpoint really awkward writing , and help you tighten things up .
Step 6 : You ’re done .
Post it .
I just followed these steps for this article .
So far I ’ve been writing for 10 minutes .
What ’s your best advice for speeding up the writing process ?

A driver can get a wide - angle view they can trust when their wing mirrors are made using a new technique , a parent application claims ( Image : Wipo )
The US Department of Transportation says that in 1994 alone , lane changes and lane merger crashes were the cause of 244,000 crashes , causing 225 deaths and many serious injuries .
That is largely down to the poor view afforded by wing mirrors , says Andrew Hicks , a mathematician at Drexel University in Philadelphia , in a recent patent application .
Mirrors usually have a curved design , which is supposed to increase the field of view .
But Hicks says that also introduces distortion to a dangerous degree , causing drivers to make wrong judgements about the position of their car relative to other objects .
Due to advances in diamond turning machining processes that were funded by the US defense agency DARPA in the late 1990 ’s , it has become now possible to create high quality optical surfaces of almost any shape .
Hicks ’ intends to combine those with sophisticated mathematical models to design and create the perfect curved wing mirror surface – with an increased field of view but no distortion .

Telecoms billionaire Carlos Slim is the world 's second richest man
The New York Times is set to receive a $ 250 m ( £ 180 m ) investment from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim to help the paper finance its business .
Faced with having to pay back substantial debts , the loan from the telecoms magnate will give the paper some financial breathing space .
In return , Mr Slim 's stake in the paper will be increased , making him the second largest shareholder .
Mr Slim is the world 's second richest man , according to Forbes magazine .
The biggest shareholder in the paper is the Ochs - Sulzberger family , which has controlled it for 100 years .
Struggling papers
The paper 's chief financial officer James Follo said Mr Slim 's interest is purely financial .
The New York Times has a circulation of around a million , making it the third biggest selling newspaper in the US .
American newspapers have been hit by a decline in traditional advertising as the economy has slowed and some people have turned to the internet for their news .
Last month , Tribune Co , which owns the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times , filed for bankruptcy protection as it became unable to pay back $ 13 bn in debt .
Last week , the Minneapolis Star Tribune also filed for bankruptcy protection .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
An Iranian woman , blinded by a jilted stalker who threw acid in her face , has persuaded a court to sentence him to be blinded with acid himself under Islamic law demanding an eye for an eye .
Ameneh Bahrami refused to accept " blood money . "
She insisted instead that her attacker suffer a fate similar to her own " so people like him would realize they do not have the right to throw acid in girls ' faces , " she told the Tehran Provincial Court .
Her attacker , a 27 - year - old man identified in court papers as Majid , admitted throwing acid in her face in November 2004 , blinding and disfiguring her .
He said he loved her and insisted she loved him as well .
He has until early this week to appeal the sentence .
Doctors say there is no chance Bahrami will recover her vision , despite repeated operations , including medical care in Spain partially paid for by Iran 's reformist former president , Mohammed Khatami , who was in power when the attack took place .
Majid said he was still willing to marry Bahrami , but she ruled out the possibility and urged that he remain locked up .
" I am not willing to get blood money from the defendant , who is still thinking about destroying me and wants to take my eyes out , " she told the court .
" How could he pretend to be in love ?
If they let this guy go free , he will definitely kill me . "
Bahrami told the court that Majid 's mother had repeatedly tried to arrange a marriage between the two after Majid met Bahrami at university .
She rejected the offer , not even sure at first who the suitor was .
Her friends told her he was a man who had once harassed her in class , leading to an argument between them .
But he refused to accept her rejection , she said , going to her workplace and threatening her .
Finally , she lied and told him she had married someone else and that " it would be better all around if he would leave [ her ] alone . "
She told the court that she reported the conversation to police , saying he had threatened her with " burning for the rest of my life " -- but they said they could not act until a crime had been committed .
Two days later , on November 2 , 2004 , as she was walking home from work , she became aware of a man following her .
She slowed , then stopped to let him pass .
" When the person came close , I realized that it was Majid , " she said .
" Everything happened in a second .
He was holding a red container in his hand .
He looked into my eyes for a second and threw the contents of the red container into my face . "
Bahrami knew exactly what was happening , she said .
" At that moment , I saw in my mind the face of two sisters who years ago had the same thing happen to them .
I thought , ' Oh , my God -- acid . ' "
Passers - by tried to wash the acid off Bahrami , then took her to Labafinejad Hospital .
" They did everything possible for me , " she said of the doctors and nurses there .
Then , one day , they asked her to sign papers allowing them to operate on her .
" I said , ' Do you want to take my eyes out ? '
The doctor cried and left . "
They did want to remove her eyes surgically , she learned , for fear they would become infected , potentially leading to a fatal infection of her brain .
But she refused to allow it , both because she was not sure she could handle it psychologically , and because she thought her death would be easier for her family to bear .
" If I had died , my family would probably be sad for a year and mourn my death , and then they would get used to it , " she told the court .
" But now every day they look at me and see that I am slowly wasting away . "
The three - judge panel ruled unanimously on November 26 that Majid should be blinded with acid and forced to pay compensation for the injuries to Bahrami's face , hands and body caused by the acid .
That was what she had demanded earlier in the trial .
But she did not ask for his face to be disfigured , as hers was .
" Of course , only blind him and take his eyes , because I cannot behave the way he did and ask for acid to be thrown in his face , " she said .
" Because that would be [ a ] savage , barbaric act .
Only take away his sight so that his eyes will become like mine .
I am not saying this from a selfish motive .
This is what society demands . "
Attacking women and girls by throwing acid in their faces is sufficiently common in countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia that groups have been formed to fight it .
Human rights organizations have condemned the practice in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
It is not clear how often such attacks take place in Iran .
Iran and Saudi Arabia are the only countries that consider eye - gouging to be a legitimate judicial punishment , Human Rights Watch has said .
CNN 's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report .
All About Iran • Mohammed Khatami • Crime • Criminal Sentencing and Punishment
If anyone doubted that a class war is in progress , hidden beneath a variety of euphemisms , like ‘ bail out ’ , ‘ downsizing , ’ ‘ outsourcing ’ and ‘ NAFTA ’ , their doubts can now be given the decent burial that they deserve .
There has been no more blatant act of class antagonism in recent memory than the apparent willingness of Congress and Wall Street ’s appointed grifter , Henry Paulson , to let a major part of the American manufacturing sector die .
The difference between a diffident Congress respectfully requesting a teensy bit more information before handing Henry The - Sky – Is - Falling Paulson a $ 700 billion authorization , in record time and with no strings attached , stands in stark contrast to the hostility and derision directed at Detroit ’s auto executives , who are responsible for actually making something useful and who are requesting a $ 34 billion guaranteed loan to help get them through the harshest economy in memory .
An economy in freefall , by the way , that is the direct and immediate consequence of Wall Street and its Washington , D.C. , enablers .
Until recently , auto manufacturers were selling their big , profitable SUVs , making money for shareholders and being applauded by investors .
Suddenly , Wall Street speculators hijacked the oil industry , transportation and food prices skyrocketed , the economic core of the country , the homeowner , went into Wall Street - induced foreclosure , and before Detroit could turn its massive ship around and concentrate more of its attention on hybrids , SUVs were collecting dust on new car lots .
A lack of foresight ?
Yes .
Just like millions of homeowners who tried to get ahead of the curve .
Just like the Congress that had deregulated so many markets that corrosion had seeped into the financial base forming the substructure of impending economic doom .
The auto executives were told that they could n’t get a government loan without a specific plan detailing how they would use the funding .
With a brand new set of standards that had been notably lacking when Paulson ’s railroad came through , Senator Pelosi made clear : “ No plan , no money . ”
Despite the negligence and incompetence of banks , Wall Street , and the U.S. Congress which have caused an international crisis that will certainly bring U.S. hegemony to an end , Paulson was never asked for a reasoned , intellectually honest plan for his bail out billions , which , as events quickly showed , he could n’t have provided anyway .
Senators , deep in the depths of hypocrisy , castigated the auto executives for flying to Washington on private jets .
They suggested that the auto honchos step down from their jobs so that new management could be put in place .
The auto executives were even asked if they would forego their salaries for the requested loan .
None of these subjects was broached with Wall Street surrogate and ex-Goldman Sachs CEO Paulson .
The sight of U.S. Senators conducting a withering assault on representatives of the manufacturing sector was a sad spectacle made surreal by the participants themselves .
The U.S. Congress and its approval of one free trade agreement after another has made virtually all American industry , with its environmental safeguards and middle class wages , noncompetitive in the global market .
The entire industrial sector is well on its way to having a Southeast Asia or Mexico zip code .
Legislators talk as though the U.S. manufacturing sector is a dispensable nuisance instead of a sign of strength , and when South Carolina ’s republican governor Mark Sanford says the American auto industry is unnecessary ( PBS , 12/3/2008 ) , we have to wonder if this was their intent all along .
Richard Shelby , R - Ala , has been the most derisive of the industry ’s critics .
However , as USAToday noted on December 2 , his state is home to Honda , Toyota and Hyundai plants , and has given $ 650 million in tax incentives to foreign manufacturers .
The South in total has handed them $ 3.2 billion .
Critics say that auto workers are paid too much .
If we ’re talking about the CEOs there is no argument , although they are scarcely in the same league as Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain , who made $ 83 million in 2007 , or Goldman Sachs ’ Lloyd Blankfein at $ 54 million .
The workers themselves make about the same as employees at Toyota and Honda , about $ 26 an hour .
The real difference lies in the legacy costs of the Big Three .
Although nonexistent at the foreign automakers with their new manufacturing operations , Ford , Chrysler and G.M. have decades of history including retired employees , pension and health benefits obligations .
Added together and divided by the current workforce , their hourly employee cost of operation , they say , is $ 70 .
Politicians want Detroit to do away with its high legacy costs by ‘ restructuring ’ or declaring bankruptcy and letting a judge do it for them .
It ’s no exaggeration to say that Detroit ’s auto industry is largely responsible for creating America ’s middle class .
Kicking and screaming , the auto companies in the 1940s and 1950s worked with their unions to provide decent pay and benefits .
Then – voila !
- their employees could not only buy the cars they made but also housing , appliances , and clothing , too .
Because of the health care and pension benefits eventually built into their contracts , auto workers became some of the most economically secure citizens in the world .
All workers wanted what Detroit had made possible .
Before 1960 , the pay and benefits in the industrial sector had become the gold standard for every employee across the country .
The quality of life of the U.S. middle class had become the envy of the world .
About 30 years ago , automakers began to take seriously the inroads being made by foreign manufacturers and , in the interest of remaining competitive , began serious efforts to ‘ restructure ’ , that is , reduce the number of employees , pay and benefits .
Free trade agreements beginning in the 1990s made circumstances nearly untenable for employer and employee .
Detroit went into a downward spiral .
Now , with Washington politicians demanding that auto makers jettison their legacy obligations and cut wages , many in the ‘ elite ’ classes gleefully anticipate the complete annihilation of the remnants of the hard - won , historically unprecedented , social contract between employer and employee .
With an estimated 3 million jobs at stake , this could mean the extinction of the remaining middle class wage earner and pensioner .
The devolution of the middle class coincided with the financialization and securitizaton of the economy , as money handling became more esteemed than making things .
Free trade coincided with the announcement of the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the beginning of every evening news broadcast .
Now , the middle class is vanishing , facilitated by politicians who have enabled the death of unions , rewarded outsourcing , passed free trade agreements , annually increased the numbers of H1 - B visas , deregulated the securities and banking industries , actively laying the groundwork for declining incomes and endlessly repetitive financial scandals .
If Congress decides to cut loose one of the last of the major U.S. manufacturers it could have enormous consequences for national security , not to mention the well being of millions of Americans .
As our elected champions hand trillions of taxpayer dollars , without challenge or conditions , to a grossly negligent financial sector , it will signal a final chapter in a class war lost by those in the middle .

Sean Avery Suspended for Elisha Cuthbert Comment ( VIDEO )
Dallas Stars ' has been suspended for inappropriate comments about ex-girlfriend , who is currently dating Calgary Flames player
" I am really happy to be back in Calgary , I love Canada , " Avery told reporters Tuesday morning .
" I just want to comment on how it 's become like a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall in love with my sloppy seconds .
I do n't know what that 's about .
Enjoy the game tonight . "
The NHL quickly responded with an open - ended suspension pending a hearing .
In a statement , team owner Thomas Hicks said , " I completely support the league 's decision to suspend Sean Avery , " continuing with , " Had the league not suspended him , the Dallas Stars would have .
This organization will not tolerate such behavior , especially from a member of our hockey team .
We hold our team to a higher standard and will continue to do so . "

Supermarkets have been told by ministers to stop selling processed food containing cheaper foreign meat with labels suggesting it is British .
The Environment Secretary , Hilary Benn , said retailers were undermining the Government 's drive to persuade shoppers to buy British and putting at risk the Government 's policies on food security and animal welfare .
A labelling loophole allows grocery chains to mark products as " Produced in the UK " if the last significant change to it took place in Britain , even if the main ingredient comes from abroad .
As such , they can legally label chicken sandwiches as " Produced in the UK " , even if the chicken has come from intensive poultry sheds in Thailand , because they have placed the chicken between bread and , similarly , sell ready meals containing cheap foreign pork .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In a selection of " Produced in the UK " goods on sale yesterday , Tesco was selling chicken sandwiches with imported poultry , Somerfield " Wiltshire cured bacon " from Denmark , and Asda Cornish pasties with beef from Ireland .
In an interview with The Independent , Mr Benn said that Britain was lobbying for new European laws that would outlaw the practice – which he described as " hard to justify " .
At a meeting at Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) last week , he and the Farming minister Jane Kennedy urged stores to stamp out misleading labelling before the new legislation comes into force in several years .
Tesco and Sainsbury failed to turn up to the meeting , which was attended by Asda , Morrisons , Waitrose , Marks & Spencer and the British Retail Consortium , which represents all big stores .
Mr Benn suggested to the Food and Drink Federation this week that manufacturers should state the percentage of British ingredients in ready meals , pies and other products .
He told The Independent that labelling of fresh meat was generally good but he suggested some products were giving a false impression to consumers .
He said : " If you buy something that has on the package ' Wiltshire cured bacon ' , I think most people would assume the bacon came from Wiltshire , but under the current European rules that is not necessarily the case .
You may turn it over and discover that actually it came from Denmark .
Or if you buy , for example , Cumberland sausage you might assume that that is where the pork came from , but then you discover it 's not from there – it's from somewhere else .
" So , we are pressing strongly in Europe ... because consumers are not getting clear information . "
" We know a great deal about the origin of our car or the house we buy , " he added .
" I think we should have better information about where our food comes from . "
Farmers ' representatives welcomed the minister 's " excellent " contribution , which it hoped would raise pressure on the stores to increase their backing for Britain 's 152,000 farmers .
Helen Ferrier , chief scientific adviser for the National Farmers ' Union , said : " If people do want to buy British , we want them to be able to go into a shop and easily find those products – and at the moment they can't .
The extra element of advantage our members might have over Dutch or Brazilian producers is not there . "
Supermarkets defended their labelling , saying that they could not always source British meat or were supplying " value " products that consumers would not expect to have come from within the UK .
Tesco said : " ' Produced in the UK ' ... will be in small writing on the back of pack and is intended only to indicate where the food has been produced .
It is not used in a way that suggests any of the ingredients are British and is not used to market the food as a ' British ' product . "
Somerfield said of its Wiltshire cured bacon : " The suggestion that customers automatically think the pigs are reared in Wiltshire is questionable .
But we will revisit how we label country of origin in that product . "
Confusion about country of origin labelling was raised by the TV chef Jamie Oliver last night in his show , Jamie Saves Our Bacon , in which he criticised grocery stores for their labelling of pork .
Setting out the Government 's stance , Mr Benn said that he wanted to ensure the UK had a thriving farming sector at a time when the rapidly rising global population might reduce the willingness of other countries to export food to the United Kingdom .
He has been working on improving labelling for a month , having warned that government policy could only be allowed to take place if shoppers were informed of the origin of their food .
" I think the public and I have the opportunity to raise that and change it because it is clearly wrong that something should be labelled in a way that makes people believe that the meat product came from somewhere it did n't come from .
" It seems to me that is wrong .
It needs to change , " Mr Benn said .
Ever splurge on an expensive purchase , only to have your job pulled right out from under you shortly afterward ?
Hyundai understands , and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its self - proclaimed " America 's Best Warranty , " the company has unveiled the Hyundai Assurance Program , which allows buyers to return their new Hyundai within 12 months of the purchase if they experience an involuntary loss of income .
" We understand consumers ' hesitance to commit to large purchases in today 's economic environment , " said John Krafcik , acting president and CEO of Hyundai Motor America .
" Ten years ago , Hyundai 's industry - leading warranty provided peace of mind to consumers about Hyundai 's quality and reliability .
Today , we 're extending that peace of mind to cover consumers ' employment status and personal finances . "
While most people would n't buy a new car if they thought their job was in danger , some are caught off - guard and stuck with car payments they can't afford .
In what Hyundai claims is a first for the U.S. auto market , the company will allow people who lose their source of income to return their car and be absolved of any financial responsibility and negative impact on their credit .
There are , of course , a few stipulations .
Qualifying circumstances include :
Involuntary unemployment
Physical disability
Loss of driver 's license due to medical impairment
International employment transfer
Self - employed personal bankruptcy
Accidental death
Buyers must also have made at least two payments on their loan or lease , be current on their payments and return the vehicle within 12 months of the purchase date .
Further , Hyundai will forgive the remainder owed on the vehicle up to $ 7500 less than the purchase price .
If the vehicle has depreciated beyond that dollar amount , the buyer will have to pay the difference .
The car must be returned to the dealer it was purchased from , and the dealer is responsible for appraising the vehicle 's value and depreciation -- both of which are factored into the valuation formula .
Once the deal is complete , the dealer can then resell the vehicle .
The Hyundai Assurance Program is complimentary , applies to all Hyundai vehicles , is available to anyone and supplements Hyundai 's 10 year / 100,000 - mile powertrain warranty and all other incentives .
There are no restrictions based on age , health , employment history or the amount of money financed .
The vehicle can be financed through Hyundai or other participating third - party lenders .
You 'll just have to find a participating dealer and lender .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers trying to find ways to transform ordinary skin cells into powerful stem cells said on Sunday they found a shortcut by “ sprinkling ” a chemical onto the cells .
Ampoules containing a medium for stem cell storage are displayed at the UK Stem Cell Bank in north London , May 19 , 2004 .
Researchers trying to find ways to transform ordinary skin cells into powerful stem cells said on Sunday they found a shortcut by " sprinkling " a chemical onto the cells .

Adding the chemical allowed the team at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in Massachusetts to use just two genes to transform ordinary human skin cells into more powerful induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells .
“ This study demonstrates there ’s a possibility that instead of using genes and viruses to reprogram cells , one can use chemicals , ” said Dr. Doug Melton , who directed the study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology .
Melton said Danwei Huangfu , a postdoctoral researcher in his lab , developed the new method .
“ The exciting thing about Danwei ’s work is you can see for the first time that you could sprinkle chemicals on cells and make stem cells , ” Melton , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator , said in a statement .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells , giving rise to all the tissues , organs and blood .
Embryonic stem cells are considered the most powerful kinds of stem cells , as they have the potential to give rise to any type of tissue .
Doctors hope to someday use them to transform medicine .
Melton , for instance , wants to find a way to regenerate the pancreatic cells destroyed in type 1 diabetes and perhaps cure that disease .
INSERTING GENES
But pluripotent stem cells such as the embryonic cells are difficult to make , requiring the use of an embryo or cloning technology .
Many people also object to their use , and several countries , including the United States , limit funding for such experiments .
In the past year , several teams of scientists have reported finding a handful of genes that can transform ordinary skin cells into iPS cells , which look and act like embryonic stem cells .
To get these genes into the cells , they have had to use retroviruses , which integrate their own genetic material into the cells they infect .
This can be dangerous and can cause tumors and perhaps other effects .
Last month U.S. researchers did the same thing using a harmless virus called an adenovirus , but the method was not efficient .
And last week , Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University in Japan , who discovered iPS cells in mice , used a loop of genetic material called a plasmid to reformat the cells .
Huangfu tried treating the cells first with valproic acid .
After she did this , it only took two of the four usual genes to reprogram the cells into iPS cells , she reported .
This is good because the other two genes usually needed can promote cancer .
The Melton team used retroviruses to carry the two genes in but suggest they might not be necessary .
“ These results support the possibility of reprogramming through purely chemical means , which would make therapeutic use of reprogrammed cells safer and more practical , ” they wrote in their report .
Huangfu said the valproic acid unraveled the chromatin -- the physical structure of the chromosomes -- making it possible to get in and alter the DNA more easily .
“ We may need two types of chemicals , one to loosen the chromatin structure , and one to reprogram .
We are looking for that reprogramming chemical , and it should be possible to find it eventually , ” she said .
“ We feel like we have been living in a bubble , ” said Justin Theel , part owner of a dealership that sells Toyotas , Dodges and Scions in Bismarck .
“ We see the national news every day .
We know things are tough .
But around here , our people have gone to their jobs every day knowing that they ’re going to get a paycheck and that they ’ll go back the next day . ”
North Dakota ’s cheery circumstance  which economic analysts are quick to warn is showing clear signs that it , too , may be in jeopardy  can be explained by an odd collection of factors : a recent surge in oil production that catapulted the state to fifth - largest producer in the nation ; a mostly strong year for farmers ( agriculture is the state ’s biggest business ) ; and a conservative , steady , never - fancy culture that has nurtured fewer sudden booms of wealth like those seen elsewhere ( “ Our banks do n’t do those goofy loans , ” Mr. Theel said ) and also fewer tumultuous slumps .
As it happens , one of the state ’s biggest worries right now is precisely the reverse of most other states : North Dakota has about 13,000 unfilled jobs and is struggling to find people to take them .
“ We could use more people with skills for some of these jobs , ” Marty Aas , who leads the Fargo branch of the state ’s Job Service North Dakota , said as his offices  where the unemployed might come for help  sat quiet and nearly empty .
State employees outnumbered the six clients on a recent afternoon .
( Mr. Aas insisted that such a slow afternoon was rare . )
State officials and private companies have begun looking elsewhere to recruit workers , including traveling in October to Michigan , where tens of thousands of workers have been laid off , and , this month , holding an “ online job fair , ” anything to lure people to a place that is , at least for now , removed from the deep financial dismay  if also just plain removed .

Sony's PlayStation 3 racer MotorStorm : Pacific
Rift has sold over one million units worldwide , according to the company 's Worldwide Studios boss Michael Denny .
The sequel to the popular PlayStation 3 launch title was released at the beginning of November , entering the charts at number 29 in the UK and then falling the following week to 35 .
But despite the crowded release schedule during one of the busiest months at retail which kept it out of the top ten , the title has broken the one million milestone , and Evolution Studios is already at work on new downloadable content for the game .
" We 're pleased with the high Metacritic rating of 82 per cent and it's sold over a million units worldwide , " said Denny , in an interview published today .
The original MotorStorm became a flagship title for the console in its early months , and has since become part of Sony 's budget Platinum range for PS3 .

NEW YORK , Jan 21 ( Reuters ) - Three executives at News Corp's NWSA .
O Dow Jones &
Co headquarters received envelopes containing white powder on Wednesday and 10 more were discovered in the mailroom , prompting evacuations of two floors of the building .
The building contains Dow Jones as well as its Wall Street Journal daily business newspaper .
The New York Police Department and New York Fire Department ’s Hazmat teams are investigating .
Authorities do not yet know if the powder is dangerous .
The letters were sent to Wall Street Journal Managing Editor Robert Thomson , Dow Jones Chief Executive Les Hinton and Journal Editorial Page Editor Paul Gigot , according to a source familiar with the matter .
Five female employees were temporarily quarantined and later released , according to an employee memo .
The employees are “ apparently in good spirits and good health , ” said the memo , written by Dow Jones human resources executive Gregory Giangrande .
U.S. authorities have been on alert for mail with white powder in it since 2001 when envelopes laced with anthrax were sent to media outlets and U.S. lawmakers , killing five people .
The envelopes were found on the 11th floor , where News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch and Thomson have offices , Wall Street Journal spokesman Robert Christie said .
Thomson was not in the building at the time .
Murdoch ’s whereabouts are unknown .
The 11th floor was evacuated , as was the ninth floor where the mailroom is located .
The building is on Liberty Street in lower Manhattan , close to the Ground Zero site where the World Trade Center stood before it was attacked and destroyed on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
A News Corp spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment .
News Corp ’s headquarters is in Midtown Manhattan .
The envelopes bore a Knoxville , Tennessee , return address , Brown said .
It is unknown what the postmark says on the envelopes or whether they contained notes .
The incident follows others late last year in which powder was sent to media outlets and financial institutions .
In October , letters , many containing white powder , were sent to Chase bank offices and two other financial institutions in several states .
They also were sent to The New York Times NYT.N headquarters in New York and to Thomson Reuters Corp 's TRI .
TOTRIL.L Reuters newsroom in New York .
The letters sent to the financial institutions warned “ it ’s payback time , ” according to a text released by the FBI in October .
“ We have had many of these in the last year and they typically are talcum powder or cornstarch , ” New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said .

On Thursday , January 29th , I sent President Obama this message :
“ Mr. President : The Bush Administration lied to the people in pursuit of war .
As a result , at least one million Iraqis and thousands of U.S. soldiers are dead .
Thousands more are maimed .
The stature of the U.S. is severely damaged .
The U.S. Constitution is in shreds after signing statements , wiretaps , and torture .
Your obligation is to investigate and bring to justice those who violated U.S. and international law , such as the torture treaty .
Failure to do so makes you complicit in their crimes . ”
On Wednesday , January 28th , I sat in front of the television and I could n’t believe what I was hearing .
Exactly what I ’ve been saying , myself .
But it was coming from an unexpected source : the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture , Manfred Nowak .
I wrote down every word .
He said that the United Nations has proof that former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld knowingly approved of torture as a policy for the United States .
He said that President Barack Obama has a responsibility to investigate and prosecute those who condoned , conducted , or approved of torture .
Further , Jonathan Turley , in an MSNBC interview stated that if Obama fails to investigate or prosecute that he would be an “ accessory . ”
This is significant .
It means that all of us , sadly , were right to pursue impeachment of the key figures in the Bush Administration .
Impeachment was the Constitutional imperative ; but the Constitution did n’t mean anything to either the Republican or Democratic national leadership .
And to think , on this day filled with impeachment news , Nancy Pelosi took impeachment “ off the table ” for this cast of villainous characters .
I never will forget watching Rocky Anderson , former Mayor of Salt Lake City , say on national television that Nancy Pelosi should be impeached for impeding impeachment .
But Nancy Pelosi is n’t the only one who obstructed justice .
In fact , how could Dick Durbin and Harry Reid , so voluble in standing up to Roland Burris because he was Governor Blagojevich ’s pick for Obama ’s vacated Senate seat , sit as quiet as church mice in the face of repeated calls for impeachment because of the reckless criminality of the Bush Administration ?
And now , we have the United Nations tell us the equivalent of “ Houston , we have a problem . ”
Some of us knew all along , from the very beginning , that the Bush Administration was the quintessence of election theft , graft , corruption , and war criminality .
Some of us recognized early on that our struggle was “ against principalities , against powers , … against spiritual wickedness in high places . ”
It is impossible to “ go along and get along ” with illegal and immoral acts .
But that is exactly what the national leadership of this country asked us all to do , and that is exactly what they did .
Dr. King was confronted with the expediency of staying on the civil rights track , remaining with his friends in the civil rights movement , or doing what his conscience impelled him to do .
That ’s when he made his famous statement , that popular chroniclers of Dr. King seem to have forgotten :
“ When I first decided to take a firm stand against the war in Vietnam , I was subjected to the most bitter criticism , by the press , by individuals , and even by some fellow civil rights leaders .
There were those who said that I should stay in my place , that these two issues did not mix and I should stick with civil rights .
Well I had only one answer for that and it was simply the fact that I have struggled too long and too hard now to get rid of segregation in public accommodations to end up at this point in my life segregating my moral concerns . ”
Dr. King had to leave behind some of his best friends in the movement when he decided to speak out against the Vietnam War .
Dr. King could have bowed to the pressure and stayed in his “ civil rights ” lane .
But he knew that the war was wrong and he had to use every fiber in his being to stop it .
Even his life , itself .
One of the first under - reported acts of President Obama was to sign an order continuing the drone airstrikes , resulting in at least 22 killed so far .
For the dead children of Afghanistan or Pakistan or Gaza , it does n’t matter to their parents if the bomb was dropped by Bush or Obama or the client state they support .
And President Obama has made it clear that the bombs will continue to drop ; it is up to us –the people of the United States –to stop them .
That ’s why it was on my birthday , in front of the Pentagon in 2007 , that I declared my independence from every bomb dropped , every child killed , every veteran maimed in the name of U.S. wars .
I said it , and I meant it , and I knew I was going to have to do something I ’d never done before if I was ever going to have something I ’d never had before .
So I left the Democratic Party .
I do n’t regret my decision one minute .
I draw my strength from Dr. King , who in his own way , did the same thing when he refused to segregate his moral concerns .
My neighborhood in Los Angeles , Watts and South Central , is already a police state .
Tonight , 25 to 30 young black men , standing handcuffed , outside the barber shop .
Every night , routine dehumanization is carried out in black and brown neighborhoods by LAPD .
I see it .
I never miss it .
It ’s all around me .
Oscar Grant murdered in cold blood by law enforcement .
Robert Tolan , murdered in cold blood by law enforcement , for driving his father ’s car , mistaken for stolen .
Filiberto Ojeda Rios assassinated by the U.S. government ; I met his wife and heard the entire story of what happened as he was shot by the FBI and then bled to death .
Innocent black and brown and poor white men on death row .
How many Troy Davises and Mumia Abu Jamals will we allow to exist in our country ?
Native Americans trying to survive despite genocide and ethnic cleansing , struggle against drug and alcohol abuse and poverty , and try to keep their culture alive .
And yet the likes of Harry Reid , Dick Durbin , Nancy Pelosi , and now Barack Obama say nothing about the pain I see on the mean streets and reservations across our country , and the miscarriages of justice that are its regular feature , but they allow Bush and company to get away with the highest of crimes , involving millions of deaths .
In each of these writings , I ask you , too , to write to the White House and let them know that you exist .
We did n’t recruit President Obama to run , so I am clear on the limitations of a White House letter writing campaign .
But trust me , our collective efforts will congeal into the movement for dignity , real peace , and true justice that we so desperately need for ourselves and the rest of the world .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Healthy people are increasingly turning to brain - enhancing drugs like Ritalin to boost their performance in school or at work , researchers said on Monday .
File photo illustration of pills of all kinds , shapes and colours , March 2003 .

And while some expressed alarm over the trend , others embraced the idea , provided the drugs are proven safe .
“ In the United States , stimulant medications are widely abused , ” Dr. Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse , said in a telephone briefing .
Volkow said recent surveys on college campuses suggest drugs like Novartis ’ Ritalin , or methylphenidate , and Cephalon ’s Provigil , or modafinil , for narcolepsy are being used by students , professors and others as a way to get a competitive edge .
“ They are abused for a variety of reasons including the fact that people want to get high , but there is the realization that they are being increasingly utilized to improve cognitive performance , ” she said .
Volkow said annual reports from a narcotics control board at the United Nations noted a 300 percent increase in the production and supply of stimulants in the United States between 1995 and 2006 .
“ This not something that is going away , ” Volkow said , adding that researchers must study the long - term effects these drugs might have in healthy people .
“ It behooves us to try to answer the question , ” she said .
Her concern follows a commentary in the journal Nature on Sunday that argues for use of the drugs in healthy adults as a legitimate way of improving brain power , much like education , the Internet or other helpful tools .
“ We should welcome new methods of improving our brain function , ” Henry Greely of Stanford Law School in California , Barbara Sahakian , a psychiatry professor from the University of Cambridge in Britain and others wrote .
They cited a recent survey that found nearly 7 percent of students in U.S. universities have used prescription stimulants , and on some campuses , as many as a quarter of students have used the drugs for non-therapeutic purposes .
The researchers called for doctors , educators , regulators and others to evaluate the risks and develop policies governing the use of cognitive - enhancing drugs .
Volkow said she and other experts would discuss the issue this week at meeting of American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Nashville , Tennessee .
It was a little over three years ago , on December 20 , 2005 , that Judge John E. Jones III issued his ruling in Kitzmiller v. Dover that intelligent design was not science , but merely repackaged creationism — and that it had no business in biology class .
The hoopla was immediate and enduring .
Jones ’ decision launched headlines across the globe , not to mention celebrations by the trial ’s plaintiffs , their legal team and science experts ( who send “ Merry Kitzmas ” greetings to each other on the anniversary ) .
For many , the Dover case became a cautionary tale of what can happen when a public school board believes its attempts to insert religion into the classroom can stand up to national attention and legal scrutiny .
But it would be a mistake to think that public school educators of fundamentalist faiths have made peace with science .
Attacks on evolutionary education continue to take place out of the national spotlight , in small towns where people are reluctant to challenge the behavior of those clinging to power , and where teachers use their classrooms to proselytize to students away from the disapproving eyes of church - and - state watchdogs .
They continue to preach intelligent design , the concept that life ’s complexity demands a divine hand , and out - and - out Young Earth Creationism .
X Marks the Spot
Nowhere right now is this more apparent than in the small town of Gambier , Ohio , a place that bears a striking resemblance to the fictional town of Frank Capra ’s Bedford Falls .
Here , in late September , just off a wide - spaced street that leads to the green campus of the liberal arts school of Kenyon College , a small - framed woman in dark sunglasses takes a seat at the local restaurant .
She is trying to pass unnoticed .
Nervously , she nods to the owner of the establishment .
Because she does n’t know who is on her side and who ’s not , Jenifer Dennis keeps her head down .
Only weeks later , Dennis would be forced to out herself publicly .
But for now , she is trying to remain anonymous in order to protect her son Zachary from the inevitable recriminations from some who reside in the Mount Vernon School District in conservative south - central Ohio .
Last December she and her husband Steve accused a popular 8th - grade science teacher , John Freshwater , of using an electrostatic device known as a Tesla coil to brand a cross into Zachary ’s arm [ see image above ] .
They say the burn , which in photos show an 8 - by - 4 - inch mark on his forearm , raised blisters , kept their son awake that night , and lasted for several weeks .
At first glance , they saw the mark as a religious emblem .
But their first concern was less about religion and more about what they considered to be a case of a teacher injuring their son .
Their accusations and their resulting lawsuit against the district have brought them criticism .
A sign posted in a yard near their house read , “ The student goes .
We Support Mr. Freshwater .
The Bible stays ! ”
For all the unusual elements to this story , this part is the strangest .
At first , Jenifer and Steve were timid about pursuing legal action against the school district , fearing that they would be perceived as anti-Christian .
They ’re not .
“ We are religious people , ” they said in a statement after they filed suit in June .
“ But we were offended when Mr. Freshwater burned a cross onto the arm of our child .
This was done in science class in December 2007 , where an electric shock machine was used to burn our child . ”
Changing Stories : An X or a Cross ?
The day after the incident , Jenifer and Steve met with the district Superintendent Stephen Short and showed him a photo of her son ’s burn .
Jenifer recalls that she was told that Freshwater ’s use of the device was unacceptable and the district would investigate .
What took place over the next several months is not exactly clear .
As is typical in these types of stories , there is much disagreement over who is on the side of truth .
But some details have emerged .
The district hired an independent investigator .
After a lengthy investigation in which Freshwater , other teachers , students , and administrators were all interviewed , the consultant concluded in a report that Freshwater had been teaching students that evolution is a lie for at least 11 years .
The report also said that Freshwater had witnessed to students , at one point telling them that there could n’t possibly be a genetic link to homosexuality because the Bible says it is a sin .
The report also said that he handed out Bibles to members of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and led them in prayers during school hours .
Also , Freshwater said he had given a voluntary extra-credit assignment to students who watched Expelled , a documentary that argues teachers who believe in intelligent design are facing discrimination .
According to the report , Freshwater at first denied the incident .
Later he admitted to the experiment , admitting he marked Zachary with an X .
However , students interviewed for the investigation all described it as a cross .
The link to the full report is here .
In response to the investigation , Freshwater was told to remove all religious items from his room , including a poster of the Ten Commandments hanging on the wall , stickers with scripture on them , extra Bibles he kept in the back of the classroom , and the Bible that he kept on his desk .
In April , Freshwater , fearing disciplinary action , took his side of the story public .
He never mentioned the branding incident .
Rather he said it was because of the Bible on his desk .
Because he had refused to remove it , citing religious freedom under the First Amendment , he said he was being persecuted .
Students organized a rally for him , bringing their Bibles to school in support .
A Web site devoted to Freshwater ’s cause is called www.bibleonthedesk.com.
But Dennis said the issue was never about the Bible on the desk .
And nowhere in the lawsuit ’s initial complaint is it even mentioned .
Rather , she says , it ’s because her son was branded .
After Freshwater took his side public , Jenifer said she and her husband were worried Freshwater would n’t face disciplinary action .
In June , they filed a lawsuit against Freshwater and the district for violating the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause by permitting religion to be taught in class , and for failing to protect their son .
Federal law allows such civil liberties cases to be filed anonymously .
Freshwater has filed a countersuit , citing defamation of character .
In July , the school board suspended Freshwater without pay based on the investigatory report , saying he had misused the electrical device , taught religion in his science class , and failed to follow district curriculum and rules .
Both sides are now awaiting the outcome of administrative hearing to determine whether he should be permanently fired .
The hearings took place this fall and have been continued until January 6 .
For now , while he waits for the outcome of the hearings , Freshwater is selling Christmas trees .
Last week , he said he believes the district is retaliating against him because he advocated for “ critical analysis ” of evolution in 2003 .
“ They ’ve marked me as a religious — I do n’t know if I want to use this phrase about myself — but as a religious fanatic , ” Freshwater said .
Freshwater is careful to say he does n’t object to all elements of evolutionary theory , but would simply like to raise some questions about it .
He said that in the 21 years he has been a teacher , he has been using the Tesla coil on students , even though manufacturer instructions warn that it is not to be used on human skin .
He said he has never had one complaint until now .
Freshwater said that there is no way to tell whether the photo presented by the Dennis family that shows the mark of a cross on a forearm was doctored , or whether it was even Zachary ’s arm .
When asked if he was accusing the family of lying , Freshwater said , “ Do n ’t put words in my mouth . ”
While he admits using the device on Zachary , he said he did n’t know if it left a mark .
Not Always a Rural Issue
Despite the gruesome elements , the story is less unusual than at first appears .
According to a poll published this spring in the Public Library of Science Biology , one in eight US high school teachers presents creationism as a valid alternative to evolution .
The poll , conducted by Michael Berkman , a political scientist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park , and his colleagues , also learned that 16 percent of teachers believe in creationism .
While Berkman ’s research did not address why so many teachers are creationists , he speculated in an e-mail that biology appeals to even fundamentalist Christians :
In Darwin ’s day , most biologists felt that they had a calling to describe God ’s works .
So people of all faith traditions may be drawn to biology , including those whose faith includes a literal interpretation of Genesis .
Clearly , a substantial percentage of them are unwilling to accept the geological , chemical , and genetic evidence for an old earth .
Jason Wiles , a Syracuse University biology professor whose research focuses on teaching issues related to biological evolution , said he frequently runs into creationists training to be educators .
“ It ’s not only in the South , or in rural areas , ” Wiles said .
Wiles recently held a workshop for 30 science teachers in the Syracuse city school system .
Three of the teachers were actively interested in promoting intelligent design .
He suspects that the reason that so few cases make it to the public stage is that many parents are n’t always aware of what ’s going on in the classroom .
Also , children are often unaware that the teacher has crossed a Constitutional line .
“ A lot of times students just do n’t know what their rights are , ” Wiles said .
Resolution Far Off
On that day in September , Jenifer Dennis had come to Gambier to meet one of the plaintiffs in the Dover case .
I was giving a speech at Kenyon College that night about Dover ’s battle .
Cyndi Sneath , one of the parents from Dover , had ridden out with me from Harrisburg .
As they sat down at the table , Sneath and Dennis began to compare notes , sharing common experiences .
Dennis plopped a large file on the table that details the case and starts flipping through pages .
She asked Sneath if she had initially realized how demanding and time - consuming being a plaintiff in a First Amendment case would be .
Sneath told her she honestly had no idea what to expect .
At first , Jenifer Dennis said she could n’t tell if she was overreacting to her son ’s arm .
“ I was thinking maybe I ’m crazy , ” she said .
“ I was thinking maybe it ’s something they do ?
And it ’s OK ? ”
Dennis and her husband are both Catholic .
They are NASCAR fans who camp in an RV at races .
Yet , they are being labeled as elitist and intolerant of religion .
At one school board meeting in July , numerous parents and teachers spoke in defense of Freshwater and criticized the parents .
One parent told the board , “ As a Christian , I do n’t accept the separation of church and state . ”
During the district ’s administrative hearing process , Freshwater successfully argued that Zachary ’s name be released publicly .
So the anonymous status in the family ’s lawsuit has now become a moot point , and the recriminations that the family feared have begun with calls and letters .
But Dennis said she has also had friends and strangers come up to her and say that they ’re glad they came forward .
She said Zachary , who turned fifteen on Dec. 17 , is handling the pressure .
But unlike in the Kitzmiller case , in which Sneath and 10 other parents sued the Dover school district , Jenifer Dennis still feels alone in her fight .
She is looking forward to a resolution in the case .
When she started this battle a year ago , she never envisioned it would still be going on through another Christmas .
“ I just need some closure , ” she said .
But her lawsuit will no doubt drag on for much longer .
The trial date is not until May 2010 .
Martin Chalifour , concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic , performs the eerie concertolike solo in “ Welcome to Rapture , ” part of Garry Schyman ’s score for BioShock .
In Prince of Persia , Stuart Chatwood plays the oud and other instruments to add an exotic touch to Inon Zur ’s sweeping orchestral score .
The field has also attracted major film composers like Danny Elfman , Howard Shore and Hans Zimmer .
The composer Michael Giacchino began his career writing for games ( including the Medal of Honor series ) before branching into film and television .
And more composers might follow his path now that schools like the Berklee College of Music in Boston have started game scoring classes .
For composers and performers accustomed to struggling to find steady work even in flush times , there ’s good money to be made in an industry that , according to the NPD research group , generated $ 21.6 billion in retail sales in the United States alone in the 12 months that ended in November .
Tommy Tallarico , a game composer who founded the Game Audio Network Guild to promote the field , said the typical fee for a composer is $ 1,000 per minute of music , with top names making up to $ 2,000 .
For a typical game , which requires one to two hours of music , a composer could make $ 60,000 to $ 240,000 .
The increasingly nuanced scores reflect “ the growing maturity of the games industry , which is getting better at storytelling ” and weaving moral dilemmas into game plots , said Sean Decker , general manager at DICE , the division of Electronic Arts that created Battlefield .
The main challenge for composers is switching from a linear to an interactive medium in which the music has to reflect several possible outcomes at each stage of the game .
Different music is needed , for example , depending on whether a gamer perishes or emerges victorious from a tussle with a venomous monster .
Jesse Harlin , music supervisor at LucasArts ( which uses scores by John Williams , among others , for its Star Wars games ) is swamped with demos from composers .
He encourages them to write music that reflects what is happening to the gamer in the story and to avoid loop - based scores that can result in listener fatigue .
Music can be “ dynamically mixed in real time by the game itself , ” he said , meaning that if the gamer gets into a hectic combat situation , for example , brass and percussion can be layered on top of a string track .

In the all the coverage of alleged con-man Bernie Madoff's $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme , I keep hearing that this could be the biggest swindle of its kind in history .
That 's just plain wrong .
The largest Ponzi scheme in history is run by the U.S. government and it's called Social Security .
Now I 'm not one of those people who wants to privatize social security or thinks it 's definitely going to go bust .
But I can't deny the similarities between how social security operates and what Bernie Madoff was allegedly doing with his investors , or should we call them marks ?
With the Social Security system workers pay 12.4 % of their salaries into the system to cover payments to retirees , who themselves paid into the system when they were working .
Except the original recipients of social security in the depression never had to pay
payroll taxes because the system did n't exist when they were working .
Now look at the definition of a Ponzi scheme courtesy of wikipedia : " A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that involves paying abnormally high returns to investors out of the money paid in by subsequent investors , rather than from the profit from any real business . "
Hmm , returns to investors come from the money paid in by subsequent investors .
That does sound a lot like social security .
It 's true there 's no promise of abnormally high returns , and social security is n't an investment scheme at all , it 's a form of social insurance , but the similarities are pretty jarring .
But the big question is whether social security is essentially fraudulent for younger workers paying into the system right now .
Will the demographics of America 40 years from now allow people my age to collect the same kind of benefits that retirees are collecting today ?
If not , then reforming social security so it's not a big giveaway from the young to the old should be the second biggest political priority of anyone under the age of 30 , right after dealing with this recession .
We feel bad for the people who came late in investing with Bernie Madoff and got burned when his Ponzi scheme fell apart .
Now , I do n't begrudge anyone their social security benefits , but I also do n't want my generation to be feeling sorry for itself when our time to collect comes around and the money is n't there .
I think most of the worries about the insolvency of social security are overblown , but if we have to reduce benefits or raise the age at which workers can collect at some point in the future , then that hurts my generation .
So if you 're young and you think what Bernie Madoff did was wrong , you might want to mobilize and prevent the U.S. government from doing the exact same thing to you .
I do n't think this is a left - wing vs. right - wing issue .
This is about the young vs. the old ; the potential victims and the current beneficiaries .

The economic , social and political disaster produced by the Zionist project
Part One
By Jean Shaoul
21 January 2009
We repost below the first of a two - part report on Israel and Palestine by Jean Shaoul to an expanded meeting of the World Socialist Web Site International Editorial Board held in Sydney , Australia from January 22 to 27 , 2006 .
Shaoul is a WSWS correspondent and a member of the Socialist Equality Party in Britain .
The second and concluding part of the report will be posted on January 22 .
The present economic , social and political conditions in Israel and Palestine are an indictment of the Zionist project and the nation state as the solution to the oppression of the Jews .
The Zionist state was conceived as the answer to the problem of the European persecution of the Jews — a state where the Jews would find a safe haven , social justice and equality .
It was realised in the form of a capitalist state created by the dispossession of another people and maintained through war and repression , and social inequality at home .
Indeed , it is impossible when presenting this report , to avoid pointing out that the Jewish people , sections of whom have a long history in every progressive movement , not least the international socialist movement , are now themselves widely regarded as oppressors with blood on their hands .
The Fourth International and Palestine 1948
I think it is pertinent to recall what the Fourth International said about Palestine in 1947 - 48 .
One can not but be struck when reading its statement , Against the Stream , written nearly 60 years , how extraordinarily prescient its warning was .
It insisted that Zionism was both utopian and reactionary and denounced the 1947 UN decision to partition Palestine into two tiny states .
" By partition a wedge is driven between the Arab and Jewish worker .
The Zionist state with its provocative lines of demarcation will bring about the blossoming forth of irredentist ( revenge ) movements on either side .
There will be fighting for an ‘ Arab Palestine ' and for a ‘ Jewish state ' within the historic frontiers of Eretz Israel ( the Land of Israel ) .
As a result , the chauvinistic atmosphere thus created will poison the Arab world in the Middle East and throttle the anti-imperialist fight of the masses , while Zionists and Arab feudalists will vie for imperialist favours . "
The Fourth International said : " The Jewish state , this gift of Truman 's and Bevin's , gives the capitalist economy of the Zionists a respite .
This economy rests on very flimsy foundations .
Its products cannot compete on the world market .
Its only hope is the inner market from which the Arab goods are debarred ....
The continuous flow of Jewish immigrants , who would come with the remnants of their possessions , is apt to increase the circulation of goods .
It will allow the bourgeois producers to dispose of their expensive wares .
Mass immigration would also be a very useful means of forcing down wages which ‘ weigh so heavily ' on Jewish industry .
A state engaged in inevitable military conflicts would mean orders from the Hebrew Army , a source of Hebrew profits not to be underrated at all .
A state would mean thousands of snug berths for Zionist veteran functionaries . "
Jewish workers would have to bear the cost in the form of high prices and heavy taxes .
Separated from their Arab brothers and sisters and prevented from fighting as a united class , they would be at the mercy of their class enemies , imperialism and the Zionist bourgeoisie .
As Chaim Weitzmann , who was to become the first president of the new state , said , " The Jewish state will stem the communist influence . "
In answer to the question , " And what promises does the Jewish state hold out ?
Does it really mean a step forward towards the solution of the Jewish problem ? " the Fourth International warned , " The partition was not meant to solve Jewish misery nor is it ever likely to do so .
This dwarf of a state , which is too small to absorb the Jewish masses , cannot even solve the problems of its citizens .
The Hebrew state can only infest the Arab East with anti-Semitism and may well turn out — as Trotsky said — a bloody trap for hundreds of thousands of Jews . "
For the Arab feudal leaders , the UN vote for a Zionist state was a godsend , enabling them to divert the attention of the masses away from a united class struggle and any possibility of international class solidarity , with a declaration of war on the newly formed Zionist state .
The military conflict and ensuing bloodshed — all in the name of anti-imperialism — also served to break up the workers ' movements in both camps , thereby weakening the working class and strengthening imperialism .
The Fourth International stressed that Zionism was a reactionary and utopian movement .
It was utopian to believe that :
1 . A harmonious development within an isolated and closed economy in the midst of a capitalist world is possible .
Without the expansion of the economy , millions of Jewish immigrants could not be absorbed .
2. A Jewish state could exist amid the open hostility of tens of millions of Arabs , and in the face of an Arab population growing at least as fast as Jewish immigration .
3 . That Israel could manoeuvre successfully between the rival imperialist powers , all of which were using Israel to further their own strategic interests in the region .
4 . That anti-Semitism could be eradicated simply by granting nationality to the Jews , ignoring its social , historical and ideological roots .
It was reactionary because Zionism :
1. Serves as a support for imperialist domination by giving it the fig leaf of acting as arbiter between the Jews and the Arabs .
2. Produces a nationalist reaction on the part of the Arab masses thereby creating a racial division of the international working class , and strengthening the national " unity " of both the Jews and the Arabs .
3 . As a nationalist force , acts as a break on the participation of Jewish workers in the class struggle in the rest of the world , separates them from the world proletariat , gives them their own and different goals to strive for , and above all creates illusions in the possibility of improving their lot within the framework of capitalism .
The Fourth International warned that war on neither side in the Arab - Zionist conflict bore a progressive character : it served only to obscure the class antagonisms and open the gates for nationalist excesses , weakening the proletariat and strengthening imperialism in both camps .
It called on the workers of the two peoples to unite in a common front against imperialism and its agents .
It warned Jewish workers that they would not be free and safe as long as they had not done away with national discrimination , isolationalism and imperialist loyalty .
What are the conditions within the Zionist state today ?
Let us fast forward nearly 60 years and ask :
What has been the end result of the Zionist road to the security of the Jewish people ?
What have been the main tendencies of development that should inform our work on perspectives ?
First of all , Israel has from the beginning faced an enormous economic , social and political crisis .
It was carved out as one of five states ( Israel , Palestine , Jordan , Lebanon and Syria ) from the former Syrian province of the Ottoman Empire .
Capitalism within such a tiny state , surrounded by hostile states , with few natural resources and little water , and unintegrated into the wider regional economy , was never economically viable .
From the beginning , the Arab regimes refused to trade with Israel and boycotted those companies that did so .
It is this , in part at least , that has forced successive governments to seek to expand Israel 's borders , and thus military and settlement expenditure .
This is why Israel has lurched , throughout its entire existence , from one economic crisis to another and why it has been so reliant on external support .
This has inevitably affected its role internationally and at home .
In its early years , Israel was kept afloat by the Diaspora , which contributed $ 200 million a year before 1967 and a massive $ 700 million a year in the following six years .
Even today , Israel receives $ 1.5 billion a year from private US donations .
In the 1950s , German reparations money provided another important source of finance : $ 125 million a year before 1966 .
Even after the reparations money came to an end , West German aid continued at a higher level than before .
But by far the most important source of economic assistance has been the US government .
While before 1967 , US provided very little , at $ 50 million a year , this had risen to a massive $ 3 billion a year by 1986 ( split between $ 1.2 billion economic and $ 1.8 billion military assistance ) , plus some $ 500 million a year aid from other parts of the US budget or in some cases , off - budget .
It has continued at this level ever since , making Israel the highest per capita recipient of US aid in the world .
But this aid to Israel differed from most US aid .
Firstly , normally US aid is tied to specific projects and the purchase of US goods and services , and overseen by the government agency , USAID .
Most US aid to Israel goes straight into its Exchequer as a cash transfer .
Secondly , aid is a bit of a misnomer .
It usually comes in the form of loans that have interest and repayment obligations .
But most of the military loans were converted into grants and the remaining military loans were " forgiven " by Congress .
Only the economic aid had to be repaid with interest .
To put US aid to Israel into perspective , direct aid to Israel is more than six times all US aid to sub Saharan Africa .
But even these annual $ 3.5 billion grants were insufficient .
In 1992 - 96 , the US stepped in to provide $ 10 billion in loan guarantees and a similar amount in 2002 - 03 .
Without such guarantees , Israel would have been bankrupt .
Its external debt is now much greater than its GDP .
As well as rescuing the economy , the US also permitted the settlement expansion .
While officially Clinton deducted the cost of settlements from the aid , he simply made equivalent amounts available as grants from other sources .
Thus in effect , the US subsidised the settlements .
Ninety - nine percent of US military assistance to Israel came only after Israel became stronger than all the Arab armies , and ruled over the Palestinian population .
Assistance increased after every military intervention and suppression of the Palestinians .
It increased after the Oslo peace talks , and again after they collapsed .
It continues today when Israel faces no military threat .
Indeed , US aid is to ensure military superiority .
Similarly , the US provides economic assistance to a country that has a GDP far larger than the combined GDP of its Arab neighbours , including Egypt , despite having a population of only 6 million compared to 100 million .
As well as economic assistance , the US has provided political cover for Israel at the UN .
Between 1972 and 2001 , it vetoed 39 resolutions in the Security Council in order to block criticisms of Israel 's policies and actions in the Occupied Territories .
It used the veto threat on countless other occasions to get resolutions withdrawn or watered down .
Thus the US has ensured that no action has ever been taken against Israel for its defiance of UN resolutions or its development of nuclear weapons .
What has been Israel 's quid pro quo for the US ?
Israel prevented victories by the Palestinians and their supporters outside Israel 's own border : in Jordan in 1970 , Lebanon 1976 - 82 , as well as in the Occupied Territories .
It thus helped suppress the Arab working class and maintain decrepit regimes in power .
It kept the Stalinist bureaucracy in Moscow at bay during the Cold War : in 1967 and then again in 1973 , it defeated Egypt and Syria , both of whom were armed and aided by the Soviet Union .
In effect , Israel replaced Britain after its withdrawal " East of Suez " as the policeman of the Middle East on behalf of US imperialism .
Its frequent wars provided the US with live testing for its arms , often against Soviet weaponry .
With its nuclear arsenal , Israel had weapons capable of reaching the Soviet Union .
It prevented the emergence of Iraq as a nuclear power with the bombing of Iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981 .
Israel also provided valuable services as a subcontractor for the US .
It has served as a conduit for US arms to regimes that the US could not be seen to be assisting : apartheid South Africa , Khomeini 's Iran during the Iran - Iraq war , and numerous military dictatorships and right - wing rebel forces , particularly in Latin America .
Israel 's intelligence service , Mossad , provides Washington with intelligence gathering and can be relied upon to carry out illegal and covert operations on behalf of the US that the US itself either does not want , or be seen , to carry out .
It trialled novel forms of interrogation and torture , later to be used in Iraq .
In other words , Israel acts as a mercenary for US imperialism , a situation that its own commentators have likened to " the Godfather 's messenger " .
This is because Israel carries out the " dirty work " of the Godfather who " always tries to appear to be the owner of some large respectable business " .
One Israeli intellectual noted that the state had gathered in three million Jews into Israel and transformed them into " parasites of America " .
Growth of anti-Semitism
Unquestionably one of the most potent factors re-igniting anti-Semitism today is the brutal methods adopted by the Israeli government .
This factor has been used to considerable effect by one Middle East regime after another to whip up anti-Semitism as a diversion to obscure their own political bankruptcy .
In part , this has been one of the elements that have , amid the present political confusion , encouraged the growth of Islamic fundamentalists who employ populist anti-Semitism to manipulate political discontent .
Two years ago , a leaked European Union report showed a rise in the number of attacks on Jews by European Muslim youth .
It linked a rise in attacks on Jews with events in the Middle East , particularly since the start of the Intifada in September 2000 and Israel 's attack on Jenin in the West Bank in April 2003 .
To recognise this fact is not to endorse anti-Semitic views or to defend those who hold them .
Yet , the political basis for a dangerous re-emergence of anti-Semitism among often politically uneducated second generation Arab and African immigrants cannot be ignored .
Israel itself routinely lumps together legitimate hostility to its treatment of the Palestinians with anti-Semitism .
Any objective appraisal of what Israel has done is depicted as anti-Semitism .
This serves a very definite purpose , in obscuring political understanding .
Breaking out of a national autarky
Zionism 's solution to its economic problems — expanding Israel 's borders — has proved to be no solution at all .
That is not only because it turned Israel into an international pariah and incurred massive military costs .
While in the immediate post - war period , Israel operated as a nationally regulated economy , the development of globalisation in the late 1970s rendered this impossible .
Israel had to seek economic integration into the wider Middle East economy .
The policies of privatisation , economic liberalisation and drastic devaluations espoused by the Likud government after 1985 devastated much of Israel 's traditional enterprises , ruptured the nationally regulated economy , and opened it up into the international economy .
Foreign institutional investors began to own an increasing proportion of the Tel Aviv stock market - quoted companies .
Many of Israel 's leading high - tech companies began to have their shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange and to operate outside Israel .
These measures also changed the social composition of Israel 's business circles .
The shift toward internationalisation upset the old equilibrium that had existed between big business and the military establishment , in favour of a new elite based on Israel 's high - tech sector , IT and pharmaceuticals .
Peace with Israel 's Arab neighbours would end its isolation .
It promised more new markets than Israel 's garrison state could ever deliver .
But the price to be paid for a wider regional role and markets that would make Israel a regional economic power was some kind of deal with Arafat and the Palestinians , even if it was not the full withdrawal from the Occupied Territories and Jerusalem demanded by international conventions and UN resolutions .
That price was the 1993 Oslo Accords .
As Labour party leader Shimon Peres explained in a newspaper interview in 1992 : " All the world is organised like a house with two floors : in the basement the regional agreements .
And on the top floor : multinational groups of companies " .
He then spelt it out more clearly : " We do not want a peace between nations .
We want a peace between markets . "
In other words , and what tends to be forgotten , beneath all the rhetoric and re-branding of the Labour party as the party of peace , lay Israel 's ambition to become the economic powerhouse of the Middle East .
Subcontracting to a Palestinian mini-state would enable access to EU and Arab markets , while excluding the Palestinians from Israel 's workforce and preserving a Jewish majority in Israel itself .
But such a " peace " famously initiated on the lawns of the White House in September 1993 could never be more than a chimera .
It could not alleviate the appalling social conditions of the Palestinians .
Indeed , it was not designed to do so .
Israel closed its borders to Palestinian workers and simply replaced low - wage Palestinian workers with workers from Asia .
These immigrant workers are cheaper and have even fewer rights than Palestinian workers .
While their numbers may seem low , they are proportionately the highest in the world .
They have had a massive impact , forcing down wages and social expenditure in Israel , and increasing poverty in Palestine .
So Oslo was bound to be resisted , despite the capitulation of the PLO .
Moreover , within Israel , Oslo was opposed by the very social forces unleashed by the expansion of Israel — the settlers and ultra-religious as well as Sharon , Netanyahu and the Likud .
On their insistence , the settlements were expanded .
The collapse of the Oslo framework , the subsequent Intifada uprising in September 2000 , the cost of the military suppression of the Palestinians — currently costing $ 1.4 billion a year — and the continued expansion of the settlements were an unmitigated disaster for Zionist capital and the Labour party .
Israel plunged into its deepest ever recession as tourism , its key foreign currency earner and employer , and foreign investment plummeted .
The Greater Israel policy — the expansion of the settlements and the murderous war against the Palestinians — came at a huge cost to the Israeli working class .
Firstly , Sharon appointed former International Monetary Fund staffer , Stanley Fischer , to head Israel 's central bank and his arch rival , Netanyahu , to take over at the Finance Ministry .
Together they introduced a raft of market " reforms " :
• privatisations
• opening up Israel 's banking system to competition
• cuts in social benefits such as unemployment , child and insurance benefits , and income assistance
• freezing of benefit levels which are to be linked to the consumer price index , not wages , from 2006
• raising the pension age
• cuts in corporate taxes and income taxes for the rich
• anti-trade union laws , restrictions on the right to strike and a ban on strikes in the public sector .
All this was aimed less at reducing the government deficit than undermining social security and creating " labour market flexibility " .
Expenditure on the armed forces and settlements , including the roads and infrastructure , increased .
These measures have brought unremitting misery , unemployment and poverty to increasing numbers of workers and their families .
The price for US support for Sharon 's land grab — including the extra land seized by the security wall , even if it was not as large as he would have liked — was that Sharon had to be seen to make some minor concession to the Palestinians .
Hence Sharon 's unilateral " disengagement " from Gaza — in the teeth of opposition from the ultranationalists and religious forces — for which he was re-branded by the international media as a " peacemaker " .
In reality and from an economic perspective , the pull - out is part of a drive to deepen the isolation of the Palestinians and ensure their absolute separation from Israel in a glorified militarised ghetto .
Exports from Gaza have fallen by half .
Sharon intended to massively curtail the use of Palestinian labour within Israel .
This must in turn lead to further attacks on Israeli wages and social conditions if Israel is to compete in the world market .
As a result of all these factors — a small unviable and autarkic economy , the failure of the economic perspective that underpinned Oslo , the uprising , the military and settlement costs , cheap foreign labour , unemployment and the gutting of social welfare — Israeli workers and their families have seen their living standards plummet .
The Zionist dream of a national home for the Jews and escape from oppression and persecution within Israel has turned into its opposite .

TOKYO ( CNN ) -- Japan -- the world 's second - largest economy -- is in a recession , government officials announced Monday .
Japan 's Cabinet Office confirmed that its economy shrank another 0.1 % in its third quarter , following a 0.9 % drop in the second quarter .
The country 's gross domestic product -- second to the United States -- has fallen by 0.4 % this year , pushing Japan into its first recession since 2001 .
The financial crisis has spread to all corners of the world .
In Europe , the pain has been particularly acute .
The European Union on Friday officially declared that the 15 - nation group had entered into a recession , with its gross domestic product declining 0.2 % for the second straight quarter .
Major indexes around the globe have plummeted over the last two months amid the economic gloom .
The Russian stock market has lost 65.5 % of its value since the start of the year .
Stocks in Japan and the U.S. have been equally hard hit , falling 42 % and 33 % , respectively .
Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso was among the Group of 20 world leaders that met in Washington over the weekend , unveiling a set of sweeping plans aimed at tackling the ever - expanding economic crisis , which has roiled financial markets worldwide .
The G - 20 members at the historic two - day meeting managed to find some common ground on both the causes of the crisis and areas that need to be fixed .
The plans include interest rate cuts by central banks around the globe or potential economic stimulus packages , and boosting developing countries struggling under the weight of the crisis .
Japan 's recession announcement was not unexpected .
Part of the problem is the strong yen , which skyrocketed in recent weeks as turmoil in the world 's financial markets and concerns about a global recession drove investors away from high - yielding currencies such as the euro and the pound .
As a result , lower - yielding currencies like the dollar and the yen surged in value , because they are considered by many investors to be a safe haven .
Since Japan is such a big exporter of goods , a more robust yen hurts profits for Japanese firms as sales from abroad get translated back into yen .
The more that the yen has climbed , the worse Japan 's stock market has performed , which has resulted in a ripple effect on European and U.S. exchanges .
After an early selloff Monday , Japan 's Nikkei 225 stock index rebounded .
The index finished the session up nearly 1 % .

When we need to make a difficult decision , usually we attempt to analyze all possible options in order to choose what is best .
According to a new study , when faced with a complex decision the best option is not to think about all the problems and allow our unconscious thought to do the trick .
The strategy may sound quite interesting , but the study published in the journal " Psychological Science " edited by the Association for Psychological Science , warns about the effectiveness of unconscious thought picking the best options .
Scientists from the Duke University chose a number of volunteers to take part in a lottery choice task .
Participants had to select from four different options , each having a different , but close , payoff .
In order to perform this task , John W. Payne , Adriana Samper , James R. Bettman and Mary Frances Luce , scientists who carried out the research , divided the participants into 3 groups : volunteers from one group were told to think about the task for a specific amount of time , people in another group were instructed to think about the task for an unlimited period of time and those from the third group were distracted before making their choice , thus they though about the task unconsciously .
In the second experiment scientist only changed the payoff of the four options .
This time there were considerable differences in the rewards .
Scientists discovered that in some circumstances unconscious thought will not help pick the best option .
In case when the payoffs were close , the decision was effective in both cases , when participants though for as long as they needed to make a selection and when they picked unconsciously .
But when the payoffs became considerably different unconscious thinking registered poorer results than thinking about the task for an unlimited period of time .
The group of participants who had to make a choice in a give amount of time showed poorer results in both experiments .
Researchers explain that participants in the second group had " too much time to think " and thus their attention moved " to information of lesser relevance , " which led to less gainful decisions .
In such a way the study showed that despite the fact that unconscious thought can sometimes help us pick the best option , it would be more effective to rely on self - paced conscious though more often and try to pay more attention to the problem .

The former is added in the current version , and the later is being replaced by scroll bars .
Edit : Please use this thread * only * for feature requests and ideas to keep it clean .
So , if you want to report a bug , do so on BKO .
If you want to discuss something else about Lancelot , or to make an inquiry on what and why , create another theme , or contact me on IRC .
Cheerio !

The colour of the edges when hovering over them should adapt to the system color scheme and not be hard - coded to red .

Uh , I 'm afraid I have n't understood you well .
Do you want to be able to change the order of the section buttons ?
Or to be able to move the inner categories ( Places , ... ) left or right ...
@blueget
Yes , that was the plan from the beginning .
The red was only a temporary thing - just to show the idea on blog .
But , as Aaron says , temporary things tend to stick for a long time .

One thing I can suggest is animation when item ' clicked ' .
You see , like five yellow flashes in windows taskbar , for example .
That could add some more " feedback " to application .
I will try last version and suggest something else tomorrow )

You mean one icon in the panel ( or wherever ) but to open only one section ?
And , I suppose you 'd want to be able to choose which section to be shown ...
Hm ... a good idea , I must say , but I propose one extension to it - that you can choose which sections you want shown in panel - so for example you could have only applications and computer if you have no use for contacts and documents .
Is it OK ?
@ OnlyWhisky
Feedback animations ( and other animations ) are in the TODO list , but as it is with the most features , I really do n't know when they will arrive .
( btw , I have absolutely no idea what yellow flashes you are talking about , but some feedback will be made )
Concerning the current SVN version - there are some layout issues with lists , so be warned .
It will soon be fixed , I hope .

I 'd like for the lancelot window to stay open after an app is selected especially the results window from a search , this could be either timed or until closed or until another window is selected - I liked how TastyMenu did this

thank you for lancelot ..
It 's rock ..
I can suggest the option Clear chronology of documents and applications ... by right - click on mouse or other ..
or in generale I suggest to add any features on different menu's areas by right - click ..
i.e .
option for contact list ... or clear chronology as mentioned ..
sorry for my english :'(

An option to have every item in the menu squished together so that no scrolling is ever required , and a further option within that one to limit each list to a specifically defined maximum number of items to be displayed at a time , so that scrolling is required if more than the specified number of items is present .

How hard would it be to include an option to configure menu sorting ?
For example : sort alphabetically .

As we go into the holiday phase , I was looking at how we celebrate the holidays .
We often throw parties have big feast with plenty of food and drinks .
I love to have an occasional glass of wine especially when dining .
This led me to look at recent studies about the positive effects of wine on a person ’s health .
For those who enjoy a glass or two of wine daily , the news is good .
Dr. Joy Bauer , a contributor to the Today show on NBC TV , says that drinking wine in moderation is beneficial for a person ’s health .
Dr. Bauer states that wine , as part of an individual ’s overall diet , reduces the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancers .
Additionally , drinking wine in moderation can slow down the debilitating effects of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson’s .
The intake of moderate amounts of wine delivers cardiovascular benefits that raise your good cholesterol and thin out your blood .
Wine contains resveratrol that prevents blood clotting and the formation of plaque in our arteries .
It has also been shown in animal studies to reduce tumours in animals .
Red wine contains larger amounts of resveratrol than white wine , and red wine from cool climates has the largest amounts of resveratrol .
So , drink moderately and keep your heart healthy and strong .
What Constitutes “ Moderate ”  Wine Consumption
There is some debate as to how much wine constitutes a moderate level of wine consumption .
Dr. Bauer feels that levels of moderation are different between men and women .
For men , a moderation level consists of no more than two 5 ounce glasses of red or white wine ; for women , the moderation level maxes at one glass per day .
Weight gain is another reason you should drink in moderation .
One 5 ounce glass of wine contains about 120 calories .
One bottle of wine , or 4 glasses , is the equivalent of drinking 40 ounces of a soft drink , such as Coke or Pepsi .
By consuming too much wine , you risk elevating your triglyceride level , which could induce diabetes and other health - related diseases .
Also , over consumption of wine can cause migraine headaches .
Tips for Wine Selection
The selection of the right wine is really a subjective judgment on your part .
Gary Vaynerchuk , wine connoisseur and spokesman for Wine Library TV , reinforces this point on his video on Wikihow .
Gary states that the information on wine selection is so scattered and unreliable , that the best way to select appropriate wines is to develop a relationship with someone in a wine shop or a restaurant .
You need to tell these people about your eating preferences , and ask that they recommend a dozen different wines , depending upon your food selections .
Here are some general rules that apply when you are selecting wine for consumption :
Select your wine based on the weight and texture of your meal .
For example , spicy foods go better with white wine .
Red wine is more suitable for heavier meals , such as meats and heavy sauced entrees , while white wine is more suited for lighter fare , such as chicken and fish .
Select a dry wine to complement a sweet meal , and a sweeter wine to complement food of a more acidic substance .
Do n’t sweat the small things .
There is no wine that will ruin a meal !
Variety is the spice of life .
Experiment with a wide range of wines , and you ’ll be pleasantly surprised at the results of the variations of your wine selections .
Enjoy , enjoy , and enjoy !
Wine is nature ’s gift to us , so savour the taste .
Expand Your Knowledge of Wine
Some ways to expand your knowledge of wines are :
Take a course on wines
Attend wine tasting parties
Ask for wine recommendations when ordering in restaurants and bars , and ask why the certain wine recommendation was made .
Now that you know the benefits of drinking wine in moderation , and have some tips on how to select a bottle of wine , I hoist my glass of Napa 2005 cabernet sauvignon in your honour , and wish you the best !!
Remember state laws about drinking and driving .

Fox contributor mocks black reporter 's tears during Obama win David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Late night Fox News host Greg Gutfeld makes a living off controversy .
But this is low , even for him .
On Tuesday night , Gutfeld talked with correspondent Bill Schulz as the two mocked a video clip of a black ABC reporter breaking into tears as Obama 's election to the presidency was announced .
" I grew up in a neighborhood that was mostly black , " said ABC's Steve Osunsami .
" And my father used to tell us that there 's no way this country would elect a black president .
Well , this evening , the country has proved my old man wrong , and we 're the better for it . "
Several times , the reporter 's voice wavered , as he was obviously emotionally moved by the news .
" I so wanna comfort him , right now , " sneered Gutfeld . " ...
Bill , you were convinced he was faking it . "
" I am , and I have to say , if that 's a television moment , I cry on this show every night ! " responded Schulz .
" Why do n't we get better ratings ? "
The show 's various cast members laughed .
" Yeah , I do think he was faking it , " he continued .
" It looked like he was trying to force the tears out and they were n't happening .
So he could force the moment , that I come by so naturally ...
Every time you hit me ! "
Gutfeld laughed and hissed , " Yes !
Yes , I know ! "

Dec. 14 , 2008 -- Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , took on his own party this morning for continuing to criticize the way President - elect Barack Obama has handled the scandal surrounding Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich .
" In all due respect to the Republican National Committee ...
I think we should try to be working constructively together , not only on an issue such as this , but on the economy stimulus package , reforms that are necessary , " McCain said in an exclusive " This Week " interview with George Stephanopoulos .
RNC Chairman Mike Duncan has released a statement every day since news broke of the Blagojevich corruption investigation calling on the Obama team to reveal all contact that they 've had with the governor .
However , McCain also called on the Obama transition team to publicly release all information relating to Blagojevich .
" I think that the Obama campaign should and will give all information necessary ...
I do n't know all the details of the relationship between President - elect Obama 's campaign or his people and the governor of Illinois , but I have some confidence that all the information will come out .
It always does , it seems to me , " he said .
McCain argued that the disgraced governor should resign .
" He should , " he said .
" You know , there 's a lot of corruption amongst Republicans and Democrats , and this kind of thing does n't help in these kinds of difficult economic times .
So I would hope that he would resign , but we also ought to look at systems that breed this kind of corruption , and unfortunately , it is n't confined to one city or one state . "
In his first Sunday interview since the election , McCain explained his role in the Republican Party going forward .
" I think my job is , of course , to be a part of and hopefully exert some leadership in the loyal opposition ...
Will there be areas of disagreement ?
Of course .
We are different parties and different philosophy .
But the nation wants us to unite and work together . "
When asked where he foresees coordinating with his former rival , McCain suggested he is willing to sign onto a stimulus plan in January .
" I 'm willing to sign on to a package that will help our economy get fixed , " he said .
On Obama 's proposed economic recovery plan , McCain explained , " I want to see the details of it ...
We also have to enact some fundamental reforms about the way we do business . "
He also weighed in on the ongoing fight on Capitol Hill over a bailout for the Big Three auto companies .
While McCain argued during the campaign that " we 've got to keep the auto industry alive , " he joined the effort to kill the auto bailout this week in the Senate .
When asked why , McCain said the package under discussion did not remedy the situation .
" I did n't believe that this fix would keep the auto industry alive .
I think it just put them on some life - support system for two or three months , because they did n't make the fundamental changes , i.e. more changes in their costs and salaries and wages and benefits , which would put them in line and make them competitive with foreign manufacturers in the United States -- not foreign manufacturers overseas , " he said .
Vice President Dick Cheney warned Senate Republicans this week that if they do n't bail out the auto industry , the Republican Party will forever be known as the party of Herbert Hoover .
In response McCain asked , " what is the point if you just kept at least two of the three alive for another two or three or four months ?
You end up in the same position , only you 've spent an additional $ 15 billion . "
When pressed further by Stephanopoulos about whether the auto companies need to go into bankruptcy , McCain said " I think that if not bankruptcy , certainly a bankruptcy - like solution , which forces everybody to sit down at the table and redo all these agreements . "
McCain also addressed the Obama transition so far , admitting that " absolutely " Obama 's national security team could have been one that he would have picked himself .
When asked what that tells him about the president - elect , McCain responded , " [ It ] tells me that the president - elect is going to address national security issues with people who he thinks the American people can trust , and that he can place trust and confidence in . "
On the campaign trail McCain repeatedly voiced his belief that Obama " is n't ready " to be commander in chief , but this morning he said " It 's not a matter of whether he 's ready ...
He has been selected by the American people .
We honor that decision . "
Of his campaign remark that the nation will be tested if Obama were elected , McCain laughed , " I said that because his running mate said that ! "
Finally on the future of his running mate , McCain refused to say whether he would support Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska if she runs for president in 2012 .
" Oh , no .
Listen , I have the greatest appreciation for Gov. Palin and her family , and it was a great joy to know them .
She invigorated our campaign .
" But I ca n't say something like that , " McCain said .
" We 've got some great other young governors . "
When asked why not , given that he selected her to succeed him as president if anything were to happen to him , McCain explained , " Now we 're in a whole election cycle .
Have no doubt of my admiration and respect for her and my view of her viability . "
He went on to joke , " My corpse is still warm , you know ? "
The Minnesota State Canvassing Board met today , at 9 AM CT , to finalize all challenge resolutions .
Each campaign brought forth a series of ballots that were believed to have been inaccurately allocated .
At the end of the day , Franken gained 6 votes and Coleman added 2 for a net Franken gain of 4 votes .
This addition extends Franken 's lead to 50 .
The final seven and a half minutes of the of the Canvassing Board 's discussion can be viewed below or downloaded ( *.wmv , 00:07:41 , 87.7 MB ) :
Shortly after the Canvassing board concluded , Marc Elias , Franken 's lead lawyer , conducted a brief press conference .
Below is an excerpt followed by the full video :
Marc Elias :
And now with everything except for the absentee ballots counted we are leading by 50 votes .
We could not be more thrilled with where we stand , in this process .
This recount has gone exceptionally well .
...
Marc Elias :
At every stage we have gained votes .
And we have every reason to believe that will be true of the absentee ballot review as well .
As you know we made an offer to accept all thirteen hundred and fifty of them , because we are confident that if all those were counted we would gain even more votes .
Source : VoteForAmerica.net ( *.wmv , 00:03:56 , 45.5 MB )
Tony Trimble then discussed the Coleman campaign 's view of the recount proceedings in a lengthier proceeding .
An excerpt is available below followed by the video :
Tony Trimble : The Canvassing Board , as we all know , has not taken care of the duplicate voting , the double voting thats occured in Minneapolis .
We are faced with an artificial Franken lead , of a , double digits is all .
There were a hundred double counted ballots , actually a hundred and ten doubled counted ballots that will wipe out that lead and keep Coleman , justifiably in front .
That 's where we stand today .
... Reporter A : If you have that faith in local officials , why are you not accepting their list of the thirteen hundred ?
Tony Trimble :
We have faith in local officials , they 're going do the right thing .
But we have brought to their attention , and the Franken campaign 's attention , that there is another stack , a small stack ten to twelve thousand that ought to be reviewed .
And we have faith that they will produce those , and show those to the Franken folks [ so that they can agree ] .
Source : VoteForAmerica.net ( *.wmv , 00:09:51 , 113 MB )
Minnesota Secretary of State , Mark Ritchie then held a Press Conference .
The first , probably ten minutes , pertained directly to the recount ; the second half focused on some of the legislative responsibilities of the Secretary of State .
I only have the first portion in video form , but the second portion is still available , and pretty interesting .
The video portion is available below along with an excerpt from part one :
Mark Ritchie :
To my knowledge neither of the campaigns even attempted to get agreement from the other campaign to meet this requirement .
So as of three o'clock yesterday this agreement made by both campaigns , the local elections officials , and our office was that by three they had to have agreement by both campaigns to add any additional challenges .
It is not that complicated of a rule .
It is under the order of the SC of MN .
Its a very straight forward thing that 's fairly easy to read and interpret .
If anybody would like to ask for further clarification on whether this rule should be changed they should say that , but that 's a different thing than saying the rule does not exist .
Reporter A : So the rules says that after 3 PM you cannot add to pile 5 , except by mutual agreement .
Mark Ritchie : Correct .

The only remaining step , for the Canvassing Board , revolves around acknowledging sum potential 1,350 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots .
The board will meet on January 5th and 6th from 2:30 to 5:00 PM CT .
During this time , the five member committee will review the challenged absentee ballots before they allocated .
It is possible , perhaps even probable that on January 6th the State Canvasing Board will declare that one of the candidates has received the most votes .
This is not to be confused with an election certificate .
Acknowledging the receiver of the most votes does not imply certification .
Once it is known who received the most votes , the loser may request an " election contest " within seven days .
If a contest does occur , the winner is officially certified after the resolution of that contest .
If there is no contest , the winner is certified seven days later .
Minnesota will not have a second Senator on January 6th , the would - be day of admittance .
A prototype diesel truck with a urea tank and SCR unit .
Credit : DaimlerChrysler Power Systems
Urea tanks will be standard equipment for most new diesel trucks , buses , cars , and sport utility vehicles ( SUVs ) manufactured in the United States after Jan. 1 , 2010 .
An automotive grade of urea will be injected into the vehicles ' exhaust stream to " scrub " nitrogen oxide ( NOx ) from the diesel exhaust .
NOx , a major air pollutant , contributes to smog , which causes asthma and respiratory and heart diseases .
The system , urea SCR or " urea - based selective catalytic reduction , " is the only technology available that can remove enough NOx from diesel exhaust to comply with strict new limits imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , says Glenn Kedzie , Environmental Counsel for the American Trucking Associations .
The automotive urea , called " diesel exhaust fluid " ( DEF ) in the United States and AdBlue , a trademarked name in Europe , reduces NOx by as much as 90 % alone , and can take NOx to near - zero levels when used in combination with diesel particulate filter technology , says Kim Doran , spokesperson of the newly formed North American SCR Stakeholders Group and editor of FactsAboutSCR.com , a Web site dedicated to SCR news .
DEF and AdBlue are an aqueous urea solution 32 ( AUS 32 ) , a clear 32.5 % nitrogen solution of high - purity urea in demineralized water .
The urea solutions are safe to handle , manufacturers claim .
AdBlue can be bought in bulk in Europe or by the liter at some service stations .
The advent of DEF and AdBlue is creating a new demand for urea , the world 's most widely used nitrogen fertilizer .
Some are concerned that the new use will drive fertilizer prices higher .
Others think it will be an incentive for manufacturers to increase production and thus , lower prices .
" We know about diversion of traditional food crops such as corn or sugarcane to biofuels like ethanol — but now urea , a basic input for food production , is also going into fuel , " says Dr. Amit Roy , President and CEO of the International Center for Soil Fertility and Agricultural Development ( IFDC ) .
" Ironically , cleaning our environment is a key reason for both technologies . "
Manufacturers Adopting Urea SCR Technology
More than half a million diesel trucks in Europe now use urea SCR and the fleet is growing by about 25,000 trucks per month , according to Integer Research , a London - based market analysis firm specializing in urea SCR .
Doran says that SCR technology is being adopted by passenger car and light truck manufacturers serving the United States including Audi , BMW , Hyundai , Jeep , Kia , MiniCooper , and Volkswagen .
Mercedes - Benz is introducing three new diesel - powered SUVs that use urea SCR technology into the United States in late 2008 .
Urea SCR is also used in Japan and Singapore and will soon be used in China .
Manufacturers in the commercial trucking industry adopting SCR include Freightliner , Kenworth , Mack , Peterbilt , and Volvo .
Leading engine manufacturers using SCR include Cummins and Detroit Diesel Corp .
Future Demand
Consumption of the urea solution is about 3 % of the diesel consumption .
Diesel trucks average 6.5 miles per gallon ( 2.8 km / liter ) .
An average diesel truck will need to refill its 20 - gallon tank of DEF every 4,000 to 6,000 miles ( 76 liters every 6,400 to 9,600 km ) .
Urea to reduce NOx emissions now consumes 0.3 to 0.4 million metric tons ( mt ) of urea in Western Europe , says Stephen Zwart , Licensing Manager of Netherlands - based Stamicarbon , the world 's largest licensor of urea plant technology .
In 10 years the current truck fleet in Western Europe will have been replaced , and urea use will be 3 to 4 million mt .
Future urea demands generated by SCR technology in the United States have been calculated by Dr. Carlos Baanante , IFDC Agricultural Economist .
In 2003 , 213 billion liters of diesel fuel were used for transportation in Europe and 146 billion liters in the United States , according to EarthTrends , an initiative of the World Resources Institute ( http://earthtrends.wri.org/index.php).
Baanante assumes that only 7 % of the diesel trucks in the United States will use urea SCR in 2010 — the new trucks purchased that year .
" U.S. urea consumption for transportation will probably be the urea fertilizer equivalent of about 210,000 tons in 2010 — but will be at least double that amount in 2011 and will increase rapidly afterward as older trucks are replaced with newer models that carry urea tanks , " Baanante says .
The estimates assume that a liter of the solution weighs about 1 kg and the urea fertilizer contains 46 % N , Baanante explains .
Thus , 1 kg of urea solution would consume the N needed to produce 0.7065 kg of urea fertilizer .
A conversion factor of 0.7065 is used to calculate urea solution consumption in terms of mt of urea - fertilizer equivalent .
" More than 90 % of the world 's urea production is for fertilizers — but new demands for urea SCR may change that , " Baanante says .
Urea is also used in animal feed , plastic and glue manufacture , highway de-icing , cloud seeding to induce rain , and tooth - whitening products .
Stringent New EPA Exhaust Emission Rules
Kedzie says that diesel - powered vehicles manufactured in the United States in 2010 can emit no more than 0.2 grams of NOx per brake horsepower hour — 90 % less than current emissions .
The new EPA regulations will not apply to vehicles manufactured before 2010 .
Tractors , bulldozers , and other non-road vehicles must meet the new EPA standards by 2015 .
The U.S. timetable for ships and locomotive engines has not yet been set .
" Some trucking agencies are now buying new trucks that were scheduled for replacement after 2010 to avoid the expenses of urea tanks and buying and transporting urea , " Kedzie says .
But Thom Albrecht , a transportation equity analyst with Stephens Inc. in Virginia , United States , thinks that most corporate carriers — the main buyers of heavy - duty trucks — will continue normal buying cycles as the next EPA emissions deadline looms in 2010 .
Albrecht reached that conclusion after surveying 88 carriers about their future buying plans .
New Demands Could Affect World Fertilizer Market
Keith Stokes , proprietor of Stokes Engineering and IFDC consultant on urea production , says , " Urea for NOx reduction will create a new demand that could drive up fertilizer prices — just as ethanol production did . "
But Doran of SCR Stakeholders says , " Demand for this automotive - grade urea is not expected to exceed 5 % of the world 's production .
The new use of urea to control vehicle emissions could lead to increased investment and expand world capacity for urea production . "
How Urea SCR Systems Work
Urea SCR cleans the exhaust after combustion .
The urea solution is held in a separate storage tank and injected as a fine mist into the hot exhaust gases .
The heat breaks the urea down into ammonia — the actual NOx - reducing agent .
Through a catalytic converter , the ammonia breaks the NOx down to harmless nitrogen ( N ) gas and water vapor .
The exhaust is no longer a pollutant ; the atmosphere is about 80 % nitrogen gas .
Bill Herz , Vice President of Scientific Programs for The Fertilizer Institute , based in Washington , D.C. , says , " You hear a lot about harmful effects of fertilizer on ecosystems — but little about the positive role of urea in stripping away pollutants . "
Doran says , " Because SCR technologies reduce NOx exhaust to almost zero , engines can be tuned to maximize fuel efficiency . "
The result is as much as a 3 %
If that seems backwards , it 's because it is .
Iraqis have never been awarded reparations for any of the crimes they suffered under Saddam , or the brutal sanctions regime that claimed the lives of at least half a million people , or the US - led invasion , which the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , recently called " illegal " .
Instead , Iraqis are still being forced to pay reparations for crimes committed by their former dictator .
Quite apart from its crushing $ 125 bn sovereign debt , Iraq has paid $ 18.8 bn in reparations stemming from Saddam Hussein 's 1990 invasion and occupation of Kuwait .
This is not in itself surprising : as a condition of the ceasefire that ended the 1991 Gulf war , Saddam agreed to pay damages stemming from the invasion .
More than 50 countries have made claims , with most of the money awarded to Kuwait .
What is surprising is that even after Saddam was overthrown , the payments from Iraq have continued .
Since Saddam was toppled in April , Iraq has paid out $ 1.8bn in reparations to the United Nations Compensation Commission ( UNCC ) , the Geneva - based quasi tribunal that assesses claims and disburses awards .
Of those payments , $ 37 m have gone to Britain and $ 32.8 m have gone to the United States .
That 's right : in the past 18 months , Iraq 's occupiers have collected $ 69.8 m in reparation payments from the desperate people they have been occupying .
But it gets worse : the vast majority of those payments , 78 % , have gone to multinational corporations , according to statistics on the UNCC website .
Away from media scrutiny , this has been going on for years .
Of course there are many legitimate claims for losses that have come before the UNCC : payments have gone to Kuwaitis who have lost loved ones , limbs , and property to Saddam 's forces .
But much larger awards have gone to corporations : of the total amount the UNCC has awarded in Gulf war reparations , $ 21.5 bn has gone to the oil industry alone .
Jean - Claude Aimé , the UN diplomat who headed the UNCC until December 2000 , publicly questioned the practice .
" This is the first time as far as I know that the UN is engaged in retrieving lost corporate assets and profits , " he told the Wall Street Journal in 1997 , and then mused : " I often wonder at the correctness of that . "
But the UNCC 's corporate handouts only accelerated .
Here is a small sample of who has been getting " reparation " awards from Iraq : Halliburton ( $ 18 m ) , Bechtel ( $ 7 m ) , Mobil ( $ 2.3 m ) , Shell ( $ 1.6 m ) , Nestlé ( $ 2.6 m ) , Pepsi ( $ 3.8 m ) , Philip Morris ( $ 1.3 m ) , Sheraton ( $ 11 m ) , Kentucky Fried Chicken ( $ 321,000 ) and Toys R Us ( $ 189,449 ) .
In the vast majority of cases , these corporations did not claim that Saddam 's forces damaged their property in Kuwait - only that they " lost profits " or , in the case of American Express , experienced a " decline in business " because of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait .
One of the biggest winners has been Texaco , which was awarded $ 505 m in 1999 .
According to a UNCC spokesperson , only 12 % of that reparation award has been paid , which means hundreds of millions more will have to come out of the coffers of post - Saddam Iraq .
The fact that Iraqis have been paying reparations to their occupiers is all the more shocking in the context of how little these countries have actually spent on aid in Iraq .
Despite the $ 18.4bn of US tax dollars allocated for Iraq 's reconstruction , the Washington Post estimates that only $ 29 m has been spent on water , sanitation , health , roads , bridges , and public safety combined .
And in July ( the latest figure available ) , the Department of Defence estimated that only $ 4 m had been spent compensating Iraqis who had been injured , or who lost family members or property as a direct result of the occupation - a fraction of what the US has collected from Iraq in reparations since its occupation began .
For years there have been complaints about the UNCC being used as a slush fund for multinationals and rich oil emirates - a backdoor way for corporations to collect the money they were prevented from making as a result of the sanctions against Iraq .
During the Saddam years , these concerns received little attention , for obvious reasons .
But now Saddam is gone and the slush fund survives .
And every dollar sent to Geneva is a dollar not spent on humanitarian aid and reconstruction Iraq .
Furthermore , if post - Saddam Iraq had not been forced to pay these reparations , it could have avoided the $ 437 m emergency loan that the International Monetary Fund approved on September 29 .
With all the talk of forgiving Iraq 's debts , the country is actually being pushed deeper into the hole , forced to borrow money from the IMF , and to accept all of the conditions and restrictions that come along with those loans .
The UNCC , meanwhile , continues to assess claims and make new awards : $ 377 m worth of new claims were awarded last month alone .
Fortunately , there is a simple way to put an end to these grotesque corporate subsidies .
According to United Nations security council resolution 687 , which created the reparations programme , payments from Iraq must take into account " the requirements of the people of Iraq , Iraq 's payment capacity , and the needs of the Iraqi economy " .
If a single one of these three issues were genuinely taken into account , the security council would vote to put an end to these payouts tomorrow .
That is the demand of Jubilee Iraq , a debt relief organisation based in London .
Reparations are owed to the victims of Saddam Hussein , the group argues - both in Iraq and in Kuwait .
But the people of Iraq , who were themselves Saddam 's primary victims , should not be paying them .
Instead , reparations should be the responsibility of the governments that loaned billions to Saddam , knowing the money was being spent on weapons so he could wage war on his neighbours and his own people .
" If justice , and not power , prevailed in international affairs , then Saddam 's creditors would be paying reparations to Kuwait as well as far greater reparations to the Iraqi people , " says Justin Alexander , coordinator of Jubilee Iraq .
Right now precisely the opposite is happening : instead of flowing into Iraq , reparations are flowing out .
It 's time for the tide to turn .

Going to the dentist fishkill is n’t exactly something that most people consider enjoyable .
The bright lights , the poking and prodding ; going to the dentist is n’t exactly fun .
However , while it may not be something to look forward to , most people do n’t have any issue with going to the dentist because they know how important dental visits are for their oral hygiene .
But for some people , the idea of going to the east fishkill dentist is downright scary .
The very thought of visiting a dentist invokes fear and anxiety .
If you ’re one of those people , there ’s a pretty good chance that you ’ve been putting off a dental exam – and you ’re not alone .
It ’s estimated that up to 15 % of American adults are n’t receiving the dental care they need because they suffer from dental phobia .
If you are afraid of the dentist , read on to learn more about dental phobia and how a reputable dentist can help you overcome your fear .
Phobias are extreme and unreasonable fears .
They are n’t uncommon ; in fact , some of the most common phobias include claustrophobia ( the fear of enclosed spaces ) , aviophobia ( the fear of flying ) , and acrophobia ( the fear of heights ) .
However , there ’s one phobia that may be more common than any other : dental phobia – an intense fear of going to the brewster dentist .
There are a lot of reasons why a person can become dental phobic .
Some reasons may include : These fears can lead to feelings of extreme uneasiness .
For example , the very idea of going to the dentist may induce physical pain or trigger a severe anxiety attack .
Those who suffer from dental phobia avoid going to the dentist at all costs so that they do n’t have to face their fears .
However , while not having dental exams may prevent intense anxiety and panic , it can lead to serious issues .
For example , those who are dental phobic have a higher risk of developing gum disease and tooth loss .
Infections are also more likely to develop , which can lead to serious health complications , such as cardiovascular disease and infections in the lungs , which could decrease life expectancy .
Furthermore , not going to the dentist can impact a person ’s appearance and self - esteem .
Needless to say , putting off going to the dentist certainly is n’t a wise idea , no matter how afraid you may be .
If you suffer from dental phobia , it ’s far better to face your fear than it is to keep putting off getting the dental healthcare you need to avoid your phobia .
As they say , the key to getting over anything you may be afraid of is by confronting it head - on .
Dentists are highly trained and understand that their patients can be fearful of dental exams and procedures .
If your phobia has been preventing you from making an appointment with your dentist , here are some tips that can help you put your fears at ease :
No matter how intense your dental phobia may be , putting off going to the poughkeepsie dentist is not the solution .
Our certified , licensed , and highly experienced dentist will work with you every step of the way to make sure that you are as comfortable as possible .
Your oral health directly impacts your overall health and well - being .

Composite image by POLITICO McCain allies prefer plumber to Powell
John McCain ’s surrogates took to the Sunday shows to minimize the damage from Colin Powell ’s endorsement of Democrat Barack Obama and challenge the hardening conventional wisdom that the presidential race is slipping away from their candidate .
House Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri admitted he wished Powell would have endorsed McCain , but said that neither the endorsement nor Obama ’s association with 1960s radical Bill Ayers will matter as much as Joe the plumber .
Advertisement
“ I think Joe the plumber does matter here , not because he 's Joe or not because he 's a plumber but because of all that particular discussion represents , ” Blunt said on CNN ’s " Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer . "
“ Endorsements are typically overrated , I think , ” former Bush budget director Rob Portman said on CBS ’ " Face the Nation . "
“ I do n't think it makes a big difference , ” Portman told host Bob Schieffer , though he added that Powell “ is well respected ” and has said Powell “ respects both men but he 's always had a special admiration for Sen. Obama . ”
Missouri ’s Republican Gov. Matt Blunt told Schieffer , “ I do n't know that it will make a difference in Missouri , ” and he downplayed the record 100,000 - person crowd Obama drew Saturday in St. Louis .
“ He obviously has a great celebrity status , ” Blunt said of the Illinois senator .
“ That does n't always translate into votes . ”
Powell got it wrong when he called Obama “ transformational , ” Rudy Giuliani said on “ Late Edition . ”
“ I do n't see the same things in Barack Obama that Colin Powell sees , ” said the former New York mayor , who acknowledged he has “ the highest regard ” for Powell and wanted him to seek the GOP presidential nomination in 1996 .
“ What I see [ in Obama ] is a very traditional liberal Democrat , really a throwback — even a throwback before the Clintons , Giuliani said , charging that Obama would engineer a government takeover of health care and strip workers ’ rights to secret ballots in union elections .
On the other side of the Sunday show aisle , Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , a Democrat , told CBS ’s Schieffer that Powell ’s endorsement proves that Obama will be able to set aside partisan ideology to forge pragmatic solutions and said it validates Obama 's national security judgment .
“ Gen .
Powell is not seen as a dividing figure but a uniting figure , ” Kaine said , adding that “ to have the confidence of Gen .
Powell in this election is very important . ”
Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said on ABC ’s “ This Week with George Stephanopoulos ” that Powell ’s endorsement of Obama should “ erase any remaining doubts about his national security agenda [ and ] his experience . ”
Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) a top Obama surrogate , said Powell ’s endorsement repudiates McCain ’s efforts to link Obama to Ayers ’ bombings in the 1960s .
“ Does anybody in their right mind think that Gen .
Powell would ever endorse anyone that had any patience with terrorists ? "
McCaskill said on " Late Edition . "
" Of course he would n't . ”
She got backup from some unlikely quarters .
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich of Georgia , a Republican luminary , agreed with Brazile that the endorsement “ eliminated the experience argument .
How are you going to say the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs , former secretary of state , former national security adviser , was taken in ? ”
Former presidential adviser David Gergen , also on “ This Week , ” called Powell ’s “ the most important endorsement of the campaign so far . ”
Gingrich attributed Obama ’s growing cash advantage — the campaign announced Sunday it had raised $ 150 million in September — to the McCain - authored 2002 campaign finance overhaul ( which actually did not change the public financing system limiting the Arizona senator to $ 84 million for the general election ) , calling it a “ bizarre irony ” and predicting it may be too much for McCain to overcome .
“ If nothing changes , Sen . Obama is going to win , ” Gingrich said , asserting that McCain ’s only chance is to seize on Obama ’s much - ballyhooed comments last week to the Ohio plumber who confronted him while canvassing demanding to know if Obama believed “ in the American Dream . ”
Obama told the plumber , Joe Wurzelbacher , that “ when you spread the wealth around , it ’s good for everybody . ”
Americans favor focusing on job growth over redistribution by 84 percent to 14 percent , Gingrich said , asserting “ even with no resources , a presidential candidate ought to be able to take an 84 to 14 issue — as Reagan would have — stay on it for two weeks ” and reshape the election .
That message is already resonating in the critical swing state of Ohio , which Portman , a former Ohio congressman , predicted would be tight .
“ John McCain has , really , a very simple message now , which is that , for the economy , Barack Obama is going to be risky , ” Portman said on CBS .
“ Joe the plumber kind of put the face on it , but the fact is , there are plumbing contractors , there are restaurant owners , there are small manufacturers , there are small software companies all around this beautiful Ohio state , who are saying : ‘ Look , I 'm having a hard time keeping the employees I have .
I want to add more employees .
Do n't tax me , ’ ” Portman said .
Kaine challenged Portman ’s portrayal , saying that “ the Joe the plumbers of the world are going to do much better under Sen. Obama as president than Sen. McCain . ”

WASHINGTON , Jan. 10 ( UPI ) --
The 1970s classic " The Joy of Sex " has gotten a makeover with 42 new chapters , including one on safe sex and another on transexualism , says its publisher .
The revised and updated " The Joy of Sex : The Timeless Guide to Lovemaking " replaces the pictures of hairy men in former editions with cleaner cut men , The Washington Post reported Saturday .
Advertisement
The new edition , by Crown Publishing Group , also ditches cracks about " one- legged ladies , " " negresses " and sex on horseback found in the original 1972 edition while adding a chapter on phone sex and a four - page resource guide on everything from menopause to eating disorders , the Post reported .
The book originally written by Alex Comfort , a doctor and author who died in 2000 , has been overhauled by Susan Quilliam , a British psychologist who advises a " practice session " before attempting new sexual positions so no one gets hurt .
Transfixed by the daily spectacle of dismal economic news and wild Wall Street swings , few Americans have looked up to see what a wide array of economists say lies beyond the immediate crisis .
And with good reason :
The picture is n’t pretty .
The sleek racing machine that was the U.S. economy is unlikely to return any time soon despite the huge repair efforts now underway .
Instead , it probably will continue to sputter and threaten to stall for years to come .
The prospects are so gloomy , according to a recent study , that unemployment may be slightly higher by the time President - elect Barack Obama ’s first term ends .
Advertisement
The damage done by plunging house and stock prices , the failure of other major economies to be independent sources of growth and hidden weaknesses in America ’s past performance have crippled nearly every actor in the nation ’s economic drama .
None -- save perhaps the government -- retains the power to push the economy back to speeds it regularly achieved during much of the last generation , economists say .
The result :
An economy that once averaged 3 % or better annual growth would be lucky to grow 2 % a year during the entirety of the new president ’s term .
“ That is going to feel like stagnation ” to most people , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody ’s Investors Service .
Advertisement
“ We ’re in a post - bubble global recession , and post - bubble recessions are lethal for growth , ” Stephen S. Roach , chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia , said from Beijing .
“ It will be a long time before the world experiences anything more than anemic recovery . ”
Obama and his economic aides seem to understand the painful prospects they face .
Obama misses no chance to temper hopes for a quick and complete comeback .
A recently released study by Christina Romer , his nominee to chair the Council of Economic Advisors , and Vice President - elect Joe Biden ’s chief economist , Jared Bernstein , concluded that , even with an $ 825 - billion stimulus package , the unemployment rate at the end of Obama ’s first term would be one - half to one full percentage point above where it was before the start of the recession .
That would mean as many as 1.5 million additional jobless workers .
And some independent economists say that number could be much higher .

What most worries analysts is not a cataclysm such as the Great Depression but the sort of economic morass into which Japan fell after its stock and real estate markets burst in the late 1980s and early ‘ 90s .
Daily life for most Japanese citizens was n’t terrible .
There were few company shutdowns or mass layoffs .
Indeed , the Japanese came to call their economic condition the “ golden recession , ” said Simon Johnson , a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The problem was that the country simply did n’t grow -- and that , economists worry , is what could happen in the U.S. and around the world .
“ Four years from now , I suspect that we ’ll be pretty much where we are today , ” Johnson said .
The question he predicts people will then ask : “ Why ca n’t we get growth going again ? ”

Four factors -- like the cylinders of an engine -- power an economy : consumers , investors , the government and a favorable balance of trade with other countries .
And for many years , the most important of these has been the American consumer .
U.S. households long have accounted for the lion ’s share of economic activity not only here but also in much of the rest of the world .
Although U.S. consumers constitute only about 4.5 % of the global population , they bought more than $ 10 trillion worth of goods and services last year .
By contrast , said Roach of Morgan Stanley Asia , Chinese and Indian consumers , who together account for 40 % of global population , bought only $ 3 trillion worth .
In the last decade , a new generation of financial engineering -- complex deals involving home equity loans , subprime mortgages and other devices that provided easier access to credit -- seemed to make it safe for Americans to save less and consume more .
That further expanded their share of global economic activity and made them even more indispensable here and abroad .
U.S. consumer spending shot up from a little over 73 % of the economy to nearly 77 % from 2001 to 2007 , according to government statistics .
Advertisement
Initially , the expansion was heralded as evidence of economic vitality .
But by now , it has become apparent that the growth was largely a debt - driven bubble -- and a double bubble at that , in housing and in personal consumption .
As the elaborate superstructure of easy credit began to pop rivets , consumers found themselves caught dangerously short .
They have reacted by drastically cutting back on purchases , particularly those that are discretionary .
Retail sales in the last three months of 2008 plunged 7.7 % compared with a year earlier , the government said last week , making it the worst sales quarter in more than 40 years .
At almost any other time , economists would write off such a drop as sharp but short - lived and predict that Americans would return to their spendthrift ways as soon as the economy began to recover .
But many veteran forecasters say this time is different .
Advertisement
“ Decades of borrowing have finally caught up with consumers ; they realize there is no more easy money left , ” said Allen Sinai , chief economist of Decision Economics Inc .
“ This is going to scar this generation of consumers the way the Great Depression did our fathers ’ and grandfathers ’ . ”
For the first year of the current crisis , which began in the summer of 2007 , there was hope that a replacement for U.S. consumers and a new source of economic strength had been found in the rest of the world ’s economies , especially such giant and newly industrializing nations as China and India .
Economists pored over figures suggesting these economies were continuing to boom even as the U.S. tottered on the financial brink .
There was much talk about other countries having “ decoupled ” from America and begun their own , internally fueled expansions .
But by last fall , the hope had faded .
The economies of most of the world are either slowing sharply or actually shrinking .
Asian powerhouses such as China are doing so because of a bust in exports to the U.S .
Advertisement
Worse yet , much of the Asian boom appears to have sprung from a sort of financial engineering that served as a matched set to that in the U.S.
By keeping their currencies undervalued , they kept export prices low and encouraged others -- especially Americans -- to keep buying .
China and other Asian economies “ were driven by export bubbles , which , in turn , were a play on the U.S. consumption bubble , ” Roach said .
With the bubbles on both sides now burst , the U.S. and Asia are dragging each other down , he said .
If renewed consumption is n’t going to revive the U.S. economy , and a growing world able to buy more U.S. exports has vanished , one of the few options for recovery that ’s left is business investment .
But investment , especially in high technology , was barely growing even during the boom years of this decade .
With the economic crisis , it has plunged .
Advertisement
Lonski , the Moody ’s economist , used government statistics to examine business investment in such high - tech items as computer and telecommunications equipment .
What he found was that in most previous cycles , companies quickly resumed investing after the economy moved from bust to boom , pushing computer and telecom orders back above their pre-bust highs .
But not in this decade .
Between the last recession in 2001 and the current one , high - tech investment has barely crawled upward .
That has left telecom and computer orders still down nearly 50 % from their previous highs .
“ This shows that technological progress was lagging ” during the decade ’s good years , Lonski said .
It seems unlikely the pattern should improve now that times are bad .
Advertisement
That leaves only government to power the renewed growth .
Every Economics 1 textbook introduces the economy with the same simple equation .
It reads : consumption + investment + net exports + government spending = gross domestic product or output .
It ’s an equation that the new president and his top economic aides know well .
With the first three elements negative or contracting quickly , the new administration sees few alternatives but to sharply expand the fourth factor -- government spending .
It ’s not a surefire solution .
But the hope is that something eventually catches and the nation ’s economic engine begins turning over again on its own .

A Pakistani seventh grade schoolgirl is writing a diary after Taleban militants in the troubled north - western Swat district ordered schools to close as part of an edict banning girls ' education .
Militants seek to impose their austere interpretation of Sharia law and have destroyed about 150 schools in the last year .
News of further attacks and a Taleban invitation to public floggings appears in the latest extracts of the diary , which first appeared on BBC Urdu online .
THURSDAY 22 JANUARY : VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION
I am quite bored sitting at home following the closures of schools .
Some of my friends have left Swat because the situation here is very dangerous .
I do not leave home .
At night Maulana Shah Dauran ( the Taleban cleric who announced the ban on girls attending school ) once again warned females not to leave home .
The Taleban routinely carry out public floggings in Swat He also warned that they would blow up those schools which are used by the security forces as security posts .
Father told us that security forces have arrived at the boys ' and girls ' school in Haji Baba area .
May
God keep them safe .
Maulana Shah Dauran also said in his speech on FM radio that three ' thieves ' will be lashed tomorrow and whoever wants to see can come and watch .
I am surprised that when we have suffered so much , why people still go and watch such things ?
Why also does n't the army stop them from carrying out such acts ?
I have seen wherever the army is there is usually a Taleban member nearby , but where there is a Taleban member the army will always not go .
MONDAY 19 JANUARY : ARMY IN THEIR BUNKERS
Five more schools have been destroyed , one of them was near my house .
I am quite surprised , because these schools were closed so why did they also need to be destroyed ?
No one has gone to school following the deadline given by the Taleban .
The authorities are accused of doing little to protect schools Today I went to my friend 's house and she told me that a few days back someone killed Maulana Shah Dauran 's uncle ; she said that it may be that the Taleban destroyed the schools in anger at this .
She also said that no one has made the Taleban suffer but when they are hurt they take it out on our schools .
But the army is not doing anything about it .
They are sitting in their bunkers on top of the hills .
They slaughter goats and eat with pleasure .
FRIDAY 18 JANUARY : NO POLICE IN SIGHT
My father told us that the government would protect our schools .
The prime minister has also raised this issue .
I was quite happy initially , but now I know but this will not solve our problem .
Here in Swat we hear everyday that so many soldiers were killed and so many were kidnapped at such and such place .
But the police are nowhere to be seen .
Our parents are also very scared .
They told us they would not send us to school until or unless the Taleban themselves announce on the FM channel that girls can go to school .
The army is also responsible for the disruption in our education .
Today a boy from our locality went to school and he was told by the principal to go back home because a curfew was to be imposed soon .
But when he reached home he came to know that there was no curfew , instead his school was closed down because the army was to move through the road near his school .

Kissinger : Obama's ' task ' is to help create a ' new world order '
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday January 6 , 2009
Print This Email This President Nixon 's Secretary of State , the aging Henry Kissinger , recently told CNBC that he believes the current world economic crisis is a " great opportunity " for President - elect Obama to help create a " new world order . "
" What do you think the most important thing is for Barack Obama ? "
Kissinger was asked . " ...
If you had to say , this is going to be the country , or the conflict , or the place that will define the Obama administration , what would it be ? "
Kissinger replied : " The President - elect is coming into office at a moment when there are upheavals in many part of the world simultaneously .
You have India - Pakistan .
You have , ah , a jihadist movement . "
" But , " continued Kissinger , " he can give new imputus to American foreign policy , partly because the ascension of him is so extraordinary and admirable .
" I think that his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period , when really a " New World Order " can be created .
It 's a great opportunity .
It is n't such a crisis . "
In response to a parting question , Kissinger added that Obama 's cabinet is an " extraordinarily able group of people . "
" The phrase ' new world order ' traces back at least as far as 1940 , when author H.G. Wells used it as the title of a book about a socialist , unified , one - world government , " writes Drew Zahn .
" The phrase has also been linked to American presidents , including Woodrow Wilson , whose work on establishing the League of Nations pioneered the concept of international government bodies , and to the first President Bush , who used the phrase in a 1989 speech . "
In that 1989 speech , the elder Bush told Congress , " A new partnership of nations has begun , and we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment .
Out of these troubled times , our fifth objective  a new world order  can emerge :
A new era in which the nations of the world , east and west , north and south , can prosper and live in harmony . "
It is a quote echoed across the Internet by those who believe a non-elected governing body is forming at the very top of the world 's elite , and spreading .
Kissinger previously spoke at some length about this " new world order " during an interview with Charlie Rose .
" I think that when the new administration assess the position in which it finds itself it will see a huge crisis and terrible problems , but I can see that it could see a glimmer in which it could construct an international system out of it , " Kissinger told Rose in a Dec. 2008 conversation .
" The jihadist crisis is bringing it home to everybody , that international affairs cannot be conducted entirely by drawing borders and defining international politics by who crosses what borders with organized military force , " he said .
" This has now been reinforced by the financial crisis , which totally unexpectedly has spread around the world .
It limits the resources that each country has for a foreign policy geared to an assertion of its own pure interests . "
Kissinger publicly supported McCain for President in 2008 .
The following video was aired on CNBC on Jan. 5 , 2009 .
Set your alarm
Set the alarm for the morning of Thanksgiving so you can wake up and put the bird in and go back to sleep .
Grab those giblets
Make sure to take the giblets out of the turkey before it goes into the oven .
Cook in advance
Make as many of the sides before so all you have to do is ether warm them up if they are pre-cooked or bake them if not pre-cooked .
Everything does not have to be made from scratch
Store bought pies and dinner rolls are sometimes just as good Another alternative is purchasing pre-made sides from the grocery store many are as good as homemade .
Do n’t hesitate to ask for help
Have family and friends all make a dish similar to a “ Pot Luck ”
Make it a FriendsGiving
Invite friends that do n’t have family in the area .
If you have relatives coming they will be on their best behavior and it reduces stress .
Do n’t feel guilty about your guest list
Do n’t feel obligated to invite family .
Decorate in advance
Pre -set the table 1 - 2 days in advance and put serving dishes out so all you have to do is put the food on and fill the glasses .
Stock up early November
Purchase everything 2 weeks before .
Items will be less expensive , less lines and you know the items will be in stock .
Scrap tradition this year
Do n’t feel obligated to cook .
All the grocery stores have Thanksgiving dinners you can order in advance .
Job it out
Do n’t do what you do n’t like to do .
If you do n’t like to do dishes order them from Party Plus and they will drop them off and pick them up and you do n’t have to do the dishes .
Pace yourself
If you have to go to multiple Thanksgiving dinners eat the entrée at one , veggies at the other and desserts at the last one .
Enjoy and let this day be guilt - free
Relax and have fun .
Do n’t feel bad saying NO or asking people to help .
After a .. , this is a celebration !
Host a Thanksgiving potluck
Another idea is have everyone bring a favorite Thanksgiving dish and you provide the turkey .
You provide the turkey or ham and ask friends to bring desserts and wine .
I do this every year and my friends bring their own specialties .[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row ][/et_pb_section ]
Venezuela 's government is expelling the Israeli ambassador and all embassy personnel in response to Israel 's military offensive in the Gaza Strip .
The OPEC nation 's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that Israel 's campaign constituted " flagrant violations of International Law " and the use of " state terrorism . "
Faulty Labeling ?
Turkey holds suspicious Iran- Venezuela shipment Associated Press Turkish customs discovers lab equipment capable of producing explosives in shipment of 22 containers labeled ' tractor parts ' traveling from Iran to Venezuela Turkey holds suspicious Iran - Venezuela shipment
" For the reasons mentioned above , the government of Venezuela has decided to expel the ambassador of Israel and part of the personnel of the Embassy of Israel , " the statement said .
The Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned Venezuela following its decision .
" Israel will continue to defend itself before its enemies including Hamas and Iran , with which Venezuela has created strong ties , " a ministry statement said .
" Venezuela needs to choose which side it is taking in this war .
It must choose between those who fight terror and those who support it .
It 's not surprising that Venezuela is once more clarifying to the world which side it is on . "
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has condemned the Israeli campaign in Gaza , where more than 600 Palestinians have been killed in ground and air strikes .
Chavez on Tuesday called Israel 's offensive a Palestinian " holocaust " and said the presidents of Israel and the United States should be tried in international court .
" The Holocaust , that is what is happening right now in Gaza , " Chavez said in televised comments .
" The president of Israel at this moment should be taken to the International Criminal Court together with the president of the United States . "
The socialist Chavez , a harsh critic of Israel and the US , on Monday had accused Washington of poisoning the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to destabilize the Middle East and justify US - backed Israeli incursions .
In 2006 , Chavez threatened to break ties with Israel over its military campaign in Lebanon in a war of words that led both nations to withdraw their envoys .
Chavez , a frequent critic of the US and its allies , said Venezuela also is trying to supply food and medical aid to Gaza .
The issue of falling or rising prices is one of the subjects when most confusion exists .
On the one hand politicians regularly denounces " price gouging " , which is to say when they claim that companies keep prices too high , and that prices should be cut .
In other contexts they depict price deflation as the worst possible calamity , a point where to quote one well - known Keynesian Telegraph columnist , we should " abandon all hope " ( alluring to Dante 's depiction of hell ) .
The reality is that falling prices is good for buyers , but bad for sellers .
We all benefit when we have to pay less , but suffer when we are paid less .
Whether or not particular or general price declines are good or bad for the overall economy is a somewhat complex issue which depends on exactly why and how prices are falling , an issue which I will not elaborate upon in this post ( I have however discussed this issue before , for example here here and here ) .
But the point in this context is that falling prices will produce both winners and losers - as will rising prices .
Note that this is not just true for consumer prices , it is just as true for asset prices .
While people planning to sell their houses and stocks suffer from falling stock - and house prices , people who are planning to buy houses and stocks benefit from it .
People who buy a home will have lower housing costs if they are able to buy their house cheaper .
People who buy stocks will get the more dividends and other forms of positive future cash flow for any given investment if they are able to but stocks cheaper .
Yet the benefits of lower asset prices are even more rarely recognized than the benefits of lower prices of goods and services .
When stock prices for example fall it is almost always referenced as " destruction of wealth " , even though it should more appropriately be discussed as " redistribution of wealth " .
Even when it reflects deteriorating fundamentals ( falling profits ) due to malinvestments it is a symptom of " destruction of wealth " rather than being a form of wealth destruction in itself .
One exception to this to ignore the benefits of lower stock prices is this post from Dean Baker .
Yet he focuses mainly on the benefits to people who do n't trade in stocks , rather than the benefits to future stock buyers , which is somewhat misleading since not everyone eho abstains from buying or selling stocks benefits from lower stock prices .
If current stock holders usually use their paper wealth to buy certain things , then this will lower the price of those goods , hurting the sellers of those goods while benefiting other buyers of those goods .
Assuming for example that champagne are bought disproportionably by current stock holders , then falling stock prices will likely force champagne producers to lower their prices and so reduce their real income .
But other buyers of champagne will see their real income rise as they pay less for their champagne .
In short , lower stock prices will hurt current stock owners , or more strictly future net sellers of stocks , as well as the people who disproportionably sell to these future net sellers of stocks .
But future stock buyers , as well as other buyers of the things disproportionably sold by the future net sellers of stocks , will benefit from lower stock prices .
Deathbed Confession : Woman Admits To 1967 Murders
, 60 , died on January 19 , 2009 , two months after confessing to police that she killed two women on April 11 , 1967 .
She reportedly turned a gun on the pair because they had been harassing her about being a lesbian .
The slayings took place in a Staunton , Virginia ice cream store .
The victims were Constance Smootz Hevener , 19 , and her 20 year old sister - in - law Carolyn Hevener Perry .
According to Smith , the three women worked together at High 's Ice Cream .
On the night of the murders , Smith went to her workplace with a . 25 - caliber automatic handgun .
She intended to tell the women that she would n't be at work the next day but instead got into a physical altercation with one of the women and ultimately killed them both .
A suspect , William Thomas Jr. , 24 , did stand trial for one the murders but was acquitted , leaving the case an unsolved mystery for 41 years .
The investigation was jump started on September 10 , 2008 after a Crimestoppers tip .
A co-worker of the three women , Joyce Crawford , came forward indicating that 18 year old Smith had opened her glove compartment and showed her a handgun and remarked that it had a bullet in it for one of her co-workers .
This conversation took place several days before the murders .
Smith , suffering from kidney and heart disease and interviewed at a terminal care center , confessed to police on November 28 and was arrested on December 12 , 2008 .
During a police interrogation , Smith said she gave the gun to police detective Davie L. Bocock , who she said was a friend and had taught her how to shoot .
He told her he would bury the weapon .
Crawford reportedly went to Bocock with her suspicions after the murders but the detective brushed her off by saying Smith 's gun had been cleared in the case .
Bocock died in 2006 and it is unclear just how involved he was in the crime Smith had committed or the apparent cover up .
The detective held on to the weapon for 14 years and then gave it to another police officer in 1981 .
That officer is also deceased but his widow Kathy Myers , circulation manager at the Staunton News - Leader , read news reports of Smith 's recent murder confession and realized that the gun in question was among her husband 's personal effects .
She has since turned it over to authorities who say it matches the description of the weapon that Smith reportedly used in the murders .
Staunton Police Chief Jim Williams indicates Smith 's December hearing was canceled because of the dire condition of her health .
Following her death , he now considers the murder investigation closed but his department will continue to look into recently leveled allegations that suggest Bocock may have been a ' dirty cop ' .

As if the Tribune Company did not have enough problems .
A day after the newspaper and television chain filed for bankruptcy protection , federal law enforcement officials said Tuesday that the governor of Illinois , Rod R. Blagojevich , had been illegally threatening to withhold the state ’s help in a business deal unless the company ’s flagship , The Chicago Tribune , fired editorial writers who had criticized the governor and called for his impeachment .
The writers were not fired , and the editorial page continued to confront the governor .
Editors for The Chicago Tribune said Tuesday that they were not aware of any pressure from the governor ’s office and the company said it did not do the governor ’s bidding .
“ I first heard it this morning , ” said R. Bruce Dold , the editorial page editor .
“ I had no inkling at all .
We had no idea that he was allegedly bringing this kind of pressure .
It was pretty shocking to wake up and hear the governor is gunning for you . ”
But conversations recorded by federal investigators , and excerpted in a criminal complaint filed Tuesday by the United States attorney ’s office for the Northern District of Illinois , suggest that for a few weeks Mr. Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris , believed that the company would give in .
AMD CO FOUNDER , Ed Turney , has died of brain cancer at his old age home in Cupertino , aged 79 .
Turney , one of seven AMD founders , was born in Brooklyn , New York in 1929 .
After a stint in the US Navy during the Korean War as an electronics technician , Turney turned his hand to chips in 1963 , becoming a salesman for Fairchild Semiconductor .
He left Fairchild and in May 1969 , along with seven other ex Fairchild execs , founded Sunnyvale - based AMD .
One of his first roles at the firm included buying up equipment and overseeing the construction of the firm ’s first chip fab .
Turney was also instrumental in setting up AMD ’s sales organization and laying out a network of electronics distributors .
He left AMD in 1974 , opting to do some work for smaller semiconductor firms , where he mainly acted in the capacity of a consultant to start - ups , helping them pull in funding .
According to a statement by his brother , George Turney , Ed will be buried tomorrow in Los Altos , CA , next to his mother .

Seattle Police Shoot , Kill Man In Nazi Uniform
Two Seattle Police officers are on paid administrative leave after an early morning shooting in Ravenna .
Police were called to the 5200 block of 17th ave NE around 2 am after neighbors reported two men firing off weapons .
When officers arrived at the scene , a man approached them wearing a Nazi uniform and carrying a rifle and bayonet .
The man pointed the gun at police and two officers opened fire .
The man died at Harborview several hours later .
Police say they found a large collection of Nazi regalia inside the man 's home .
Apple will , in fact , launch an updated Mac mini model at next month 's Macworld Expo in San Francisco , according to a source speaking to Wired .
This rumor comes hot on the heels of recently - revived rumors of an iPhone nano announcement ; however , the Mac mini is long overdue for a refresh .
Apple product cycles typically average around 200 to 300 days for most products .
But the Mac mini , last updated in August 2007 , has n't been updated for 497 days as of this writing .
Though European resellers were told to not expect any further stock of the current model back in October ( leading to rumors that it might be EOL'd ) , one concerned customer got a phone call from Apple telling him to " be patient " about Mac mini .
Apple announced a revised line of notebooks in October , giving us some indication of what we might expect from the new Mac mini .
Based on those machines , we would expect the updated Mac mini to take advantage of Apple 's new manufacturing techniques , perhaps carving some or all of the casing from billet aluminum .
We would also expect to see easier access for RAM and perhaps even hard drive upgrades .
Count on the latest iterations of Intel 's 45nm processors paired with the NVIDIA 9400 M chipset to deliver vastly improved graphics , a Mini Display Port , and possible loss of FireWire 400 ; but do n't count on seeing a Blu-ray optical drive .
Given that Snow Leopard is expected to ship within the next six months ( or perhaps sooner ) , Apple will likely update its other hardware platforms to take advantage of OpenCL and Grand Central .
The iMac and Mac Pro line are due for updates as well , and Apple 's other Cinema Displays could see an LED makeover .
Macworld Expo 2009 is just three weeks away , so whatever Apple has up its sleeve will be revealed then .
She lives with her parents in a 1,550 - square - foot home in Whittier , where television trucks and camera crew continued to roam the quiet cul - de- sac Friday .
This afternoon , the children 's grandfather returned to the home with four toddlers and did not speak to the throng of media , other than to ask for privacy .
The 33 - year - old Whittier woman , who has not been publicly identified , gave birth to the octuplets at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Bellflower on Monday and already has six young children , including a set of twins , said her mother , Angela Suleman .
The family of octuplets born in Southern California this week has a history of financial problems , including a bankruptcy , tax liens and a foreclosure , according to court records .
Last March , Suleman filed bankruptcy , claiming nearly $ 1 million in liabilities — mostly because of a bad house investment , her attorney said .
Countrywide Home Loans approved a $ 492,000 mortgage for Suleman in 2006 for a second home she bought in Whittier for $ 615,000 .
In 2008 , the bank began foreclosure procedures .
The house was sold in August for $ 369,375 .
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Thursday , Suleman said her daughter did not expect to have octuplets , but that all the implanted embryos " happened to take . "
She acknowledge that supporting a family with 14 children would be difficult , but that her daughter felt like she had little choice .
" What do you suggest she should have done ? " Suleman said .
" She refused to have them killed . "
To help support the family , the woman 's father works in Iraq as a contractor , where he earns at least $ 100,000 annually .
Fertility experts , including the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , have raised concerns about the number of embryos implanted and whether it was within medical guidelines .
" I can not see circumstances where any reasonable physician would transfer eight embryos into a woman under the age of 35 under any circumstance , " said Arthur Wisot , a fertility doctor in Redondo Beach .
" I cannot imagine that any of the mainstream practices in the Los Angeles area were involved in this .
I would guess — and it's a pure guess — that she either went out of the country or went to a practice that flies below the radar . "
The California Medical Board , which investigates doctors , and the California Department of Public Health Services , which licenses clinics and hospitals , said no doctors or facilities are currently being investigated regarding the births .
A spokesman for the state health agency said there is no indication the implantations occurred at a facility they license .

Yes , it ’s absolutely true , just one powerful , persuasive headline can make you a fortune .
Before I explain , I want to tell you a story about Granny and her cake .
Granny used to bake such delicious cakes when I was a kid , heck even until a few years ago they would get demolished quicker than an all you can eat buffet once the Klumps arrived .
Yep , Granny ’s cake usually won first prize at the annual cake fair , the old girl could cook .
Last weekend , I went to visit Granny , she put on a pot of tea and sliced up the cake she had baked earlier in the morning , knowing her favorite grandson was coming over .
I sat down , poured a cup of tea and grabbed a slice of cake and took a huge bite , as my taste buds began to kick in , I had a sudden urge to barf , seriously this was n’t what granny used to bake .
This cake tasted like crap .
I think eating the doggy truffle from ‘ American Pie – The Wedding ’ would have tasted better .
My mouth was full of cake , Granny ’s sitting across from me and all I wanted to do was spit the cake out .
As a chewed , trying to seem as though the cake was scrumptious , the inside of my mouth was doing all but a gag reflex .
Quick thinking , I knocked my cake plate onto the floor , reached down and picked it up , as I did , I spat out the disgusting cake in my mouth and covered it with the cake I had scooped up then headed for the trash can .
Granny asked me if I wanted another slice , saying – “ I know how much you love my cakes ” .
Not wanting to hurt her feelings , I said no and that I really was trying to lose a few pounds .
I said to granny , this cake tasted a little different from what she used to bake and asked if she had added any new ingredients .
Now , her memory is n’t what it used to be and she said , no , she did n’t and that she does n’t use a recipe book , she goes from her memory , after all she ’s been baking that one for 50 years .
Clearly , Granny forgot a key ingredient to cause her cake to taste like crap , causing me to almost heave on the spot .
YOUR HEADLINES ARE LIKE BAKING A CAKE :
Let ’s face it , when you bake a cake and if you leave out the key ingredient , like my granny did , it ’s going to taste like crap when you eat it !
If you leave out the key ingredients in your sales message , it ’s going to be crap as well .
When the headline of YOUR advertisement or Sales Message is poor , the best copywriter in the world ca n’t write copy to sell your products or services .
Reading through some rare advertising by Clyde Bedell – I discovered his great headline ingredient .
When you consider 5 times as many people will read your headline , your email subject line or blog post title , it is critical you understand your headline , is simply an advertisement for your advertisement , sale message , email , blog post or social media submission .
Did I invent the above statistics ?
NO .
Here ’s where it comes from .
“ On average five times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy .
It follows that unless your headline sells your product , you have wasted 90 percent of your money . ”
This is a direct quote from the David Ogilvy , world - famous founder of the ad agency Ogilvy & Mather and author of the best - seller “ Confessions of an Advertising Man . ”
When you fail to capture your reader ’s attention in those split seconds , you will be leaving money on the table and making your competitor ’s rich .
This applies to any social media sites you submit stories as well .
THE GREAT HEADLINE INGREDIENTS :
“ The eye of your prospects are ever flitting , flickering , serving as a selective switchboard . . . seeking with intensive discrimination because no one has time for all those ads ) for just the few to read which are pertinent and vital to the prospect .
YOUR art and YOUR headline must therefore be selective of the precisely right prospects , or they will never know you are seeking to interest them .
Your art and your headline should proclaim FAST , INSTANTLY what is of greatest interest in your proposition to your specific prospects OR , you wo n’t get past the switchboard . ”
Your sales messages will sell like crap when you leave out your key ingredient in your headline .
It ’s no different .
The one and only job of your headline , subject line in your emails or title for your blog articles and posts is to hook your readers and prospects into reading the next sentence .
Then . . . the job of the next sentence is to compel them to keep reading until they buy , subscribe or take the action you desire – PERIOD !
No exceptions .
No excuses .
ONE POWERFUL , PERSUASIVE HEADLINE CAN MAKE YOU A FORTUNE :
The world is full of products and services which fail badly , even though many of them are of an exceptional quality .
The major reason they fail is due to how it ’s advertised .
The difference between you having a failure with your product or services and a multi-million dollar success , depends on how well your sales copy is . . . which starts with your headline .
Without a persuasive and powerful headline , no matter how great your sales message is otherwise , your promotion is doomed for a dismal failure .
Absolutely !
I do n’t give a toss , how fantastic your body copy is .
Without a kick ass headline which hooks your prospects into your body copy like a gaff hook rips into a shark . . .
YOU do n’t stand a chance in hell .
At the risk of sounding like a broken record , as much as 90 % of your buyer ’s decision is made at your headline .
Powerful headlines are , in fact , a major reason why my personal friend and mentor , Ted Nicholas , The Godfather of Copywriting , has personally sold over 6 Billion Dollars worth of products and services online and offline .
When marketing your products and services , nothing comes close to meeting the heavy burden your
headline must carry .
Your headline must do a forklift load of “ heavy lifting . ”
No exceptions .
No excuses .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Societe Generale said on Thursday that the United States ’ economy looks likely to enter a depression and China ’s could implode .
In a highly bearish note , veteran cross asset strategist Albert Edwards said investors should now cut equity exposure after a turn - of - the - year rally and prepare for a rout .
He predicted that the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks could be set for a fall of around 40 percent from recent levels .
Edwards also raised the danger of a global trade war with China .
“ While economic data in developed economies increasingly reflects depression rather than a deep recession , the real surprise in 2009 may lie elsewhere , ” Edwards wrote .
“ It is becoming clear that the Chinese economy is imploding and this raises the possibility of regime change .
To prevent this , the authorities would likely devalue the yuan .
A subsequent trade war could see a re-run of the Great Depression . ”
Edwards has long been one of the most bearish analysts in London , first with Dresdner Kleinwort and then with SocGen .
But he called in October for clients to increase their exposure to equities , which he said were due a rebound .
“ We believe that the market is ( now ) set to quickly slide sharply toward our 500 target for the S&P , ” he said .
The S&P 500 .SPX stock index is currently at 842 , up about 14 percent since hitting a low in November .

My Take on Today 's Announcements
Before today 's event started , rumors abounded : an $ 800 value Mac was incoming .
Sure , it would make a boatload of sense to try and create an affordable portable in this economy .
But nobody was terribly surprised by today 's pricing announcements .
People joke about the PC / Mac exchange rate .
Heck , Microsoft 's PR machine made a crack yesterday about a " Mac Tax " -- paying a premium for the Apple name .
Here 's a breakdown .
Announced :
The white 13 - inch MacBook ( $ 999 ) comes with Intel Core 2 Duo , pokey Intel integrated graphics , 1GB RAM , and a 120 GB hard disk .
My two cents :
Is Apple offering anything new here besides cutting a few bucks off the price ?
If the company had crafted a real value machine , it might have been an interesting game - changer .
With all of the talk about how the Mac OS is more efficient than Windows Vista , surely Apple could could have cobbled together a mini-notebook capable of running a low - key Leopard ?
In this economy , I 'd wager that it would sell like hotcakes .
Apple hotcakes .
Announced :
The step - up MacBooks , starting at $ 1299 , ship with the nVidia GeForce 9400 M integrated GPU ( goodness ! ) and 2GB of RAM .
My two cents :
Are these step - up MacBooks better than what 's already out there ?
Hang on a sec .
Running a quick spec check on a 13 - inch notebook at the HP store , I find that you can assemble a dv3500t with 3GB of RAM and a250 GB hard disk for about $ 300 less than the MacBook costs .
Announced : The Air keeps the same basic pricing scheme as the first - generation models ( $ 1799 and $ 2499 ) , but beefs up the hard drive ( a 120 GB HDD or a 128 GB SSD ) and the nVidia GeForce 9400M GPU .
My 2 Cents :
What 's interesting to me about the Air announcement is that it puts this machine squarely in competition with Samsung 's recently announced NP - X360 - - which costs roughly the same amount .
The two dance spec - for - spec most of the way .
Apple has the nVdia edge , which could make it the winner , but Samsung offers more ports ( and HDMI ) .
Which is better ?
We 'll tell you after we test them both .
Announced : The 15 - inch MacBook Pro ( starting at $ 1999 ) is the real deal .
My 2 Cents :
Of all of the Apple announcements made today , this one is probably the likeliest to sway people to embrace the Mac side of The Force .
This is where you 'll see nVidia let you choose between two different GPUs on the same machine .
( CNN ) --
Is a woman 's virginity worth $ 3.8 million ?
That 's how much a 22 - year - old from San Diego , California , said she has been offered through an auction she announced in September .
Natalie Dylan , 22 , said she has put her virginity up for auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch .
The woman , who goes by " Natalie Dylan , " set up a private auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch , a legal brothel in Nevada .
The auction has given her lots of " business opportunities , " she said .
Her top bid comes from a 39 - year - old Australian , but she has no immediate plans to settle the auction , she said in a recent interview with CNN .
Some men may seek virgins because they want them as trophies , or desire purity .
But as to why men would bid so much money on virginity , she said she has no answer .
" I honestly do n't know what they see in it , " she said .
If you think Dylan 's auction amounts to prostitution , she completely agrees .
She also said she 's not breaking any laws -- after all , prostitution in Nevada is legal .
" I feel people should be pro-choice with their body , and I 'm not hurting anyone , " she said .
" It really comes down to a moral and religious argument , and this does n't go against my religion or my morals .
There 's no right or wrong to this . "
Watch for more on Dylan »
The idea that virginity has a high value harkens back to the days of early humans -- if a man has sex with a virgin woman , he knows for sure that her children will be his , anthropologists reason .
In early civilizations , women were also considered the property of men , said Laura Carpenter , assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee .
Through the 1950s in America , women were expected to remain virgins until marriage , Carpenter said .
But with the availability of the pill and the IUD in the 1960s , combined with youth counterculture and gay rights movements , it became more common for women to engage in premarital sex , she said .
Attitudes shifted toward the conservative side in the 1980s with the worldwide HIV / AIDS pandemic , which made the stakes much higher for choosing a sex partner , especially for men .
Abstinence - based education programs also took off around that time , with government support , she said .
Today , about 95 percent of Americans have sex before they 're 25 , Carpenter said .
But worldwide , virgin prostitutes can claim larger fees , certain cultures still attach larger dowries to virgin brides , and some women undergo reconstructive surgery to restore their hymens .
In looking at Dylan 's auction , " To some extent it 's not new .
The new part is the Internet , " Carpenter said .
Dylan is not the first to hold a public sale for her sexual innocence .
An Italian model reportedly had plans to sell her virginity for more than $ 1 million in September .
Dylan said she was inspired by a report of a Peruvian woman who put her virginity up for sale .
Some think Dylan 's auction may be indicative of a shift in the way society treats sexuality .
" In a world that is teeming with brand messages , with sponsorships everywhere , intimacy is really just the next thing to go , " said Jon Ray , a 24 - year - old marketing consultant in Austin , Texas , and author of the blog Who is Jon Ray ?
Brett Austin Vanderzee , a 19 - year - old student at Oklahoma Christian University who has pledged to stay a virgin until marriage , finds Dylan 's actions somewhat appalling , but not shocking .
" It 's kind of crazy , but I think it 's the general direction that society has been heading in for a while , " he said .
" We 're becoming more accepting of things that normally would have been considered unwise . "
Kiara Daines , a 17 - year - old from Detroit , Michigan , said she 's saving herself until marriage for personal and religious reasons .
Both Vanderzee and Daines said they have endured teasing from their peers because of their choice to remain abstinent .
Others say there 's just too much hype around virginity .
Martha Kempner , vice president for information and communications for the nonprofit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the U.S. , said telling a young woman to stay " pure " misses the point that sexuality will influence her long after she loses her virginity .
" By putting the emphasis there , [ on virginity ] , we 're actually devaluing the rest of women , the rest of her , and the rest of her sexuality for the rest of her life , " she said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Taking to your teens about sex
A recent study in the journal Pediatrics showed that religious teens who take virginity pledges are as likely to have sex before marriage as their religious peers , and less likely to use condoms or birth control when they become sexually active .
Many people say losing one 's virginity has different implications for men than women .
While young women see the act as a symbolic giving of themselves , young men are more prone to want to get it over with and brag about it .
Similarly , says Kempner , women are taught to keep themselves " pure " and help men exercise control , while there 's a " boys will be boys " attitude around men .
Do men really think that virginity is worth millions of dollars ?
Audacia Ray , a 28 - year - old former sex worker from New York and author of " Naked on the Internet : Hookups , Downloads and Cashing In on Internet Sexploration , " is skeptical .
She views Dylan 's auction as a publicity stunt and does n't anticipate she 'll " continue in the industry . "
The importance of a woman 's virginity may vary in different cultures , but generally there 's not the high value there used to be , Ray said .
" It begins to be viewed more as a burden over time -- a burden in that losing virginity is an event , so that it has to somehow mean something , which is part of the reason why people are all up in arms about Natalie , " she said .
How do Dylan 's friends and family feel ?
Dylan , who said she was raised in a conservative , non-Christian religious household , said although her mother does n't agree with her , she still loves her as a daughter .
Generally people have been supportive , Dylan said .
" I 've talked with my exes , some different guys , and they understand it 's just a business deal , and they know me , and they know I 'm not this promiscuous girl .
Honestly , even if I did n't do this , I 'd always be the girl who thinks prostitution is OK , " she said .
" I would always want to find a partner that can accept me for me . "

TWICE in the past week I have been confronted in debates with the question that Thomas Aquinas and others have used in a theological context : “ Why is there something rather than nothing ? ”
I do n’t want to dwell on whether this justifies the existence of God .
Rather , I ’d like to point out that physics has largely answered this question , at least if it is reframed as “ how ” rather than “ why ” .
A three - dimensional space can be geometrically open , closed or “ flat ” , and my scientific career was launched largely by a …
Two men are facing a total of 26 charges , including three counts of attempted murder , after a police officer was struck in the head by a shotgun pellet Saturday night .
Police were responding to a Beer Store robbery at 8 p.m. near Symington Ave. and Dupont St. when a fleeing suspect fired a shotgun , skinning the officer 's forehead .
" He 's pretty lucky , that 's for sure , " said Staff .
Sgt. Devin Kealey .
A shotgun was recovered near the scene , he said .
One man was caught hiding in a backyard on Campbell Ave. , while police scoured the area with a helicopter for the other man .
Investigators nabbed him just after 11 p.m. in the Eglinton Ave. W. and Keele St. area , about five kilometres north of the shooting .
Jeron Powell , 32 , faces 17 charges including attempted murder , armed robbery and possession of an illegal firearm .
He will stay in jail until his Feb. 11 court date .
Craig Buckle , 29 , is charged with armed robbery , possession of a loaded weapon and several other offences .
He is remanded in custody until Jan. 28 .
The injured officer was treated at St. Michael 's Hospital and released .
During the manhunt , an unoccupied cruiser on the tracks at Wallace Ave. was crunched by a VIA Rail train .
The car initially had its flashing lights on , but police say the cold apparently killed the battery .

Australian researchers have discovered that the tipping point for ocean acidification caused by human - induced CO2 emissions is much closer than first thought .
Scientists from the University of New South Wales ( UNSW ) and CSIRO looked at seasonal changes in pH and the concentration of an important chemical compound , carbonate , in the Southern Ocean .
The results , published in today 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , show that these seasonal changes will actually amplify the effects of human carbon dioxide emissions on ocean acidity , speeding up the process of ocean acidification by 30 years .
Dr Ben McNeil , senior research fellow at the UNSW 's Climate Change Research Centre , says the ocean is an enormous sink for CO2 , but unfortunately this comes at a cost .
" The ocean is a fantastic sponge for CO2 , but as it dissolves in the ocean it reduces the pH of the ocean , so the ocean becomes more acidic , " Dr McNeil said .
This acidification makes life especially hard for marine creatures such as pteropods - an important type of plankton found in the Southern Ocean - whose shells are made up largely of calcium carbonate .
Tipping point
Once the acidity of the Southern Ocean reaches a certain level , the shells of these and other calcareous marine creatures will start to dissolve .
" That 's a really bad point to get to , " Dr McNeil said .
" After that point , we can't go back unless we suck the CO2 out of the atmosphere . "
This so - called ' tipping point ' of acidification had been predicted to occur when atmospheric CO2 levels hit 550 parts per million , around the year 2060 .
However , the new research shows levels of the carbonate that these creatures need to build and maintain their shells drops naturally in winter , due to natural variations in factors such as ocean temperature , currents and mixing , and pH .
Dr McNeil says this means the tipping point is likely to be reached at far lower atmospheric CO2 levels - around 450 ppm , which also happens to be the target set by the IPCC for stabilisation of CO2 emissions .
" That 's the benchmark that a lot of climate scientists have said we want to reach , " he said , but this concentration is forecast to be reached around 2030 .
Dr McNeil says ocean acidification could lead to large - scale ecosystem changes , affecting not just plankton but other marine life including fish , whales and dolphins .
" They 're at the base of the food chain ... so right now we do n't really know the ramifications . "
He always gets up on the wrong side of the bed .
Hello there .
We 're starting to release the details of some of the things we 'll be showing off at Gizmodo gallery , and I think for our first , we 'll show off one of the most interesting and mysterious :
This Frog Design made Apple prototype which I cannot find many official details of .

There are photos of the concept floating around the net with a check writing program on the monochrome stylus touchscreen ( 1980s PayPal ! ) but neither Frog nor Apple can or will tell me anything about this curious machine other than it was worked on by Hartmut Esslinger , founder of Frog , and The Steve , as part of the Snow White design language applied to the IIc and original Mac .
It was unveiled by Esslinger 's son last year , who described the thought process going on between Jobs and his father as not only thinking about the drinking glass , but the very nature of thirst itself .
It will be at Gizmodo Gallery this December 4th - 7th , in NYC , along with another Apple Prototype which I will save for the exhibit itself .
I hope you can come .
Till then , if you know anything about this device and can give me some back story , I 'd love to hear it .

Barack Obama may ask for another multi-billion dollar tranche of taxpayer money to prop up the US banking system , after key lieutenants warned the current $ 700 bn bailout package may not be enough to fix the country 's spiralling financial problems .
The new president is already planning sweeping reforms for Wall Street to try to prevent a repeat of the chaos unleashed by the credit crisis , and will make a new push this week to gain momentum for an expanded economic stimulus package , which has run into scepticism from leading Republicans .
But with the words of Mr Obama 's sombre and sobering inaugural address still ringing in the public 's ears , Democrats have begun to prepare the ground for yet more expensive efforts to restore confidence and fill the financial black hole at the centre of the economy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Larry Summers , Mr Obama 's White House economics supremo , who is giving the president daily economic briefings in the same way he receives a morning intelligence briefing , said the controversial $ 700 bn Wall Street bailout pushed through in October is " a start " that may not be enough to restore the nation 's banks to health .
Speaking on NBC's Meet The Press , Mr Summers said : " What ultimately will be necessary is something that will play out over time . "
Also yesterday , Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , said she is open to additional government rescue money for banks and financial institutions , but she is demanding taxpayers get an ownership stake in return .
Congress gave approval earlier this month for the new administration to use the second half of the $ 700 bn fund .
The first half was used quickly to plug holes in many of the country 's biggest banks , which have been brought to the brink of insolvency by bad bets on risky mortgages .
Mr Summers said the administration plans to widen the use of the fund to ensure credit can start flowing again to homebuyers and small businesses but , behind the scenes , there is a battle raging about how far Mr Obama should go towards nationalising the troubled banks .
The use of bailout money by former president George Bush has been criticised as ineffective , since the banks have hoarded the cash rather than resumed lending to help the recession - hit economy .
Timothy Geithner , Mr Obama 's nomination for Treasury Secretary – whose appointment is being held up on Capitol Hill because of anger that he failed to pay the full amount of taxes owed in a previous job – will announce a new strategy for repairing the banking system after he is confirmed , Mr Summers said .
Mr Summers is head of the White House National Economic Council .
Obama aides are also promising quick efforts to regulate Wall Street and rein in the excesses that led to the seizure of the banking system .
These will include new rules governing hedge funds and action to prevent unscrupulous lending by mortgage brokers , much of which can be achieved through existing regulators but some of which will also require action by Congress .
Mr Obama prepared the nation in his inaugural address last Tuesday for tough choices and difficult times ahead , and Mr Summers yesterday warned the world 's largest economy would get worse before it gets better .
" The next few months are going to be very difficult , no question , and maybe longer than that , " he said .
In his weekly radio and YouTube address , Mr Obama set out new details of his proposed $ 825 m economic stimulus plan , which authorises government spending and tax cuts on an unprecedented scale to try to ease the effects of the worst recession since at least the 1980s .
Without it , he said , " we could lose a generation of potential , as more young Americans are forced to forgo college dreams or the chance to train for the jobs of the future . "
It is far from clear if Mr Obama can hold together his hopes of winning a bipartisan consensus on an economic recovery package .
John McCain , his defeated opponent for the presidency , said he could not support the current proposals .
And there were a few piquant exchanges in a closed - door meeting with Republican leaders at the weekend , when Mr Obama told them that they " ca n't just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done " , referring to the ultra - partisan right - wing talk radio host .
In one exchange , with a congressman who took issue with parts of the president 's platform , Mr Obama shot back , " I won " .
Republicans argue the stimulus bill is being loaded with spending programmes that have little do with helping the economy , and have picked out funding for family planning clinics as one example .
Democrats say such measures are designed to ease the financial burden on states .
Joe Biden , the vice - president , said he expected there would be further compromise with Congress , but said the administration is " trying to get money out the door as rapidly as possible " .
He argued Republican demands for tax cuts would not work quickly enough .
The newspaper is dead .
You can read all about it online , blog by blog , where the digital gloom over the death of an industry often veils , if thinly , a pallid glee .
The Newspaper Death Watch , a Web site , even has a column titled “ R.I.P . ”
Or , hold on , maybe the newspaper is n’t quite dead yet .
At its funeral , wild - eyed mourners spy signs of life .
The newspaper stirs !
Colonial newspapers , burdened by a new tax , floridly staged their demise .
Liberty , they warned , would perish with them .
Illustration by Ralph Steadman
The last time the American newspaper business got this gothic was 1765 , just after the first gothic novel , Horace Walpole ’s “ The Castle of Otranto , ” was published , in London , and , in an unrelated development , Parliament decided to levy on the colonies a new tax , requiring government - issued stamps on pages of printed paper — everything from indenture agreements to bills of credit to playing cards .
The tax hit printers hard , at a time when printers were also the editors of newspapers , and sometimes their chief writers , too .
The Stamp Act — the “ fatal Black - Act , ” one printer called it — was set to go into effect on November 1 , 1765 .
Beginning that day , printers were to affix stamps to their pages and to pay tax collectors a halfpenny for every half sheet — amounting , ordinarily , to a penny for every copy of every issue of every newspaper — and a two - shilling tax on every advertisement .
Printers insisted that they could not bear this cost .
It would spell the death of the newspaper .
On October 10 , 1765 , an Annapolis printer changed his newspaper ’s title to the Maryland Gazette , Expiring .
Its motto : “ In uncertain Hopes of a Resurrection to Life again . ”
Later that month , the printer of the Pennsylvania Journal replaced his newspaper ’s masthead with a death ’s - head and framed his front page with a thick black border in the shape of a gravestone .
“ Adieu , Adieu , ” the Journal whispered .
On October 31st , the New - Hampshire Gazette appeared with black mourning borders and , in a column on page 1 , lamented its own demise : “ I must Die ! ” The Connecticut Courant quoted the book of Samuel : “ Tell it not in Gath ! publish it not in Askalon ! ”
The newspaper is dead !
Or , then as now , not quite dead yet .
“ Before I make my Exit , ” the New - Hampshire Gazette told its readers , “ I will recount over some of the many good Deeds I have done , and how useful I have been , and still may be , provided my Life should be spar ’d ; or I might hereafter revive again . ”
The list of deeds ran to three columns .
Nothing good in the world had ever happened but that a printer set it in type .
“ Without this Art of communicating to the Public , how dull and melancholy must all the intelligent Part of Mankind appear ? ”
But , besides the settling over the land of a pall of dullness and melancholy , what else happens when a newspaper dies ?
In one allegory published during the Stamp Act crisis , a tearful LIBERTY cries to her dying brother , GAZETTE , “ Unless thou revivest quickly , I shall also perish with thee !
In our Lives we were not divided ; in our Deaths we shall not be separated ! ”
In the eighteenth century , the death of a newspaper signalled the death of liberty .
What it signals now is harder to know , especially because there ’s death , and then there ’s death .
If , one day , ink - and - print is dead and gone , newspapers will endure , wraiths of ether .
The newspaper did n’t stay dead in the age of the American Revolution , either .
Soon enough , it rose from its inky grave .
Two months after that first Annapolis paper expired , a New York newspaper reported a sighting : “ The APPARITION of the late Maryland Gazette , which is not Dead , but only Sleeping . ”
That ghost story — the fate of the undead newspaper in Revolutionary America — bears telling .
Maybe if we knew more about the founding hacks , we ’d have a better idea of what we will have lost when the last newspaper rolls off the presses .
If the newspaper , at least as a thing printed on paper and delivered to your door , has a doomsday , it may be coming soon .
Not so soon as weeks or months , but not so far off as decades , either .
The end , apparently , really is near .
That makes this a good time to ask : what was the beginning about ?
Newspapers date to the sixteenth century ; they started as newsletters and news books , sometimes printed , sometimes copied by hand , and sent from one place to another , carrying word of trade and politics .
The word “ newspaper ” did n’t enter the English language until the sixteen - sixties .
Venetians sold news for a coin called a gazzetta .
The Germans read Zeitungen ; the French nouvelles ; the English intelligencers .
The London Gazette began in 1665 .
Its news was mostly old , foreign , and unreliable .
Because early newspapers tended to take aim at people in power , they were sometimes called “ paper bullets . ”
Newspapers have long done battle with the church and the state while courting the market .
This game can get dangerous .
The first newspaper in the British American colonies , Publick Occurrences , printed in Boston in 1690 , was shut down after just one issue for reporting , among other things , that the king of France had cuckolded his own son .
Propping up power is , generally , a less dodgy proposition than defying it .
The Boston News - Letter , “ published by authority ” — endorsed by ecclesiastics — lasted from 1704 till 1776 .
In 1719 , two more Colonial papers began printing : the Boston Gazette and , out of Philadelphia , the American Weekly Mercury .
( Nearly every early American newspaper was issued weekly ; it took sixteen hours to set the type for a standard four - page paper . )
But James Franklin ’s New - England Courant , launched in 1721 , in Boston , marks the real birth of the American newspaper .
It was the first unlicensed paper in the colonies — published without authority — and , while it lasted , it was also , by far , the best .
The Courant contained political essays , opinion , satire , and some word of goings on .
Franklin was the first newspaperman in the world to report the results of a legislative vote count .
The Boston News - Letter contained , besides the shipping news , tiresome government pronouncements , letters from Europe , and whatever smattering of local news was bland enough to pass the censor .
Franklin had a different editorial policy : “ I hereby invite all Men , who have Leisure , Inclination and Ability , to speak their Minds with Freedom , Sense and Moderation , and their Pieces shall be welcome to a Place in my Paper . ”
Not long after Franklin started printing the Courant , he hired his little brother as an apprentice .
Decades later , when an aging Benjamin Franklin wrote his autobiography , he painted his brother James as a brute , in order to make his own Hogarthian story , the apprentice ’s progress , a metaphor for the colonists ’ growing irritation with parliamentary rule .
James ’s “ harsh and tyrannical Treatment , ” Franklin wrote , had served as “ a means of impressing me with that Aversion to arbitrary Power that has stuck to me thro ’ my whole Life . ” Franklin ran away .
He might have titled this chapter of his autobiography “ Wherein the Bridling Apprentice Pursues His Independence . ”
It is just the kind of story that clever people tell about their lives : meaningful , useful , and , quite possibly , not altogether true .
Whether or not James Franklin was a hard master , he was , as a printer , bold unto recklessness .
He set as his task the toppling of the Puritan theocracy , and nearly managed it .
A fuming Cotton Mather dubbed Franklin and his writers the Hell - Fire Club and called his newspaper “ A Wickedness never parallel ’d any where upon the Face of the Earth ! ” Undeterred — more likely , spurred on — Franklin printed , in the pages of his paper , essay after essay about the freedom of the press .
“ To anathematize a Printer for publishing the different Opinions of Men is as injudicious as it is wicked , ” the Courant argued .
For this , and much more — and especially for printing a profile of Mather , an “ Essay against Hypocrites ” — Franklin was thrown in jail , twice .
In 1723 , a legislative committee charged with investigating the Courant reported , “ The Tendency of the Said paper is to Mock Religion , & bring it into Contempt , That the Holy Scriptures are therein profanely abused , that the Reverend and faithful Ministers of the Gospell are injuriously Reflected on , His Majesties Government affronted , and the peace and good Order of his Majesties Subjects of this Province disturbed . ”
Authorities ordered Franklin to submit the Courant to review or stop printing it .
But no one said that someone else could n’t print it .
A notice in the next issue claimed that the paper was “ Printed and Sold by BENJAMIN FRANKLIN in Queen Street . ”
As Benjamin Franklin later fondly recalled , “ I had the Management of the Paper , and I made bold to give our Rulers some Rubs in it . ”
Giving their rulers some rubs was what eighteenth - century printers did best , as Marcus Daniel recounts in “ Scandal & Civility : Journalism and the Birth of American Democracy ” ( Oxford ; $ 28 ) .
Standards of journalistic objectivity date to the nineteenth century .
Before then , the whole point was to have a point of view .
“ The Business of Printing has chiefly to do with Men ’s Opinions , ” Benjamin Franklin wrote , in his “ Apology for Printers , ” in 1731 , after he started printing the Pennsylvania Gazette , in Philadelphia .
( Franklin proposed printing a one - size - fits - all “ Apology ” annually , to save himself the labor of apologizing every time he offended someone . )
Franklin ’s job , as he saw it , was n’t to find out facts .
It was to publish a sufficient range of opinion : “ Printers are educated in the Belief , that when Men differ in Opinion , both Sides ought equally to have the Advantage of being heard by the Publick ; and that when Truth and Error have fair Play , the former is always an overmatch for the latter . ”
Often , truth did out .
In 1735 , John Peter Zenger , the German - immigrant printer of the New - York Weekly Journal , was jailed for seditious libel for printing essays pointing out that New York ’s governor , William Cosby , was an avaricious scoundrel .
( Zenger did n’t write those essays ; he just printed them . )
Zenger ’s dazzling lawyer , Andrew Hamilton , managed to get the printer acquitted by arguing that what Zenger printed was true —
Cosby really was a blackguard — even though truth , before the Zenger case , had never been allowed as a defense against libel .
Boston ’s Benjamin Edes gave his rulers some rubs , too .
In 1755 , Edes , with his lacklustre partner , John Gill , took over the failing Boston Gazette .
The son of a Charlestown hatter , Edes was not a man of means .
He was once City Scavenger .
Two years after Edes started printing the Gazette , Boston ’s selectmen scolded him : “ you have printed Such Pamphlets & such things in your News Papers as reflect grossly upon the received religious principles of this People which is very Offensive . . . we therefore now Inform you if you go on printing things of this Nature you must Expect no more favours from Us . ”
Edes could have done with Franklin ’s handy - dandy “ Apology . ”
Instead , he was left to issue a vague and impossible promise that he would in the future “ publish nothing that shall give any uneasiness to any Persons whatever . ”
What would the point of that have been ?
Edes did n’t stop .
In the seventeen - sixties , his Boston Gazette , once the scourge of pious selectmen , became the organ of the patriot opposition .
John and Samuel Adams , James Otis , Jr. , Joseph Warren — Boston ’s self - styled Sons of Liberty — all wrote for Edes ’s paper ; Paul Revere engraved its masthead .
Edes wrote for the Gazette , too , though his prose flickered but dimly .
But Edes , like all his writers , knew how to sling mud , especially at royally appointed governors , British soldiers , and tax collectors .
Tory printers took to calling the Gazette the “ Weekly Dung Barge . ”
This charge was n’t entirely without foundation .
Early American newspapers tend to look like one long and uninterrupted invective , a ragged fleet of dung barges .
In a way , they were .
Plenty of that nose thumbing was mere gimmickry and gambolling .
Some of it was capricious , and much of it was just plain malicious .
But much of it was more .
All that invective , taken together , really does add up to a long and revolutionary argument against tyranny , against arbitrary authority — against , that is , the rule of men above law .
There were twenty - two newspapers in the thirteen colonies in 1764 , the year that Parliament passed the Sugar Act , a duty on certain imports , and warned colonists that a stamp tax would soon follow .
Very many colonists were already broke , peeved , and even grieving .
The gruesome French and Indian War had ended only after taking thousands of lives and leaving in its wake a crippling depression .
The imperial coffers were empty , too : the war had nearly doubled Britain ’s debt .
The reasoning of George Grenville , the new Prime Minister , was that the colonies cost us this war and the colonists should pay for it .
Hence the Stamp Act .
“ It will affect Printers more than anybody , ” Benjamin Franklin predicted from London , where he begged Parliament to reconsider .
The Stamp Act turned out to be Britain ’s worst mistake .
( “ The Grenville ministry ’s grossest blunder , ” Arthur Schlesinger , Sr. , called it . )
Printers , better than anybody , could fight back .
In the words of David Ramsay , a South Carolina delegate to the Continental Congress who wrote , in 1789 , the first American history of the Revolution , “ It was fortunate for the liberties of America , that newspapers were the subject of a heavy stamp duty .
Printers , when uninfluenced by government , have generally arranged themselves on the side of liberty , nor are they less remarkable for attention to the profits of their profession . ”
You do n’t mess with the men who work the presses .
After all , the motto “ Do n’t Tread on Me ” was made famous by a man who wanted his gravestone to read “ B. Franklin Printer . ”
In Boston , Benjamin Edes refused to buy stamps and , at John Adams ’s suggestion , changed the Gazette ’s motto to “ A free press maintains the majesty of the people . ”
When Massachusetts ’s royally appointed governor , Francis Bernard , who believed that Edes ’s paper “ swarmed with Libells of the most atrocious kind , ” threatened Edes and Gill with prosecution , Adams urged the printers on .
Do not , he told them , “ suffer yourselves to be wheedled out of your liberty by any pretences of politeness , delicacy , or decency .
These , as they are often used , are but three names for hypocrisy , chicanery , and cowardice . ”
On November 1 , 1765 , that Black Day , Bostonians staged a funeral for Liberty , beneath the Liberty Tree.
Edes ’s Gazette reported on similar funerals held all over the colonies .
Everywhere , the story ended the same way .
In Portsmouth , New Hampshire , a coffin was “ prepared and neatly ornamented , on the Lid of which was wrote LIBERTY , aged 145 , STAMP’D , computing from the Era of our Forefathers landing at Plymouth . ”
But then , lo , a reprieve , otherworldly !
The eulogy “ was hardly ended before the Corps was taken up , it having been perceived that some Remains of Life were left . ”
Liberty stirs !
In 1766 , Parliament , blindsided by the fervor of the Colonial opposition , repealed the Stamp Act. GAZETTE , like his sister , LIBERTY , woke from the dead .
But other taxes soon followed .
In 1768 , British soldiers landed in Boston to suppress the growing rebellion .
During the occupation , Edes helped prepare a daily “ Journal of the Times , ” featuring stories , most written by Samuel Adams and not all of them true , about atrocities committed by redcoats on the citizens , like the one about a woman who was raped by a soldier and who staggered across the Common , only to die beneath the Liberty Tree .
The syndicated “ Journal of the Times , ” printed in newspapers across the colonies , proved crucial to the resistance movement ( and has been credited with originating the political exposé as a journalistic form ) .
“ Working the political Engine ” is how John Adams described writing for Edes , after a night in 1769 spent “ Cooking up Paragraphs ” for “ the Next Days newspaper . ”
The following year , Edes , with the help of Samuel Adams and Paul Revere , turned the shooting by British soldiers of five rioting civilians into the “ Boston Massacre . ”
In 1773 , the men who dumped the tea in Boston Harbor apparently changed into their disguises in the Gazette ’s back room .
In 1774 , a British commander gave his troops a list of men— including John Hancock and Sam Adams — who , the minute war broke out , were to be shot on sight , and he added a postscript : “ N.B . Do n’t forget those trumpeters of sedition , the printers Edes and Gill . ”
By then , there were forty newspapers in the colonies .
War came , to Lexington and Concord , on April 19 , 1775 .
That night , in Boston — a city held by the British — Edes and Gill hastily dissolved their partnership .
Gill went into hiding .
Under cover of darkness , Edes , alone , carted his printing press and types to the Charles River , where he loaded them onto a boat moored at the bank , and rowed through the night to escape the siege .
In a nearby town , he set up a makeshift printing shop , and , within weeks , managed to resume printing the Gazette , on lumpy paper , with gunky ink .
In besieged Boston , British troops searched for Edes but , failing to find him , made do with his nineteen - year - old son .
Peter Edes spent months as a prisoner of war .
He watched from the window of his cell while a fellow - prisoner , a Boston painter , was beaten until , broken , he finally called out , “ God bless the King . ”
Peter Edes survived .
He became a printer .
The war ended .
It took some time to figure out what , in a republic , a newspaper was for .
Although Benjamin Edes kept printing his Gazette , he had lost his best writers .
Warren had died at the Battle of Bunker Hill .
Otis had gone mad .
John Adams had left Boston for good .
The political landscape had changed , too .
The Revolution was over ; now was the time to constitute the nation .
Former radicals had to find a way to build a stable government .
Edes , like many other poor tradesmen and long - suffering revolutionaries , was stuck in a moment that had passed .
He opposed the Constitution , which smacked , to him , of tyranny .
He railed against it but found himself an anti-Federalist in a Federalist city .
When the government of Massachusetts passed its own stamp tax , Edes argued against it , signing himself “ The Printer ’s Friend . ”
In 1796 , Edes ’s onetime friend John Adams defeated Thomas Jefferson and became President of the United States .
Adams ’s high - handed and controversial Administration led to an even more opinionated press , as Marcus Daniel relates in his shrewd study of the newspaper wars of the seventeen - nineties .
Printers , whether attacking Adams or , just as zealously , defending him , grew bolder and bolder .
“ Professions of impartiality I shall make none , ” the Federalist newspaperman William Cobbett wrote .
“ They are always useless , and are besides perfect nonsense . ”
The printer of the Connecticut Bee promised to report
Of turns of fortune , changes in the state , The fall of fav’rites , projects of the great , Of old mismanagements , taxations new , All neither wholly false , nor wholly true .
From 1790 to 1800 , Republican printers founded seventy - two new papers ( newspapers grew at four times the rate of the population ) , as Jeffrey Pasley reported in his 2001 study , “ The Tyranny of Printers : Newspaper Politics in the Early American Republic . ”
In Hallowell , Maine , Peter Edes began printing the Kennebec Gazette .
On page 1 of the first issue , he reprinted Alexander Hamilton ’s attack on Adams .
( Hamilton deemed Adams a man plagued by “ the unfortunate foibles of a vanity without bounds and a jealousy capable of discoloring every object . ” )
In Philadelphia , Benjamin Franklin Bache , Benjamin Franklin ’s grandson , and later William Duane , edited the Aurora , a newspaper as passionately devoted to the cause of unseating John Adams from the Presidency as James Franklin ’s Courant had been to tipping over Cotton Mather ’s pulpit .
In July of 1798 , Adams signed into law the Sedition Act , making defaming his Administration a federal crime .
Adams had come to consider printers a scourge : rubbing your rulers is all well and good , but not when the ruler is you .
Jefferson intended to run against Adams in the election of 1800 .
The Sedition Act was set to expire on March 3 , 1801 , the day before the new President would be inaugurated , leading many Americans to conclude that Adams simply wished to silence the opposition in order to insure his reëlection .
Twenty - five people were arrested for sedition , fifteen indicted , and ten convicted ; that ten included seven Republican journalists who , like the Edeses , supported Jefferson .
Duane , who had earlier suffered much the same fate in India and in Britain , went to jail .
Bache was spared trial only because he died of yellow fever before he could be brought to court .
Thomas Cooper , a Republican editor , was charged with attempting to bring Adams “ into contempt and disrepute and to excite against him the hatred of the good people of the United States . ”
When Cooper , who served as his own counsel , tried to prove that everything he said about Adams was true ( since only false statements defaming the government were , by the terms of the act , seditious ) , the court refused his request to subpoena the President , found the printer guilty , and sentenced him to six months in prison .

The news sent the company 's stock downward , and raised questions about whether Mr. Jobs had new health problems or some new products were not ready .
But another question is likely to persist after the debate dies down :
How well could Apple keep up the pace of new products without its iconic chief executive ?
Speculation ...
by Miguel de Icaza
Koushik Dutta got Mono running on the Android - based G1 phone .
He posted a video of the phone compiling " Hello World " ( he points out that it is slower due to Mono running from the SD card ) :
He also posted some performance and memory usage comparisons between Dalvik , Mono and Java / ARM .
Short story : Mono does great !
There are some caveats on running Mono on the G1 , see the comments on this post .
Still , these are encouraging news .
The " Obama is a Liberal Fascist Hitler " meme has been floating around since at least February , if not before .
And now that the election 's over and voters can't punish Republicans for spouting this kind of nonsense , it 's getting a fresh life .
F'r instance , there 's the Georgia Republican congressman who foresees young Brownshirts emerging from Obama 's proposal for a national civilian - service corps :
A Republican congressman from Georgia said Monday he fears that President - elect Obama will establish a Gestapo - like security force to impose a Marxist or fascist dictatorship .
" It may sound a bit crazy and off base , but the thing is , he 's the one who proposed this national security force , " Rep. Paul Broun said of Obama in an interview Monday with The Associated Press .
" I 'm just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may — may not , I hope not — but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism . "
Broun cited a July speech by Obama that has circulated on the Internet in which the then - Democratic presidential candidate called for a civilian force to take some of the national security burden off the military .
" That 's exactly what Hitler did in Nazi Germany and it's exactly what the Soviet Union did , " Broun said .
" When he 's proposing to have a national security force that 's answering to him , that is as strong as the U.S. military , he 's showing me signs of being Marxist . "
Sounds like someone 's been reading too much Jonah Goldberg .
Of course , Jonah 's adherents at sites like Red State and Gateway Pundit think Rep. Broun is on the right track .
Meanwhile , there 's also the Texas state education - board member who fears that Obama is secretly plotting with Muslim terrorists to destroy America :
State Board of Education member Cynthia Dunbar is n't backing down from her claim that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is plotting with terrorists to attack the U.S. The Texas Freedom Network , a watchdog group that monitors the board , released a public statement on Monday asking Dunbar to retract the statement .
" I do n't have anything in there that would be retractable , " said Dunbar , R - Richmond .
" Those are my personal opinions and I do n't think the language is questionable . "
In a column posted on the Christian Worldview Network Web site , Dunbar wrote that a terrorist attack on America during the first six months of an Obama administration " will be a planned effort by those with whom Obama truly sympathizes to take down the America that is threat to tyranny . "
She also suggests Obama would seek to expand his power by declaring martial law throughout the country .
Though Dunbar is defiant , the article seems to have been removed from the CWN site .
You can read the cached version here .
In a similar vein , we 're also hearing that Obama is the antichrist from the religious - right wingnuts .
This really is a double case of deja vu .
Not only did we hear this crap circulating around the right during the campaign this year , we heard almost exactly the same thing 16 years ago when Bill Clinton won the White House -- the supposed " looming dictatorship " and the nefarious conspiracies with dark forces .
That only produced eight years of " New World Order " conspiracy theories and their accompanying militias and right - wing domestic terrorists .
You 'll forgive us if we 're not very eager to see what this go - round produces .
An easy way to write XML in Python
David Mertz 's gnosis utilities include the module gnosis.xml.objectify , which makes parsing XML in python as simple as could be .
from gnosis .
xml import objectify gnosis.objectify xmltext = " " " < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
< root >< first canned =" true " yummy = " false " > spam</ first >< second>egg</second></root > " " " inst = objectify.make_instance( xmltext )
print " first : " , inst. first .
PCDATA
print " canned : " , inst.first.canned
print " yummy : " , inst.first.yummy
print " second : " , inst.second .
PCDATA
Output :
first : spam
canned : true
yummy : false
second : egg
I wanted a similarly simple way to write XML , so I wrote a little module named xmlwriter ( zip file ) to do it .
Usage :
from xmlwriter import XmlNode , xmlify
from StringIO import StringIO xmlwriterXmlNode , xmlify root = XmlNode ( u" root " ) first = root .
first
first.val = u" spam "
first [ " yummy " ] = u" false "
first [ " canned " ] = u" true " root.second.val = u" egg " out = StringIO ( )
xmlify ( root , out )
print out.getvalue ( )
Output :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
< root > < first canned = " true " yummy = " false " > spam </ first > < second > egg </second > </root >
It 's still pretty basic .
For example , you can't have sibling nodes with the same tag name .
But it 's a very simple way to do some down and dirty XML writing .
Here 's the xmlwriter module code .
Monad transformers
In denotational semantics and functional programming , the terms monad morphism , monad layering , monad constructor , and monad transformer have by now accumulated 20 years of twisted history .
The exchange between Eric Kidd and sigfpe about the probability monad prompted me to investigate this history .
Chapter 4 of Eugenio Moggi ’s ” An Abstract View of Programming Languages ” ( Edinburgh LFCS technical report ECS - LFCS - 90 - 113 , 1990 ) defines a monad morphism as you ’d expect in the category of monads : a natural transformation between two monads as functors that commutes with the two monads ’ unit ( return ) and bind ( >>= ) operations .
The two monads do n’t even need to be over the same category of types , but Haskell has only one category of types ( pace type classes ) , so Moggi focuses on the simplified case , where the functor U is an identity .
Further , Moggi cares only about strong monads , which Haskell programmers like Wadler call a monad for short .
Roughly , a strong monad respects the Cartesian structure ( in particular of environments ) of the category of types .
Moggi thus defines a simplified strong monad morphism , which relates two strong monads over the same category of types .
For short , Haskell programmers ( like me henceforth ) call it a monad morphism , of type forall a . m a -> n a where m and n are the two ( strong ) monads being related .
Moggi continues with “ some examples of monad constructions ” ( emphasis mine ) .
He defines “ several endofunctors on Obj ( Mon ( C ) ) ” , where Obj( Mon( C ) ) is a category with monads for objects but only trivial ( identity ) morphisms .
In other words , he defines several maps from monads to monads , including what Haskell calls ErrorT , StateT , ReaderT , WriterT , and ContT .
Endofunctors on Obj( Mon( C ) ) have very little structure .
One of them exchanges the Identity monad with the State Int monad while leaving all other monads alone .
You ca n’t even define this exchange as a Haskell type constructor of kind (*->*)->(*->*) .
Moggi thus considers several ways to add structure to a given endofunctor F on Obj ( Mon( C ) ) .
” Can F be extended to an endofunctor F over Mon( C ) ? ”
That is , does every monad morphism M → N yield a monad morphism FM → FN such that blah commutes ?
For the Haskell monad maps listed above , the answer is yes except for ContT .
” Is there a natural transformation from Id Mon( C ) to F ? ”
That is , does every monad M yield a monad morphism M → FM such that blah commutes ?
For the Haskell monad maps listed above , the answer is all yes .
Can we lift the operations ( such as changing the state or producing output ) of each monad M into FM ?
That is , as F adds new operations to a monad , can it preserve the old operations of the monad ?
The last question is crucial for Moggi ’s goal , to make denotational semantics modular .
Steele , Espinosa , and Liang , Hudak , and Jones turn Moggi ’s goal into a puzzle in functional programming , that of building a modular interpreter .
Liang et al. define a monad transformer as a monad - to - monad map that satisfies item 2 above , in other words , a natural transformation from Id Mon( C ) to an endofunctor on Obj ( Mon ( C ) ) .
The monad morphism M → FM in their definition is known as lift in Haskell ’s MonadTrans class .
Of items 1 and 3 above , the latter has received by far more attention in the literature .
After all , monads are useful only to the extent that they provide useful operations .
Filinski defines a layering of a monad N over another monad M as a function family M( NA ) → NA ( for each type A ) such that blah commutes .
In Haskell notation , a layering defines a polymorphic function
layer :: forall a. m ( n a ) -> n a
where m and n are the two monads .
Filinski explains that monad morphisms and monad layerings are equivalent :
lift = layer .
liftM return layer = join .
lift
Filinski then encodes layered monads in terms of delimited control .
Lüth and Ghani propose another approach to combining monads and their operations using coproducts .
So , that ’s what I know of the story of monad morphisms , layerings , constructors , and transformers in the literature .
Three asides .
First , Cartwright and Felleisen pursue modular denotational semantics with side effects but not ( directly ) monads .
Second , monads generalize to endofunctor - enriched categories or parameterized monads , a more general notion of computation .
" We have high hopes that it will have the same impact in the UK , " he said .
" Amazon are an excellent and well trusted retailer , this new store can only be good for UK music . "
This article talks about the rise of people working part - time , doing various ‘ gigs ’ :
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-01-12/the-gig-economy/full/
Perhaps her intended audience is not interested in “ dull ” things like economics , but even someone like me with just a smattering of reading in economics can’t help but think of Coase and his Theory of the Firm when reading it .
The question is : why do firms exist ?
Why is n’t the economy composed of a huge network of independent contractors ?
If markets and prices and such work so well , why do these big , monolithic companies , which internally , are not ‘ free markets ’ exist ?
His answer is , greatly simplified , “ transaction costs ” .
From the article :
Every time the boss turns around asking for a key member of staff to join today ’s frantically convened cost - cutting strategy meeting the reply comes back , “ It ’s not Sam ’s day to come in and he ’s the one working on it .
Julia can come , though . ” “ Julia ?
What she got to do with it ? ”
“ Yeah , well , we ’ll have to bring her up to speed . ”
In other words , while there is a savings from not having Sam present every day , there is also a cost associated with it , which includes having had to look for and interview Sam to do some work , and bargaining over a price for Sam ’s services , and then “ bring him up to speed ” .
You have to do those things with regular employees too , but you have to do them less often with people who stick around for years .
So if one wanted to look , in a less anecdotal way and slightly more scientific way , about whether the US , or other countries , are turning into “ gig economies ” , one could do worse than look at the transaction costs associated with utilizing contractors as opposed to permanent employees .
If those costs have fallen ( it may be easier to find people , thanks to the internet , for example ) , perhaps it is more efficient to have more contractors and fewer full time employees and so the equilibrium will tilt in that direction .
Of course , another explanation might simply be that the economy is bad , and companies do n’t have the budget to take on more people , so they get by with what they can in the short term .
In terms of the social costs and benefits to a “ gig economy ” … well , that discussion is best left for other sites , as it ’s a big , long , complex one with lots of politics and economics and eventually boils down to everyone ’s own view of how the society they live in ought to look , which is very much outside the scope of this journal .

Israel 's military has carried out 50 air strikes in Gaza overnight as its cabinet prepares to vote on a proposal for a unilateral ceasefire .
Palestinians say a tank shell hit a UN school in northern Gaza , killing at least two people sheltering there .
Israel says it is checking the report .
The head of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( Unrwa ) said he was " ashamed " civilians were not being protected .
Hamas said it would ignore any truce if its conditions were not met .
A spokesman for the militant group , Osama Abu Hemdan , told AFP news agency : " As long as it [ the Israeli military ] remains in Gaza , resistance and confrontation will continue . "
Egypt has been mediating between Israel and Hamas in a bid to secure a truce .
Ahead of the Israeli cabinet meeting , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops .
' Investigation ' Israeli warplanes renewed bombing raids on Gaza just before dawn on Saturday , with heavy explosions south of Gaza City .

Is this the end ?
BBC reporter reaches Rafah In pictures : Gaza conflict Voices from Gaza City
Send us your comments United Nations officials say two children , aged five and seven , were killed when Israeli tank fire hit a UN school where hundreds had taken shelter in the northern town of Beit Lahiya .
John Ging , the Unrwa chief in Gaza , told the BBC that there was " nowhere safe in Gaza " .
" I 'm ashamed of this - there 's international legal responsibility to protect civilians in conflict , and we 're not doing it , " Mr Ging said .
" We 're failing here , we 're failing and there has to be accountability for that failure . "
Mr Ging 's spokesman earlier said an investigation ought to be held to ascertain whether any war crimes had been committed in the incident .
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman , Yigal Palmor , told the BBC that Israel was waiting for more information on what happened .
" We do n't have an exact description of exactly when , where or what was fired and where the shells had struck , " he said .
Accurate details would be established once the fighting ended , he added .
This is not the first time the UN has talked about war crimes in Gaza .
Earlier this month , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said some Israeli actions reported in Gaza might warrant prosecutions for war crimes .
Rocket attacks Israel 's security cabinet will vote on Saturday evening on whether to declare a ceasefire , after its government said it thought " significant progress " had been made at talks with Egyptian mediators in Cairo .

Advertisement Under the Egyptian proposal , fighting would stop immediately for 10 days and Israeli forces would remain in Gaza while the border crossings into the territory would remain closed .
For its part , Egypt would , with international help , try to shut down weapons smuggling routes on its boundary with Gaza and discussions on opening the crossings would take place at a later date .
Hamas insists any ceasefire must involve Israeli troops withdrawing from Gaza and an immediate lifting of the Israeli blockade .
Hamas officials are expected to attend further talks on Saturday in Cairo .
Israel is still coming under rocket attack from militants in Gaza On Friday Palestinian militants in Gaza reportedly fired more than 15 rockets at southern Israel , leaving five Israelis wounded .
Israel 's main objective in Operation Cast Lead is to end Gaza militants ' ability to fire rockets at Israel and stop them smuggling through tunnels from Egypt.
US - Israel deal On Friday , Israel and the US signed a deal in Washington that calls for expanded intelligence co-operation between their two countries to prevent Hamas smuggling arms into Gaza if a ceasefire is implemented .
Under the agreement , the US will provide detection and surveillance equipment , as well as logistical help and training to Israel , Egypt and other nations for monitoring Gaza 's land and sea boundaries .

In the US capital , Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said Israel would have to suspend any ceasefire if Hamas continued to fire rockets .
The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza has told the BBC that 1,193 people have been killed , including 410 children and 108 women since the conflict began on 27 December .
There were 5,300 people wounded , including 1,600 children , the ministry said .
Thirteen Israelis , mostly soldiers , have been killed during the campaign .
On Friday night , the UN General Assembly in New York overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for an immediate and durable ceasefire in Gaza , leading to a full withdrawal of Israeli troops .
The BBC's Christian Fraser in southern Gaza says the situation for Palestinian families there is tough , with food and electricity supplies limited and no running water .
He says in the skies above can be heard the scream of F - 16 jets circling for their next targets .

Greenpeace Brazil has released a report at the World Social Forum in Belém showing that up to 80 percent of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is due to an increase in raising cattle for human consumption .
Brazil has quickly become the largest exporter of beef in the world , but they are not satisfied with their current market share and plan to increase production .
The plan flies in the face of their supposed commitment to tackle climate change .
The country is currently the fourth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , 75 % of which stem from deforestation .
The map of Brazil above shows the concentration of cattle , mostly focused on the Mato Grosso region in the southwest .
Greenpeace used a unique technique to prepare this and other maps in the report :
Our Amazon team used specialized techniques to analyze and compare satellite images of vegetation ( or lack thereof ) on the ground , and data showing the growth of infrastructure , such as roads and agribusiness .
It is the first time that these two types of data have been put together in this way .
Our maps in the report Amazon cattle footprint , clearly show how much former rainforest is now used for cattle pastures in Mato Grosso .
Unfortunately , similar as in the United States , the government fully backs the agriculture industry with many politicians firmly in the pockets of agribusiness .
They ’ve even recently proposed legislation to prevent environmental groups from setting up in the Amazon .
However , with the economy moving how it is , expansion is becoming less and less of an option .
What can you do ?
Try going vegetarian , or at least making sure the beef you ’re eating comes from cows raised near where you live .
More information about the environmental impact of meat :

Archbishop 's sermon to Brown on spending our way out of crisis
The Archbishop of Canterbury and Gordon Brown were at loggerheads last night over the morality of the Government 's plans for Britain to spend its way out of recession .
Dr Rowan Williams took the extraordinary step of suggesting that Labour 's high - spending solution to the economic crisis was like ' an addict returning to the drug ' .
The leader of the Anglican faith also encouraged people to ignore the Government 's encouragement to go shopping to save the economy .
Dr Rowan Williams said Labour 's high - spending solution to the economic crisis was like 'an addict returning to the drug '
But his intervention prompted Mr Brown , the son of a Scottish Presbyterian minister , to invoke scripture by insisting he would not ' walk on by ' when others were in difficulty .
The Prime Minister appeared to be likening himself to the Good Samaritan in the Bible parable and the Archbishop to the priest who ignored the plight of a robbery victim .
Dr Williams admitted that his assault on flagship Labour policy would be seen by some as ' suicidally silly ' .
It is virtually unheard of for a senior cleric to attack the Government so directly , or for a Prime Minister to challenge an Archbishop of Canterbury on how the Bible should be interpreted .
But Dr Williams insisted somebody had to speak out about the ' moral ' failings at the heart of Britain 's economic difficulties .
Asked about the Prime Minister 's economic rescue package , he said : ' I worry about that because it seems a little bit like the addict returning to the drug .
' What I 'm worried about is anything that pushes us straight back into the kind of spiral we were in before .
' It is about what is sustainable in the long term and if this is going to drive us back into the same spin , I do not think that is going to help us .
I hope people will understand that spending itself is about need before it is about serving the economy in the abstract . '
In response , Mr Brown said that as the son of a church minister he always listened to senior clerics , but added : ' Every time someone becomes unemployed or loses their home or a small business fails it is our duty to act and we should not walk by on the other side when people are facing problems .
' That 's the reason why our fiscal policy is designed to give real help to families and businesses and to give them that help now . '
In the Parable of the Good Samaritan , the Bible tells how a man on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho is attacked by robbers and left for dead .
It adds : ' And by chance there came down a certain priest that way ; and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side . '
Dr Williams 's intervention echoes the Conservative argument that Labour is storing up problems for future generations with its reliance on debt .
Yesterday official figures showed public borrowing soared to a record £ 16 billion in November .
Dr Williams added : ' When the Bible uses the word " repentance " , it does n't just mean beating your breast , it means getting a new perspective and that is perhaps what we are shrinking away from . '
Comedian Roseanne Barr has claimed on her blog that the Jewish soul is being tortured in Israel , and that Jewish people in that country will be destroyed because of recent attacks on Gaza .
Barr , who is Jewish , also described Israel as a “ Nazi ” state in her December 30 blog posting .
“ The destruction of the jews in Israel has been assured with this inhuman attack on civilians in gaza , ” Barr wrote .
“ Hamas is the street gangs — this is the equivalent to Los Angeles attacking and launching war on the people of watts to attempt to kill the bloods and the crips . ”
In a December 20 blog posting , Barr accused Israel of engaging in ethnic cleansing in Gaza .
Israel military officials have claimed that there is no humanitarian disaster in Gaza , and that the attacks were necessary because Hamas had been firing rockets into southern Israel for nearly seven years .
Vancouver critics of the Israeli government and military have accused Israel of committing war crimes after more than 400 deaths in Gaza and more than 1,000 injuries during a recent aerial - bombardment campaign .
On Saturday ( January 3 ) , there will be a protest at 1 p.m. at the Vancouver Art Gallery .
I like Al Franken .
Yes , he 's partisan , but I do n't think he 's a hack .
I do n't like Norm Coleman .
He is a hack .
But ... as I read it ... Coleman won the election so the Democrats stole the Senate seat for Franken .
voluntary Xchange reported two months ago that it was very unlikely for each of the 4 updates in the vote totals to break Franken 's way without some underlying systemic bias .
It 's gotten worse .
There are now 7 major decisions in the recount , and they have all broken for Franken .
After the recount , 25 precincts now show more votes than voter signatures .
This is double counting ... and surprise , surprise ... these votes break towards Franken .
In another case , a precinct has more votes than ballots .
This indicates the double - counting was done on election night .
These double - counted votes were not rejected ... and surprise , surprise ... they broke for Franken .
Of course , this precedent suggests that if you have more ballots than votes you ought to accept that double - counting too .
But wait !
If you do n't double - count those ( which was the final decision ) ... surprise , surprise ... the decision breaks for Franken .
Lastly , there 's the " 5th pile " of absentee ballots that were counted over the weekend .
These came about because :
... Counties were being asked to review the absentee ballots they rejected on November 4 and decide whether they want to change their minds [ about any of them ]
Most of these fall under the first example above : situations in which an election official signed a ballot which was not countersigned by a voter .
Basically , they 've permitted something that is a felony if you do it with a $ 2 personal check .
Franken swung from about 200 votes behind to 200 votes ahead after these ballots were counted over the weekend .
Franken will be certified as the winner later today .
Honor codes for academic dishonesty routinely point out that it is cheating to be aware of problems that you do not take part in but which you do not actively inform upon ( here 's an example )
So , Franken 's not a hack .
He 's a cheater .
Vertical Centering in CSS
Yuhu 's Definitive Solution with Unknown Height
Though there is a CSS property vertical - align , it does n't work like attribute valign in HTML tables .
CSS property vertical - align does n't seem to be able to solely solve this problem :
Definition of the problem
there is an area ( e.g. < div > ) with known height in the page
an internal object ( typically long text in < div > ) is inside the area and I do n't know its height ( e.g. because its content is dynamically generated from a database )
( e.g. because its content is dynamically generated from a database ) I want to center the object vertically within the area
within the area without using HTML tables .
No general solution was known until September 2004 .
I have found it going home on Wilson street .
Display an example of the vertical centering in your browser .
Update 2015 - flex
As new browsers support display : flex , it is much easier to vertical center an item with CSS than before .
< style >
#containter {
height : 400 px ;
display : flex ;
/* flex - direction : column ;*/
align - items : center ;
/* justify - content : center ;*/
}
#content {}
</ style >
< div id= " containter " >
< div id= " content " >
any text < br >
any height < br >
any content , for example generated from DB < br >
everything is vertically centered
</div >
</div >
See this example in browser .
Uncommenting justify - content : center or flex - direction : column you can get other types of centering ( horizontal , both ) .
For instance justify - content : center with align - items : center leads to centered content both vertically and horizontally .
The most important rule is display : flex .
This relatively new value switches the display of the containter to a special mode , enabling its direct descendant to use and align in all the space of the containter ( using special properties like align - items and others ) .
The container has set some width , i.e. width : 400 px just for purpose of this example .
There is no need to style the content element , but it must be direct descendant of the container .
Support of display : flex is very good in modern browsers .
Last not - supporting browsers are Internet Explorer 9 and 10 ( version 10 has a special syntax of flex ) .
If it is important for you to optimize for those and older browsers , you should read the rest of this page .
Original content from 2004 with updates :
The idea
The keystone of the solution for Internet Explorer 6 , 7 or quirk mode is this : the internal object is absolutely positioned in half of the area height .
Then is moved up by half of its height .
The wrong interpretation of the height property in older Internet Explorer is used as a feature here ( counted height is taken as a base of percentage height of nested tags ) .
One extra nested tag < div > is needed for those Explorers .
Solution for standard browsers like Mozilla , Opera , Safari etc. ( including IE 8 , 9 , 10 and younger ) is completely different .
Entire area ( top < div > ) is set to be displayed as a table ( display : table ; part of CSS2 ) .
The internal object is set as table - cell ( display : table - cell ) .
Now -- there is the key idea -- it is possible to use vertical - align property for such table - displayed element in standard browsers .
( Internet Exlorer 6 , 7 and quirk mode ignores those properties or does n't know their values . )
Then both syntax are merged .
I use the Pixy 's underscore hack , but with sign #.
A CSS property written with the char # on the start ( i.e. # position ) is visible for IE 7 and older .
Such written property is invisible for any other standard browser ( e.g. Explorer 6 or 7 interprets # position : absolute ; unlike other browsers ) .
This so called " underscore hack " seems to be valid , but if you do n't want to use it , you may use the more structured code below in my second example ( unfortunately , not working for IE 7 ) .
Other types of browsers and Internet Explorer 8 and younger do n't need to be hacked , as they support display : table - cell properly .
Compatibility
The code below works in Internet Explorer 5.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 beta , in Gecko browsers ( Mozilla , Firefox , Netscape 7 ) , in Opera 7 , 8 and up , every Chrome , Konqueror 3.3.1 .
( maybe lower too ) , and in Safari ( Win , iOS ) .
The page can be HTML , HTML5 or XHTML , standard or quirk mode .
The valid example does n't work in IE 7 standard mode ( update 2012 : about 3 % of clients ) .
If you find any easy workaround for IE 7 , please let me know .
Understandable code :
<!DOCTYPE HTML >
< html >
< head >
< title > Universal vertical center with CSS < / title >
< style >
. greenBorder {border : 1 px solid green ;} /* just borders to see it */
</ style >
</head >
< body >
< div class=" greenBorder " style= " display : table ; height : 400 px ; #position : relative ; overflow : hidden ; " >
< div style= " #position : absolute ; # top : 50 % ; display : table - cell ; vertical - align : middle ; " >
< div class=" greenBorder " style= " #position : relative ; #top : - 50 % " >
any text < br >
any height < br >
any content , for example generated from DB < br >
everything is vertically centered
</div >
</div >
</div >
</ body >
</html >
See this example in browser
Legend for colors :
CSS styles for every browser
CSS styles for standard browsers
CSS style only for Internet Explorer 6 , 7 and quirk ( with # hack )
The result looks :
any text
any height
any content , for example generated from DB
everything is vertically centered
See this example in browser
Let 's make it structural and without hacks
( NOTE : this valid solution described below does n't work in Internet Explorer 7 ( standard mode ) , because IE7 does n't understand table - values in display property .
The centered object is too high .
BUT : IE 7 is used by only about 3 % of users ( 2012 ) and the number will decrease .
If you still do mind IE7 users , please use the non-valid solution above , write in quirk mode , or use html conditional comments for separating the properties for IE 7 somehow . )
The first example above is not nice , but I hope you have understood it .
It 's possible to write code differently .
For example this way :
< div id= " outer " >
< div id= " middle " >
< div id= " inner " >
any text
any height
any content , for example generated from DB
everything is vertically centered
</div >
</div >
</div >
And the structured valid style :
< style type =" text /css " >
#outer {height : 400 px ; overflow : hidden ; position : relative ; }
# outer [ id ] {display : table ; position : static;}
# middle {position : absolute ; top : 50 % ;} /* for quirk explorer only */
# middle [id ] {display : table - cell ; vertical - align : middle ; width : 100 % ; position : static;}
#inner {position : relative ; top : - 50%} /* for quirk explorer only */
/* optional : # inner [ id ] {position : static;} */
</ style >
See the valid example in browser ( it looks the same way as the last one ) .
Color legend :
CSS style for Internet Explorer 6 only ( or quirk )
CSS styles for standard browsers
CSS2 selector # value [ id ] is equivalent to selector #value , but Internet Explorer 6 ignores these types of selectors with [ id ] .
Generally : syntax *[ foo ] means any element with attribute foo .
Any HTML element # something must have the attribute id by definition set to " something " .
That 's the trick -- # value [ id ] works in standard browsers only ( similarly works .value[ class ] )
There 's CSS property position set to absolute or relative for Internet Explorer .
The code position : static get 's it back to default value in standard browsers ( property top does n't work then ) .
Both vertical and horizontal centering
The core code will be the same , you just need to add some extra CSS rules .
If is your page in standard mode , add this code :
< style >
#outer {width : 100%;}
#inner { width : 200 px ; margin - left : auto ; margin - right : auto;}
</ style >
As you probably see , this is the most common horizontal centering method - auto left and right margin .
Because margins needs the space in Firefox and Opera , you need to set a width to the #outer div .
If 100 % does n't fit your needs , use any other value .
The important thing is to set some proper width to #inner .
This tutorial is about vertical centering of an object with unknown height .
I assume that you know the width of the object ( in most cases you will simply decide how wide it should be ) .
You may use the pixel values , or the percentage width .
If the centered object is only an unknown - size image , you do n't need to set width .
If you use quirk mode page rendering ( mode depends on ! Doctype , as you know ) , added code should be a bit longer , because quirk mode of Exploder does n't understand auto margins , but has one nice bug in text - align interpretation instead .
This code should work for both standard and quirk mode :
< style >
#outer {width : 100%;}
# middle {width : 100 % ; text - align : center;}
#inner { width : 200 px ; margin - left : auto ; margin - right : auto ; text - align : left;}
</ style >
Please take note that this is just part of code , which you have to add to the previous example .
If you are lazy to combine codes , please see the complete example in browser : vertical and horizontal centering .
You know , I 'm lazy too .
How to center vertically on window's height
The same way , and just add the style :
< style >
body , html {height : 100%;}
#outer {height : 100 % ; overflow : visible ; } /* or without overflow */
...
</style >
It seems that #outer declaration should be sufficient , but it is not .
Body and html declaration sets 100 % of the window 's height as a base for next percentage .
Now it is better not to set overflow : hidden ( like in the examples above ) , because when the content would be taller than window , then it would be impossible to scroll on .

Special service :
The 72 - year - old milkman who delivered cannabis with the daily pinta
Special deliveries : Milkman Robert Holding said he only dealt cannabis to pensioners with with ' aches and pains '
Robert Holding was the sort of milkman who always liked to help his customers - particularly the elderly ones .
So if they left him a little note asking for something extra , he tried to get it for them .
But some of their requests went beyond the usual dozen eggs or bottle of orange juice .
Holding , 72 , has admitted supplying cannabis to some of his older customers .
He was caught placing small bars of cannabis resin into empty egg cartons , and leaving them on doorsteps .
When he was confronted by police , Holding told officers he would only ever supply pensioners with the drug to help them with their ' aches and pains ' .
Cannabis has been shown in studies to help ease pain in arthritis and other conditions .
But a judge told the elderly milkman his special delivery service would inevitably lead to a spell behind bars .
Burnley Crown Court has heard that Holding only delivered to pensioners on his delivery round who had found out about his extra service by word of mouth .
The grandfather had 17 drug customers who would regularly ask for cannabis .
Police said that the customers would leave out handwritten notes with their empty milk bottles requesting him to leave the Class C drugs with his next delivery .
Acting on information , police launched an undercover operation and watched him as he delivered milk on his regular round over several weeks .
Finally they arrested the pensioner at his home in Burnley , Lancashire .
During a search of the house , officers found 167 grams of the Class C drug .
In a police interview Holding accepted he had supplied cannabis resin to 17 households while on his milk delivery round .
Holding appeared in court charged with two counts of supplying and possessing the drug between April 1 and July 18 this year .
Wearing blue jeans and a scruffy dark jersey , Holding pleaded guilty to the charges .
Phil Holden , defending , told the court : ' The defendant , in police interview , mentioned who he dealt to .
He said it was for elderly people with aches and pains .
' Those who he supplied , and there were not many , were through word of mouth and his customers were all of a certain age . '
Mr Holden said the grandfather supplied a small bar of cannabis to his regular customers every three to four weeks .
Adjourning the case , Judge Beverley Lunt said that Holding , who has previous convictions but none for drug dealing , faced an inevitable jail sentence .
Judge Lunt said : '
You must understand these are serious offences and in my judgment the likely outcome is an immediate custodial sentence . '
The case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report .
Holding was released on bail and will be sentenced at Burnley Crown Court on February 6 .
Studies suggest that cannabis and cannabis - based medicines can provide effective pain relief for those suffering from illnesses .
It is also thought to help fight nausea and vomiting in the advanced stages of cancer and AIDS .
Campaigners also claim that the drug can be useful in treating asthma , strokes , Parkinson 's Disease and Alzheimer 's Disease .
A House of Lords Science and Technology Committee has recommended its use for medicinal purposes .

Google Analytics is probably the most popular web analytics tool in use today .
It is certainly the best tool you can get for the price -- it 's free and worth every penny .
Unfortunately , like every web analytics tool , it is not 100 percent accurate .
There are reasons why it is impossible to build perfectly accurate web analytics software , which I have covered previously in "
Visits and bounces
Firstly , we must remember that Google did not create Google Analytics .
The company bought a product called Urchin and rebranded it .
After about a year , it then released an upgraded version .
Urchin had contained a very big mistake in its calculations , which Google fixed in the upgrade .
The problem lay with counting visits .
According to all the web analytics standards , a " visit " only happens when someone reads more than one page on a site .
If someone comes to your site , looks at the first page , then leaves , this is not a " visit " -- it is a " bounce . "
The best way to think of this is in terms of a shop .
If someone looks at the store window but moves on , they have bounced .
It is only when they enter the store ( or site ) that you have a visit .
This is a very important definition to grasp because it fundamentally affects how you see the performance of the site .
The reason we need to distinguish between bounces and visits is that we can't tell how long someone spent looking at a web page .
We can only tell what time they accessed it .
We calculate the time spent looking at a page by comparing what time they accessed it with what time they accessed the next page .
For example , if someone accesses my homepage at 2 p.m. , then accesses the next page at 2:15 p.m. , we assume they spent 15 minutes reading the homepage .
If someone only accesses one page -- in other words , if they bounce -- we have no way of knowing how long they spent looking at that one page .
So you can only calculate visit duration when someone reads two or more pages .
A key metric when analyzing the performance of a site is the average duration -- how long people are spending in the site .
You need to know your overall average duration for the site , and you often want to know the average duration for visits from certain ads or for specific products .
It 's a very good way of assessing engagement .
Average duration is calculated by totaling up all the individual visit durations and dividing this by the total number of visits .

Google Analytics is probably the most popular web analytics tool in use today .
It is certainly the best tool you can get for the price -- it 's free and worth every penny .
Unfortunately , like every web analytics tool , it is not 100 percent accurate .
There are reasons why it is impossible to build perfectly accurate web analytics software , which I have covered previously in " Things that throw your stats , " so we should not blame Google for this .
However , Google Analytics is different from other products in that it has been intentionally designed by Google to be inaccurate over and above the normal inaccuracies that are inevitable .
These inaccuracies are so glaring that most people are getting a very false picture of what is happening in their sites .
This article will explain where these inaccuracies lie and provide methods to correct for them .
Firstly , we must remember that Google did not create Google Analytics .
The company bought a product called Urchin and rebranded it .
After about a year , it then released an upgraded version .
Urchin had contained a very big mistake in its calculations , which Google fixed in the upgrade .

It 's a very good way of assessing engagement .
Average duration is calculated by totaling up all the individual visit durations and dividing this by the total number of visits .
In July 2007 , Google changed the calculation of average duration so that it did not include bounces anymore .
This was the correct thing to do and meant that its figures for average duration were now accurate .
A month later , Google put it back to the old ( wrong ) way of calculation .
In other words , Google intentionally rolled Google Analytics back so that it produced an incorrect average duration .
Why ?
Brett Crosby , senior manager at Google Analytics , explained in a Google blog that it was because people complained the change meant the new ( accurate ) numbers were out of line with the old ( inaccurate ) ones .
( That blog has since been removed by Google , but you can find it copied on many sites . )
In other words , these people considered consistency more important than accuracy , and Google obliged them .
It 's been that way ever since -- Google is intentionally and knowingly providing inaccurate numbers because a few people preferred neatness to truth .
Areas of error
Treating bounces as visits does n't just affect the accuracy of average duration -- it affects any metric based on the number of visits .
Visit count
When you see a figure in your Google Analytic reports for Total Visits , ask yourself :
What do you think that represents ?
If you see Total Visits as the number of people who entered your site , who reacted to the sales pitch , who engaged with your content , who potentially could have bought products , then you are wrong .
It is the number of people who arrived at the front door of the site , nothing more .

Conversion rate
The Conversion Rate tells me how successful my site is at selling .
It is legitimate to calculate Conversion Rate including bounces , but my personal experience is that it is misleading to do so .
I use Conversion Rate to improve my site 's sales pitch .
People who bounce were never exposed to it , so including them in the calculation means I cannot possibly know whether my sales pitch is working or not .

Exit rate
Google Analytics tells me how many people exited the site from any given page .
Like Conversion Rate , this is useful for assessing the sales performance of the page .
However , getting someone to enter the site and getting them to stay in it once they have entered are two very different tasks .
They have different factors and processes involved , and they have to be measured and improved separately .
You can't assess the ability of a page to hold someone in the site and the ability of that page to engage a new arrival in the same number .
Including bounces in the Exit Rate makes the Exit Rate metric useless .

Including bounces in the Exit Rate makes the Exit Rate metric useless .
AdWords
It is important to bear in mind that this error does not affect the assessment of key metrics for AdWords traffic .
You pay for people to come to the site , whether they bounce or not , so cost - per- visitor and ROI for AdWords is not affected .
At the time Google purchased the software Urchin , it treated ( and counted ) bounces as 0 - duration visits .
When calculating the average duration , this meant that it came up with a number that was under the real one .
How inaccurate this was depended on the percentage of a site 's arrivals who bounced .
In July 2007 , Google changed the calculation of average duration so that it did not include bounces anymore .
This was the correct thing to do and meant that its figures for average duration were now accurate .
A month later , Google put it back to the old ( wrong ) way of calculation .
In other words , Google intentionally rolled Google Analytics back so that it produced an incorrect average duration .

It 's been that way ever since -- Google is intentionally and knowingly providing inaccurate numbers because a few people preferred neatness to truth .
Treating bounces as visits does n't just affect the accuracy of average duration -- it affects any metric based on the number of visits .
Correcting Google Analytics
If I have inaccurate metrics that are being used by someone to assess performance , I like to aim for minimal disruption when I correct them .
I therefore leave the existing metrics in place and add a few ( accurate ) ones .
I have found the best way to correct for this problem is to add a metric I call " Retained Visits , " leaving the existing Total Visits in place .
I can then re-calculate my metrics using Retained Visits .
I get my number of Retained Visits by removing the bounces .
For example , if Total Visits was 1,000 and the Bounce Rate was 25 percent , I had 250 bounces , so the number of Retained Visits was 750 .
Mathematically , we express this as :
RV = TV – ( TV * BR )
where :
RV is Retained Visits
TV is Total Visits
BR is Bounce Rate
Correcting average duration
In order to get the genuine Average Duration , I need to rewind the calculation Google made about half way .
Google Analytics calculated Average Duration by adding up all the individual durations and then dividing that by the number of visits ( including bounces ) .
I rewind this by multiplying the Average Duration by the Total Visits .
That gives me the number Google had before it factored in bounces , which we can call Total Duration .
( Remember that the bounces , with durations of zero , contributed nothing to this number . )
I then redo the calculation of average using Retained Visits , thus :
TAD = ( AD * TV ) / RV
where :
TAD is True Average Duration
AD is Average Duration ( as reported by Google Analytics )
TV is Total Visits
RV is Retained Visits
It is surprising , even terrifying , how far apart the old and new numbers are , and the difference in the picture this provides .
Here is a set of figures from a site that averages around 30 percent bounce rate :
These show that rather than an average engagement of around three minutes , the reality is closer to five -- people are spending almost twice as long on the site as Google Analytics says they are .
You can use Retained Visits to recalculate your Conversion Rate in a similar fashion .
While I keep my calculations of AdWords ROI untouched , I also add another one based on Retained Visits .
I have found that if you break down the ROI on each advertising campaign ( or ad ) by Retained Visits , you can often find extremely valuable revenue streams concealed inside a bland total .
Conclusion
It is critical to know how any web metrics package calculates its numbers .
You cannot assume , no matter how big the company , that the numbers will be correct .
A small variation does n't make much difference , but you could be getting a completely false view of what is happening in your site .
You may need to correct those numbers yourself .
I recommend the use of Retained Visitors as a good way of correcting for errors in Google Analytics .
The other conclusion we can draw from this is how limited the understanding of web analytics is among practitioners , and what a low priority Google gives Google Analytics .
Can you imagine an accountant insisting on using inaccurate numbers in their bookkeeping simply because that 's what they had been doing before ?
How long do you think that business would survive ?
Can you imagine Google agreeing to downgrade the accuracy of its search results to meet user demand ?
On second thought , that 's exactly what they agreed to do in China , is n't it ?

The incoming Obama administration will risk provoking the furore over gays in the military that embroiled the early days of Bill Clinton 's first term after a senior member of the team gave an unequivocal pledge to remove the ban that forbids gays and lesbians from serving openly .
In a largely overlooked answer given in response to public questions on
YouTube last Friday , Robert Gibbs , who will be the main White House press secretary , was asked whether the " do n't ask , do n't tell " provision would be revoked .
He replied : " You do n't hear politicians give a one - word answer much .
But it 's ' Yes . ' "
The ban was a compromise that emerged out of the politically damaging wrangle that tied up Clinton 's early administration in knots after it tried to open the military to equal rights for gays .
Under its terms , military officers are not allowed to ask personnel about their sexuality , but if anyone is discovered to be gay or lesbian they are expelled .
Obama indicated on several occasions on the two - year campaign trail to last November 's presidential elections that he was minded to remove the ban .
But he is also likely to be wary of repeating the mistakes of his Democratic presidential predecessor .
Gibbs followed up his YouTube remarks on Wednesday with comments suggesting that reform is unlikely to be immediate .
" There are many challenges facing our nation now and the president - elect is focused first and foremost on jump - starting this economy .
So not everything will get done in the beginning but he 's committed to following through , " he said .
Like the Xbox Live Arcade version of Lumines Live before it , the PlayStation Network release of Lumines Supernova proves that the franchise 's vibrant graphical style and uncomplicated gameplay translate magnificently to high - definition .
What makes this PlayStation Network - exclusive such an improvement over its predecessor is what you get for your money .
Whereas the limited Live Arcade offerings were overpriced , the huge amount of content in Supernova will sate your single - player puzzle - lust many times over .
The meager multiplayer options , however , will have veterans with a portable alternative questioning the worth of a game they 've ostensibly already played .
A Little Big Planet level !
Can we expect PlayStation - themed add - on packs in the future ?
The mechanics of Lumines Supernova are wonderfully simple :
By rotating and dropping an unlimited flow of bicolored blocks , which are made up of a smaller set of 2 - by - 2 squares , you 'll try to make colored rectangles across a 16 - by - 10 grid .
After you 've combined a number of same - color squares to form larger shapes , the windshield - wiper - style time line washes across the screen and erases them .
The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the grid , and points are awarded according to the size and number of blocks that are cleared from your created columns .
As a perk , you 'll periodically be offered a special bonus block that clears away all adjacent and linked blocks of the same color , leaving the leftovers to fall into place to create more combos .
The concept is easy to get a grip on thanks to the helpful text tips and video tutorials , but the challenge of developing strategies on the fly is one of the game 's biggest hooks .
Realizing that you 've got a good opening to drop your next sequence of squares into is immensely satisfying , and it feels great to watch your score leap as you wipe out a messy set of highly stacked blocks or clear the screen entirely .
Perfecting your placement of the randomly generated blocks and chaining points together make for an experience that 's every bit as addictive as the original Tetris .
Though the engrossing gameplay is the biggest strength of Lumines , the music is n't to be ignored .
The tunes are groovy and enjoyable , and the crystal - clear audio sounds fantastic through speakers and headphones .
The clever blend of catchy electronica , rock , and orchestral music integrates with gameplay so brilliantly that it will probably take you a moment to realize that your dropping , rotating , and combo-building are influencing the cadenced sounds .
The repeated bass drum that accompanies your rapid - fire spinning or the vocals that synchronously hum when you zip a block from one side of the grid to the other give Lumines the feel of a rhythm game on top of its already endearing puzzle gameplay .
Because you have a direct effect on the tunes , you 'll find yourself completely engrossed by the game as you stack your score and toe tap to the flow of the music .
Do n't be surprised to see that hours have slipped away unnoticed after a session of Supernova .
The levels , known as skins , last only as long as the song that plays behind them , so each stage is fast - paced as well as absorbing , and getting sucked in within the first few minutes is incredibly easy .
One of the best things about the game is that the eclectic mix of backgrounds , blocks , sound effects , and music give it artistic diversity .
As you play through the Challenge mode , each skin features new music to accompany the newly colored and crisp - looking cubes that drop from the top , so there 's a fresh look and sound to the constantly changing atmosphere .
Whether you play the regular game on the basic mode or the advanced mode depends on how you want to be challenged ; skins on the advanced mode have trickier combinations of faster - falling blocks and a slower - moving time line , while skins on the basic mode have a more consistent speed with less - dramatic changes .
Though the level progression is linear , the rate at which blocks fall and the time line sweeps are n't directly proportional to your progress , so each stage feels fresh rather than increasingly frantic .
And if you do n't wish to hear the same set of starting songs in Challenge mode again , completing levels unlocks new skins to choose from in the skin edit mode .
Here , you can create and save customized playlists from your extensive list of earned levels , so you can play your favorite stages over and over again .
This obvious homage to Super Mario Bros. is one of 40 skins , most of which are new .
If you 're looking for smaller chunks of fun , both the Mission mode and the Puzzle mode offer a less time - intensive alternative .
Mission goals include clearing stacks of preset blocks in a set number of turns , while Puzzle mode will have you creating shapes , such as arrows or animals , out of the vibrant squares .
Some of the more elaborate creations , like flowers or fruit , prove to be a quick , gratifying challenge .
Sadly , the puzzles are n't new .
Most of them are copied from the first Lumines , so experienced players will be let down by a chunk of content that they have little reason to revisit .
Both of these brain - teaser game variants are fun alternatives to chasing high scores for hours on end .
Time Attack mode returns , and it makes the most out of speedy sessions .
Game times as short as 60 seconds or as long as 10 minutes , with plenty of options in between , let you squeeze in a few rounds if you 're budgeting time .
Further adding to the package is the new Dig Down game .
Burrowing down into the high and wide stacks of squares to reach lower levels is a completely new way to play Lumines , and the leaderboard high scores are a good incentive to make you push for the best possible time .
While not as enjoyable as the standard game , Dig Down is a tense new way to play an already awesome game .
Another excellent addition is the revamped Sequencer tool .
Its debut in Lumines II was a disappointment because of the limited options , but the tool 's expansion in Supernova is an amusing way to unleash your inner mix master .
With just a few simple button presses , you can drop drum beats under a bass loop and add special effects to create a groovy tune of your own in just a few minutes .
Once you 've concocted the perfect jam , you 're able to play it in the background of a skin .
The sound effects that buzz and chime to your movements do n't seem to fit the premade rhythms of the sequencer , but it 's an extra way to sample your song aside from pressing the play button .
This is a great toy for music nuts looking to go a bit beyond the gameplay , and it's a subtle way to introduce puzzle players to making music .
It 's sad that there 's no way to share this user - created content with other players .
There 's a substantial amount of single - player content to sink into , but there 's just one multiplayer mode in Supernova .
The one - on - one Versus mode requires that you bust out big combos to push a vertical border toward your opponent 's end of a shared screen .
This limits your opponent 's drop space while expanding your own .
The neglect of network multiplayer in Supernova is inexcusable , especially since Lumines Live included it on the Xbox 360 two years prior to this release .
While an online component is n't core to enjoying the game , its absence is a shame , especially since the Versus CPU mode , along with its traditionally awesome sci-fi and historically themed skins , has been cut as well .
How low can you go ?
Dig Down mode is tense with a timer .
Despite being the seventh release since the franchise 's 2005 debut , Lumines Supernova retains the brilliantly charming gameplay that can turn puzzle junkies and newcomers alike into addicted insomniacs .
The refreshing skins and songs are excellent , and with so many ways to play , there 's practically limitless replay value here .
In spite of the crummy competitive options , your $ 15 investment goes a long way toward a brimming batch of addictive gameplay that 's tied to one of the most irresistible audiovisual experiences on the PlayStation 3 .
Additionally , documents showed that Thain signed off on the purchases personally , and that he used over $ 30,000 to pay the expenses Smith incurred in doing the work .
The following is a list of the items in his suite :
Area Rug $ 87,784
Mahogany Pedestal Table $ 25,713
19th Century Credenza $ 68,179
Pendant Light Furniture $ 19,751
4 Pairs of Curtains $ 28,091
Pair of Guest Chairs $ 87,784
George IV Chair $ 18,468
6 Wall Sconces $ 2,741
Parchment Waste Can $ 1,405
Roman Shade Fabric $ 10,967
Roman Shades $ 7,315
Coffee Table $ 5,852
Commode on Legs $ 35,115
Thain also hired Smith , whose celebrity client list include Steven Spielberg , Michelle Pfeiffer , Cindy Crawford and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild , to design his Manhattan apartment at 740 Park Avenue , and his 14 bedroom home in Rye , NY .
Smith is also Michelle Obama ’s interior designer and the White House paid him $ 100,000 for his services .
Thain also paid his driver $ 230,000 for one years work , which included the driver 's $ 85,000 salary and bonus of $ 18,000 , and another $ 128,000 in over - time pay , documents show .
Drivers of top executives are often paid about half that amount .
Thain was appointed as Merrill ’s CEO as the firm suffered massive losses from investments tied to the depressed real estate market under his predecessor Stan O'Neal , who was ousted in late 2007 .
Those losses continued through 2008 , forcing Thain and his management team to sell the brokerage firm to Bank of America in mid September or face near certain liquidation as investors fearing further losses began pulling lines of credit and other financing .

Imag­ine : A con­vict­ed drunk dri­ver who needs to con­vince a judge he has n’t had a drink in years .
A father in a cus­tody bat­tle who needs to prove he did not abuse his spouse .
A sus­pect­ed cor­po­rate thief who needs to prove his innocence .
What does the classic lie detector actually measure ?
Is a change in pulse and blood pressure evidence of a lie or simply evidence of nervousness ?
These are just some of the peo­ple will­ing to pay $ 5,000 , or more , to expose their brains to sci­en­tists to show that their words match their truthfulness .
Know­ing for cer­tain when some­one is lying is the stuff of dystopi­an sci­ence fic­tion – and the hope of cops and spies around the world .
And , if some aggres­sive tech­nol­o­gy entre­pre­neurs get their way , the tech­nol­o­gy will become a real­i­ty , com­ing soon to courts and inter­ro­ga­tion rooms near you .
What makes this pos­si­ble is func­tion­al mag­net­ic res­o­nance imag­ing ( fMRI ) , which has already trans­formed the world of neuroscience .
Cephos Cor­po­ra­tion and No Lie MRI are two Amer­i­can com­pa­nies at the fore­front of using fMRI tech­nol­o­gy to ver­i­fy truth in the cor­po­rate , gov­ern­ment and legal realms .
Cephos , based in Mass­a­chu­setts , argues that its tech­niques fit all the legal stan­dards and tests to be admis­si­ble in court .
No Lie , based in Cal­i­for­nia , has scores of clients inter­est­ed in using its process as evi­dence of their truth­ful­ness in court hearings .
Steven J. Lak­en , founder of Cephos – whose cor­po­rate mot­to is ​ “ Our Busi­ness Is the Truth , ” and whose mis­sion state­ment reads , ​ “ We believe Truth is among the most valu­able of com­modi­ties ” – claims a 93 per­cent suc­cess rate in deter­min­ing truth - telling from lying .
( Humans are typ­i­cal­ly able to tell the dif­fer­ence between truth and lies about 50 per­cent of the time , and tra­di­tion­al lie detec­tor machines aver­age around 85 percent . )
Both com­pa­nies are con­fi­dent that with­in months , judges will allow fMRI results to be admit­ted in tri­als .
Despite the cor­po­rate con­fi­dence that Cephos and No Lie exude , legal schol­ars , neu­ro­sci­en­tists and ethi­cists are much less optimistic .
The tech­nol­o­gy behind the fMRI is rel­a­tive­ly sim­ple .
Slide a human being wired with elec­trodes into a tube that is essen­tial­ly a large mag­net .
Mea­sure blood flow in the brain and pro­duce an image that is filled with bright and dark spots .
The fMRI reads your brain in real time by mea­sur­ing the flow and use of oxygen .
The the­o­ry behind the fMRI ’s abil­i­ty to detect a lie is based on human phys­i­ol­o­gy .
It takes more effort to tell a lie than to tell the truth , so , if you are lying , your brain works hard­er and more oxy­gen is used .
Put the per­son in an fMRI machine , ask ques­tions and inter­pret the rel­a­tive­ly bright and dark spots .
Through­out the Unit­ed States , fMRIs are used in labs and hos­pi­tals to study brain injuries , states of med­i­ta­tion , phys­i­cal cen­ters of men­tal dis­or­ders , hap­pi­ness , lust , emo­tion­al states and a pletho­ra of oth­er states of mind .
But the attacks of 9 ⁄ 11 gave a whole new urgency to the idea .
Jonathan Moreno , a senior fel­low at the Cen­ter for Amer­i­can Progress and author of Mind Wars : Brain Research and Nation­al Defense , esti­mates that at least 50 U.S. labs began study­ing the use of neu­ro­science and lie detec­tion after 9 ⁄ 11 , many of them fund­ed by the Depart­ment of Defense .
“ There ’s enor­mous pres­sure com­ing from the gov­ern­ment for this , ” says Paul Root Wolpe , a bioethi­cist at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Penn­syl­va­nia .
​ “ There is rea­son to believe a lot of mon­ey and effort is going into cre­at­ing these technologies . ”
But as quick­ly as the inter­est has grown , so , too , have con­cerns over its implications .
Hen­ry T. Greely , a Stan­ford Uni­ver­si­ty law pro­fes­sor and a lead­ing crit­ic of using fMRI for lie detec­tion , argues that there are three fun­da­men­tal prob­lems .
First , there is no evi­dence that the tech­nol­o­gy works .
Sec­ond , there ’s no evi­dence that lies can be detect­ed .
And third , there ’s no reg­u­la­tion of the field .
In effect , Greely says , ​ “ Any­one can promise anything . ”
He rejects the claim of high lie - detect­ing accu­ra­cy , large­ly because the exper­i­ments are con­duct­ed in con­trolled set­tings .
Cephos and No Lie base their results on stud­ies with stu­dents being dis­hon­est and hon­est in arti­fi­cial sit­u­a­tions .
Greely says such stud­ies tell us noth­ing about real life .
Ethi­cists , too , are alarmed .
Although the empha­sis these days is on the accused prov­ing their inno­cence , giv­ing cre­dence to the tech­nol­o­gy could invite mis­use or abuse .
The MacArthur Foundation ’s Law and Neu­ro­science Project is one of a series of ini­tia­tives across the Unit­ed States try­ing to make sense of the bur­geon­ing use of neu­ro­science in legal matters .
Accord­ing to Michael S. Gaz­zani­ga , the project ’s direc­tor , ​ “ The risk that sci­ence reject­ed for use in courts – due to the strin­gent require­ments for accu­ra­cy – may still be used wide­ly in soci­ety for oth­er pur­pos­es is always present . ”
The tra­di­tion­al lie detec­tor device – which requires hook­ing the sub­ject up to wires to record pulse , blood pres­sure and breath­ing – burst into the world in the 1920s when med­ical stu­dent John Lar­son and police offi­cer Leonarde Keel­er announced they had cre­at­ed a truth machine .
The lie detec­tor test has had a trou­bled his­to­ry ever since .
Ken Alder , a his­to­ri­an at North­west­ern Uni­ver­si­ty and author of The Lie Detec­tors : The His­to­ry of An Amer­i­can Obses­sion , describes the con­cept of using tech­nol­o­gy to sort out truth and lies as ​“ unique­ly American . ”
Greely , Wolpe and oth­ers detect two major con­cep­tu­al mis­takes in the whole idea of lie detec­tion .
First , mea­sur­ing the actions of the brain does not tell you any­thing about what the brain is actu­al­ly think­ing .
Sec­ond , lying should be judged not by machines but by people .
It ’s sim­i­lar to a fun­da­men­tal dilem­ma .
What does the clas­sic lie detec­tor actu­al­ly mea­sure ?
Is a change in pulse and blood pres­sure evi­dence of a lie or sim­ply evi­dence of nervousness ?
Alder ’s exhaus­tive explo­ration of how a tech­no­log­i­cal obses­sion can go wrong is rife with exam­ples of what Gaz­zani­ga wor­ries about .
Despite the Supreme Court ’s 1998 rejec­tion of lie detec­tor tech­nol­o­gy on the grounds that it was not reli­able , lie detec­tors are still used in job inter­views , secu­ri­ty clear­ances and interrogations .
In April 2008 , the Pen­ta­gon start­ed issu­ing hand - held lie detec­tors to sol­diers in Afghanistan .
It argued that the device ’s inac­cu­ra­cy did n’t mat­ter so long as it gave sol­diers an edge in con­fronting pos­si­ble ter­ror­ists .
This ​“ erring on the side of tech­nol­o­gy ” over real­i­ty is what scares many observers with the growth of fMRI technology .
Jonathan Marks , a bioethi­cist at Penn State Uni­ver­si­ty who stud­ies inter­ro­ga­tion tech­niques in the war on ter­ror , says the use of fMRIs could , in fact , increase the use of torture .
“ [ P ] eople [ could ] begin to say , ​‘the fMRI picked him out as a ter­ror­ist so let us give him a going over in the inter­ro­ga­tion room , ’ ” says Marks .
​“ Con­trary to the view that fMRI will ren­der tor­ture obso­lete , it might become a license for fur­ther abuse of detainees because its read­ings will con­vince peo­ple that they have a ter­ror­ist on their hands . ”
Night­mare sce­nar­ios , like the ones Marks sug­gests , have the Amer­i­can Civ­il Lib­er­ties Union ( ACLU ) concerned .
Bar­ry Stein­hardt , direc­tor of the ACLU ’s Tech­nol­o­gy and Lib­er­ty Project , says fMRIs need to be kept in check .
“ There are cer­tain things that have such pow­er­ful impli­ca­tions for our soci­ety – and for human­i­ty at large – that we have a right to know how they are being used so that we can grap­ple with them as a demo­c­ra­t­ic soci­ety , ” says Stein­hardt .
​ “ These brain - scan­ning tech­nolo­gies are far from ready for foren­sic uses and , if deployed , will inevitably be mis­used and misunderstood . ”
The mainstream media has come under fire many times in the past for failing to link out to sources from their stories .
However the problem is n’t with the entire industry and it ’s wrong to make generalisations when a good number of online news websites are very good at crediting sources with the appropriate link .
Some websites have adopted a half hearted approach of linking to lots of websites , but only from blog posts – the main articles in the site only contain internal links .
We believe that linking to useful websites does n’t “ leak ” traffic – quite the opposite in fact .
Offering useful links actually makes visitors more likely to return to see what other interesting websites they might find in the future , a model that sites such as Digg and Fark are built around .
Of course as a blogger it ’s sometimes hard to appreciate the fact that mainstream media websites are , with the exception of the BBC , business entities with shareholders and an obligation to maximise profits .
It ’s understandable that they are reluctant to send valuable page views elsewhere .
We spent some time researching the issue to see if there was a correlation between the frequency a site links out and the number of links it gets in return .
The results below might just surprise you .
By entering all the incoming and outgoing link values from the table above into an Excel spreadsheet we used the Pearson product - moment correlation coefficient to determine whether there was in fact a correlation between the number of times a website links out and the number of links it gets back in return .
The resulting figure of 0.842733801 shows that in general there is a strong relationship between news websites linking out and getting links in return .
Comments from the media
In order to make sure this article was as balanced as possible we contacted a number of mainstream newspapers to ask what their linking policy was .
The responses are below .
It appears that a number of newspapers have a policy of linking out , but in practice this does n’t always happen for many reasons .
Tom Happold , Network editor Guardian Unlimited
“ It has always been our policy to point our readers to whatever we think is of interest on the web . ”
James Montgomery Editor , FT.com
“ What I can say , regarding attribution by the FT to non-FT sources , is that one needs a clear distinction between “ attribution ” and “ sourcing ” , journalistically speaking .
Citing a non-FT source would not , generally speaking , meet the FT ’s required standards of verification .
( Just because something is reported by the New York Times , say , does n’t make it true , however much we implicitly believe what we read in that newspaper – we have to check for ourselves . )
Obviously , we are more inclined to believe some sources ( Reuters ) than others ( chat rooms ) .
Many blogs might be regarded as inherently unreliable because they do n’t reveal their sources or uphold traditional journalistic / MSM standards of reporting ( eg , double sourcing , on the record or whatever ) .
But there is nothing intrinsically untrustworthy about blogs as a genre .
So when it comes to linking out on FT.com , a link does not constitute sourcing for us .
But as a general rule , if we do acknowledge some third party content , then best practice would be to carry a link to it .
For example , if we write : “ Yesterday ’s statement by the prime minister appeared to represent a climbdown from an interview to the BBC last week in which he pledged …. ” , then we would link “ interview ” to the BBC article .
That ’s a service to the reader , who may want to follow the link to learn more ; and a confirmation that we have accurately reported the earlier quote .
Do we also live up to this best practice ?
No , because of some technology issues to do with persistent hyperlinks in text in our CMS , and newsroom training .
But we are improving .
Last , and this is probably what you really want to know , when do we acknowledge third - party content ?
This is tricky – lots of facts / information / articles written in the FT , or any other publication for that matter , existed earlier somewhere else .
But so what ?
That does n’t mean we have to credit every snippet of information to another publisher .
We do “ hat tip ” our competition , in print or online , for a genuine clean scoop ; and best practice would therefore require a link . ”
Drew Broomhall – Search Editor , Times Online
“ Times Online has a policy of linking out to third party sites where editorially appropriate , such as products , organisations , reports etc mentioned in articles .
Some sections do more than others , it depends on the section ’s editor .
Our outbound link count might even have been higher before the relaunch , a lot of links were lost due to html being stripped out of inline links when they migrated to a new CMS . ”

REYKJAVIK , Jan 23 ( Reuters ) - Iceland ’s Prime Minister Geir Haarde on Friday , under growing pressure from his country ’s financial collapse , said he would step down and announced his intention to call an early election for May 9 .
Haarde told a news conference a medical examination had last week revealed he had a malignant tumour of the oesophagus and he would seek surgery abroad at the end of January or early February .
“ I have decided not to seek re-election as leader of the Independence Party at its upcoming national congress , ” Haarde told a news conference , saying a new chairman would lead the party in the elections .
Elections would not normally be held until 2011 .
In NLTK , chunking is the process of extracting short , well - formed phrases , or chunks , from a sentence .
This is also known as partial parsing , since a chunker is not required to capture all the words in a sentence , and does not produce a deep parse tree .
But this is a good thing because it ’s very hard to create a complete parse grammar for natural language , and full parsing is usually all or nothing .
So chunking allows you to get at the bits you want and ignore the rest .
Training
The general approach to chunking and parsing is to define rules or expressions that are then matched against the input sentence .
But this is a very manual , tedious , and error - prone process , likely to get very complicated real fast .
The alternative approach is to train a chunker the same way you train a part - of - speech tagger .
Except in this case , instead of training on ( word , tag ) sequences , we train on ( tag , iob ) sequences , where iob is a chunk tag defined in the the conll2000 corpus .
Here ’s a function that will take a list of chunked sentences ( from a chunked corpus like conll2000 or treebank ) , and return a list of ( tag , iob ) sequences .
import nltk.chunk def conll_tag_chunks ( chunk_sents ) : tag_sents = [ nltk.chunk.tree2conlltags ( tree ) for tree in chunk_sents ] return [ [ ( t , c ) for ( w , t , c ) in chunk_tags ] for chunk_tags in tag_sents ]
Accuracy
So how accurate is the trained chunker ?
Here ’s the rest of the code , followed by a chart of the accuracy results .
Note that I ’m only using Ngram Taggers .
You could additionally use the BrillTagger , but the training takes a ridiculously long time for very minimal gains in accuracy .
import nltk.corpus , nltk.tag def ubt_conll_chunk_accuracy( train_sents , test_sents ) : train_chunks = conll_tag_chunks ( train_sents ) test_chunks = conll_tag_chunks ( test_sents ) u_chunker = nltk.tag.UnigramTagger(train_chunks ) print 'u :' , nltk.tag.accuracy ( u_chunker , test_chunks ) ub_chunker = nltk.tag.BigramTagger(train_chunks , backoff=u_chunker ) print ' ub : ' , nltk.tag.accuracy ( ub_chunker , test_chunks ) ubt_chunker = nltk.tag.TrigramTagger( train_chunks , backoff=ub_chunker ) print ' ubt : ' , nltk.tag.accuracy( ubt_chunker , test_chunks ) ut_chunker = nltk.tag.TrigramTagger( train_chunks , backoff=u_chunker ) print 'ut : ' , nltk.tag.accuracy( ut_chunker , test_chunks ) utb_chunker = nltk.tag.BigramTagger(train_chunks , backoff=ut_chunker ) print ' utb : ' , nltk.tag.accuracy( utb_chunker , test_chunks ) # conll chunking accuracy test conll_train = nltk.corpus.conll2000.chunked_sents('train.txt ' ) conll_test = nltk.corpus.conll2000.chunked_sents('test.txt ' ) ubt_conll_chunk_accuracy( conll_train , conll_test ) # treebank chunking accuracy test treebank_sents = nltk.corpus.treebank_chunk.chunked_sents( ) ubt_conll_chunk_accuracy( treebank_sents [:2000 ] , treebank_sents [ 2000 : ] )
The ub_chunker and utb_chunker are slight favorites with equal accuracy , so in practice I suggest using the ub_chunker since it takes slightly less time to train .
Conclusion
Training a chunker this way is much easier than creating manual chunk expressions or rules , it can approach 100 % accuracy , and the process is re-usable across data sets .
As with part - of - speech tagging , the training set really matters , and should be as similar as possible to the actual text that you want to tag and chunk .
This may be apocryphal , but when FDR was running for President for the first time in 1932 , he said something along the lines of " What America needs now is a good , stiff drink . "
Then he won and went on to help end prohibition .
Well , now we 've got a new Democratic President coming into office , we 're in similarly dire economic straits , and maybe what America needs is a nice toke ?
It 's time to legalize , or at least decriminalize , drugs .
Admittedly this would be a blow to the flourishing prison industry at a time when we do n't want to cause additional job losses .
But perhaps we could make up some of those lost prison - guard jobs by opening up new rehab clinics and filling them up with addicts who need treatment .
The voters are miles ahead of the politicians on this issue .
Most national politicians would rather admit to using drugs than come out in favor of decriminalizing them .
But in Massachusetts , a resolution decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana passed with the support of 65 % of voters , despite opposition from the governor on down .
The politicians seem to believe it 's political suicide to favor a more rational drug policy , and even the massive popularity of measures like Question 2 in Massachusetts can't convince them otherwise .
Barack Obama wo n't admit that the war on drugs is a failure , but in his autobiography he admitted to doing cocaine in his youth .
During the primaries the Clinton campaign tried to gin-up a scandal out of this fact .
I think the real scandal is that the President Elect believes that other people should go to prison for something that he , and many others , get away with Scott free .
The same goes for Bill Clinton , who smoked marijuana but " never inhaled . "
The war on drugs does two things : it makes the business of drugs more profitable and more violent , and it sends lots and lots of people to prison .
Would n't it be better if we could bring this business out into the open , slap some taxes on it , and keep people from shooting each other ?
Of the 2.3 million people incarcerated in this country , more than half are in prison for drug - related offenses .
That 's unconscionable , and I believe future generations will see this fact , more than the pseudo - legalization of torture under the Bush Administration , as the great moral failing of our time .
As the late , great Milton Friedman , an opponent of the War on Drugs from the very beginning when Nixon initiated hostilities , put it , " there is no light at the end of that tunnel .
How many of our citizens do we want to turn into criminals before we yell " enough " ? "
No one believes that illegal drugs are anything but harmful , but Americans , or at least our leaders , use that fact to stop any discussion of a rational policy to deal with the problem .
I hope the new guy will be different .
For now my generation is much more progressive on this issue than older Americans .
But I wonder what will happen to younger proponents of decriminalization as they grow up and have children .
It 's a fact that we can't prevent people from getting their hands on drugs in this country by locking up dealers and using F - 16s to spray herbicides all over Colombia .
We 've tried for over 30 years , and the only thing the policy succeeds at is ruining lives .
What kills me is that nobody seems to care , not about the human cost , or even about the financial cost .

Thank you , Sarah
The conservative Our Country PAC puts up a perhaps poorly timed , Thanksgiving - themed video thanking Sarah Palin with images of , among other things , a nice , roasted turkey .
It 's no match for the instant - classic Palin turkey video that was the most popular video in the world yesterday , and as of now has nearly 1.6 million views .

On a grassy field in the middle of the city you might find two men swordfighting …

720 > 1080
Proposal : 1080I Should Be Renamed 540I - and 480I Should Be Renamed 240I
To be fair : 1440P = 720/60 P 720 lines 720 lines 720P = 720/60 P 540 lines 540 lines 1080I = 1080/30 I Or : 540I = 540/60 I
This depicts how progressive ( P ) scanning works - see top row - versus how interlaced ( I ) scanning works - bottom row .
People ( such as Congressmen ) read " our " 720P proposal and " their " 1080 I proposal and assume that 1080I is superior because the number is larger .
The diagram above shows that this is a fallacy .
In the progressive system , 720 lines are presented to the human eye every 1/60th of a second while the so - called 1080 I system presents only 540 lines .
Therefore a more accurate name for the interlaced system is 540I .
It also more accurately represents the fact that the interlaced system is lower in quality than our 720P system .
Not only is 720P superior to 540I in quality ( note the well - known artifact : interlace flickers ) , but it is cheaper !
And it is naturally compatible with computers ( which all use progressive scanning ) .
Now you can understand the title of this page :
It is 720P that is greater than 540I - formerly known in old - speak as 1080I .
We Progressives ( vs Them , the Interlacers ) could have inflated our number to 1440P using the same logic as the interlaced camp ( add together the two numbers from two successive 1/60th second intervals ) .
But this is just not right .
Our system delivers 720 lines at each instant ; theirs 540 .
Scanline number escalation is not an answer .
Hence the proposal is to lower the number in the offending name .
Notice two things :
Our 480P system looks good compared to 540I .
480 is just not that much less than 540 .
Yet Congressmen yell at the broadcasters , threatening their digital spectrum , when told of plans to broadcast 480P .
I have seen 480P and it is wonderful .
In fact , I have seen it side - by - side with 720P and 540I ( well , 1080I , if you insist ) systems , and 480P looks better !
I am not the only one for whom this phenomenon holds .
The reason :
We humans react to increased brightness more than we do to increased resolution .
The so - called " high - definition " television displays suffer from inability to deliver high brightness compared with 480P displays ( I 'm going to have to change this sentence once the digital mirror displays become popular - they ARE bright at all resolutions ) .
Let no Congressman jump on broadcasters until he or she has seen side - by - side comparisons - with price tags attached .
480P is affordable ; 540I is not - by either broadcasters or consumers .
Expense delays return of the analog channels to Congress .
And , of course , 540I is incompatible with computers and can't be used to read text .
Here 's the picture :
480 lines 480 lines 480P = 480/60 P 540 lines 540 lines 1080I = 1080/30 I 540I = 540/60 I
Current digital television ( seen only in studios , sometimes referred to as " D1 " ) has been called 480I up until now .
By the renaming proposal above , it should be called 240I instead , for more fair comparisons .
So a 480P system is much , much better than today 's digital television , which is interlaced and has only 4:3 aspect ratio ( vs 16:9 ) , and of course only 240 lines per 1/60th second .
( And , of course , today 's digital television is much , much better than the analog that consumers see in their homes . )
This is another case where looking only at the numbers , ignoring the suffix P or I , is unfair to the Progressives .
Here is a picture of the situation , to make the need for renumbering clearer :
480 lines 480 lines 480P = 480/60 P 240 lines 240 lines 480I = 480/30 I 240I = 240/60 I
Finally , all of the above arguments omit a very important consideration :
The consumer sees compressed versions of any of the proposed formats .
Nobody demonstrates the quality loss inherent in compression to Congressmen or consumers ( or even to themselves ) .
The " high definition " formats , 540I ( aka 1080I ) and 720P , have to be compressed by about 50:1 to fit them in the alloted digital channel .
Yes , that 's right : Compressed to 1/50th their original size ( as seen in the production studio , say ) !
But 480P has to be compressed by the much smaller 18:1 .
And 240I ( current digital TV , " D1 " ) , has to be compressed by only 9:1 .
The point is : After compression - which is required for broadcast - the differences between formats even out .
480P and 240I are much better fits to the allotted channels .
This is another reason they are so affordable .
Consumers will be blown away by them .
Again , a plea to Congressmen : Please insist on seeing comparisons of all the systems after compression before making demands on broadcasters .
Interlacers often claim that their system has more pixels .
See bandwidths for the actual numbers .
Summary :
It is not the pixels in a still frame that counts - still video is boring .
It is the pixels per second delivered to viewers that matters .
The 540I system , as defined , delivers only slightly more pixels per second than 720P , and , as practiced , it delivers less !
This , of course , is before compression .
As argued above , what matters to consumers is after compression .
After compression , the formats are indistinguishable so far as pixel count is concerned .
However , the interlaced system is fundamentally flawed because of its flickering , which does not go away during compression .
CAUTION !
When comparing systems , be sure you are watching a true comparison .
If you are not , then what you are really comparing is the equipment used for format conversion , not the display technology .
This seems obvious but I have seen many " comparisons " in the chat rooms , emails , websites , etc , where , for example , crummy source material displayed on a wonderful display system is " compared " with material originated in the format designed for a competing display technology .
The crummy material still looks crummy .
What a surprise !
In a true comparison , the originating technology must be specified and all conversions that have been made to the material before display must be specified .
Does the following work for a " comparison " ? :
Take material originated in 1080i ( aka 540i ) and ( 1 ) display it on a 1080i monitor ; ( 2 ) convert it to 720 p with a format converter ; ( 3 ) display the converted material on a 720 p monitor against the display in step ( 1 ) ?
Not a valid comparison !
Step ( 2 ) will cause a degeneration ( it has to because material has been thrown away for interlace - namely every other line ) that no converter , except one costing about $ 100,000 , can possibly compensate for well .
So this " test " would be comparing a good version of the source material to a bad version .
It would be testing the quality of the converter , not the display technologies .
Another mistake I see is comparing low - res material upconverted to high - res against ( originally ) high - res material .
Not a chance that the upconverted stuff will look as good .
Again , this is comparing converters , not display technologies .
What about full - frame capture ? :
It has been suggested that full - frame capture - now being easy and widespread in devices - alters the argument above .
If full - frame capture is done every 1/60th second and the appropriate field extracted and encoded in 1080i format ( aka 540i ) , then the spatial tearing described above still happens of course ( and one field of every captured frame is wasted ) .
If however , full - frame capture is done every 1/30th second with the first field being used as the first field of 1080 i and the second field being used as the second field of 1080i , then the spatial tearing described above does not happen BUT temporal tearing does happen , and the 1080 i format is invalidly used .
This is because the second field , instead of being sampled during the second 1/60th second of a frame time is sampled during the first 1/60th second and simply delayed 1/60th of a second .
So the second field sample occurs at the wrong time .
It does n't fit the 1080i definition .
The second field is skewed backward in time relative the first field , and this is what is meant by " temporal tearing . "
Of course none of this funny business is present in progressive scan systems .
They simply grab full frames every 1/60th second and deliver them to the progressive format every 1/60th second , per definition of the format .

I 'm baffled by WhosHere .
And I 'm no newbie .
I built my first Web page in 1994 , wrote my first blog entry in 1999 , and sent my first tweet in October 2006 .
My user number on Yahoo's event site , Upcoming.org : 14 .
I love tinkering with new gadgets and diving into new applications .
But WhosHere had me stumped .
It 's an iPhone app that knows where you are , shows you other users nearby , and lets you chat with them .
Once it was installed and running , I drew a blank .
What was I going to do with this thing ?
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
So I asked for some help .
I started messaging random people within a mile of my location ( 37.781641 °N , 122.393835 °W ) , asking what they used WhosHere for .
My first response came from someone named Bridget , who , according to her profile , at least , was a 25 year - old woman with a proclivity for scarves .
" To find sex , asshole , " she wrote .
" I 'm sorry ?
You mean it 's for finding people to have sex with ? " I zapped back .
" Yes , I use it for that , " she wrote .
" It 's my birthday , " she added .
" Happy birthday , " I offered .
" Send me a nude pic for my birthday , " she replied .
A friendly offer , but I demurred .
Anonymous geoshagging is not what I had in mind when I imagined what the GPS revolution could mean to me .
The location - aware future — good , bad , and sleazy — is here .
Thanks to the iPhone 3G and , to a lesser extent , Google 's Android phone , millions of people are now walking around with a gizmo in their pocket that not only knows where they are but also plugs into the Internet to share that info , merge it with online databases , and find out what — and who — is in the immediate vicinity .
That old saw about how someday you 'll walk past a Starbucks and your phone will receive a digital coupon for half off on a Frappuccino ?
Yeah , that can happen now .
Simply put , location changes everything .
This one input — our coordinates — has the potential to change all the outputs .
Where we shop , who we talk to , what we read , what we search for , where we go — they all change once we merge location and the Web .
I wanted to know more about this new frontier , so I became a geo - guinea pig .
My plan : Load every cool and interesting location - aware program I could find onto my iPhone and use them as often as possible .
For a few weeks , whenever I arrived at a new place , I would announce it through multiple social geoapps .
When going for a run , bike ride , or drive , I would record my trajectory and publish it online .
I would let digital applications help me decide where to work , play , and eat .
And I would seek out new people based on nothing but their proximity to me at any given moment .
I would be totally open , exposing my location to the world just to see where it took me .
I even added an Eye - Fi Wi-Fi card to my PowerShot digital camera so that all my photos could be geotagged and uploaded to the Web .
I would become the most location - aware person on the Internets !
The trouble started right away .
While my wife and I were sipping stouts at our neighborhood pub in San Francisco ( 37.770401 °N , 122.445154 °W ) , I casually mentioned my plan .
Her eyes narrowed .
" You 're not going to announce to everyone that you 're leaving town without me , are you ?
A lot of weirdos follow you online . "
Sorry , weirdos — I love you , but she has a point .
Because of my work , many people — most of them strangers — track my various Flickr , Twitter , Tumblr , and blog feeds .
And it 's true ; I was going to be gone for a week on business .
Did I really want to tell the world that I was out of town ?
It was n't just leaving my wife home alone that concerned me .
Because the card in my camera automatically added location data to my photos , anyone who cared to look at my Flickr page could see my computers , my spendy bicycle , and my large flatscreen TV all pinpointed on an online photo map .
Hell , with a few clicks you could get driving directions right to my place — and with a few more you could get black gloves and a lock pick delivered to your home .
To test whether I was being paranoid , I ran a little experiment .
On a sunny Saturday , I spotted a woman in Golden Gate Park taking a photo with a 3G iPhone .
Because iPhones embed geodata into photos that users upload to Flickr or Picasa , iPhone shots can be automatically placed on a map .
At home I searched the Flickr map , and score — a shot from today .
I clicked through to the user 's photostream and determined it was the woman I had seen earlier .
After adjusting the settings so that only her shots appeared on the map , I saw a cluster of images in one location .
Clicking on them revealed photos of an apartment interior — a bedroom , a kitchen , a filthy living room .
Now I know where she lives .
Where in the World Is My iPhone ?
To pinpoint your location , your mobile phone talks to cell towers , GPS satellites , and Wi-Fi nodes .
But there 's a trade - off between speed and accuracy .
Here 's how Apple 's handset knows where you are .
— Patrick Di Justo Cell Towers Accuracy : varies ( about 500 meters in our test )
You might think that your iPhone triangulates its location by using multiple cell towers , but it actually needs only one .
After identifying the single nearby tower that it 's pinging , the iPhone queries a database at Google that lists the location of cell towers .
That information is sent back to your phone , telling the device approximately where it is .
Pros : Very fast .
Works anywhere you have a cell signal , including inside .
Cons : Accurate enough to find restaurants , but not for directions .
Wi - Fi Accuracy : 30 meters
The iPhone can also pinpoint its location using Wi-Fi .
A company called Skyhook cruises cities to map the location of Wi-Fi nodes .
The iPhone sniffs them out , measures their signal strength , and reports back to Skyhook 's servers .
Based on its database , Skyhook computes where you must be to have that particular pattern of signal strengths .
Pros : Fast .
Surprisingly accurate if you 're in an area with high network density .
Cons : Useful only in urban areas with lots of Wi -Fi networks .
GPS Accuracy : 10 meters GPS satellites orbit Earth , constantly broadcasting an identification signal , their location in space , and the time on their atomic clock .
The iPhone uses assisted GPS , which means it can tap into an assistance server and a reference network , helping to get a more accurate GPS reading more quickly .
Pros :
By far the most accurate location system available .
Cons : Although A - GPS is much faster than conventional , it 's still rather slow .
And because it requires a view of the sky , it does n't work indoors or in built - up urban areas .
Geo-enthusiasts will assure you that these privacy concerns are overplayed :
Your cell phone can be used to pinpoint your location anyway , and a skilled hacker could likely get that data from your mobile carrier .
Heck , in the UK , tracking mobile phone users is as simple as entering their number on a Web site ( as long as they give permission ) .
But the truth is , there just are n't that many people who want to prey on your location .
Still , I can't help being a little skittish when I start broadcasting my current position and travel plans .
I mean , I used to stop newspaper delivery so people would n't realize I was out of town .
Now I 've told everyone on Dopplr that I 'm going to DC for five days .
And location info gets around .
The first time I saw my home address on Facebook , I jumped — because I never posted it there .
Then I realized it was because I had signed up for Whrrl .
Like many other geosocial applications , Whrrl lets you cross-post to the microblogging platform Twitter .
Twitter , in turn , gets piped to all sorts of other places .
So when I updated my location in Whrrl , the message leaped first to Twitter and then to Facebook and FriendFeed before landing on my blog , where Google indexed it .
By updating one small app on my iPhone , I had left a giant geotagged footprint across the Web .
A few days later I had another disturbing realization .
It 's a Tuesday and I 'm blowing off a work meeting in favor of a bike ride through Golden Gate Park ( 37.771558 °N , 122.454478 °W ) .
Suddenly it hits me — since I would later post my route online with the date and time , I would be just a Google search ( " Mat Honan Tuesday noon " ) away from getting busted .
I'm a freelancer , and these are trying economic times .
I can't afford to have the Internet ratting me out like that .
To learn how to deal with this new openness , I met with Tom Coates at Caffe Centro ( 37.781694 °N , 122.394234 °W ) .
Coates started Fire Eagle , a sort of location clearinghouse :
You tell Fire Eagle where you are , and it sends that info to a host of other geoapps , like Outside . in and Bizroof .
Not only does Fire Eagle save you from having to update the same information on multiple programs , it also lets you specify the level of detail to give each app — precise location , general neighborhood , or just the city you 're in .
The idea is that these options will mitigate privacy concerns .
In addition to this , as Coates puts it : " You have to have the ability to lie about your location . "
Any good social geoapp will let you type in a fake position manually , Coates says .
Great news ; I did n't need to get busted for missing meetings — or deadlines — ever again .
I was starting to revel in the benefits of location awareness .
By trusting an app ( iWant ) that showed me nearby dining options , I discovered an Iraqi joint in my neighborhood that I 'd somehow neglected .
Thanks to an app ( GasBag ) that displayed gas stations with current prices , I was able to find the cheapest petrol no matter where I drove .
In Reno , one program ( HeyWhats That ) even gave me the names and elevation profiles of all the surrounding mountains .
And another ( WikiMe ) , which displayed Wikipedia entries about local points of interest , taught me a thing or two about the San Francisco waterfront .
( Did you know the Marina District exists largely because a land speculator built a seawall in the 1890s ? )
These GPS tools were making me smarter .
And more social .
While working downtown one day , it looked like I was going to have to endure a lonely burrito lunch by myself .
So I updated my location and asked for company .
My friend Mike saw my post on Twitter and dropped by on his way to the office .
Later , I met up with a couple of people I had previously known only online :
After learning I would be just around the corner from their office , we agreed to get together for coffee .
One of them , it turns out , works in a field I cover and gave me a tip on a story .
But then , two weeks into the experiment , I bumped into my friend Mindy at the Dovre Club ( 37.749008 °N , 122.420547 °W ) .
She mentioned my constant updates , which she 'd noticed on Facebook .
" It seems sort of odd , " she said with a note of concern .
" I 've been a little worried about you .
I thought , ' Wow , Mat must be really lonely . ' "
I explained that I was n't actually begging for company ; I was just telling people where I was .
But it 's an understandable misperception .
This is new territory , and there 's no established etiquette or protocol .
This issue came up again while having dinner with a friend at Greens ( 37.806679 °N , 122.432131 °W ) , an upscale vegetarian restaurant .
Of course , I thought nothing of broadcasting my location .
But moments after we were seated , two other friends — Randy and Cameron — showed up , obviously expecting to join us .
Randy squatted at the end of the table .
Cameron stood .
After a while , it became apparent that no more chairs would be coming , so they left awkwardly .
I felt bad , but I had n't really invited them .
Or had I ?

UPDATE : Marc Ambinder reports that Plouffe sent him an email saying he wo n’t be taking the DNC chair .
But Plouffe would n’t say what he might be doing post-election .
Howard Dean is stepping down as chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
This is no surprise ; it ’s been known for months he would be departing after the election .
The question is , who ’s next ?
HuffingtonPost reports one possibility is that Dean will be replaced by a duo : Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri , who would be the talk - show face of the party , and an operative who would do the operating ( perhaps Steve Hildebrand , who was deputy campaign manager for Barack Obama ’s presidential bid ) .
But should n’t the DNC job go to David Plouffe ?
As the manager of Obama ’s campaign , Plouffe steered the best - run presidential campaign in years .
He put together an effective campaign structure .
He efficiently matched man , message , money , and machine .
Developing his own version of Dean ’s 50 - state strategy , Plouffe expanded the electoral map for Democrats .
In public , he projected an image of calm , confidence , and competence .
His public spin was always tethered to reality .
He came across a master mechanic who believed in the mission , not an ideologue or a grandstander .
And he beat the toughest , most experienced operation in politics : the Clintons .
It ’s no put - down of McCaskill to suggest Plouffe .
Naming her DNC chief –with or without a partner –would have symbolic value .
And she was an effective advocate for Obama , especially when he was locked in a fierce battle with Senator Hillary Clinton , though Obama appears to have lost her home state by 6000 votes .
Perhaps if McCaskill becomes DNC head , that would help Obama and Dems narrow that narrow gap next time .
But Job
One of the new DNC chair is to win the 2010 congressional elections as a prelude to winning reelection for Barack Obama in 2012 .
The party does n’t need a visionary or public leader in the position .
Obama can handle those tasks .
( The party on the outs is the one that requires a posterboy or postergirl who is good on television . )
The Democrats need an uber - operative who can simultaneously oversee scores of critical House and Senate races , supervise the early reelection effort , and chart out the overall mission of advancing the party ’s interests across the country .
The next DNC chair should also know a thing or two about fundraising and be able to transform the party into the receptacle for all the grassroots energy and passion that poured into the Obama campaign .
Who better than Plouffe to do all this ?
Maybe he does n’t want the job .
( His wife just gave birth to their second child . )
And there have been far - fetched rumors that Plouffe , a Delaware native , could be appointed to fill Joe Biden ’s Senate seat .
But Obama ’s victory is transformational in many ways , and one potential transformation could occur at the Democratic Party , with the party becoming something of a central command and midwife for a diverse array of Internet - enabled grassroots activity across the country in support of the Obama presidency and its policy initiatives .
Making that happen would certainly increase the odds that the Obama presidency will be a successful one .
Judging by the election results , Plouffe is someone who can turn a heady vision like that into an on - the - ground reality .

Google continues to trim off its underperforming services , this time cutting one that had been met with skepticism when it launched but nevertheless garnered some support .
On Tuesday , the search giant announced it would close its Print Ads service .
The program launched in 2006 and was met with raised eyebrows because it meant Google , an online specialist , would be venturing into print .
Print
Ads allowed anyone with a Google AdWords account to buy advertising in the print editions of any newspaper that joined the program .
AdWords is Google 's online advertising platform .
While Print
Ads started out with 50 newspaper partners , it now has more than 800 , Google said .
Despite attracting those newspapers , many of which are desperate to find new ways to generate revenue , Print Ads apparently has n't performed well .
" While we hoped that Print Ads would create a new revenue stream for newspapers and produce more relevant advertising for consumers , the product has not created the impact that we -- or our partners -- wanted , " Spencer Spinnell , director of Google Print Ads , wrote in a blog post announcing the closure of the service .
Google plans to shut down the service on Feb. 28 .
Spinnell said that a team at Google will continue to investigate new ways to help newspaper companies .
That 's despite the company 's sometimes - uneasy relationship with the publishing industry .
Some publishers , particularly in Europe , have accused Google of copyright theft for displaying snippets of their content on sites like Google News without permission .
Google was building new features for Print Ads as recently as October , when it added an image gallery where users could find free photos to incorporate in their ads .
But over the past several months , the bulk of the announcements on Google 's " Let 's Take it Offline " blog have been about new features in Google 's TV and audio advertising services , with little mention of Print Ads .
Shutting down Print
Ads appears to be part of the house cleaning that Google admitted to last week , when it announced it would close several other services including Google Video , Jaiku , Mashup Editor , Dodgeball , Catalog Search and Google Notebook .
" In the last few months we 've been taking a long , hard look at all the things we are doing to ensure we are investing our resources in the projects that will have the biggest impact for our users and partners , " Spinnell wrote in Tuesday 's post .
" By moving resources away from projects that are n't having the impact we want , we can refocus our efforts on those that will delight millions of users . "
Despite Google 's successes in recent years , the services closures show that it too is not immune to the economic meltdown .
It also recently laid off 100 recruiters and consolidated some engineering offices .
Teaching safe sex in India via a singing and dancing group of condoms has all the makings of an entertaining time .
This is another one of those cases where something completely hilarious escaped my attention until now .
That does n’t stop me from sharing it with you , because if you have n’t seen it either , it ’s new to you !
From The Observers :
“ Our main target groups are people vulnerable to the HIV virus like sex workers , transsexuals or truck drivers .
We tour villages in mobile video vans to show the film .
The screening is followed by a question and answer session about condom use and sexually transmitted diseases .
We also encourage the use of female condoms , a relatively new concept .
We tell the women to negotiate the use of female condoms with their male partners : for men with little sex education , the insertion of the female condom in the vagina can in itself be an erotic act . ”
For the past 11 years , P Narsingh Rao , director of Nrityanjali academy , a socio-cultural group based in Hyderabad , has been using the performing arts to promote awareness :
A group of Indian campaigners is singing and dancing their way to the glorification of condom use .
It ’s a crucial fight in their central region , where two percent of the population is HIV positive .
And the result – a Bollywood style video clip – is hilarious .
Amazingly , this video is 7 minutes long , because I guess a 30 second , “ The More you Know ” campaign just did n’t get the job done :
And in case you were interested in the full lyrics so you can sing this song to your lady friend :

Protesters unfurl ' Arrest Bush & Cheney ' banner at Nat'l Archives Mike Sheehan and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Anti-war protesters hung a banner today at the National Archives calling for the arrest of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
The 22 - foot - long banner in red , white and black reads , " Defend Our Constitution - Arrest Bush / Cheney ! - War Criminals ! "
The protesters , perched on a ledge at the historic building in Washington , D.C. , additionally claim to be on a hunger strike .
According to a press release , the five are military combat veterans from the anti-war group Veterans For Peace who intend to stay on the ledge and fast for a full day " in remembrance of those who have perished and those still suffering from the crimes of the Bush administration . "
An Archives spokesperson had no comment when asked if authorities were planning to take action to stop the peaceful protest .

The 6 - foot - 7 former Division III goaltender , who 's worked for the team for nearly a year , dressed as the Caps ' backup goalie for their game against the Ottawa Senators .
After Jose
Theodore went down with a hip flexor injury during the morning skate , Leonhardt signed an amateur tryout contract and was in uniform for the pregame warmup and the first half of the first period , backing up Brent Johnson .
Simeon Varlamov , who was recalled from the minors but could n't get to the Verizon Center before the game , arrived and replaced him on the bench for the rest of the Caps ' 5 - 1 win .
Those 10 minutes were something he 'll never forget .
" It was the greatest day of my life , " he told NHL.com after finishing his regular work updating the team 's Web site following the game .
" Winning a championship in junior and going away to college , I had some great nights , but this takes the cake .
" Leonhardt , who has served as an occasional fill - in goalie at practices , said he got the word during the morning skate that he might be filling a different function than he usually does on game nights .
" Jose had a short practice , " he said during a between - periods interview during the Caps ' game telecast .
" George ( McPhee , the Caps ' GM ) , kind of came into my cubicle , tapped me on the shoulder and just told me , ' Make sure your gear is down at Verizon and be ready to go at five . '" Varlamov was on the road with Hershey , the Caps ' top farm team , which played at San Antonio on Thursday night .
He flew from Houston , where the Bears play Saturday , when he got the call , and headed for Washington — but the Caps knew he would n't get there in time for the 7:05 p.m. faceoff , so they got a dispensation from the NHL to dress three goaltenders .
Caps coach Bruce Boudreau said he was n't worried .
" Once I left the arena it was all done and I did n't think about it until I got back and found out ( Varlamov ) was n't going to make it here , and then you start worrying about it again , " Boudreau said in his postgame news conference .
" To me it 's a moot point .
We either have Brett , yes , or we do n't , and we have Varley , and I can't let that consume 90 percent of my day when it 's only maybe 10 percent of the problem at this point .
Now if Brett could n't go , then I might have been a little worried .
But Brett was tossing pucks to the crowd like he knew what he was doing , so I had no fears .
" Leonhardt said the Caps players were pumped up to have him on the ice for warmups .
" They were awesome .
They could n't have been better , " he told NHL.com .
" I 've practiced a couple times with the team , so the guys were familiar with me , and I travel with the team because I do the Web site .
The guys were cheering and high - fiving me .
" Before the game , they were telling me , ' Be yourself .
You 've been doing this your whole life . '
They made me feel really comfortable .
In the warmup , I did n't want them to not shoot their hardest because it was me .
I tried to challenge them — get them ready for the game .
" While Leonhardt was taking part in the warmup , Varlamov ’s plane was touching down and he was hurriedly getting dressed in the car en route from the airport to the Verizon Center , with Ian Anderson , director of team services , at the wheel .
Varlamov replaced Leonhardt , who wore No. 80 , on the Caps ’ bench midway through the first period .
What was Leonhardt 's reaction when he realized his brief NHL " career " was coming to an end ?
" For a while , I was hoping he would hurry up , because there were some goaltender interference calls , " Leonhardt said .
" When I saw him , the first thought was , " Good , he 's here , " because you think about the team first .
After that it was , ' Aw , it 's over . '" Though Leonhardt did n't see any action , it was n't impossible that he could have — he skated at Thursday 's practice because Johnson had a sore hip after a fall during Wednesday 's 3 - 1 win over Boston , and Boudreau wanted to give him the day off .
" It did n't cross my mind , " he said during the between - periods interview of the possibility of actually facing shots in an NHL game .
" Before the game , I was talking with ( goaltending coach ) Dave Prior , and he was telling me tendencies of the ' D ' and communication , and I was like , ' Dave , let 's hope we do n't have to worry about that .
'" Leonhardt , 26 , played two years for SUNY Oswego in New York and two years for Neumann College near Philadelphia .
According to U.S. College Hockey Online , the Waterloo , Ontario , native had a 13 - 2 - 2 record in 21 appearances during his four years in college , including a 7 - 1 - 2 mark with a 2.66 goals - against average and one shutout in 2004 - 05 , his second year at Oswego .
His one regret was that his parents did n't get to see the game , though they did see him later on television highlight packages .
" Because of the flight stuff .
I told my parents to be aware — to try to find somewhere that had the Center Ice package — but they could n't , " he said .
" They live in Grand Bend , Ontario , in the middle of nowhere .
They could n't find a bar or anywhere that had Center Ice .
They did n't get to watch the game .
" After the game , it was back to the more mundane duties of a Web producer .
" I had to do my job after that , " Leonhardt said in a phone interview with NHL.com that took place after his Web work was done .
" I did n't get the night off . "
Pelosi wants investigation of Bush officials , open to prosecutions David Edwards and Jeremy Gantz

In a Sunday morning interview with Fox 's Chris Wallace , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signaled that she 's open to backing prosecutions of Bush administration officials that may arise from congressional hearings .
" I think we have to learn from the past and we cannot let the politicizing of , for example , the Justice Department to go unreviewed , " said Pelosi .
" The past is prologue , we learn from it ... I want to see the truth come forth . "
The California Democrat suggested that the Bush administration 's politicized Justice Department 's should be further investigated for wrongdoings .
" I think you look at each item and see what is a violation of the law and do we even have a right to ignore it , " Pelosi said .
" We have a contempt of Congress against members of the executive branch who withheld information from us . "
On January 6th , House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) unveiled a bill that would create a commission to investigate questionable policies of the Bush administration , including torture and wiretapping programs .
Named the National Commission on Presidential War Powers and Civil Liberties , the panel comprise " experts outside government service " who would review the Bush administration 's " claims of unreviewable war powers . "
Obama has not ruled out prosecution of Bush administration officals , but he recently called President Bush " a good guy . "

British musician Leo Sayer has become one of Australia 's newest citizens .
He was one of 60 people to become citizens during an Australia Day ceremony in Canberra attended by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
Sayer says he first visited Australia more than 30 years ago and now he has decided to make it his home .
" I think a lot of people know I love this country and always have done , " he said .
" Coming down here in ' 74 I think for the first tour ...
I just love this place and everything about it .
It 's nice when you 're popular because it does kind of influence you to think ' they all want me here ' . "
Like I did last time I have chosen again three games .
The first game is from Primera Division , Barcelona against Valencia .
A derby in Spain , that ended with the categorical victory for Barcelona .
Valencia have not lost any game away of all season and was expected to be a difficult game for Barcelona .
In the absence of Eto ’o , Henry was allowed to play a more free role in attack and the difference was seen .
Henry put up an amazing performance , scoring a hat - trick and marked Barcelona ’s 20th game without defeat .
Barcelona won the game 4 - 0 with the goals of Henry and Alves .
Their next championship game will be against eternal rivals Real Madrid .
The next game is from Serie A , Lazio against Inter .
Probably this is the best game of Inter since Mourinho ’s arrival .
Inter showed again the power and the efficiency that we used to in the last couple of seasons .
Ibrahimovic had an outstanding match and showed everybody why he is the best paid football player in the world .
The game ended with a smashing 3 - 0 victory for Inter .
The goals were scored by Samuel , Diakite own goal and Ibrahimovic .
Inter controlled the game from start to finish showing efficiency both in defence and attack .
This is the sixth straight victory for Inter that maintain the six points difference in front of Juventus and Milan .
The third game and in my view the best one is also from Primera , Real Madrid against Sevilla .
Another bad performance for Real Madrid which seems that is not recovering from the bad period .
Again the defence proved to be the weakest department .
Sevilla were controlling the game and at half - time the score was already 3 - 1 for them .
Adriano , Romaric and Kanoute all scored and gave Sevilla a comanding lead .
Raul was the scorer for Real .
The second half was better for Real which managed to equalize after Higuain and Gago goals .
It looked like Real could turn the score into their favor , but Robben ’s red card set the hosts back and Renato scored a dramatic goal which settled the victory for Sevilla .
An interesting transfer campain is announcing for Real Madrid this winter and Bernd Schuster days at Real are counted .
The next game against Barcelona could be decisive for him .

How to Think Better : The Top 8 Tips from the Last 2500 Years

Follow me on Twitter .Â
â€ Did you ever stop to think , and forget to start again ?â€ 
Winnie the Pooh
â€ The world we have created is a product of our thinking ; it can not be changed without changing our thinking .â€ 
Albert Einstein
When I was younger I used to think that thinking was the best thing since sliced bread .
So I thought .
And though and thought .
And then I thought some more .
It had some wonderful and positive effects such as helping me to get good grades in school .
But on the other hand this thinking was also trapping me and limiting me in various ways .
One of my biggest insights in recent years is that there are a lot of both positive and negative sides to how you think .
So learning to use my thinking in a better way has become a main focus and also one of the most beneficial things I have ever done .
Now , this may sound a little vague so I letâ€™s explore some of the facets of thinking with the timeless help from clever people that have gone before us .
1 . You are what you think .
â€ œAs you think , so shall you become.â€ 
Bruce Lee
Understanding this is essential to start thinking in more useful ways .
Itâ€™s perhaps the most basic statement of how we work .
Think about what you are thinking today .
What do those thoughts say about you ?
About your life ?
And how well do they really match your plans for your life and your image of yourself ?
Itâ€™s easy to forget about this simple statement in everyday life .
Itâ€™s easy to be quite incongruent with what you think on an ordinary day compared to how you view yourself and your goals .
A simple external reminder such as a post - it with this quote can be helpful to keep you and your thoughts on the right track .
A brilliant and beautiful expansion on this thought can be found in James Allenâ€™s â€ œAs a man thinkethâ€ ( that can be downloaded for free here ) .
2 . Thinking has its place .
â€ œTake time to deliberate ; but when the time for action arrives , stop thinking and go in.â€ 
Napoleon Bonaparte
â€ Chi Wen
Tzu always thought three times before taking action .
Â
Twice would have been quite enough.â€ 
Confucius
Thinking has its place .
But it can never replace action .
I sometimes think there is some kind of wish when overthinking that thinking will somehow replace action .
A wish that if you just think enough you can find some easy way out .
Or get what you want without having to actually do something .
Without taking action youâ€™ll most likely not get what you want .
Thinking is however seldom as scary or uncertain as taking the leap into the unknown and taking action .
So it can become a place where you hide from taking action and then rationalize to yourself in different ways how all this thinking will help you .
Even though you know deep down that what you really want and need is to take action and get going .
If youâ€™re having trouble taking action then you may also want to check out Do You Make These 5 Mistakes When You Try to Take Action ? and How to Take More Action : 9 Powerful Tips .
3 . Your mind can become a prison .
â€ œMen are not prisoners of fate , but only prisoners of their own minds.â€ 
Franklin D Roosevelt
â€ œIt is neither good nor bad , but thinking makes it so.â€ 
William Shakespeare
â€ œLoving people live in a loving world .
Hostile people live in a hostile world .
Same world.â€
Wayne Dyer
Thinking isnâ€™t always all it may be cracked up to be .
What you believe about yourself and the world is what you will see and find .
Hereâ€™s the big problem though : when you are in your prison cell you canâ€™t see it .
You think your beliefs and what see is reality and that it has you boxed in .
But itâ€™s just a perspective .
So you have to take a leap of faith and try out a new belief and viewpoint to actually experience a change in your world .
Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of thinking : â€œwell , when I see some proof of this being true then I might make a change in how I thinkâ€ .
Such reasoning doesnâ€™t really work that well because itâ€™s just theory and itâ€™s seen from your current perspective .
Your mind wonâ€™t allow you to see what isnâ€™t aligned with your current beliefs .
Or you will just disregard it as nonsense or something that may work for someone else but not you .
You mind wants to keep your perspective of the world stable .
I think itâ€™s better to think about what would be most beneficial for me .
Yes , you may see a lot of proof in the world that your current negative attitude is the correct one to have .
But donâ€™t you think a positive attitude would be even more useful to make you happy and successful ?
If you do , check out 8 Awesome Reasons to Blast Negativity Out of Your Life , and How To Do It .
4 . We are emotional creatures .
â€ œPeople mistakenly assume that their thinking is done by their head ; it is actually done by the heart which first dictates the conclusion , then commands the head to provide the reasoning that will defend it.â€ 
Anthony de Mello
â€ œWhen dealing with people , remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic , but creatures of emotion.â€ 
Dale Carnegie
Itâ€™s alluring to think you are someone in complete control .
Someone who controls his / her life with a good head on those shoulders .
But your emotions play a huge role .
Sure , everyone likes to think of themselves as smart and in control .
And the mind is fond of thinking that itâ€™s in pretty much complete control too .
The thought that what we do is often based in an emotional response to something that happens to us and we later on rationalize as the right thing to do isnâ€™t as appealing .
The ego that is based in the awesomeness of human thinking doesnâ€™t like that .
Such theories may make us seem just a bit too much like animals for the ego to be happy about it .
This may sound a bit depressing but I also think it is very important to keep in mind .
So you donâ€™t blindly follow what your thoughts are telling you .
So you become more attentive to your emotions ( and other peopleâ€™s emotions too ) .
And so you can make decisions that are more based in whatâ€™s helpful and positive rather than for example based on old emotional fear patterns you may have .
Word and thoughts are important in our lives .
But donâ€™t underestimate the importance and power of emotions .
5 . Think for yourself .
â€ œThink for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so , tooâ€ 
Voltaire
This is not always easy though .
But it is very important to learn to trust your own judgement and thoughts .
Itâ€™s easy to assume that someone that you view as an authority is telling is the truth .
There is however just opinions , no matter who is speaking .
Sure , it can sometimes be easier to just do what someone else says .
It takes some of the responsibility off you for your life ( you can always blame them when things go wrong ) .
And taking it the other way and becoming totally unreasonable is of course not helpful either .
But you have to make yourself the highest authority in your life .
It canâ€™t be your parents , boss or some personal development guru .
Let other people think for themselves .
Listen to what they have to say .
But find a lot more freedom within and in your world by holding your own opinion the highest .
6 . Donâ€™t worry what others are thinking about you .
â€ œAt the age of 20 , we do n't care what the world thinks of us ; at 30 , we worry about what it is thinking of us ; at 40 , we discover that it was n't thinking of us at all.â€ 
Unknown
â€ œI have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men , but yet sets less value on his own opinions of himself than on the opinions of others.â€ 
Marcus Aurelius
The biggest part of thinking and doing what you really want is to stop caring so much about what other people think of you .
A lot of the actions you take â€ “ or do not take – may be because you need approval from other people .
When we are young we get grades in school that tells us that we are â€œgoodâ€ .
This makes it very easy to create a life where you always go looking for the world to give you the next hit of approval .
It may be from your family , boss , friends , co-workers and so on .
But this need creates neediness .
And the stronger the need the stronger the neediness .
And so other people will sense this .
And approval may be withheld or used to manipulate you .
Or they may just not like your neediness .
The people on the other hand that does not care that much about getting approval often do more of what they want deep inside .
They may be considered courageous for instance .
So the way they live their lives will gain appreciation and approval from the people around them .
Itâ€™s a bit counterintuitive .
7 . When you think , think in a constructive way .
â€ œThe ‘ how ' thinker gets problems solved effectively because he wastes no time with futile ‘ ifs '.â€ 
Norman Vincent Peale .
Itâ€™s very easy to spend your time thinking and imagining all the horrible things that may happen if you stand up and face the obstacles and troubles in life .
But if you actually do that those negative images seldom come into life .
They are just huge monsters that you build in your mind .
Just like you did when you were a kid and imagined monsters in the closet or under your bed .
When you actually stand up and face your obstacles you may find that the experience isnâ€™t as bad as you imagined .
Sometimes itâ€™s actually a bit anti-climatic .
You think to yourself : â€ What ?!
Is this it ?â€ .
So , after having done some thinking about how to go about doing something donâ€™t fall into the trap of overthinking and monster - building .
Just go and do what you need to do instead .
8. Donâ€™t think .
Just be here now .
â€ œRealize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have .
Make the Now the primary focus of your life.â€ 
Eckhart Tolle
â€ œTrue salvation is freedom from negativity , and above all from past and future as a psychological need.â€ 
Eckhart Tolle
Many times the best thing you can do is to not think at all .
Well , maybe itâ€™s a bit of thinking , I donâ€™t really know but itâ€™s like your mind is empty .
You are fully present in this moment .
Without dozens of thoughts running through your mind like a wild river .
There is stillness within .
This is not just a very enjoyable state of mind .
It is also practically perhaps the most useful state of mind .
Because when you are present your focus is not split .
Your thoughts are not in the past or future .
And so there is very little fear or negative emotions inside of you . Â
This is the perfect state of mind to take action .
When you do something while being present the anxiety or fear that comes from thinking about for example the future ( â€œwill I lose this race ? â€ ) disappears .
This increases the quality of whatever you do while being present .
Being present also makes you more creative because you let your subconscious puzzle together impressions and concepts until you get an idea .
Often in the shower or someplace like that .
Because there you arenâ€™t actively thinking about a solution .
Your subconscious gets some space to work while you focus your conscious mind on not getting soap in the eyes .
Finally , being present makes any activity more enjoyable because the suffering you may feel often comes from a split focus or just too much thoughts running around in your head .
My favourite way to reconnect with the present moment right now it to see everything as I was seeing it for the first time .
I imagine it like that , I take that role .
Like someone who has never experienced this before .
Like a child or someone who has never been here before .
I like this one and I have been doing it from time to time for years ( although back then I didnâ€™t really understand why it felt nice when I did it ) .

And it has nothing to do with the waterboarding , cattle prods or sleep deprivation – they just wanted to get it off their chest
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , December 9 , 2008
The government is set to wheel out five more tortured detainees in a desperate effort to prop up the thoroughly discredited official 9/11 story , including another appearance for the ultimate patsy – Khalid Sheik Mohammed .
“ Five detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , say they want to confess to conspiracy charges for planning the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , a Pentagon spokeswoman said Monday , ” reports CNN .
“ Khalid Sheikh Mohammed — the confessed architect of the attacks , who was captured two years later in Pakistan — and four other alleged co-conspirators asked a military judge if they could withdraw all pending motions and plead guilty , Maj. Gail Crawford said in an e-mail . ”
“ The military judge accepted the requests from Mohammed , Ali Abdul Azziz Ali and Walid bin Attash , but ruled that competency hearings are first needed for Mustafa al Hawsawi and Ramzi bin al Shibh , because “ questions exist as to their competency to stand trial , ” Crawford said . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The new set of “ confessions ” will hold about as much credibility of those of purported “ 9/11 mastermind ” Khalid Sheik Mohammed when he first spilled the beans in March 2007 , After only five years of torture , KSM confessed to nearly everything under the sun , only stopping short at accepting responsibility for killing Kennedy , creating AIDS and being the real Santa Claus .
Indeed , KSM was so keen on never seeing a cattle prod again that he even confessed to being responsible for attacking banks that were founded after his arrest , seemingly invoking the power of long range telekinesis to commit his dastardly deeds .
KSM mentioned the “ Plaza Bank ” by name despite the fact that it only came into existence in 2006 , three years after his arrest .
Either KSM has the power to influence objects with his mind or we were lied to , but the media and the government would never do that , would they ?
Medieval Justice : A little encouragement and the confession was obtained !
After all , it ’s a reasonably safe bet to trust a press release from a heavily redacted secret military tribunal of a tortured detainee conducted by individuals representative of an oligarchy whose every deception , gross violation of U.S. law , and act of imperial bloodletting over the last seven years rests on maintaining the orthodoxy of the official 9/11 myth .
And it ’s a safe bet in the case of the Gitmo detainees – the waterboarding , the sleep deprivation and the beatings have got nothing to do with it , these guys simply want to get things off their chest and tell the truth about their role in 9/11 .
I ’m sure being chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the floor for 18 hours or more a day , urinating and defecating on themselves , led in no way whatsoever to the detainees telling their captors whatever they wanted to hear .
In reality , polls at the time showed a massive 74 % disbelieved KSM ’s numerous confessions and the same skepticism is likely to emerge this time around , but not with any influence from the corporate media , who are happily playing up the “ confessions ” and taking them as gospel without stopping for a second to question if they were obtained through torture .

Ohhhohohoh ... * wipes tear from eye *
That was great , I 'm still laughing .
From the tracks of the High Line – the derelict elevated railway on New York ’s Lower West Side currently being transformed into a mile - and - a - half - long “ park in the sky ” – this most bustling of cities seems suddenly quiet and still .
Three storeys above the hubbub of Chelsea – where a few days earlier people had queued round the block to vote for Barack Obama – even the perpetual horns of taxi cabs seem muted , and the only human voices heard are the occasional shouts from workmen .
The Hudson river flows gently out towards the skyscrapers of Jersey City .
Golfers thwack balls towards the huge nets of Chelsea Piers .
Up on the tracks , the concrete path that will form the backbone of the new park splits off in places to weave between seed beds , recalling the plant life that sprang up between the tracks during nearly 30 years of disuse .
Elsewhere , between new wooden benches and young beech and pine trees , stretches of the steel track have been restored to their original positions .
At two points during this first section of the line – due to open in spring – the route ducks right through huge gaps in private buildings where goods trains used to deliver directly to the upper floors of warehouses .
The park will end at a new public plaza in the fashionable Meatpacking District , overlooked by a new outpost of the Whitney Museum of American Art .
The High Line has attracted embarrassingly lavish praise since the project to save and renovate it began almost a decade ago .
In 2001 , Adam Gopnik of the New Yorker wrote of the then - overgrown and under - threat tracks : “ The High Line does not offer a God ’s - eye view of the city , exactly , but something rarer , the view of a lesser angel : of a cupid in a Renaissance painting , of the putti looking down on the Nativity manger . ”
But Friends of the High Line , the campaign group that saved the line from demolition and is now in charge of rebuilding it , seems to be seeking a simpler reaction from the public , something closer to photographer Joel Sternfield ’s verdict upon seeing the tracks for the first time : “ It ’s green !
It ’s a railroad !
It ’s rural !
Where am I ? ”
The High Line was constructed in the early 1930s as part of New York ’s West Side railway .
Train tracks had originally been built at ground level along the middle of 10th Avenue , but this proved so dangerous that the stretch became known as “ Death Avenue ” , and trains had to be preceded by a man on horseback , nicknamed the West Side Cowboy , waving a red flag as a warning to pedestrians .
The High Line was the solution .
A mile and a half long and 30ft above street level at its highest point , it stretched from the Meatpacking District on the Lower West Side up to West 34th Street , level with the Empire State Building , covering 22 blocks in total .
At certain points the tracks disappeared into the upper floors of warehouse buildings in order to deliver meat , milk or manufactured goods , reappearing again on the other side .
But as the freight industry switched from rail to road , use of the High Line declined .
Part of it was pulled down in the 1960s , and the last train ran in 1980 , carrying “ three boxcars full of frozen turkeys ” for Thanksgiving , according to actor Ethan Hawke , who narrates a video about the line on the Friends of the High Line website .
In the years that followed , residents and businesses in Chelsea lobbied for the disused tracks – now overgrown with weeds and plants – to be torn down .
In 1999 , two locals , Joshua David and Robert Hammond , met at a community meeting and formed the idea of trying to save the High Line and turn it into a “ park in the sky ” .
“ We looked for other organisations working to save the structure but nobody was , ” says David .
A former magazine writer , David was working on an article about the changing face of Chelsea when he first noticed the line .
“ It just captured my imagination .
It seemed like an amazing opportunity to create something that would allow people to experience the city in an utterly new way .
To go and tear it down without considering how we could use it seemed a waste to me . ”
After forming Friends of the High Line , David and Hammond persuaded the rail company that then owned the site to take them up on to the tracks .
“ It was extremely exciting , ” says David .
“ We went up through one of the old factory buildings .
I remember stepping out on to the tracks , and there ’s an incredible 13 - block - long stretch immediately : this incredible vista of wild grasses and flowers .
It took my breath away . ”
With the help of celebrity backers such as Hawke , fellow actor Edward Norton , and designer Diane von Fürstenberg , FHL managed to overturn mayor Rudy Giuliani ’s demolition orders and get the new administration of Michael Bloomberg behind the project .
The group held a design competition for the refurbishment or reuse of the tracks , and proposals – including a rollercoaster and a mile - and - a - half - long swimming pool – were publicly displayed at Grand Central station .
The winning design , by Field Operations and Diller Scofidio +
Renfro , was chosen in 2004 , and resembles a long walkway above the streets , flanked by lawns , flowers and trees , with numerous benches and access points via stairs and escalators .
The model seems to be the Promenade Plantée in Paris , another elevated railway that has been remade as a long , overhead public park .
Also similar is north London ’s Parkland Walk , a trail following the line of a former train track from Finsbury Park to Alexandra Palace .
Groundbreaking for the new High Line took place in April 2006 , with Bloomberg in attendance as well as New York senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer , and the first stretch of the line is set to be completed early next year , with the second finished in 2010 .
The line runs through former industrial neighbourhoods now defined by flats , restaurants , nightclubs , art , and fashion , and this area is being transformed by the project .
The 2005 re-zoning that approved the park also allowed for new construction alongside the track and last year New York magazine identified an already - emerging “ High Line neighbourhood ” , complete with “ glittering retail spaces and restaurants and condos ” , as well as High Line - themed restaurants and festivals .
In what may be a sign of things to come , in September Calvin Klein celebrated its 40th anniversary by building a temporary structure leading up to a section of the line and throwing a party up there featuring actors Halle Berry , Claire Danes and Jared Leto , among others .
A couple of streets up from the new Whitney outpost , LA ’s celebrity - friendly Standard hotel is set to open a branch above the line between 12th and 13th Streets .
David says the credit crunch has had some impact on all this building work .
“ There was a flurry of building starts at the time the High Line was approved ; there are certainly fewer things starting now .
But there is still an extraordinary amount of activity : cranes all over the place and numerous buildings under construction .
“ We hoped it would attract architects and developers who would create extraordinary and original buildings along it – and that ’s really come to pass . ”
David hopes the High Line will not only be used by people strolling to work or eating lunch , but will also become “ a real destination for visitors to New York … a cultural destination ” .
Craig Schwitter of Buro Happold , the lead engineer on the project , suggests it could host open - air markets , concerts and other artistic events .
The project that began with an attempt to save the elevated wilderness that Alan Weisman , in his book The World Without Us , identified as an example of nature taking back the urban landscape has now morphed into something rather different : a regeneration project for an entire neighbourhood .
But David is happy with that .
“ It ’s at once a preservation project about the city ’s past and a construction project about the city ’s future , ” he says .
“ The High Line has always evoked the passage of time , with the incredible landscape that has sprung up on top of it . ”
He had wanted the new design to retain some of that original , unique landscape , “ but there was no way it could be walked on without being destroyed .
The challenge for the design team was to do that and allow the public to come up in a safe and accessible way . ”
To that end , the plan uses plant material “ pushing up through walkways ” and reintroduces railway tracks in a number of locations .
At two locations the new High Line will go through “ doughnut holes ” in private buildings , just like the old freight trains did when the buildings were warehouses .
“ It will be quite clear to visitors how it worked , ” says David .
David , 45 , and Hammond , 39 , a former painter and consultant , now run Friends of the High Line full - time .
The group , which has a staff of 16 , is itself now transforming – into a “ conservancy ” , an organisation that will manage and maintain the park in partnership with New York City council .
David and Hammond are currently trying to raise both the $ 50 m to build the park ( $ 22 m has been raised already ) and an unspecified sum to maintain it and pay for staff once it has been completed .
Yet above 30th Street , where the line snakes around the West Side rail yards , FHL is still the campaigning group it once was .
This section of the line is still under threat and could be torn down as part of the redevelopment of that area .
“ That ’s something we are fighting very strongly , ” says David .
That part of the line has not yet been designed , although the basic plan is to connect it to the Hudson River Park at 34th Street .
New York is a city of spectacular views from towering vantage points .
But according to David the High Line is different .
“ It ’s called the High Line , but it ’s not that high .
It ’s three storeys off the ground .
I think that ’s what ’s so special .
It ’s not that experience on top of the Empire State Building where everybody is like ants or little toys .
You can shout down to people on the street .
It ’s connected to street life but at a distance .
There ’s a sense of remove . ”
“ There used to be a lot of elevated rail in the city , ” notes Schwitter , “ but that was all removed after world war two . ”
The High Line restores that perspective , he says .
“ A quieter perspective , somewhere to walk quietly , and observe the city . ”

HAML ‘s lovely .
As I ’ve been working with Turbinado , I ’ve been having some issues with HSP .
HSP is an insanely impressive piece of software , but its error messages can be a bit unclear .
So I started playing around a bit with HAML .
Got me wondering “ How easy would be to write a HAML parser in Haskell ? ”
So I tried .
Here ’s a first - pass , to - be- updated [ and somewhat incomplete ] HAML parser for Haskell .
Not all of the features are implemented , but it ’s a start .
It generates HTML bits suitable for compilation by GHC .
Input
f = content page = # content .left.column %h2 Welcome to our site ! %p = print_information %p = print_inline .right.column = render [ abba = ding , ding = abba ] dinger
Output
f = ( stringToHtml " content " ) page = ( ( tag " div " ![ strAttr " id " " content " ] ) ( ( tag " div " ![ strAttr " class " " left column " ] ) ( ( tag " h2 " ) ( stringToHtml " Welcome to our site ! " ) ) +++ ( ( tag " p " ) ( stringToHtml print_information ) ) +++ ( ( tag " p " ) ( stringToHtml print_inline ) ) +++ ( ( tag " div " ![ strAttr " class " " right column " ] ) ( stringToHtml render ) ) +++ ( ( tag " div " ![ strAttr " abba " " ding " , strAttr " ding " " abba " ] ) ( stringToHtml " dinger " ) ) ) )

Nearly half of politics .
co.uk users feel more sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians following the conflict in Gaza , an on - site survey has revealed .
In a highly polarised set of results , a slim majority respondents sided with the Palestinians , with 49 per cent saying they felt more pro-Palestinian since the fighting started .
That compared to 41 per cent who said they felt more pro-Israeli .
Forty - four per cent of respondents described the Israeli attack as a war crime .
Thirty - five described it as ' necessary ' .
Eight per cent described it as proportionate , the exact same figure as those who said it was disproportionate .
Personalities in the Israeli leadership and Hamas itself emerged badly , with Ehud Barak , Israel 's defence minister , earning only two per cent sympathy , and Hamas getting four per cent .
The results remained split - but tilted towards the Palestinians - when politics .
co.uk users were asked how the UK should have responded to the crisis .
Forty per cent called on the government to publicly criticise Israel .
That compared to 23 per cent who wanted the UK to support Israel diplomatically , and even topped the number of people calling for the government to work toward ceasefire arrangements , at 28 per cent .
But users seemed to blame Hamas for the conflict .
Forty per cent said they were responsible , while only 34 per cent blamed Israel .
Twenty - six per cent of people blamed both of them .
The poll comes as Gazans begin returning to their homes to discover the true scale of destruction caused by Israel 's three week campaign against the territory .
The fragile ceasefires declared over the weekend appeared to have held as Israeli troops continued to withdraw from key points towards the border .
The United Nations , however , has warned the cost of rebuilding the Palestinian territory after the conflict may reach billions of dollars .
UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon travelled to Gaza yesterday to inspect the destruction .
Tens of thousands of people are said to have been left homeless with almost half a million currently suffering from a lack of running water .
Estimates suggest at least 1,300 Palestinians died in the 22 day conflict launched by Israel last month , with over 5,000 more injured .
During the weekend , Israel declared a ceasefire claiming it had met its military objectives , followed a day later by the Palestinian militant group Hamas which declared a seven - day truce of their own , allowing Israeli soldiers to pull out from the region .

As a nation we have enjoyed relatively low unemployment for the last five years .
At the end of 2007 the unemployment rate stood at 4.6 % .
By comparison , the U.S. unemployment rate peaked at 24.9 % in 1933 , during the darkest year of the Great Depression .
In October of this year the unemployment rate grew 0.4 % to 6.5 % , its highest rate in 14 years .
Ten million Americans are now unemployed : 240,000 people lost their jobs in October , and 284,000 lost their jobs in September .
That represents the biggest two - month loss of American jobs since 2001 .
Economists are predicting the unemployment rate will rise to 8.5 % by the end of 2009 , which means as many as three million more workers will be laid off in the U.S .
Because I 'm a CEO who hires employees regularly , a few friends of mine who have recently been laid off have asked me for job - hunting advice .
Some have asked me to review their resumes and offer suggestions .
Unfortunately these folks are now in job recovery mode and are n't able to optimally position themselves for landing on their feet .
Personally I prefer actionable advice .
As such , I 'm instead going to suggest ten things you can do now to be prepared for a layoff a year from now .
Update your skills .
It 's easy to become distracted by everything that 's going on today at home and at work .
We neglect investing in ourselves .
We can get away with that during boom times , but during tough times we need up to date , relevant skills .
Start immediately .
If you need training , get it — but do n't mistake training for application .
Make sure you are practicing your skills professionally on a day - to - day basis .
Reduce your household burn rate .
Many people earn more than the market will bear for their services .
Stock prices have fallen 50 % .
Home prices are falling .
Salaries adjust due to market conditions , too .
When finding a job is tough , do n't restrict the size of the relevant job pool because you can't afford to work for less than you 're currently earning .
We live in different times than our parents did .
I personally think everyone
should prepare financially for being unemployed once every five years for a period of 3 to 6 months .
Start a blog that contains at least 50 % professional material .
If you do n't already have a blog , stop reading this one and go start one right this minute .
It 's essential .
Your blog is your living resume .
It shows how you think .
It shows how you write .
It shows what 's important to you .
While it is fine to blog about personal topics , devote half of your posts to professional content .
What is that you do by trade ?
Mentor us through your blog .
We employers love hiring mentors — they raise everybody 's performance .
Expand your physical network .
Depending on how you 're wired , networking is either a lot of fun or a lot of work .
If it 's work for you , have the discipline to start now .
Building a network takes time , effort and sincerity .
Start attending breakfast and / or cocktail networking events .
Set goals for yourself .
For example : “ I want to have a good conversation and exchange business cards with at least 3 people during this breakfast . ”
Update your LinkedIn profile .
You are on Linked In , right ?
If not , do that right now .
Your LinkedIn profile is a marketing tool .
Be honest , genuine and show some humility , but also make yourself stand out in a crowd .
Optimize your profile for the five - line preview that comes up when someone conducts a search .
Expand your virtual network via LinkedIn .
Future employers are n't dumb .
They 'll detect that you only decided to invest in updating your profile and expanding your network and references after you lost your job .
Do it now .
Like physical networking , developing your virtual network takes time too .
Set goals .
For example : “ I want to have 100 contacts by the end of the year and 250 contacts by this time next year . ”
Start exercising .
We all know that discrimination is illegal for most reasons and unethical for other reasons .
But if you 've watched 60 Minutes , you know that 's not how humans behave .
With comparably qualified candidates , the attractive , fit people are usually offered the job .
What are employers looking for in prospective employees ?
Someone who will get the job done .
If you look like you are full of energy , the perception is that you will get the job done .
Learn to use social media effectively .
Learn to use Twitter and Facebook .
In addition to starting your own blog , participate in some discussions online by commenting on blogs in your industry .
Always link your comments back to your blog .
Potential employers will Google you .
Show them that you 're thoughtful and have something to say .
Conversely , be careful about thinking “ it 's just Twitter ” before tweeting something that could embarrass you later .
Do extracurricular work that showcases your abilities .
What 's better than telling a prospective employer how good you are ?
Show them !
If you 're a software engineer , contribute on an open source project , develop an iPhone application or develop a robust website .
If you 're an online marketer , prove your good by showing me that you have a site that gets a lot of traffic .
I met a man earlier this year who 's a program manager at Microsoft .
He wanted to move into a new role as a marketer , but did n't have any day - to - day responsibilities at Microsoft that showed he could do the job .
So he bought a domain and set up a website dedicated to Caribbean travel .
Soon it was attracting lots of traffic and ranked high in organic search .
It was a great way to show doubters that he was qualified .
Avoid being laid off in the first place .
Last but not least , do n't relinquish the pole position .
An incumbent has an edge .
It 's easier to keep a job than find one .
We 're hearing about companies cutting 25 % or 33 % of their headcount .
That means you need to be in the top 67 % or 75 % to avoid a pink slip .
Other than an entire plant , division or office closure , the decisions about whom to keep and whom to let go are based on performance , salary and redundancy of position .
Boost your performance by getting meaningful things done .
Come in earlier .
Stay later .
Be more visible .
Start sending your boss weekly status reports showing your accomplishments .
Exhibit leadership .
My wife participates in a group for moms of preschoolers , and she shared a story with me earlier this week .
Each table has four young moms and one “ mentor ” mom whose kids are now adults .
One of the young moms was concerned that her sole - provider husband might lose his job and asked the mentor what she would suggest they do .
Her matter - of - fact answer was , “ Well , for starters , you can stop complaining when he can't drop the kids off at school before work and be home by 6:00 for dinner . ”
Nobody knows how long the current economic crisis will last or how bad it will get .
But it 's already proving to be a much tougher job climate than the past few years , and the next year looks bleaker still .
Start preparing today for the possibility of being laid off sometime next year .
The earlier you start , the better off you 'll be .
Unfortunately layoffs are sometimes unavoidable .
If you 've been laid off , we at blist hope we can help .
We 've created a website called Land on My Feet .
It 's a simple , free , one - page , opt - in site for anyone who has been laid off to enter their name and a link to their Linkedin profile .
Despite economy - wide layoffs , some companies are still hiring , and we 're promoting this site to hiring managers as a free resource to find qualified candidates .
Hopefully blist can help you land on your feet .

' It takes a village ' vs. ' It takes the one - sided teachings of a sole household '
by Jeremy Hooper
Speaking about the need for evangelicals to ditch public school " indoctrination " in favor of the dinosaur - denying , gay - shunning , debate - removing form of education that can only be obtained via evangelical homeschooling , Lt. Col.
E. Ray Moore of something called the Exodus Mandate Project says the following :
" The real target of the liberals and the left has always been the children .
And we can see in California where the conservatives won Proposition 8 -- the vote [ was ] 52 to 48 [ percent ] -- but ... when Proposition 22 was voted on [ in March 2000 ] , they had a 61 - percent margin of victory .
So the culture is turning against Christianity and against the pro-family movement primarily because we 've allowed our children to be educated in their schools , " ... "
They 're converting our children ; we 're not converting them . "
Okay , let 's think about all this for a second .
Mr. Moore is admitting that the culture is getting more supportive of our equality , which is refreshingly honest for a " pro-family " personality .
But he 's suggesting that this turn towards tolerance is a turn away from Christianity , as well as outright blaming this fall away from the " pro-family movement " on public schooling .
And he 's flat - out admitting that this " will you accept gays ? " game is a battle of conversion , with their outside voices of queer rejection necessary in order to replenish their side of " culture war " soldiers .
He 's also fessing up about their team 's need to recruit , even if he 's saying that we need to do so as well .
But as annoying as these ideas might be , we would suggest that all of these admissions are actually quite good for our side .
Here 's why :
(1) If they start suggesting more and more that becoming gay - friendly is a fall away from Christianity , they are going to piss off lots of people .
For one , they 're going to upset the queer - supportive people of the Christian faith who do n't see a conflict between their support of LGBT human beings and their relationship for God .
For another , they 're going to tick off those from other faiths who are not fond of having their own religious views undermined by evangelicals .
But even outside of religion , they 're also going to open the entire population 's eyes to just how fully they wish to govern with faith - based policies .
This will only help us make our case against American citizens being free to use their personal faith views to limit the civil rights of others .
(2) By suggesting that kids need to converted in order to become anti-gay , they are helping to show how close - minded this form of bias truly is .
Whereas the indoctrination they accuse us of fostering involves open and frank conversation , usually led by educated people ( teachers , judges , etc. ) , they are pushing for a form of TRUE indoctrination that involves one person ( whose most important training comes from their own , personal faith views ) passing on those same exact views to another and then telling them not to question what they have learned .
So essentially they 're accusing us of recruiting children through our villages of diverse opinion and background , yet suggesting that the way to end that " indoctrination " is to limit those villages to only like - minded people .
No objective person could look at that scenario and deem us the unfair ones !
(3) In suggesting that any sort of " conversion " is needed , they are showing how thoroughly unnatural it is to reject gay people .
Sure , kids need guidance about the world and its inhabitants .
However , no child is born with dislike for LGBT people .
That viewpoint is the unfortunate product of heterosexist society .
And by coming right out and saying that their side needs to step in and interject before the support for fairness takes hold , they are again showing just how fully they wish to rule via their own societal myopia .
So we say to Mr. Moore and others : Please , by all means , keep working these ideas .
We are , quite unapologetically , trying to convert America 's anti-fair conversation into a more pro-equality one .
By pushing for an America and a world that is educated and governed by only one certain mindset , the evangelical set is connecting the dots much faster than we ever could .
Christians called to mass exodus from public schools [ ONN ]
Your thoughts
When I read that statement , I interpreted " them " as meaning us , as in " the pro-equality folk are converting our children , when we should be converting the gays and those who like them . "
That still shows the untenable position they occupy .
GLBTs are n't in need of " fixing " , but conversion .
It also sort of implies that homosexuality ( and pro-equality beliefs ) and christianity are on equal footing , if mutually exclusive .
Posted by : JT | Jan 2 , 2009 11:49:39 AM
What Mr. Moore does n't understand ( or does n't want to understand ) is that attitudes of our youth is not changing due to indoctrination .
In fact the only premeditated attempt at indoctrination of children is coming from his side and his words are nothing less than a call to do just that .
The reason younger people are so much more open to gay rights is because they have experienced the truth firsthand .
As more and more people have come out , the lies of the Dobson 's and LaBarberra 's become increasingly difficult to pull off .
My children and their friends know better than to believe that gay people are limp wristed , child molesting , perverts who hate God and family .
When I was a kid , we did n't .
My advice to Mr. Moore is that the trend will continue and your need to stop your lies .
If you continue to lie to your children about us , they will see right through it .
It will only compromise their trust in you and view of the church .
I 'm sure you will blame us as you already are , but if the church loses this generation , it will be because of how you compromised your principles to justify discrimination .
Not any calculated attempt to indoctrinate people from the gay side .

Yea , I guess the " them " could be either us or the children .
But yea , either way , it shows their desire to convert rather than accept .

The discussion , just finished few minutes ago and was titled Gaza : The Case for Middle East Peace .
It was moderated by David Ignatius and was carried on by Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the premier minister of Turkey , Amr Moussa , the Secretary - General of the Arab League and Shimon Peres , the president of Israel .
All of them spoke and expressed their points .
I did not personally hear what the PM Erdogan said before and catched the discussion when the turn was with Moussa .
Mr. Amr Moussa spoke in a very balanced way and said that the Arabs have formally offered Israel a formal position , a formal acceptance into the family of the nations of the Middle East and asked the formal position of Israel .
Moussa said we know what the papers write and what we read in translations , but what is the former position of Israel .
At the end of his speach he complemented Israel 's president Shimon Peres as being an " eloquent " speaker , but said he wanted to ask the formal position of Israel .
Shimon Peres replied indeed very eloquently .
He mentioned the word " peace " may be 15 - 20 times .
He said Israel does not want war , but wants peace .
Israel resorts to power when it 's left with no choice .
He said the rocket attacks were being fired and the people of Israel would call him and administration " traitors . "
Where is the government , why does not the government provide security .
So Israel resorted to using power .
Shimon Peres blamed Hamas .
He said Hammas leaders were hiding inside the bunker tunnels and making the homes of innocent people as place to launch rocket attacks .
But he said Israel would always call those people 's houses to warn them that they are going to be attacked soon .
Peres said in the 20 days of the Gaza war Israel has made 250,000 phone calls to the houses of the Palestinian people in Gaza to warn them .
Peres also told that Israle 's war was against Hammas that launched the rocket attacks , not against the Palestinian people .
I had decided to write a story about Israel 's 250K warning phone calls to Gaza residents , but then something happened .
President Peres turned up his voice and blamed the Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan , one of Israel 's few friends in the region , for not supporting Israel on the Gaza .
Peres was the last speaker and really did not well answer Amr Moussa 's question of formal position ( could be that it 's Peace ) , but dedicated his entire speech addressing PM Erdogan .
After he finished his speech after about 25 minutes the moderator Ignatius wanted to wrap up and close , but Erdogan asked for time to reply .
Ignatius said he did not want to start another debate .
Erdogan insisted by keep saying " one minute , one minute . "
He was dutifully taking notes during the speech of Peres hoping to have the opportunity to respond .
Eventually Ignatius gave him one minute and said he is going to hold Erdogan on to it .
PM Erdogan started his response by first noting that president Peres has a " loud voice . "
He was not given more than one minute to respond and the only thing he was able to say is if the Israel was not trying to harm the civilians why " we saw dead children on the beaches ? "
Indeed , this was going to start another big debate and Ignatius stopped the debate .
PM Erdogan was very upset and angry .
He took of his headphones and said that president Peres spoke for 25 minutes and " you did not gave me to speak even half of that time . "
" I will never come to Davos , " said the PM Erdogan and left the room in a protest .
Then Klaus Schwab took the podium and tried to have the closing remarks , basically saying that the goal and the wish is that all the nations of the Abrahamic faith can one day leave together in peace .

CiteSeer ( http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu ) could be called a vertical research portal , a niche search engine , or a specialized digital library .
It uses a specialized crawler ( robot ) to find scholarly papers ; it then extracts the text from PDF and PostScript files and creates a searchable full - text index .
CiteSeer enriches access to these materials by extracting metadata such as author names and publication information .
The pioneering Autonomous Citation Indexing tool follows citations and acknowledgments from one paper to another , science mapping and data mining as it progresses .
Digital libraries of scholarly works need structure and context .
The newly announced SeerSuite open source code base offers excellent tools for this process , from automated citation indexing to web crawling to Boolean queries .
CiteSeer , in one version or another , has been running for more than 10 years , with hundreds of thousands of documents and millions of citations from papers in computer and information sciences posted to the web .
It was first created as Research Index in 1998 by Steve Lawrence ( now at Google ) and professor C. Lee Giles of The Pennsylvania State University .
Over the years , it has provided a rigorous testbed for both software development and content research .
Its emphasis on automation of web crawling to find academic documents and automatically extracting citations has proven very successful .
CiteSeer has been heavily used , handling hundreds of thousands queries a day , and it has improved over time due to long - term development commitments and user demand .
The citation linking created a network effect , enriching the information on the portal as the system processes more citations and makes more connections .
" This is adding to the Semantic Web by semanticizing research documents , " Giles says , as it extracts valuable searchable metadata .
Building on that experience , CiteSeerX is a completely new system , re-architected for scaling and modularity , to handle increasing demands from both researchers and digital library programmatic interfaces .
The system uses artificial intelligence , machine learning , support vector machines , and other techniques to recognize and extract metadata for the articles found .
It now uses the Lucene search engine and supports standards such as the Open Archives Initiative ( OAI ) , including metadata browsing , and Z39.50 .
CiteSeerX has a simple but powerful internal structure for documents and citations .
If it cannot access a document cited , it creates a virtual document as a place holder , which can then be filled when the document is available .
According to Giles , " We ’ve learned from web search that getting access to information improves understanding and decision making .
Our goal is to build tools for researchers to gain insight into what work has been done , avoid duplicate effort , and create new theories . "
SeerSuite beta 0.1 ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/citeseerx) is the Java open source code version of CiteSeerX , distributed under the Apache license .
This includes the citation indexing and search features , as well as a scalable modular framework that can handle thousands of simultaneous queries , distribute indexes , and balance their demands across many servers .
Documentation , currently sparse , will be added within the next 6 months .
While at an early stage now , Giles says that SeerSuite will bring this form of digital library structure to many different researchers and fields , requiring IT support mainly to install and configure the system .
Using this source code , any field can start to build its digital library portal , customized for the articles , papers , and data sets of specialized disciplines , rather than trying to fit all types into one specific system .
The new portal would use the web crawling processes to keep the information current , index the full text , extract metadata , and automatically create a citation index .
It provides simple full - text search ; fielded search ; and full Boolean , phrase , and proximity search .
In search results , CiteSeer can show the context of search terms and citations for each paper , providing a preview or scanning overview of each paper , and it creates a continuously updated bibliography .
All these features can be adjusted for specific requirements of a field or discipline .
Giles says , " The goal is to have automated extraction tools in many disciplines , to the benefit of even small or medium digital libraries . "
For example , the ChemXSeer portal ( http://chemxseer.ist.psu.edu) recognizes chemical entities , which are the main information components central to much chemistry research .
ChemXSeer can convert data displayed in tables to tabular data , with rows and column names , and numeric data from the table cells .
Similarly , it can take apart other kinds of published data sets , in lists , for example , and treat them as individual strings or numbers .
Giles has headed the development of these tools because chemists need all the information from earlier work to design new experiments .
He points out that there is more than a century of chemical research where the only underlying data is expressed in the printed images , and that data is extremely valuable .
" The past needs to be fixed , " he says , even if everyone posts data sets with future research papers .
CiteSeer tests have also been deployed for academic research in ebusiness and archeology and have led to a more modular architecture of the system to support the requirements of these fields .
The CiteSeer group is experimenting with sharing content as well as code , perhaps using federated or distributed principles .
The SeerSearch code has lightweight web services for metadata extraction , citation graphs , general indexing , metadata , repository , file type conversion , and duplicate detection .
This means that any other web applications can use the system to perform these tasks and send back the results .
It can integrate with Fedora ( repository / digital asset management software ) to store not just documents as data objects but also microformats such as citations .
Ongoing projects for both CiteSeerX and the shared SeerSuite modules include recognizing acknowledgments as a form of citation and recognizing and clustering name entities and institutional affiliations .
More ambitiously , there is an initiative to recreate the mathematical expressions of equations displayed as images in PDF .
Likewise , Giles is working on a " graph indexer , " which can read statistics published as line graphs , histograms , and other 2D plots ; identify the units on the X and Y axes ; and use OCR to extract the data points and text blocks .
The information will then be stored in XML form and integrated into the digital library system .
CiteSeerX also offers personalization and Web 2.0 features such as personal collections , tagging for articles , error correction , and document submission ( user - created content ) .
Users can monitor specific papers for metadata updates via email and create bibliographies by marking and downloading specific records .
Finally , Giles and his students plan a complex event logging system , which can independently store the actions of users on the entire site , not just the search engine .
This will provide much more useful insights into user vocabulary , results evaluation , and general behavior .
The narrow sidestreet was in darkness and littered with broken glass and burnt debris when suddenly a panicky voice called out in the gloom " run , run run ! " and young men scattered in all directions as riot police charged , their silhouettes caught in the flames of a shower of Molotov cocktails .
The students had reason to run .
The baton - wielding police were lashing out , tired with a fourth night of rioting on the streets of the Greek capital .
The riots were sparked by the shooting dead of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos by police but symptomatic of a wider discontent with the government and other examples of police brutality .
The fighting was happening in the student quarter around the National Archaeological Museum .
A mile away , a 27 - year - old waitress had joined a peaceful protest outside the parliament building .
Declining to be named , she told me she had been demonstrating since the trouble began because she was " fed up with life here " .
" I have two degrees but I am a waitress .
There is no opportunity for young people here any more but I do n't think this is confined to Greece .
The economic situation leaves a lot of young people across Europe feeling bleak and hopeless . "
As she finished speaking a round of sarcastic applause broke out among the crowd , greeting the " changing of the guard " of police outside the seat of Greece 's increasingly unpopular government .
Back near the museum , the students regrouped for another attack , hurling more petrol bombs and fireworks .
The police , wearing helmets and carrying riot shields , advanced again , this time in respirators as teargas filled the streets , tearing at the eyes and lungs of the students and those of us who watched , sheltering in the doorways of smashed and looted shops .
Police cordoned off streets and redirected traffic away from the trouble spots , but the city was noticeably empty anyway last night as more trouble had been predicted after the funeral earlier in the day of the young victim .
Greeks are still angry at a savage beating given to a student by seven officers three years ago .
No officer has been charged with the assault , which left the boy in hospital for three months .
The students showed no signs of easing their demonstrations last night , but as the waitress moved off into the night she predicted they would end soon .
" The weather is changing .
It 's getting colder .
That will finish it sooner than the police can , " she said

We all know we are meant to be reducing our carbon footprint , but I suspect that many people would n't be prepared to go as far as Joan Pick .
She has n't driven a car since 1973 and has only been in a petrol - guzzling vehicle twice since then ( once in the hearse at her mother 's funeral , the other time when an ambulance came to pick her up after she dislocated her shoulder ) .
Her gas supply was cut off sometime when the last Labour government was in power , and her electricity usage is minimal .
She eats only raw food and the only items she ever buys are new trainers - because she gets around by running everywhere .
Pick is 67 and claims her lifestyle keeps her healthy .
" I 've been living on nothing for the past 35 years , " she says .
She is n't , you gather , an average sort of person .
She is charming , in her tracksuit , ready to go out running , with her hair pulled into a baseball cap bearing the symbol of the high - IQ society , Mensa .
A scientist for many years , she has a mind that darts off in different directions and it can be hard to keep track of what she is talking about ( perhaps because I am not a member of Mensa ) .
Much as I admire Pick 's low impact on this frazzled earth , is n't her lifestyle all a bit , well , extreme ?
She shrugs her wiry shoulders .
" Does it look like a hovel ? " she says , throwing a beady glare around her Croydon flat .
It does n't ; it is neat and tidy , and the furniture is classic 1960s - very fashionable now - that she has had for four decades .
She last owned a television in 1975 and listens to Classic FM and Radio 4 on an old secondhand stereo system .
The walls are hung with her own artworks .
The only electricity she uses is a single light ( low - energy bulbs , of course ) for the evenings , and her kettle , which not only makes the tea she drinks all day , but provides the hot water for laundry - which she does by hand - and bucket baths .
Pick does n't have heating .
It is a chilly day so I keep my jacket on , but she is far less weedy than me .
Does n't she get cold ?
" Sometimes , " she says .
How does she keep warm ?
" Clothing and exercise , " she replies .
Since she gave up cooking , she now uses her heavy cast - iron saucepans as gym weights ; space is cleared in her living room for hula - hooping .
She decided to start living like this , she says , " because I realised we have got the energy question totally wrong .
I decided to imagine that the earth was a business in need of sound management .
We are all members of the board , a shareholder , a trustee , a consumer and an employee .
We believed that fossil fuels were infinite , but they are finite . "
Pick was a scientist , and writer , for many years , with a particular interest in energy consumption .
She despairs that most people have to be forced to change the way they live , rather than making the choices themselves .
" They have to almost bribe people to use energy - efficient things .
It 's terrible .
I adopt a [ lifestyle ] that is consistent with the sustainable management of the world 's resources .
Everyone knows we have to have very severe cutbacks to meet that standard , " she says .
Her world has shrunk to the distance around her flat in south London that she can run to ( which is n't small - she can run to Tower Bridge , several miles away ) .
These days ,
Pick spends her time going to the library to read the papers - " It takes longer on a Thursday because I have to read the New Scientist as well , but it 's so awful " - and looking through Who 's Who and Google to find the addresses of the politicians , scientists and industry leaders she wants to write to ( Pick is a prolific letter - writer , tapping out her missives in dense little letters on an old typewriter ) .
She rode a bicycle until she felt it had become too dangerous and the last time she went on a plane , she says , was 1971 .
Does n't she ever want to go on holiday ?
" Oh no , " she says .
" I 've never enjoyed going on holidays .
You can learn about places by reading about them .
My mother died in 1972 , and my brother lives in Dallas , so there 's no possibility of going there . "
I wonder if her life is n't a bit isolating .
She has never married and does n't have a partner ( " a husband might expect three cooked meals a day .
Can you imagine ? " ) and she admits , with a sparkle in her eyes , that her friends and neighbours do think she 's " a bit mad " .
Maybe she is , but perhaps we will all have to live like Pick one day .
She follows a raw vegetarian diet .
" I had done studies of the food industry - the beef industry and the destruction of the rainforest to fuel it , " she says .
" I was at a Mensa dinner , with a vegetarian ... "
She does n't continue this thought .
" I 've always been a natural fatty ... I had tried every diet in the book , so I decided to try a raw - food vegetarian diet . "
When was the last time she ate a cooked meal ?
" I do n't know , I can't remember . "
Does n't she miss it ?
A nice bowl of soup , a roast dinner ?
" Of course not .
There 's no mess .
Have you seen what I eat ? "
We go into her kitchen , where the cupboards are bare .
She opens a large tub full of mixed seeds and nuts , which forms the basis of her diet , along with fruit and wheatgerm .
" It 's very easy to live like this .
I could n't imagine living any other way now , " she says .
It seems a bit joyless to me ( where are the treats ? ) , but Pick is n't a joyless person ; far from it - she 's delightful .
I 've made her late for her daily two - hour run .
We walk down the several flights of stairs together ( she never uses the lift ) and she runs off into the afternoon sunshine .
THE clubhouse of the Dirty Ryderz , a Brooklyn - based motorcycle club with 63 local members ( plus 27 in Virginia ) , is in a featureless brick building in East Flatbush with a security gate out front and tall , colorful trophies lying flat along a wall in the basement .
Winter weather is not motorcycle weather , so no cycles were to be seen outside last week .
But on Wednesday evening , the clubhouse buzzed with activity .
It was nearing time for a meeting of the Concerned Citizens for Motorcycle Safety , an umbrella organization for several local clubs that has had its hands full lately fighting a proposed city law aimed at controlling cycles ’ noise .
In particular , members were preparing for a third City Council hearing on the bill , to be held in the next few weeks , and for the international motorcycle show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center this weekend .
The bill , which was the subject of two Council committee hearings late last year but was delayed for further study after motorcyclists and their supporters raised objections , is intended to curb common modifications to the exhaust pipes that make cycles noisier .

On new motorcycles , exhaust pipes bear a stamp from the manufacturer certifying that they meet state and federal laws limiting noise to 80 decibels , comparable to the level of a vacuum cleaner or an alarm clock .
The law , as proposed , would give police the power to ticket the drivers of cycles that are missing the factory stamp  presumably cycles with excessively noisy or improperly modified pipes .
I ’ve mainly stayed away from the discussion of gender issues in technology .
I did n’t think that I had any real expertise to share .
But over the last six months , after many conversations , it has become clear that many of my female friends in tech really do feel disempowered .
They feel invisible , lacking in confidence , and unsure how to compete for attention with the men around them .
Then I see the stupid puerile misogynistic manner with which some of the more powerful voices in the tech community – some of them repeat offenders – treat women , and it makes me very cross indeed .
The objectification of women is bad enough when it ’s done by the media , but when it ’s done by a conference organiser or tech commentator or famous tech publication , what message does it send ?
Nothing but “ You will never be taken seriously , but we might take notice of you if you ’re hot . ”
But what to do ?
Well , let ’s pull back from the anger a little , and start to look instead at why it might be that women feel less secure in their abilities than most men , and what might help change that .
Undoubtedly it ’s a complex issue , but recent research may shed some light : Psychologist Penelope Lockwood discovered that women need to see female role models more than men need to see male ones .
Well , that ’s a relatively simple problem to begin to address .
If women need female role models , let ’s come together to highlight the women in technology that we look up to .
Let ’s create new role models and make sure that whenever the question “ Who are the leading women in tech ? ” is asked , that we all have a list of candidates on the tips of our tongues .
Thus was born Ada Lovelace Day , and this pledge :
“ I will publish a blog post on Tuesday 24th March about a woman in technology whom I admire but only if 1,000 other people will do the same . ” — Suw Charman - Anderson ( contact ) Deadline to sign up by : 24th March 2009 Ada Lovelace
Day is an international day of blogging to draw attention to women excelling in technology .
Women ’s contributions often go unacknowledged , their innovations seldom mentioned , their faces rarely recognised .
We want you to tell the world about these unsung heroines .
Whatever she does , whether she is a sysadmin or a tech entrepreneur , a programmer or a designer , developing software or hardware , a tech journalist or a tech consultant , we want to celebrate her achievements .
It does n’t matter how new or old your blog is , what gender you are , what language you blog in , or what you normally blog about – everyone is invited to take part .
All you need to do is sign up to this pledge and then publish your blog post any time on Tuesday 24th March 2009 .
If you ’re going to be away that day , feel free to write your post in advance and set your blogging system to publish it that day .
You ’ll notice that I ’ve asked for 1,000 people to sign the pledge , which is an ambitious number .
Indeed , PledgeBank makes a pretty strong point during the pledge creation process of asking people to limit their requests to 20 people , but I am sure that over the next 77 days we ’ll be able to find another 989 people to join us !
What can you do ?
Obviously , and most importantly , please sign the pledge .
If you already have a blog , then it will be easy for you to take part .
If you do n’t have a blog , this might be a great reason to start one !
It ’ll take you about five minutes to get yourself set up on WordPress and then you ’ll be up and running !
Please also consider putting a pledge badge on your blog now or writing a short post about the project to help spread the word .
You can also use the “ Share This ” link on the pledge itself to send the pledge to your favourite social bookmarking or news site , or to email it to a friend .
The more people who send this link to Delicious or Digg and the like , the more likely we are to hit our target !
Also , if you ’re on Twitter , Facebook , Jaiku , Identi.ca or any other microconversation tool , please ping a message to all your friends about Ada Lovelace Day , and do n’t forget the link !
If you ’re on Linked In , you could also add it as your temporary status for a while .
It is going to be a challenge to hit 1,000 people – we ’ll need an average of 13 people signing each day – but if we all tell our friends about it , I think we can do it !
Keep up with Ada Lovelace Day news
I ’ve got a Twitter account , mailing list , blog and Facebook event set up , so feel free to follow , subscribe and add to your RSS reader , as you wish !
Tags , video / audio and the meaning of technology
These are the tags that we ’re going to be using .
AdaLovelaceDay09 for Delicious , Technorati etc .
It ’s long , but clear .
for Delicious , Technorati etc .
It ’s long , but clear .
# ALD09 for Twitter hashtags .
It does n’t matter what medium you choose to do your post in – it could be a video post , a podcast or any other format you choose .
Equally , it ’s up to you how you interpret the phrase “ in technology ” .
We ’re not just talking about hardcore ninja programmers , but any woman who creates , invents , or uses any technology in an innovative way .
One of my friends is going to write about women in animation , for example .
But there are many women excelling in gaming , or developing hardware , or tech project management , or using tech to do science … there are all sorts of careers that could come under the banner of “ technology ” and we ’re happy to hear about women in any of them .
Finally , your chosen women can be alive , or she can be dead .
After all , I ’m going to be writing about Ada .
( Not that I want to spoil the surprise , but I think we ’d all agree that it would be apropos ! )
What will happen next ?
If Ada Lovelace Day is a success I ’d like to make it an annual event .
And , once the economy is in a better position , I ’d like to put together a one day conference called Finding Ada .
We would cover presentation skills and would introduce women to tech conference organisers , with the aim of getting more women up on stage at tech conferences .
At the moment , I ’m short of money to get Finding Ada moving , so if you ’d like to be a sponsor please get in touch and I ’ll tell you more about it .
Finally , who was Ada ?
Ada Lovelace was one of the world ’s first computer programmers , and one of the first people to see computers as more than just a machine for doing sums .
She wrote programmes for Charles Babbage ’s Analytical Engine , a general - purpose computing machine , despite the fact that it was never built .

But some members of Congress said Sunday that even that might not be soon enough  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , said that President Bush and Mr. Obama should work together now to put a stimulus package in place by early next year .
Otherwise , he said , the Obama approach would probably take until the second quarter of next year , “ and that ’s too long . ”
Advisers to Mr. Obama say they want to use the economic crisis as an opportunity to act on many of the issues he emphasized in his campaign , including cutting taxes for lower - and middle - class workers , addressing neglected public infrastructure projects like roads and schools , and creating “ green jobs ” through business incentives for energy alternatives and environmentally friendly technologies .
In light of the downturn , Mr. Obama is also said to be reconsidering a key campaign pledge : his proposal to repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans .
According to several people familiar with the discussions , he might instead let those tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011 , effectively delaying any tax increase while he gives his stimulus plan a chance to work .
That approach , Mr. Daley said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” “ looks more likely than not . ”
On Monday morning in Chicago , Mr. Obama plans to hold his second news conference since the election to introduce his economic team , led by his Treasury secretary , expected to be Timothy F. Geithner .
News that Geithner , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , would get the job helped send the stock market up by nearly 500 points on Friday after days of sharp losses .
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers is to be the director of the National Economic Council in the White House , the president ’s principal economic adviser and policy coordinator , according to an Obama aide .
Mr. Axelrod appeared to tacitly confirm those two nominations , though he said that another widely reported nomination , that of Governor Bill Richardson as commerce secretary , might be premature .
Referring to the stimulus plan being prepared , Mr. Axelrod said , “ We need the best people we can find , the best minds in our country to help us accomplish that plan , and people like Tim Geithner and Larry Summers are among those people . ”

WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama and leaders in Congress are fashioning a plan to pour billions of dollars into a jobs program to jolt the economy and lay the groundwork for a more energy - efficient one .
The details and cost of the so - called green - jobs program are still unclear , but a senior Obama aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a work in progress , said it would probably include the weatherizing of hundreds of thousands of homes , the installation of “ smart meters ” to monitor and reduce home energy use , and billions of dollars in grants to state and local governments for mass transit and infrastructure projects .
The green component of the much larger stimulus plan would cost at least $ 15 billion a year , and perhaps considerably more , depending on how the projects were defined , aides working on the package said .
During the campaign , Mr. Obama supported a measure to address global warming by capping carbon emissions while allowing companies to buy and trade pollution permits .
He said he would devote $ 150 billion of the revenue from the sale of those permits over 10 years to energy efficiency and alternative energy projects to wean the nation from fuels that are the main causes of the heating the atmosphere .
Suspect dies in Santa Rosa after being Tasered SANTA ROSA
A man died Saturday after a Sonoma County sheriff 's deputy responding to a violent attack in a Santa Rosa home stunned him three times with a Taser , according to the sheriff 's office .
Nathan Vaughn , 39 , was throwing and breaking things in a home on Brighton Drive when the deputy arrived at the house , the sheriff 's office said in a statement Sunday .
The deputy stunned Vaughn once , then hit him twice more when Vaughn continued to fight .
The deputy , who has not been named , was able to handcuff Vaughn , but shortly thereafter Vaughn showed signs of medical problems , according to the sheriff 's office .
An ambulance crew already on the scene treated Vaughn and took him to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead .
The incident started at about 10:30 a.m. Saturday when Vaughn 's mother , Doris Vaughn , called 911 and told a dispatcher that her son was very violent and was destroying the house and hitting his dad , according to the sheriff 's department .
Vaughn 's father , Ronald Vaughn , suffered multiple cuts and bruises in the incident , none of which required immediate medical attention , according to the sheriff 's department .
Investigators later learned that deputies had responded to another disturbance at the same house at 4:30 a.m. Friday .
No one was arrested in that incident , but Nathan Vaughn was taken from the home to stay with friends .
Shortly after deputies left Vaughn , he went to a pay phone and made several calls to 911 but hung up on dispatchers , according to the sheriff 's office .
Deputies then arrested Vaughn for making repeated , unnecessary emergency calls .
Vaughn was cited and released from Sonoma County Jail at about 1:30 p.m. Friday .
Vaughn had an extensive history of arrests and convictions in a 15 - page criminal history report , according to the sheriff 's office .
He had been convicted multiple times for drug possession and being under the influence .
He also had several theft - related convictions and had served time in state prison for burglary , according to the sheriff 's office .
Because Vaughn 's death happened while he was in custody of the sheriff 's department , the incident is being handled by another law enforcement agency , the Petaluma Police Department .

This holiday season , many people are worried about the economy .
Unemployment and other issues are causing a certain amount of worry .
And many people want a little extra to make the holiday season a little brighter .
So it is no surprise that the " skip a payment " offer from lenders and others is so appealing at this time .
Back when I had a car loan , this was routine : I received a letter in the mail , encouraging me to — for a low $ 25 fee — skip my December car payment .
I could do it for January as well if I wanted ( for another $ 25 fee in that month ) .
Some years , it was tempting .
$ 25 instead of $ 200 ?
I never took it , though .
Skip a loan payment does n’t mean you do n’t pay
Lenders are n’t being nice .
You will still pay that money .
The lenders pocket the fee and then add your entire payment to the end of the loan .
They ’ll even capitalize the interest so that is added to the total as well .
So , really , when you " skip a payment " , you are actually deferring the inevitable — and you are actually paying more in the long run .
It can be tempting to use skip a payment to buy a few extra gifts this holiday season , but that ’s really not the best option .
Instead , join the 67 % of Americans that say they are cutting back on their holiday spending , and look for other gifts that can be given instead .

OFTEN it pays not to be leader of the pack — just ask a racing cyclist or a Formula One driver .
Conserving energy by following the leader , a trick known as slipstreaming , can give a rider or driver that extra bit of juice to pull ahead at the very last moment .
In the natural world , however , bodies are more likely to be flexible , like a fish 's , rather than rigid , like a car's .
In these systems , as a recent paper in Physical Review Letters reports , it is the leader that enjoys a significant dynamic advantage over the followers .
Jun Zhang of New York University came to this conclusion obliquely , by examining one of life 's burning questions : why is it that flags flutter in a breeze ?
Flags are good analogues of birds and fish because all three change their shape as they move through a fluid .
In 2000 Dr Zhang did some experiments to study the motion of thin silk filaments ( standing in for flags ) in flowing films of liquid dishwashing soap ( standing in for the breeze ) .
As the soap film “ blew ” past a flag it formed streams and eddies .
Dr Zhang was able to observe these by illuminating it .
Light bouncing within the film between its surfaces creates an interference pattern ( this is why soap bubbles appear coloured ) .
Streams and eddies in such a film alter its thickness , and thus the details of this interference pattern , allowing the pattern of irregularities induced by the flag to be captured on camera .
These initial experiments revealed that fluttering is an intrinsic feature of the motion of a flag .
Make a flag long enough , and it will flutter no matter how steady the breeze .
This is because the shape of the flag changes .
Any small instability in shape causes changes in the flow of fluid , which alters the shape further .
The whole process thus amplifies the fluttering .
Now , in collaboration with Leif Ristroph of Cornell University , Dr Zhang has used the same technique to look at what happens when there are several objects in the moving fluid — a series of flags outside a government office , for example , or a line of fish in a school .
In this case , the researchers were surprised to find that the familiar physics of slipstreaming were inverted .
If one flag has a second downwind of it , that second breaks up the wake of the leader .
This stops that wake being a single , coherent back - and - forth wave .
As a result , the leading flag flies straighter .
In a line of many flags , moreover , most experience this reduced drag in turn , making the whole group more aero- ( or hydro - ) dynamic .
Inverted slipstreaming of this sort could have some counterintuitive effects .
A fish frantically trying to escape from a predator might get the advantage of reduced drag .
As the team put it in their paper , “ it is better to be chased than to chase . ”
However , fish and birds actively change their shape when they swim and fly , whereas flags flutter passively in the breeze .
Whether this makes a difference is not yet clear .
The researchers therefore plan follow - up tests with aquarium fish to see if they , too , experience inverted slipstreaming .
If they do , then there may , eventually , be engineering applications .
Whether wobbly bikes and flexible racing cars are among them remains to be seen .
Seeking the secret to walrus reproduction vallejo Researchers are seeking to learn the secrets of walrus reproduction
Jocko belly - flopped onto the artificial ice floe in the middle of his Vallejo pool and rocked back and forth - a blubbery portrait of walrus bliss .
His counterparts in the wild should have it so good .
Their Arctic ice floes are shrinking because of global warming , which means their numbers could decrease .
That possibility makes the breeding behavior of Jocko and his two female friends , who live at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom , fascinating to scientists - to the point that one researcher is creating an artificial vagina to entice the 2,200 - pound Pacific walrus into sexual acts that can be measured and quantified .
" This would be the first semen sample out of a walrus in the wild or captivity , " said Holley Muraco , a specialist in marine mammal reproduction who has constructed similar body parts for horses , cows and pigs .
She said the dramatic changes likely to occur in the Arctic would affect walrus breeding , an obscure activity about which little is known , partly because it happens underwater and partly because Pacific walruses live in a remote part of the world .
" It 's extremely mysterious , " Muraco said .
" They 're very inaccessible .
But we 're able to study the Six Flags walruses so intimately , and they participate so fully , that we can apply that science to wild animals if we need to . "
If researchers can understand and demystify walrus sex , their findings will shed light on how environmental change can influence the conditions that hurt or help breeding .

The 14 - year - old Vallejo residents - who are already sexually active but have nothing to show for it - are among only 30 or so captive walruses divided among seven facilities in the United States .
The Discovery Kingdom animals offer unusual access because they arrived at 2 weeks of age as unrelated orphans from the Bering Sea , and were raised and trained by humans .
The walruses ' mothers had been killed during a subsistence hunt .
The pups were given Yupik names suggested by Eskimo schoolchildren : Uquq ( blubber ) , Siku ( ice ) and Sivuqaq ( the ancient name for the village of Gambell , Alaska ) , who was dubbed Jocko in the movie " 50 First Dates . "
Jocko , still growing , could reach 4,000 pounds , while the females are about 1,700 pounds apiece and gaining steadily .
Like other members of their species , they are gregarious , surprisingly agile and prone to blowing snot on whatever or whomever is nearby .
" They want to feel what you 're wearing with their whiskers and they want to breathe in your nose , " said Discovery Kingdom animal trainer Robert Roozendaal on Tuesday , as the three walruses inspected a visitor to their indoor quarters .
" It 's a walrus greeting . "
Jocko , described as exceptionally mellow and laid back , ate ice cubes and sucked on his tongue .
Siku , an overachiever and the " honor roll student " in the group , slid into the pool , while the lazy but assertive Uquq did sit-ups .
" A lot of animals have personality , but these guys are so interactive they can express that personality with more animation , " Roozendaal said .
Toni Rael , another animal trainer at the Vallejo theme park , said polar bears have gotten most of the attention in the uproar over global warming , while walruses have been overlooked - although the Center for Biological Diversity , a conservation group , sued the U.S. government in December to force it to add the Pacific walrus to a list of threatened species .
A census is now under way , but there are no hard numbers for the elusive creatures .
" They 're an underappreciated marine mammal , " Rael said .
" But it 's funny how they capture your heart . "
Sweet , lovable creatures
Ron Schusterman , a research marine biologist at UC Santa Cruz , has been studying the sounds of the walruses at Discovery Kingdom since they were babies .
" They 're so lovable , " he said .
" They truly are .
They want to snuggle up to you all the time .
Of all the animals I 've worked with , they 're the coziest .
They love to rub and touch .
They 're just very sweet animals that right now need protecting . "
Schusterman has scrutinized a vast repertoire of walrus vocalizations that include whistles , groans , bellows , grunts , knocks , taps and metallic bell sounds .
He said he hopes that the Vallejo pinnipeds , who provided vocals in " Jurassic Park " and the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy , will soon reproduce .
" It 's very important that the animals in captivity should be bred if at all possible , " he said .
" It 's a good way to make a contribution to the environment .
We know so little about them . "
Although the ice floe in the Six Flags pool was built out of surfboard material , it is treated like the real thing by Uquq , Jocko and Siku , who has no tusks because they became infected when she was younger .
The white object is their favorite hangout , said Leah Coombs , marine mammal supervisor at Discovery Kingdom .
In the wild , Coombs said , ice floes are crucial because Pacific walruses , not known as marathon swimmers , can rest on them , give birth on them and follow them during a lengthy migration from summer in the Chukchi Sea to winter in the Bering Sea .
With fewer ice floes , the easily spooked herd animals retreat to rocky shores , where the calves are sometimes trampled to death by the adults when something frightens them and they take off en masse .
Coombs is excited about the reproduction study .
" Nobody has figured it out yet , " she said of walrus sex .
Destructive and dirty
Captive walruses are rare because they are difficult to acquire , given the many rules and regulations , as well as very destructive and dirty , said Michael Muraco , animal director at Discovery Kingdom .
" It 's very expensive to manage them , " he said .
" And they 're like an elephant .
A lot of the food that comes in comes right back out . "
His wife will monitor the walruses ' hormones , use ultrasound , determine when the females cycle during the winter breeding season and watch them mate under water - in addition to making the latex or rubber artificial vagina into which semen can be deposited when Jocko ejaculates .
" They 're not shy with their sexuality , " Holley Muraco said .
" So we 'll try to put the pieces of the puzzle together and see why we do n't have a baby yet . "

This is the concluding installment in my series examining how the most reliable economic indicators during the Inflationary Era , perform during periods of deflation .
I have done this by examining the Roaring Twenties , Great Depression , New Deal , and the Post WW 2 deflationary recession .
The reason for doing so is that we are now in the midst of the first deflationary recession in 60 years .
Most indicators used by economists and pundits do not exist or have never been tested that far back in time .
Indicators which may work during inflations may not work during deflations .
Having set forth the data for you , today we show exactly how two such indicators -- monetary and interest rates -- panned out , and the implications of those conclusions to our present situation .
During the period from 1960 - 2008 there were 8 recessions .
One predictor -- the Kasriel Recession Warning Indicator ( or KRWI ) -- had a perfect 8 for 8 record with no false positives .
When it signalled a recession , one started shortly thereafter .
When it did not signal a recession , no recession started .
The KRWI has two components , ( 1 ) the interest rate component .
Was the yield curve in the bond market inverted ( i.e. , di longer maturity bonds like 10 year treasuries pay less in interest than short term 3 month bonds or the Federal Reserve overnight rate ? ; and ( 2 ) the monetary component .
Is consumer inflation as measured by the 12 month CPI higher than the M1 money supply ?
If both of those yield a " yes " answer , then the Indicator is triggered .
It also appear that the converse has also been true .
From 1960 to 2007 , if the answer to both questions is " no , " then the economy is not in a recession or is just ending a recession .
Here is a graph showing that performance :
In Part II we examined the monetary component of the Indicator during the Roaring Twenties .
In Part III we examined the monetary component in the 1930s and the 1948 - 49 deflationary recession .
In Part IV we examined the yield curve from 1920 - 1950 .
Part V. Conclusions and Predictions
Now that we have completed our examination , how did the components of the KRWI perform during the period of 1920 - 1950 ?
Here is the combined result .
Where the Indicator was triggered by one component or the other , the month that the indicator was triggered is indicated to the right :
Recession Time Period Inverted yield curve CPI > M1 1/20 - 7/21 YES 1/19 YES 1/20 5/23 - 7/24 NO
YES 9/23 10/26 - 11/27 YES
1/26 NO
8/29 - 3/33 YES 10/26 NO
5/37 - 6/38 NO YES 6/37 1/49 - 10/49 NO YES from 1945
Our examination shows that in only ONE of the 6 recessions from 1920 - 1950 did the KRWI correctly signal recession -- the post WW1 deflationary recession of 1920 - 21 .
In all other cases , one of the indicators is missing .
So the KRWI , in its Infaltionary Era formulation , does not work .
Deflationary recessions , as it turns out , are different .
Just as interesting , however , is that in each of the other 5 recessions , one or the other of the two components was triggered .
The monetary indicator was triggered for 1923 , 1937 , and 1948 ( although in the last two cases , the indicator did not anticipate the recession , but coincided with the onset of the recession ) .
The inverted yield curve was triggered in 1926 and , spectacularly , in 1929 .
In fact , at no point did either the monetary or the yield curve indicator give a false signal .
When either one was triggered , a recession followed .
As I have previously indicated , all the deflationary recessions followed a pattern .
The CPI declined from the beginning of the recession and its
YoY rate of decline bottomed immediately before the recession 's end .
M1 followed a similar pattern , sometimes coincidentally , sometimes leading slightly .
Like a roller coaster reaching the bottom of a decline , the indicator that the bottom is at hand is that the coaster continues to decline , but declines at an ever decreasing rate !
In all 6 of the deflationary recessions during our study period of 1920 - 50 , once M1 and CPI both declined at a decreasing rate , the recession was about to end .
In visual terms , deflationary recessions are like wry smiles ( left , the 1937 - 38 recession ) vs. inflationary recessions which are like mouths agape ( right , the 1970 and 1974 recessions ) .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
During inflationary recessions , CPI tends to be rising before and at least 3 - 4 months into the recession , which is why M1's decline is a leading indicator ; in contrast , during deflationary recessions , CPI falls immediately and somewhat in sync with M1 , so M1 generally does not lead .
Now let us turn our attention to our own situation .
You may recall that in Part II I said to keep in mind the period of time when M1 was either flat or declining at an increasing rate during a period of deflation .
In Part IV , I noted the ominous pattern of an inverted yield curve with very high " real " interest rates during a time of CPI deflation .
Have either or both of those patterns happened since ?
The answer , with one slight modification ( quarterly vs. YoY deflation ) , is YES .
The pattern has recurred exactly one time -- in 2006 .
Here is the graph :
In 2006 as for several years before , M1 ( blue ) was essentially flat , just as it was in the 1926 - 29 period .
The yield curve ( green Fed funds rate over orange 10 year Treasury rate ) was inverted , with Fed Funds rates of 5.25 % being at one point ~ 3.5 % above the YoY inflation rate .
Although the YoY inflation rate at that time was positive , the period featured a quarter during which deflation actually occurred , in the amount of ( - 1.1 % ) -- the most deflation in half century at that point .
On this basis the yield curve in 2006 was giving almost the same ominous reading as it did in 1928 - 29 .
So what do the indicators portend for the future ?
A couple of weeks ago , I gave a Deflation Outlook for 2009 , including both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios .
I have prepared a graph of M1 and CPI incorporating both of those scenarios , here :
The graph indicates that it is very unlikely that YoY CPI will bottom out before the middle of the year , although under the optimistic scenario in particular it appears the bottoming will at least take place shortly before or after .
Thus , if M1 continues to expand , in the face of the positively sloped yield curve from 2008 , the indicators we have studied from the earlier Deflationary period suggest that the recession might bottom out in about Q3 ( the graph would look very much like the 1937 - 38 recession ) .
If , on the other hand , the pessimistic scenario unfolds , and if in particular wage cuts ( including " stealth " wage cuts via , e.g. , reduced workweeks ) feed into a cycle of increasing demand destruction , then the CPI may continue to decline into a very bad situation indeed .
An efficient LZW implementation
The LZW patents in all countries where they were granted have expired , which makes it patent - free and thus free for anyone to use anywhere .
The LZW algorithm itself is quite ingenuous .
With a relatively simple algorithm decent compression factors are achieved .
One big advantage of LZW is that it can be made really fast and to not to take humongous amounts of memory to compress or decompress .
I present here a very efficient implementation of LZW both speedwise and memorywise .
The following table presents compression and decompression times of several example files .
The tests were run on a 3.4GHz Pentium4 running Suse 9.3 .
My implementation of LZW supports a freely - specifiable maximum bitsize for the dictionary indices .
16 bits was used in these tests .
In these tests I first read the entire file into memory , then run the LZW algorithm and then write the result .
These tests thus measure the time taken to encode / decode from memory to memory ; the time taken for I /O is not included .
File Size Encoding
time Compressed
size % of
original Decoding
time rfc3530.txt 586 kB 0.03 s 192 kB 32.7 % 0.02 s msgothic .ttf 4.0 MB 0.45 s 2.9 MB 73.0 % 0.22 s msmincho.ttc 8.7 MB 0.90 s 6.0 MB 69.7 % 0.46 s access_log 110.4 MB 4.74 s 20.6 MB 18.7 % 3.62 s
The memory requirement for this LZW implementation depends on the maximum bitsize of the dictionary .
For example in practical C++ implementations the dictionary can be allocated as two arrays ( one for the indices and another for the byte values ) , thus avoiding memory management overhead .
The following table presents the minimum amount of memory required by the dictionary ( in a C++ implementation ) for some maximum bitsizes when LZW - encoding .
The second column assumes that if the maximum bitsize is less or equal to 16 then 2 - byte index values are used , else 4 - byte index values .
The third column gives the required memory assuming that 4 - byte index values are always used .
Maximum
bitsize Minimum memory
requirement Minimum memory
requirement ( using
4 - byte indices ) 12 36 kB 68 kB 14 144 kB 272 kB 16 576 kB 1088 kB 18 4.25 MB 20 17 MB
Basically no additional memory ( besides the input and output data ) is required .
It is also possible to allocate the dictionary as one single array , with the character of each item embedded with the index values .
In this case , however , the character will usually require 4 bytes instead of one , increasing the memory usage slightly ( by about 18 % ) .
In practice the data will usually compress the better the larger the maximum bitsize ( although maximum bitsizes exceeding about 20 will usually have only minimal effect ) .
The LZW decoder requires even less memory ( because it does n't need the ancillary data used by the encoder for fast dictionary searching ) .
Notable features of this implementation
The most notable feature of this implementation is that the heaviest step in the whole encoding process - the dictionary search - can be done in a fixed amount of byte comparisons ( at most 256 of them ) regardless of the dictionary size and the length of the strings .
Thus , technically speaking , the dictionary search is an O ( 1 ) operation , ie .
a constant - time operation .
This is done without the need for any external data container ( all the ancillary data required for this is stored inside the dictionary itself ) .
Some LZW encoding implementations use an external hash table to perform the dictionary searches .
Often these implementations suffer from large memory usage requirements and / or slowness ( because the search time may depend on the size of the dictionary and / or the size of the strings inside it ) .
The solution presented here never requires more memory than what was presented in the table above , and always performs a dictionary search in ( at most ) a fixed amount of steps regardless of the dictionary size .
Another notable feature is that the memory usage of the dictionary is not dependent on the input .
In other words , even if the input produces very long strings in the dictionary , that does n't make the dictionary require more memory .
This is so for both encoding and decoding .

Proposition 8 and the election in general has brought out the worst side of us , as evidenced by overt racism at the McCain / Palin rallies and the growing tensions in California over marriage equality .
Hate is finally out of the closet and on display for the whole world to see .
In California , some Proposition 8 supporters compare gays and lesbians to Hitler , while others see us bringing about the end times .
There seems to be no limit to what they will say or do .
I ’ve put together a list of eight reasons why voting No on Prop 8 might not be such a terrible idea , particularly if you do n’t want to be associated with the lot below .
Here they are , in no particular order
1. People who want marriage equality are well , like , Hitler
Brad Dacus ( [ email protected ] , ( 916 ) 857-6900 ) a spokesman for Proposition 8 , spoke passionately in Sacramento equating their struggle against gay marriage and saving the soul of America , to the people of faith in Germany who left the soul of their country to Hitler .
Really ?
2. The Mormons
By far the largest financial contributors to Proposition 8 , Mormons have a long history of veiled hate and intolerance .
Their church mobilized against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 70s .
Blacks were not allowed into the temple until 1978 , frowned on interracial marriage , and expelled gays and lesbians from their church who are unable to go straight .
Sounds like an inclusive group to me .
3. 2012 Letter from Focus on the Family
Focus on the Family , one of Prop 8 ’s largest contributors , have released a fictional letter written by a Christian circa 2012 , telling the story of what ’s gone wrong with America in the first 4 years of an Obama presidency .
Notable highlights include gay scoutmasters will be able to sleep in tents with young boys , schools can teach homosexuality as a personal choice , counselors and social workers can nolonger discriminate against homosexuals , and gays will target Christian book publishers , through defacement and censorship , including cyber attacks against those booksellers carrrying their books .
Are you kidding me ?
4. The Call
Organized by religious leaders across the country , the Call brings together people to pray for the passage of Proposition 8 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego this weekend .
James Dobson of Focus on the Family has decided at the last minute to join event , at the urging of Rev. Jim Garlow , who later goes on to say that he fears the end of western civilization if Prop 8 does n’t pass .
Do n’t these folks have something better to pray for ?
Like world peace ?
Or food for the millions starving across the globe .
Or cures for the sick ?
This is how they choose to spend there time ?
5. Yes on Proposition 8 Sends out Blackmail Letters
Last week the fine folks behind Proposition 8 sent out blackmail letters to many businesses that had made
No on 8 donations , threatening to “ out ” them if they did n’t make a matching donation to Yes on 8 .
Truly tasteless .
6. Cyber attack of No on Prop 8 Website
After sending out an urgent call for donations to match
Yes on 8 ’s recent funding surge , the No on Prop 8 site was attacked by hackers , denying contributors from making donations for several hours .
Hackers can be bigots too I guess .
7. Tom McClintock
Tom McClintock who is running for Congress in Southern California is quoted as saying :
“ Lincoln asked , ‘ If you call a tail a leg , how many legs has a dog ?
The answer is four .
Calling a tail a leg does n’t make it one , ' ” McClintock said in a statement .
“ And calling a homosexual partnership a marriage does n’t make it one . ”
McClintock is no friend of the gay community .
8. Orange County , California
Yes , the whole county .
There ’s nothing orange about it , it ’s red , through and through .
A bastion of support for Proposition 8 , Yes on 8 signs are everywhere , from neighborhood lawns to billboards .
Some of Proposition 8 ’s biggest contributors are from Orange County .
Donors skew heavily conservative , religious , and Mormon .
I suspect gays and lesbians are , well , unwelcome .
So , if you are planning to vote Yes on Prop 8 , then you are associating yourself with the fine class of people mentioned in the examples above .
Is that what you really want ?

Free -market economists like myself attack government tax - and - spend policies as being damaging to prosperity , accusing the government of " sucking money " or " leeching resources " out of the economy .
We claim that taxes damage not only the welfare of the person from whom they are taken , but the whole country .
Politicians , supporters of state spending , and even questioning students often challenge this negative view of taxation with the positive effects of public spending .
In essence , the argument runs something like this :
Say man A makes $ 100,000 and man B is unemployed .
The State decides to create a government job for man B .
To do this , they tax man A $ 50,000 to pay for man B's salary .
Surely the $ 50,000 that man A lacks is now in the hands of man B , who will spend it in the economy instead ?
Therefore should n't there be no overall loss to the economy , but more people employed ?
This is the old ' zero - sum ' fallacy ; the politicians ' belief that the size of the economy is fixed and they only have to decide how to divide it up .
Austrian economists , with their focus on the real world and human nature , know better ; wealth does not just exist , it has to be created , and the disincentive effects of government actions do not just distribute wealth — they actively destroy it .
Taking $ 50,000 from A through taxation reduces the economy not by $ 50,000 but by more , much more .
Studies in the USA and Australia suggest that the damage caused by $ 50,000 of taxes could be over $ 130,000 .
This means that even when the $ 50,000 taken from A is returned to the economy via B , there is still a net loss of $ 80,000 .
This comes about through a variety of disincentives , of which the most important is the impact on A .
A's $ 100,000 job now only brings him $ 50,000 of after - tax income .
Now a $ 100,000 job commonly involves more time , responsibility and stress than a $ 50,000 job , hence its higher rewards .
A used to be compensated for this by his higher salary , but now part of that has been taken away by the state ; as A effectively now has a $ 50,000 job , he will want to reduce his effort and stress to levels commensurate with his after - tax pay .
Traditionally , economists thought of this being done by working fewer hours , and found little evidence of it happening in the real world .
However this downshifting could equally be by working less hard , not working , hidden , unpaid overtime , or even by trading down to an easier job ( perhaps even that soft government job created for B ) .
Economists call this the " substitution effect " ; by working hard A can now only get 50 % of the salary that work brings , but if he works shorter hours he gets 100 % of the benefit of the extra leisure time , as that is n't taxed .
Effectively A opts for leisure ( or just a less stressful life ) instead of paid work .
Society therefore loses out , by getting less of the useful work that A was doing .
Yes , society now gets the benefit of B's work , but since society was n't prepared to pay for that voluntarily through the market it clearly does n't value it as much .
The common counterargument to this is that once A is being taxed he will have to work harder , or longer hours , to earn more and maintain his after - tax income .
This may have been true in the past , but in the modern economy it has probably been pushed as far as it can without us all dropping from exhaustion .
Also greater general wealth means that very few of us are close to the bread line any more ; a drop in income will not mean starvation or homelessness , just a drop in lifestyle that can be compensated for by other lifestyle gains from an easier job .
So the effect on A is damaging to society , but what of the effect on A's employer , X ?
If A is working less hard , or threatening to leave for an easier job , X faces a loss of profits ( more damage to the economy ) .
To prevent this , X could of course increase A's pay , so that his after - tax pay returns to its old level .
Alternately , X could hire someone else to help A , with two people doing the job of one ( if possible ; A may have rare skills ) .
The left , especially the unions , like this because it appears to increase employment .
Unfortunately it also increases X's costs , which X will have to attempt to pass on to its customers .
In the short term , this will result in an increase in living costs ( and therefore a drop in welfare ) for the whole of society , as products become more expensive .
In the long term , domestic producers like X will be undercut by foreign competitors who do not face these tax costs .
If X goes bust ( or relocates its activities to a more favorable country ) then A's job goes , and the tax to pay for B's job goes with it .
Advanced technology can help keep home producers like X competitive despite tax - driven labor cost hikes , but not for long ; the rest of the world soon catches up .
So there are two sources of hidden costs , the effect of the tax on A and X .
But there is another problem that is even less visible ; the effect of the tax on C .
Who is C ?
C is the man who would have come up with a new invention , or improved a business process , or just run a business very efficiently , creating jobs and probably providing real employment for B .
If taxes were low then he would try this , because the potential rewards would make the effort and risk worthwhile .
However at a 50 % tax rate the potential rewards are halved while the risks and effort remain the same , so many Cs will not bother and instead choose the easy life of a less well - paid but more stress - free and risk - free job .
This opportunity cost is invisible , and difficult to measure ; it is the loss of wealth that would have been created in the future were it not for the tax .
However , long - term comparative studies have suggested that each 1 % of GDP taken in tax reduces long - term growth rates by between 0.2 % and 0.4 % .
This may not sound like much , but that is an annual loss ; if taxes are raised by 3 % of GDP ( the U.K. government 's current plan ) and then kept steady at that higher level , there will be a loss of growth of around 1 % a year .
Over 25 years , the cumulative effect of this would be a national economy around 30 % smaller than it would otherwise have been .
That 's a lot of real jobs that B could have had .
Notice that these problems apply to all taxes ( other than a poll tax ) ; even if you could design a perfect non-distorting tax system , it would still have these costs .
In reality of course , actual tax systems produce their own additional distortions ; special tax concessions for different types of activity that divert too many resources into particular sectors of the economy .
There are also the administrative costs of collecting the tax and of advising the taxpayer , resources wasted on merely transferring rather than creating wealth .
The effect of taxation is therefore overwhelmingly damaging .
Even if taxes are ' invested ' in projects that are expected to increase national wealth ( an argument frequently advanced in Europe for publicly - funded transport networks ) , the threshold for success is enormous ; the benefits of the project have to not only cover its costs , but also outweigh all the hidden costs of the tax .
And that 's without taking into account the massive waste and inefficiencies of the public sector .
If that is the case , then why does public spending still happen ?
We know that real jobs are a better guarantee of prosperity for the unemployed than welfare .
If reducing taxes helps the economy to grow , the main beneficiaries will be the unemployed who find jobs .
Why then do politicians insist on higher taxes ?
Partly through ignorance , of the politicians and of the electorate , especially of the hidden opportunity costs .
Unfortunately though , it is also through something more sinister .
The harmful effects of taxation are spread throughout the economy , but the benefits can be concentrated on smaller groups .
Therefore , although the economy overall suffers from tax - and - spend policies , special interest groups can actually benefit .
These special interest groups may be formed on regional , ethnic , class , or even industry lines ; anything that allows the politicians to target a bunch of voters .
In today 's low - turnout elections , politicians can make the tradeoff between a diffuse , and hidden , disadvantage to the many ( who probably wo n't vote anyway ) and a well - directed and well - advertised benefit to the few .
There is also a marginal cost / benefit problem ; the losses due to taxation are spread throughout the population , so to do anything about it the concerned citizen would have to campaign successfully against billions of dollars of public spending to reduce his own taxes by a few hundred .
Against him are the special - interest groups who only have to be successful in one campaign to reap massive benefits .
In the middle of this sit the politicians , deftly plucking the taxpaying goose without letting it squawk too much .
What can we do ?
Squawk loud , squawk long , squawk often .

A terminally ill teenager who won a legal battle against a hospital 's attempt to force her to have a life - saving heart transplant said today she had endured " too much trauma " .
Hannah Jones , 13 , from Marden , Herefordshire , who has been in and out of hospital since the age of four , said she did not want to go through any more operations .
She was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia at the age of five .
" I just decided that there were too many risks and even if I took it there might be a bad outcome afterwards .
I have been in hospital too much , " Jones said in an interview with Sky News .
She added : " I have had too much trauma .
I did n't want this [ a heart transplant ] and it's not my choice to have it . "
Although her decision means that she may have only months to live , Jones said : " I have made the right decision at the moment and I 'm not going to change it . "
She added : " There 's a chance I may be well and there 's a chance I may not be as well as I could be .
That 's a chance I 'm willing to take . "
Sitting beside her mother Kirsty , an intensive care nurse , the teenager said she now wanted to have a holiday with her family in Disney World , Florida .
" It 's always been on my list to go away on holiday and forget about things at home , " she said .
Mrs Jones said the family had sought publicity about her daughter 's condition because they had been unable to get the travel insurance that would allow Hannah to make the trip .
She praised her daughter 's bravery , saying : " She 's absolutely fabulous .
She 's so grown up .
There are times when she can be naughty but she 's really brave and we are so proud of her . "
After Jones decided against the surgery , saying she wanted to die with dignity surrounded by family and friends , Hereford hospital instigated high court proceedings .
It sought to remove her , temporarily , from her parents ' custody to allow the transplant .
Jones said she had been " shocked " to hear that she could be taken to hospital by force .
Her mother said it had been a " terribly frightening " experience .
" We had to tell the three younger children that they had to be good and had to be quiet and Hannah might cry because she did not want to go , but we would have to let her go because otherwise we would not be allowed to come into hospital and support her afterwards , " she said .
Health officials abandoned the proceedings after the teenager made her case to a child protection officer .
" The child protection lady came , and she was fabulous .
She listened to what Hannah wanted , she went to the barrister 's chambers , and that ended proceedings , " Mrs Jones explained .
Jones 's plea was conveyed to barristers at the high court in London who decided she was mature enough to make the decision for herself and the order was thrown out .
The family later received a letter from the hospital insisting that it always put the patient 's " best interests " first , but the letter stopped short of an apology .
The girl 's father , Andrew , an auditor , said : " It is outrageous that the people from the hospital could presume we did n't have our daughter 's best interests at heart . "
After being diagnosed with leukaemia , Hannah was given three doses of a high - strength drug designed to kill off an infection , but it also caused a hole to develop in her heart , which meant a transplant would provide her only long - term chance for survival .
Global market expenditures for remote sensing products are projected to increase to more than $ 9.9 billion by 2012 .
That , according to a new report issued yesterday by BCC Research .
The Massachusetts - based research firm estimates that more than $ 7 billion was spent on remote sensing products last year .
The firm estimates future increases in spending on remote sensing will run 6.3 % annually .
Weather forecasting holds the highest share of the market , accounting for approximately 38 % of the total .
The biggest potential for growth in the remote sensing market will be public health applications , which the firm estimates could grow to $ 675 million in 2012 .
Other major markets include right - of - way inspection , intelligence gathering , and climate change studies .
In the past , the popularity of of geographic information systems ( GIS ) and global positioning systems ( GPS ) technology caused some to predict that the demand for remote sensing information would bring about a boom .
Optimistic predictions placed the market at more than $ 30 billion in sales by 2005 .
While the industry never came close to meeting such lofty expectations , BCC Research does forecast steady growth for the future .

Clearing Up This Mess
John Maynard Keynes had the answer to the crisis we ’re now facing ; but it was blocked and then forgotten .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 18th November 2008
Poor old Lord Keynes .
The world ’s press has spent the past week blackening his name .
Not intentionally : most of the dunderheads reporting the G20 summit which took place over the weekend really do believe that he proposed and founded the International Monetary Fund .
It ’s one of those stories that passes unchecked from one journalist to another .
The truth is more interesting .
At the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 , John Maynard Keynes put forward a much better idea .
After it was thrown out , Geoffrey Crowther – then the editor of the Economist magazine – warned that “ Lord Keynes was right … the world will bitterly regret the fact that his arguments were rejected .
” (1) But the world does not regret it , for almost everyone – the Economist included – has forgotten what he proposed .
One of the reasons for financial crises is the imbalance of trade between nations .
Countries accumulate debt partly as a result of sustaining a trade deficit .
They can easily become trapped in a vicious spiral : the bigger their debt , the harder it is to generate a trade surplus .
International debt wrecks people ’s development , trashes the environment and threatens the global system with periodic crises .
As Keynes recognised , there is not much that the debtor nations can do .
Only the countries which maintain a trade surplus have real agency , so it is they who must be obliged to change their policies .
His solution was an ingenious system for persuading the creditor nations to spend their surplus money back into the economies of the debtor nations .
He proposed a global bank , which he called the International Clearing Union .
The bank would issue its own currency – the bancor – which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange .
The bancor would become the unit of account between nations , which means it would be used to measure a country ’s trade deficit or trade surplus ( 2,3,4 ) .
Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union , equivalent to half the average value of its trade over the past five years .
To make the system work , the members of the Union would need a powerful incentive to clear their bancor accounts by the end of the year : to end up with neither a trade deficit nor a trade surplus .
But what would the incentive be ?
Keynes proposed that any country racking up a large trade deficit ( equating to more than half of its bancor overdraft allowance ) would be charged interest on its account .
It would also be obliged to reduce the value of its currency and to prevent the export of capital .
But – and this was the key to his system – he insisted that the nations with a trade surplus would be subject to similar pressures .
Any country with a bancor credit balance which was more than half the size of its overdraft facility would be charged interest , at 10 % * .
It would also be obliged to increase the value of its currency and to permit the export of capital .
If by the end of the year its credit balance exceeded the total value of its permitted overdraft , the surplus would be confiscated .
The nations with a surplus would have a powerful incentive to get rid of it .
In doing so , they would automatically clear other nations ’ deficits .
When Keynes began to explain his idea , in papers published in 1942 and 1943 , it detonated in the minds of all who read it .
The British economist Lionel Robbins reported that “ it would be difficult to exaggerate the electrifying effect on thought throughout the whole relevant apparatus of government … nothing so imaginative and so ambitious had ever been discussed ” ( 5 ) .
Economists all over the world saw that Keynes had cracked it .
As the Allies prepared for the Bretton Woods conference , Britain adopted Keynes ’s solution as its official negotiating position .
But there was one country – at the time the world ’s biggest creditor – in which his proposal was less welcome .
The head of the US delegation at Bretton Woods , Harry Dexter White , responded to Lord Keynes ’s idea thus : “ We have been perfectly adamant on that point .
We have taken the position of absolutely no ” ( 6 ) .
Instead he proposed an International Stabilisation Fund , which would place the entire burden of maintaining the balance of trade on the deficit nations .
It would place no limits on the surplus that successful exporters could accumulate .
He also suggested an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , which would provide capital for economic reconstruction after the war .
White , backed by the financial clout of the US Treasury , prevailed .
The International Stabilisation Fund became the International Monetary Fund .
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development remains the principal lending arm of the World Bank .
The consequences , especially for the poorest indebted countries , have been catastrophic .
Acting on behalf of the rich world , imposing conditions which no free country would tolerate , the IMF has bled them dry .
As Joseph Stiglitz has shown , the Fund compounds existing economic crises and creates crises where none existed before .
It has destabilised exchange rates , exacerbated balance of payments problems , forced countries into debt and recession , wrecked public services and destroyed the jobs and incomes of tens of millions of people ( 7 ) .
The countries the Fund instructs must place the control of inflation ahead of other economic objectives ; immediately remove their barriers to trade and the flow of capital ; liberalise their banking systems ; reduce government spending on everything except debt repayments ; and privatise the assets which can be sold to foreign investors .
These happen to be the policies which best suit predatory financial speculators ( 8 ) .
They have exacerbated almost every crisis the IMF has attempted to solve .
You might imagine that the United States , which since 1944 has turned from the world ’s biggest creditor to the world ’s biggest debtor , would have cause to regret the blinkered position it took at Bretton Woods .
But Harry Dexter
White ensured that the US could never lose .
He awarded it special veto powers over any major decision made by the IMF or the World Bank , which means that it will never be subject to the Fund ’s unwelcome demands .
The IMF insists that the foreign exchange reserves maintained by other nations are held in the form of dollars .
This is one of the reasons why the US economy does n’t collapse , no matter how much debt it accumulates ( 9,10 ) .
On Saturday the leaders of the G20 nations admitted that “ the Bretton Woods Institutions must be comprehensively reformed . ” ( 11 ) But the only concrete suggestions they made were that the IMF should be given more money and that poorer nations “ should have greater voice and representation . ”
We ’ve already seen what this means : a tiny increase in their voting power which does nothing to challenge the rich countries ’ control of the Fund , let alone the US veto ( 12 ) .
Is this the best they can do ?
No .
As the global financial crisis deepens , the rich nations will be forced to recognise that their problems cannot be solved by tinkering with a system that is constitutionally destined to fail .
But to understand why the world economy keeps running into trouble , they first need to understand what was lost in 1944 .

Governor Paterson had planned to announce his selection on Friday or Saturday , but it was not clear how Ms. Kennedy ’s move may affect the timing .
The governor has been coy , and while he has praised Ms. Kennedy , he has also spoken approvingly of other candidates , including Mr. Cuomo and Representative Kirsten E. Gillibrand , who is beginning her second term in Congress from the Albany area .
Mrs. Clinton resigned from the Senate on Wednesday , immediately after being sworn in as secretary of state .
The governor has said privately and publicly that he would like to select a woman to succeed her , noting that if he were to choose a man , the number of female senators would drop to just 16 .
Some have speculated that with the state facing a $ 15 billion budget deficit , it would be risky for Mr. Paterson to bypass Ms. Kennedy , given her connections to the Obama administration and top Senate Democrats like Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Mr. Paterson appeared to like Ms. Kennedy and saw in her a potential star , but was frustrated and angry by what he saw as efforts by her supporters , especially within Mayor Bloomberg ’s administration , to create a sense of inevitability about her candidacy .
“ She has pluses and minuses , ” Mr. Paterson said in a radio interview earlier this month , adding that Ms. Kennedy “ has a tremendous relationship with the president and that ’s certainly a plus .
She does not have much legislative experience , which is a minus . ”

There have been conflicting signals in recent days and weeks about whether Mr. Paterson had settled on Ms. Kennedy for the job .
Mr. Paterson said earlier this week that he had chosen someone , but some advisers , as recently as Wednesday , remained convinced that he not yet made up his mind .
A friend of the governor ’s said on Wednesday afternoon that “ I would be totally shocked ” if Mr. Paterson did not pick Ms. Kennedy .
The day after Thanksgiving is the day millions of Americans , enjoying a rare Friday off ( and a dearth of football games on television ) , head for the malls to kick off the Christmas shopping season .
“ Black Friday ” ( supposedly so named because it ’s the day when retailers turn the corner and see their income statements move out of the red and into the black , but originally the phrase was a derisive term applied by police and retail workers to the day ’s plethora of traffic jams and badly - behaved customers ) is regularly cited as “ the busiest shopping day of the year . ”
But although Black Friday may be the day the greatest number of holiday shoppers traipse through malls , it is n’t necessarily the biggest day of the year in terms of dollars spent :
Popular belief has it that the Friday after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year .
These days many shoppers buy with the holidays in mind all year long .
Decorations go up around Halloween , and some Santa Clauses arrive at malls before Thanksgiving .
Some shoppers get an early start Thursday at a limited number of stores like Kmart and Wal - Mart Super Centers , which are open on the holiday .
To be sure , there are still intense crowds on the day after Thanksgiving — led by the “ doorbusters ” who show up at dawn for early - bird sales .
“ It ’s one of the busiest days in terms of traffic but not in sales , ” said Pam Rucker , spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation .
“ But the mystique is still there . ”
“ People just want to get out and do something on that day , ” said Jay McIntosh , director of U.S. Retail and Consumer Products for accounting giant Ernst & Young .
“ They do because of all of the incentives to shop , but many are n’t buying . ”
Previous holiday shopping trends showed sales figures spiking on the day after Thanksgiving before suffering a sharp decline through the end of November .
However , sales would steadily increase throughout December , peaking on the four days comprising the two weekends before Christmas .
As a result , Black Friday sales almost always ranked below the last Saturday before Christmas ( or December 23 , if Christmas Day falls on a weekend ) .
Up until 2002 it ranked between fourth and eighth on charts of the year ’s busiest shopping days .
According to statistics published by the International Council of Shopping Centers ( ICSC ) , the top shopping days for the years 1993 through 2002 were :
2002 : Saturday , Dec. 21
2001 : Saturday , Dec. 22
2000 : Saturday , Dec. 23
1999 : Saturday , Dec. 18
1998 : Saturday , Dec. 19
1997 : Saturday , Dec. 20
1996 : Saturday , Dec. 21
1995 : Saturday , Dec. 23
1994 : Friday , Dec. 23
1993 : Thursday , Dec. 23
During that period , “ Black Friday ” held the following positions in the ICSC ’s rankings of year ’s busiest shopping days :
2002 : # 4
2001 : #6
2000 : #5
1999 : #8
1998 : #8
1997 : #7
1996 : #5
1995 : # 7
1994 : #8
1993 : #8
Holiday shopping patterns changed in the following years as more shoppers began using on - line sales outlets for their holiday purchases .
( Indeed , online retailers coined the term “ Cyber Monday ” to describe the first weekday after the Thanksgiving holiday weekend , a day on which their sales supposedly spike as shoppers pile onto the Internet to buy online whatever they could n’t or did n’t get at the mall the previous weekend . )
But times change .
Since 2003 when this page was first published , marketing has become reality and “ Black Friday ” has taken on greater prominence ; analytics firm Shoppertrak ranked it the top predicted holiday shopping day in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 .
The National Retail Federation also estimated that 115 million people will do their holiday shopping during “ Black Friday ” in 2017 .
( CNN ) -- Janis Krums was heading to New Jersey on a ferry when he clicked a snapshot with his iPhone of US Airways Flight 1549 partially submerged in the Hudson River .
He uploaded the picture to his Twitter account and then forgot about it as he assisted in the rescue of the plane 's passengers .
i Reporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the scene in Hudson River .
The deluge of image views crashed the servers of TwitPic , the application that allows Twitter users to send photos with their Twitter updates or " tweets . "
" I posted it because I thought ' That 's pretty newsworthy ' and I wanted to share it with the people who follow me on Twitter , " Krums said .
" I was letting some of the survivors use my phone and it was n't until later that I looked and saw that I had quite a few messages . "
More people are turning to social networking sites like Twitter , Facebook and Flickr when news breaks to share stories and pictures .
In an era when even the president of the United States has a Facebook page and spectators texted and tweeted about Inauguration Day , the power of online and digital social networking is clear .
Barack Obama tapped into the stream for his grass - roots presidential campaign and the Israeli Consulate in New York used its Twitter account to disseminate information during the recent Israeli - Palestinian conflict in Gaza .
Twitter does n't release figures on the total number of registered users , but according to Compete , which offers analytics on Web sites , the site had more than 4.4 million unique visitors as of December 2008 .
Facebook has more than 150 million active users and Flickr has more than 34 million registered users worldwide .
Accounts of the deadly attacks last fall in Mumbai , India , the May 2008 earthquake in China and last week 's plane crash show what used to be just a virtual gathering place to communicate pet peeves or plans for the weekend has evolved into a go - to spot for eyewitness news -- sometimes even before mainstream media has had time to crack the story .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said Twitter users were the first to alert others last summer after an earthquake hit Southern California .
" The earthquake struck at 11:42 [ a.m. ]
PST and at 11:42 PST people started twittering , " he said .
Twitter allows its users to post messages , or tweets , to their accounts that are then distributed to those who are " following " that user online .
Stone noted that there was an Associated Press story on the quake that he saw posted nine minutes later on their site and said that during those nine minutes there were more than 3,600 tweets .
" That 's when it sort of struck home for me , " he said .
" With Twitter , we have this real - time feed of what people around the world are seeing , thinking and feeling . "
Such citizen journalism is in some cases happening almost accidentally , said Susan Jacobson , an assistant professor at Temple University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , who researches the impact of technology on journalism .
" Most people are just sending this information off to their friends , " Jacobson said .
" The main thing to take from sites like Twitter and Facebook is that they are informal modes of news dissemination . "
Part of that informality includes brevity -- tweets have a maximum capacity of 140 characters , and Facebook statuses can only be a few lines -- and the possibility of inaccurate information .
Jacobson said users , especially those who have grown up in the digital age , are very much aware of that .
" Young people , I think , have an innate radar about what is legitimate and what is not , " she said .
" They realize that not everything they read and see on the Web is true . "
Stephen Hultquist , a Boulder , Colorado , consultant who gets a great deal of his breaking news from Twitter , said traditional media sources also make mistakes or give skewed reports .
" If anything , Twitter reminds me that everyone is human and they all have their own views and a paradigm through which they see the world , " said Hultquist who had a unique appreciation of the quick , firsthand tweets that came after the earthquake in China last year .
" I was five miles from the epicenter of the earthquake in 1989 that happened right before a World Series game and I noticed that the media that was reporting on it was n't getting it all right , " he said .
Immediacy , said iReporter Jim Davidson , is one reason he posted his images of the downed plane in the Hudson on Flickr in addition to CNN.com .
" When something like this happens , it 's an easy way to syndicate it , " said Davidson , who lives two blocks from the Hudson in Hoboken , New Jersey .
Social networking sites also enable spry reactions to news .
Rob Reale of New York City started a Facebook group soon after the crash for the " Fans of Sully Sullenberger -- and the crew of Flight 1549 " to celebrate the pilot who is being hailed as a hero for deftly landing the plane .
The group quickly swelled to more than 27,000 members , some of whom posted video and photos and provided information that Reale used to update the page .
" I felt like the Facebook group was an opportunity to spread the good news , " Reale said of the crash , which all survived .
" Part of it was getting the word out and part of it was keeping that good feeling going . "
Chris Krewson , executive online editor for the Philadelphia Inquirer , has a personal Twitter account in addition to posting tweets for his paper .
Mainstream media is learning to better utilize online social networking to connect with its audience , he said .
" People are already talking about the news , " Krewson added .
" This is just a way for us to involve ourselves in the conversation . "

Wait , was n't being commander of the Alaska National Guard part of Palin 's executive experience the McCain camp has been touting ?
I guess that means she runs things about as well as the rest of the Republican Party .
Veterans For America :
The post - deployment challenges facing Alaska 's Army National Guard are more daunting and widespread than any seen by Veterans for America ( VFA ) .
VFA 's National Guard Program just completed a week in the state reviewing the needs of Alaska 's citizen - Soldiers and the resources in place to meet them .
The needs of Alaska 's Guard members and their families far outstrip the available help .
Many of the Alaska 's Guard members have been deployed , and redeployed , despite the shortage of care and treatment available upon their return .
With more than one - quarter of Alaska 's Guard members living 60 miles or more from a Veterans Affairs facility , many rarely if ever get treatment they need .
Travel to Anchorage alone can cost more than $ 1,500 for each Guard member - an upfront cost too burdensome for many to shoulder , even if they are eventually reimbursed .
With the economy worsening , the costs to Guard families for their own healthcare will mount and even fewer will receive treatment .
We owe our citizen - Soldiers better than this .

President - elect Barack Obama will probably tear down long - standing barriers between the U.S. ’s civilian and military space programs to speed up a mission to the moon amid the prospect of a new space race with China .
[ postpic=center ] 98498 [/postpic ]
Obama ’s transition team is considering a collaboration between the Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration because military rockets may be cheaper and ready sooner than the space agency ’s planned launch vehicle , which is n’t slated to fly until 2015 , according to people who ’ve discussed the idea with the Obama team .
The potential change comes as Pentagon concerns are rising over China ’s space ambitions because of what is perceived as an eventual threat to U.S. defense satellites , the lofty battlefield eyes of the military .
“ The Obama administration will have all those issues on the table , ” said Neal Lane , who served as President Bill Clinton ’s science adviser and wrote recently that Obama must make early decisions critical to retaining U.S. space dominance .
“ The foreign affairs and national security implications have to be considered . ”
[ banner=center , http://www.usdemise.com]94093[/banner]
China , which destroyed one of its aging satellites in a surprise missile test in 2007 , is making strides in its spaceflight program .
The military - run effort carried out a first spacewalk in September and aims to land a robotic rover on the moon in 2012 , with a human mission several years later .
A Level of Proficiency [ / h3 ]
“ If China puts a man on the moon , that in itself is n’t necessarily a threat to the U.S. , ” said Dean Cheng , a senior Asia analyst with [ url=http://www.cna.org/]CNA Corp. , an Alexandria , Virginia - based national - security research firm .
“ But it would suggest that China had reached a level of proficiency in space comparable to that of the United States . ”
Obama has said the Pentagon ’s space program — which spent about $ 22 billion in fiscal year 2008 , almost a third more than NASA ’s budget — could be tapped to speed the civilian agency toward its goals as the recession pressures federal spending .
NASA faces a five - year gap between the retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 and the first launch of Orion , the six - person craft that will carry astronauts to the International Space Station and eventually the moon .
Obama has said he would like to narrow that gap , during which the U.S. will pay Russia to ferry astronauts to the station .
NASA Resistance [ / h3 ]
The Obama team has asked NASA officials about the costs and savings of scrapping the agency ’s new Ares I rocket , which is being developed by Chicago - based Boeing Co. and Minneapolis - based Alliant Techsystems Inc .
NASA chief Michael Griffin opposes the idea and told Obama ’s transition team leader , Lori Garver , that her colleagues lack the engineering background to evaluate rocket options , agency spokesman Chris Shank said .
Garver and other advisers declined to comment .
At the Pentagon , there may be support for Obama ’s vision .
While NASA has n’t recently approached the Pentagon about using its [ url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/delta/delta4/delta4.htm]Delta IV and [ url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/ssc/commercial_launch_services/launch_vehicles/AtlasV500Series.html]Atlas
V rockets , building them for manned missions could allow for cost sharing , said Steven Huybrechts , the director of space programs and policy in the office of Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who is staying on into the new administration .
The Delta IV and Atlas V are built by United Launch Alliance , a joint venture of Boeing and Bethesda , Maryland - based Lockheed Martin Corp. , and typically are used to carry satellites .
Already Developed [ / h3 ]
“ No one really has a firm idea what NASA ’s cost savings might be , but the military ’s launch vehicles are basically developed , ” said John Logsdon , a policy expert at Washington ’s [ url=http://www.nasm.si.edu]National Air and Space Museum who has conferred with Obama ’s transition advisers .
“ You do n’t have to build them from scratch . ”
Meanwhile , Chinese state - owned companies already are assembling heavy - lift rockets that could reach the moon , with a first launch scheduled for 2013 .
All that would be left to build for a manned mission is an [ url=http://history.nasa.gov]Apollo-style lunar lander , said Griffin , who visited the Chinese space program in 2006 .
Griffin said in July that he believes China will be able to put people on the moon before the U.S. goes back in 2020 .
The last Apollo mission left the lunar surface in 1972 .
“ The moon landing is an extremely challenging and sophisticated task , and it is also a strategically important technological field , ” Wang Zhaoyao , a spokesman for China ’s space program , said in September , according to the state - run Xinhua news agency .
Docking [ / h3 ]
China plans to dock two spacecraft in orbit in 2010 , a skill required for a [ url=http://www.google.com/moon]lunar mission .

Emocracy -
The illusion of democracy , where the source of general opinion is not a common set of values , but certain emotions that force a strong feeling about towards an election , a military retaliation , or sports event .
e.g. ,
In the Netherlands , a typical emocracy was evident in the huge election victory of an unknown party .
The charismatic party leader had been assassinated two weeks before the election .
Pseudo - Dictionary
True , indeed .
People vote with emotions , self - identification and fear , but not critical thinking , logical analysis and contextual awareness .
Emotions means they pick whoever panders to them and appears to be the nicest ; self - identification means they pick a political outlook like a sports team and cheer for it ; fear means they vote against things more than they vote for them .
Reality is far away .
That 's the unpopular truth .
Addressing Clergy
Note that priests and their superiors and religious should be treated with the utmost respect .
The rules of etiquette that apply when dealing with people of different social standing apply here as well , for example : during introductions , laymen are introduced to priests or their superiors and religious ( e.g. , " Father , I present Mrs. Doe. Mrs. Doe , this is Father Smith . " ) ; clergy and religious should be seated at the right hand of a host ( or hostess , as the case may be ) ; at social gatherings , they should be seated in the place of honor , etc .
A note on kneeling : Kneel on the left knee for persons ( Kings , Bishops , Archbishops , Patriarchs , Cardinals , Popes , etc. ) ;
Kneel on the right knee for Christ in the tabernacle ;
Kneel on both knees when the Eucharist is exposed .

Some 12,545 cholera cases have been recorded since August , the UN says Zimbabwe 's government has asked for urgent international help to tackle its cholera outbreak , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has said .
At a meeting with aid agencies , Health Minister David Parirenyatwa is reported to have asked for medicine , equipment and funds to pay medical staff .
Cholera has killed at least 565 people in Zimbabwe since August , the UN says .
Ministers previously said the outbreak was under control .
They blamed it on Western sanctions on President Mugabe .
On Wednesday , police in the Zimbabwean capital , Harare , broke up a protest march by doctors and nurses angered at the worsening outbreak .
Witnesses said officers used batons to disperse and beat up the crowd of health workers .
The authorities also prevented trade union members staging a protest over the country 's banking meltdown .
Dr Malvern Nyamutora , vice president of the junior doctors ' association , said they had asked for permission to protest but were denied .
They went ahead with the protest , but before they could put up their banners and placards " the brutal police force of Zimbabwe had pounced on us , " he told the BBC 's World Today programme .
One of his colleagues suffered a perforated eardrum after being hit by a baton .
" They just came , they did n't explain anything , they just said ' disperse ' and started hitting everyone , and people were running around the streets of Harare . "
Without water
At the aid meeting , Mr Parirenyatwa said his government needed water as well as sanitation equipment , the WHO 's communications officer in Harare , Paul Garwood , told the BBC .
In some parts of town there is raw sewage running down streets
Harare diarist Esther
Harare diary : ' Too much to take ' ' Water crisis hinders cholera fight '
" What the government has done today is request support and we 're very keen to provide that support , " he said .
" It was the first time where the minister has called all the parties together to detail all the needs of the government . "
Mr Garwood added that the WHO had flown enough anti-cholera supplies and medicines to Harare that day to treat up to 2,000 moderate cases .
Some 12,545 cases of cholera have been recorded in Zimbabwe since August , according to the latest statement from the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
Most of Zimbabwe 's capital has been without water since Sunday .
See detailed map of affected areas " In some parts of town there is raw sewage running down streets , " BBC News website Harare diarist Esther says .
The spread of cholera has been aided by the collapse of Zimbabwe 's health and sanitation systems amid a prolonged economic and political crisis .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Meanwhile , it has been confirmed that the Limpopo River , on Zimbabwe 's border with South Africa , has been contaminated with cholera .
South African local health department spokesman Phuti Seloba has warned people not to use the river water at all .
Cases of cholera have been reported either side of Zimbabwe 's borders with South Africa , Botswana and Mozambique .
The BBC's Peter Biles reports from the South African town of Musina , near the border with Zimbabwe , that cholera patients are being treated at an emergency centre on the lawn in front of the hospital .
One cholera victim from Harare told him that on Zimbabwe 's side of the border , toilets had not functioned for a month , and people were " defecating everywhere " .
Meanwhile Amnesty International said a human rights activist was abducted at dawn from her home in Norton , south of Harare , by a group of at least 12 armed plain - clothes men , who identified themselves as policemen .
The organisation challenged Zimbabwe 's government immediately to disclose the whereabouts of Jestina Mukoko , who is the director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project .
Shortages
The government has blamed its crisis on Western sanctions it says are aimed at trying to bring down President Robert Mugabe .
The health sector has been unable to cope with the cholera outbreak
But the sanctions imposed after allegations of electoral fraud and political violence are aimed at Mr Mugabe and his close associates and consist of travel bans and a freeze on their foreign assets .
Amid Zimbabwe 's severe economic crisis , central bank governor Gideon Gono will lift import duty on basic goods , the state - run Herald newspaper reports .
" I believe this is the best Christmas present we can present to consumers this festive season , " the Herald quotes him as saying .
The latest estimated annual inflation rate was 231,000,000 % , and just one adult in 10 is thought to have a regular job .

Technology reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley
Google launched a " Free the Airwaves " campaign to open up white spaces Federal regulators have approved a plan to use currently unlicensed parts of the US TV airwaves , known as white spaces , to deliver broadband services .
For more than two years this proposal has pitted new media against old .
Companies , including Google , HP and Microsoft , say opening up the spectrum would improve internet access for Americans , especially in rural areas .
But opponents , from TV networks to Broadway producers , say it could disrupt their over - the - air signals .
The unanimous 5 - 0 vote by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) is being seen as a major victory for the big technology companies that lobbied long and hard to open up the white spaces , which are the empty airwaves between television channels .
They have said the plan would encourage innovation and investment in much the same way the spread of Wi-Fi technology has and this would lead to the creation of internet - connected wireless gadgets .
We will soon have Wi-Fi on steroids since these spectrum signals have a much longer range than today 's Wi-Fi technology
Google co-founder Larry Page " This is a clear victory for internet users and anyone who wants good wireless communications , " wrote Google co-founder Larry Page in a company blog following the FCC 's decision .
" This will put better and faster internet connections in the hands of the public .
" We will soon have Wi-Fi on steroids since these spectrum signals have a much longer range than today 's Wi-Fi technology . "
It was a view backed by the national nonpartisan media reform group Free Press , which noted that nearly half of all American homes were still not connected to broadband .
" On this election day , the FCC chose to put politics aside and voted in favour of a policy grounded in sound science , " said policy director Ben Scott .
Testing devices
" The bipartisan decision to open white spaces puts consumers first , marking a change in internet policy we can all believe in .
" It 's time to start a new era of innovation that will help close the digital divide and provide internet for everyone , " added Mr Scott .
Microsoft 's chief research and strategy officer , Craig Mundie , said the ruling " ushers in a new era of wireless broadband innovation " .
Companies like Google and Microsoft stand to benefit because this unused spectrum would allow much wider access to the internet services that they offer .
FCC chairman Kevin Martin has said the approval of the rules authorising the use of white spaces includes provisions meant to protect TV broadcasts and microphones .
Microsoft says white - space devices could be ready within 18 months
He added that any device offered by a technology company would have to go " through a rigorous certification process " .
Mr Martin said the FCC 's engineers had already taken the " extra step " of undertaking months of testing of white - space devices , to determine whether they could be used without interfering with other broadcasts and microphones .
The prototype devices used were submitted by Microsoft , Phillips Electronics , Motorola and Adaptrum Inc .
But the National Association of Broadcasters , which represents more than 8,000 local and national TV stations , has said the tests have not been rigorous enough and ignore some obvious flaws in white - space devices .
And Maximum Services Television , a broadcasters ' group , said the decision " imperils American 's television reception in order to satisfy the ' free ' spectrum demands of Google and Microsoft " .
In the past week more than 50 members of Congress , including Senator Hillary Clinton , joined others such as Guns N' Roses , Dolly Parton , the Recording Academy and the American Federation of Musicians , to ask the FCC not to open up white spaces .

No , we will never tolerate unfairness .
And it 's our right to say so .
by Jeremy Hooper
If we hear one more " yes on 8 " person calling the LGBT community " intolerant " for standing up against the recently passed biased , we are going to pull our hair out .
It , along with accusations of " gay hate , " have become the rally cries of Team Anti-Marriage Equality ™ .
However , it is nothing more than an attempt to flip the tables on the true victims here so that they who voted in favor of inequality can feel better about their choice .
We see right through it .
When the playground bully steals your lunch money , it is not " intolerant " to protest your new , midday meal - deprived status .
In fact , one might argue that we 're all compelled to stand firm against the anti-" live and let live " attitude that has kept this so - called " culture war " alive and unwell for far too long !
One must fight for their right to be treated with respect .
And if the proper recourse is to go to a reasoned body whose job it is to have an enhanced understanding of the rules ( be it the teachers or the Supreme Court ) , then we will gladly seek justice from said crew .
On the same token , it is also not a denial of anyone 's first amendment freedoms to question others '
Prop 8 support .
Are we , the " no on 8 " supporters , members of the government out to stifle speech or expression ?
NO !
We are deeply hurt citizens who are using our own first amendment right to speak out against the bias we see in the world .
And when you look at great the numbers of people from all walks of life who are turning out to the Prop 8 protests , you cannot deny that there are A LOT of us .
A lot of us who are in a state of utter shock that our fellow taxpayers used their personal , typically religiously - motivated beliefs to deny gays of their equality !!
Those on the " yes on 8 " side stood their ground for months .
Rather than accept the Supreme Court 's ruling , they put up a measure to tyrannical override it .
Rather than quietly pray for the measure to pass , they used their right to advertise it incessantly .
Rather than stay home , they held rally after rally in support of rights elimination .
Rather than deny themselves their opportunity for political participation , they put up a butt load of " yes on 8 " signs in their yards .
Rather than vote " no " and respect their gay and lesbian neighbors , they chose to foist their personal ( typically faith - based ) views on civil society as a whole .
Rather than buy us a gift off our registry , they chose to put their cash on a public record in support of Prop 8 .
And they had every right to do so .
They exercised their voice .
They let us know what they view to be " tolerance . "
They showed us just how much value they place on our lives and loves .
They seized their first amendment and they spoke out , loudly and deceptively .
We are now using our right to tell them ( a ) just how much they 've hurt us , ( b ) how deeply discriminatory their actions were ( despite their denials ) , and ( c ) how unfavorably we think future generations will look back on their vote .
If they do n't like the message we are sending , then by all means , they should stand their ground .
But do n't you dare use our honest , heartfelt reactions as an example of " gay intolerance . "
The difference between " no on 8 " and " yes on 8 " is that if they would just STOP TRYING TO DENY OUR CIVIL EQUALITY , we would not give a flying fart about how firmly or often they pray against our lives .
But they , on the other hand , are brought to rage just by our mere , benign , quiet , peaceful , existences !
And even worse , they paint them as a " threat " to families , children , and society !
THAT , my friends , is intolerance .
Your thoughts
Do n't pull your own hair out .
Pull out the other person's , or at least threaten them .

And do n't forget - please mention - that they lied intentionally about how " homosexuality will be taught to children , especially kindergarteners . "
When you lie , there are consequences and you have no one to blame but yourself .
Posted by : a. mcewen | Nov 12 , 2008 11:46:27 AM
Let 's not , in the name of equality , tell people of faith to stay home and shut up .
What a country this would be if everyone just " stayed home " and " quietly prayed " instead of speaking up and voting .
I believe in God , and I believe he expects me to kneel down and pray , and then get up and do something .
This post is quite hypocritical and counterproductive , not to mention offensive .
Posted by : Brett | Nov 12 , 2008 12:17:33 PM
No Brett , what 's counterproductive and offensive is to put words in our mouth !
The post does not tell anyone to stay home and shut up .
In fact , it 's all about everyone 's right to stand their ground !
It says they had every right to speak out , and that they should continue to do so if they do n't like the message we are sending !
We are saying that the " yes on 8 " side stood their ground .
Firmly .
And now we are standing ours .
FIRMLY .

EVERYONE at least follow this : JOIN THE IMPACT.com started Nov. 7 now has 49 states , 80 cities and one million prepared to protest NOV 15th .
Reason :
We have allowed our opponents to take our issues and make them local .
Once they have divided us , they take their national movement and attack our smaller state - wide or even city - wide one .
JoinTheImpact was forged as a way to give our community a national stage .
We all must work towards equality in our state , but we need to know that every member of our community , across the nation cares about what happens in every state .
California , Arkansas , Florida , and Arizona should not stand alone in this fight .
We must all stand with them and for each other .
These ideals are what spawned JoinTheImpact .
MISSION STATEMENT : Join the Impact - Protest Prop 8 on November 15th !
In an effort to make a positive impact in the lives of our community , our allies , and even our opposition , JoinTheImpact.com emerged .
Our movement seeks to encourage the LGBTQ community not to look towards the past and place blame , but instead to look forward toward what needs to be done now to achieve one goal : Full equality for ALL .
We stand for reaching out across all communities .
We do not stand for bigotry , for scapegoating , or using anger as our driving force .
Our mission is to encourage our community to engage our opposition in a conversation about full equality and to do this with respect , dignity , and an attitude of outreach and education .
JoinTheImpact , as an entity , will not encourage divisiveness , violence , or disrespect of others and we do not approve of this .

Ok , Madonna is said to be hooking up with this gorgeous male model who 's name is Jesus Luz .
That 's right folks , I said Jesus and for short I will call him ' Love ' .
The two met during a W magazine photo shoot and the ' Material Girl ' was evidently so enraptured by ' Love ' that she asked him to come along to Sao Paolo for her next tour stop .

Pictured : Schoolboy archer survives after friend shoots an arrow through his eye
A schoolboy archer cheated death after he was shot through the eye by a friend .
The arrow went through 11 - year - old Liu Cheong 's eye socket , completely through his head and was only stopped by the back of his skull .
He only survived because the arrow had miraculously missed his brain .
Stricken : Liu Cheong can be seen lying on a hospital bed after the arrow went straight through his eye socket
Surgeons spent four hours removing the 16in arrow which had sunk more than four inches into the boy 's head .
They had to break off part of it just to get him in the CT scanner .
The teammate who shot him - a 13 - year - old girl called Yan Shin - is being treated for shock .
Teachers at Jiutai City school in China said they believed the youngsters were practicing on their own when the accident happened .
Escape :
The 16inch arrow had sunk more than four inches into Liu's head
' If the arrow had been shot with just a bit more force , it would have come out the back of his head , ' doctors at Jida Hospital in Changchun , eastern China said .
After brain scans and x-rays , doctors began to cut away parts of his skull to remove the arrow without damaging optic nerves or brain tissue .
His parents have been warned he still faces a risk of infection and may need further operations .
' It is a miracle he survived the accident , ' said one medic .
There are some people who say that the PC gaming market is in jeopardy , that it can't survive competition with consoles and that it's too hard to publish a game on PC without it being pirated to hell and back .
Those people are going to be proved wrong pretty quickly now .
Valve has today issued it 's sales figures for it 's games catalogue as it sold in stores ( I.e. these sales figures do n't count Valve 's own distribution platform , Steam ) and the results are absolutely astounding .
Ready ?
The original , Valve 's first game and one of the most critically lauded PC titles ever , has sold an average of one million copies every year ever since it was first released in 1998 .
That 's an average of one million copies per year , for ten years , .
Wowzers .
meanwhile , which was the first game to launch predominantly on Valve 's Steam service , has sold more than 6.5 million copies in just four years and is still clocking up retail sales .
The Orange Box has managed to sell 3 million copies at retail ever since that was released just last year and Left4 Dead is currently on track to beat that record by more than 500,000 copies .
A lot of the success of the original games has obviously come from the fact that bothgames got excellent mod support from the start - but that only proves that you do n't need to be Valve to make money off the PC .
Whilebegan as a free mod for theengine and the developers later joined Valve more than 4 million people bought the standalonepackage which does n't come with any other games .
Again , without Steam .
Just to prove that you do n't need to be all shooter - riffic to make some money from the PC too the sales figures for Garry 's Mod were released recently too .
The game , which is essentially a Lego - kit for theengine , has made the independent team behind the game more than $ 3 million in sales in just two years , though that figurecounts Steam sales .
PC gaming is dead you say ?
Pfft .
We can't wait to see the sales figures that include digital sales , how about you ?

Teachers who get drunk on a Saturday night could be barred from the classroom under a code of conduct that the profession 's disciplinary body , the General Teaching Council , is drafting .
The new code , due to come into force next year , aims to put more emphasis on a teacher 's responsibility to act as a role model outside of school .
The council 's chief executive , Keith Bartley , said most teachers already practised high standards of behaviour outside school , but that it was " important that our processes reflect the dignity of teaching " .
Whether a teacher faced disciplinary action over a breach of the code committed outside school hours would depend on the circumstances , the council 's head of professional regulation , David Jones , said .

A decision to suspend or bar a teacher could hinge on their attitude towards their behaviour .
The code states a teacher can be struck off over failing to follow child protection procedures ; lax supervision on school trips ; making inappropriate sexual comments ; or engaging in inappropriate relationships with pupils – including by texting or writing to them .
The emphasis on promoting the rights and wellbeing of children follows concerns about professionals failing to recognise signs of child abuse in cases like that of Baby P .
Beirut vs. Beer Pong
A great deal of confusion could be avoided if beirut always referred to the game of beer pong without paddles , and beer pong always referred to the game of beer pong with paddles , but beer pong remains a correct label for beirut .
The Square vs. Rectangle Argument
In geometry , a rectangle is defined as : a polygon with 4 sides connected at right angles .
A square is defined as : a polygon with 4 sides of equal length connected at right angles .
The definition of a square can be reduced to : a rectangle with sides of equal length .
These postulates lead us to the conclusion that all squares are rectangles , but all rectangles are not squares .
Using this pattern of logic , beer pong can be defined as : a game played with beer and ping pong balls .
Beirut can be defined as : a game played with beer and ping pong balls without paddles .
This definition of beirut can be reduced to : beer pong without paddles .
These postulates lead us to the conclusion that all forms of beirut are forms of beer pong , but all forms of beer pong are not forms of beirut .
The Poker Argument
Poker is a game that can be played with a seemingly endless number of variations that are all considered poker .
Beer pong with paddles and beirut rival poker with the diversity of rules available .
This is why the Beirut House Rules Generator™ was needed .
In common use , poker games sometimes include the word poker ( e.g. Pai Gow Poker ) , but often do not ( e.g. 7 Card Stud , Texas Hold 'em ) .
Following this example , beirut should officially be named Beirut Beer Pong , but known commonly as Beirut .
An Extended Poker Analogy
The Stud Poker naming convention converts perfectly to the Beirut Beer Pong naming convention .
When referring to Stud Poker , it is more common to simply say the number of cards followed by " Stud " with no mention of " Poker " ( e.g 7 Card Stud ) .
Beirut is consistently referred to by the number of cups followed by " Beirut " ( e.g. 6 Cup Beirut ) .
Many times 7 Card Stud will be played with additional rules such as " Low Chicago " or " Deuces Wild " ( e.g. 7 Card Stud with Deuces Wild ) .
Similar variations exist in Beirut such as " No Blowing " or " 2 Balls " ( e.g. 6 Cup Beirut with 2 Balls ) .
Conclusion
The logical reasoning and examples put forth in this article should settle once and for all the Beirut vs. Beer Pong argument .
For those that are still unconvinced , settle it over a good game of beer pong ... oops ... beirut .

Cheney charged with organized criminal activity
November 18 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
update !
From the AP on November 19 , 2008 :
A Texas judge has set a Friday arraignment for Vice President Dick Cheney , former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and others named in indictments accusing them of responsibility for prisoner abuse in a federal detention center .
So says the AP on November 18 , 2008 :
Cheney is charged with engaging in an organized criminal activity related to the vice president ’s investment in the Vanguard Group , which holds financial interests in the private prison companies running the federal detention centers .
It accuses Cheney of a conflict of interest and “ at least misdemeanor assaults ” on detainees because of his link to the prison companies .
Gonzalez , too !
The indictment accuses Gonzales of using his position while in office to stop an investigation in 2006 into abuses at one of the privately - run prisons .
and this is cute :
Regarding the indictments targeting the public officials , [ District Attorney ]
Guerra said , “ the grand jury is the one that made those decisions , not me . ”
but before we get too excited :
The indictment returned Monday has not yet been signed by the presiding judge , and no action can be taken until that happens .
and yes , the District Attorney is the lunatic we ’ve been looking for :
Last month , Banales dismissed indictments that charged Guerra with extorting money from a bail bond company and using his office for personal business .
An appeals court had earlier ruled that a special prosecutor was improperly appointed to investigate Guerra .
After Guerra ’s office was raided as part of the investigation early last year , he camped outside the courthouse in a borrowed camper with a horse , three goats and a rooster .
He threatened to dismiss hundreds of cases because he believed local law enforcement had aided the investigation against him .
and he may be right …
Willacy County has become a prison hub with county , state and federal lockups .
Guerra has gone after the prison - politician nexus before , extracting guilty pleas from three former Willacy and Webb county commissioners after investigating bribery related to federal prison contacts .
Last month , a Willacy County grand jury indicted The GEO Group , a Florida private prison company , on a murder charge in the death of a prisoner days before his release .
The three - count indictment alleged The GEO Group allowed other inmates to beat Gregorio de la Rosa Jr. to death with padlocks stuffed into socks .
The death happened in 2001 at the Raymondville facility .
In 2006 , a jury ordered the company to pay de la Rosa ’s family $ 47.5 million in a civil judgment .
The Cheney - Gonzales indictment makes reference to the de la Rosa case .

The Joel Tenenbaum file - swapping case continues to get weirder -- and we 're still months away from an actual trial .
Not only has the RIAA now appealed the judge 's order allowing one particular hearing to be webcast , but music industry lawyers are now seeking sanctions on Tenenbaum 's lawyer , Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson .
The webcasting issue is perhaps the oddest ; the RIAA appears to believe that broadcasting pretrial hearings will influence the potential jury pool for the trial .
Although the judge called the group 's arguments " specious " when she rejected them , music industry lawyers have now appealed the ruling to the First Circuit Court of Appeals .
The First Circuit then agreed to consider the appeal , delaying this week 's expected hearing until sometime in February .
And although the trial is n't yet underway , the proceedings have already grown rancorous .
Nesson ( and the students at Harvard Law School who are doing much of the heavy lifting ) has been trying to compel a deposition from Matthew Oppenheim .
It 's difficult to discern what Oppenheim does , exactly - - he's not currently employed by the RIAA but appears to be heading up their legal campaign .
( He was also present at the Jammie Thomas trial in Minnesota . )
Why does Nesson want to depose Oppenheim ?
As Nesson told the court , " Mr. Oppenheim has assumed the central role in the prosecution of the instant action , and in the broader litigation campaign of which this action is a part ...
The scope of information sought in this deposition includes , but is not limited to , Mr. Oppenheim 's knowledge of the steps taken by Plaintiffs against Defendant before and after the commencement of this action ; the formulation and execution of the litigation campaign of which this suit against Defendant is a part ; the decision - making process that gave rise to the campaign ; and the document flow and decision - making process among the four Plaintiffs and the RIAA . "
This fits with one of Nesson 's main concerns : to attack the entire litigation strategy of the RIAA , claiming that the group has been prosecuting essentially criminal cases under civil rules .
He , and the students who work with him , want to do much more than simply win this one particular case .
To depose someone , certain rules must be followed .
Proper notice must be given and a subpoena must be properly served .
Though Nesson insists that this was all done correctly , the recording industry could n't disagree more .
They accuse Nesson , in particular , of a huge variety of procedural faults , including not serving Oppenheim in person ( but only by mail and e-mail ) and by not providing the necessary compensation and mileage reimbursement required by law .
" Defendant 's repeated failure to follow basic rules of procedure , including specifically the failures noted above concerning Defendant 's Motion , have unnecessarily complicated these proceedings , " a recent RIAA court filing told the judge .
" It is also apparent that Defendant 's counsel , rather than Defendant , is responsible for these failures to confer and to follow simple rules .
Accordingly , Plaintiffs ask that Defendant 's counsel be ordered to pay Plaintiffs ' costs , including reasonable attorney fees , incurred in filing this opposition to Defendant 's Motion . "
Nesson noted the proposed sanctions on his Twitter feed , saying , " ' letter ' just received threatening me with sanctions for moving to compel matt oppenheim 's deposition . "
Friday , the main Twitter feed for the defendants , noted that Nesson is now facing proposed Rule 11 sanctions for frivolous legal action .
If the pre-trial back - and - forth is this contentious , one can only imagine the fireworks at the trial itself -- which , if the Harvard folks have their way , will be broadcast in its entirety .
From many of the comic book lists on this site you can tell Toptenz .
net is big supporter of comic books .
In today ’s comic books you do n’t see the advertisements you used to – no ads with outrageous promises to be taller or more muscular .
No advertisements to own a nuclear sub or army tank can be found nowadays .
But if you look in older comic books you ’ll see a treasure trove of sneaky ads , crazy claims , preposterous promises and looney lies .
We ’ve tried to bring you the worst comic book ads of the bunch .
Here are 10 of the most outrageous comic book advertisements ever .
Read on , true believer !
10 . Sea Monkeys
A bowl full of happiness :
How many of us were suckered into purchasing these aquatic miracles of life ?
An entire humanoid - looking family of pets for our amusement .
This was great and surely the pictures ( illustrations ) would never lie .
Heck , they might even be able to speak .
After all they have mouths and sparkling white teeth .
And look at the size of the shadows in the fish bowl !
They are enormous .
I do like the way the father ( male ) has his tail strategically placed over his crotch .
The Truth :
They were just above microscopic size and certainly did n’t look anything like a human or a mermaid .
They were usually dead within a week .
Next time buy gold fish .
9. Amazing X - Ray Specs
A Hilarious Optical Illusion :
Well , the ad does have the word illusion written in bold , so we were only fooling ourselves if we believed the x-ray glasses would actually work .
Did it not occur to us that doctors would be wearing these x-ray specs if they could see through things ?
Well , I guess doctors did n’t read comics so maybe they just did n’t know about this medical marvel .
The Truth :
You paid for glasses that made things look blurry which gave the “ illusion ” of seeing through objects .
Your only hope was to pawn these disappointing specs on the next sucker .
Too bad you could n’t “ see through ” the scam .
8. How to Hypnotize – Hypno-coin
Impose will over someone – Sure , impose your will by learning these amazing hypnotic techniques .
You get 24 photographs to show you how .
And if they techniques are beyond you , ( although it states anyone can follow it ) you can order from the inset advertisement and get the Hypno - Coin .
How the heck do you spin it and why turn your victim into a zombie with arms held out in front ?
The Truth – While trying to hypnotize your friends you either look like an idiot as nothing happens or they fake being hypnotized and embarrass you as they ignore all your commands for world domination .
7. Charles Atlas
The insult that made a man out of Mac –
The best part of this comic book advertisement is the fifth panel as they show the passage of time with a simplistic “ Later ” .
How much later ?
One day , one month or one year ?
They do n’t say and if you follow the logic of the comic it looks like later that same summer season , so it must be only a few weeks at most .
Good to know that violence IS the answer , Mac .
Thanks , Charles Atlas !
The Truth – You received a big rubber band and got fed up after a few days of pulling rubber .
Then you start a company called Microsoft and the rest is history .
6. Automatic Firing Tripod Machine Gun
Develops Deadly Target Skill – Nothing like preparing our youth early for their days of protecting our country .
It ’s magazine fed and swivels in all directions .
So , once you kill all your enemies you can turn it against your fellow soldiers .
Friendly fire never felt so right .
And all this imaginary killing is yours for $ 1.98 !
The Truth – When it worked , it shot pellets which could , in the immortal words of Clark Griswald , “ … lodge under the skin and cause a very bad infection . ”
5. Build Your Own Apollo Lunar Module
You get all this for just one dime –
The real beauty of this was that you actually mailed the dime in the safety coin holder included – do not tape or seal .
And you got , not one , but two lunar astronauts in FULL space gear .
Good to know your toy astronauts will not be braving fake space without full space gear .
The Truth –
It was just a scale model and you will only be traveling to space in your dreams , but you did get a trial membership at the Science Program , whatever that was .
And why was it a trial ?
4. Grow Man Grow – Be Taller
Height gain guaranteed –
If you are worried about being short , act NOW !
It actually says , “ Tall up instantly . ”
How do you tall up ?
If you look at the picture it would also leave you to believe you get pumped up too .
Pump up instantly ?
Your new height secrets will be rushed to you in a PLAIN WRAPPER .
This sounds insidious , but gaining 3 inches is worth the possible embarrassment .
Wait , are we talking about your height or that certain part of the male anatomy ?
The Truth – At best you were sent a pair of shoe lifts .
At worst you were sent advice like , “ Stand up straighter . ”
Either way you were n’t going to be any taller .
And no , gaining 3 inches was not meant for your , well … you know .
3. Live Miniature Dog at No Cost
Please give me a home at no cost – Paris Hilton must have read this ad to get her tea cup dog , poodle , or whatever it is .
They give you good advice and say you can keep it in a box and enjoy teaching it tricks .
Yes , like play dead , because keeping your dog in a box will suck all the life out of it .
But hurry , they only have a limited supply of miniature dogs .
Imagine the storage facilities .
The Truth – You could get a dog ( and some ads offered a monkey ) if you could get 20 of your friends to order hand colored enlargements of photos they send in to Dean Studios , the ad ’s sponsor .
I ’m betting not many people could sucker 20 other people to pay for this rip off , but I assume a few did .
Getting the mutant dog or the half - dead monkey with HIV must have been quite a reality check .
2. 200 World War II Soldier
2 armies , the Americans , the Germans – Okay , I certainly did n’t believe I would be getting real soldiers in the mail .
But I fully expected to receive unbreakable plastic army men .
I have outlined the promise of indestructible plastic army men in red .
Feel free to click the picture to see a larger image .
It states it quite clearly .
UNBREAKABLE .
I assume I was getting some space - age plastic that would resist all efforts to destroy these men of plastic .
The Truth – These plastic army men met their demise with frightening ease .
Of course they melted effortlessly and I can forgive that .
But a few days after receiving them it looked like war had , indeed , been hell .
Many were missing legs , arms and even heads , but they continued to fight on …brave soldiers that they were .
I was disappointed as one bite would render any plastic soldier headless .
1. Nuclear Sub , Army Tank – Toys of War
“ Fires Rockets & Torpedoes ” – With that one statement all bets are off .
This submarine must work .
I do n’t care how it was powered .
You could power it with a nuclear reactor or rubber bands but I fully expected it to submerge and fire freakin’ torpedoes .
Is that too much to ask ?
And when I read I ’m getting a real mobile tank I fully expected to be crushing the neighborhood bully under my metal machine of death .
A real working , electronically lit control panel only adds to the promise of realism .
The Truth – Each item is really just a weak cardboard cut - out you put together .
And nothing worked .
No rockets and no torpedoes from your sub and your tank could be trampled by a pack of ill - tempered kittens .
Lesson learned , you ca n’t get instruments of war for under $ 7.00 with a 10 - day free trial .
You just can ’t .
Sigh …

The Journal 's Ben Casselman reports :
Remember the days when we were all buying huge houses , driving SUVs and complaining about the price of gas ?
You know , 2007 ?
The Census Bureau is out today with a pretty good picture of life back in those heady days .
It ’s the annual Statistical Abstract of the United States , a massive compilation of data on everything from education to law enforcement to recreation .
It ’s always full of interesting tidbits , but this year ’s report is especially striking because of how much has changed since the data were collected , not least in the energy sector .
Take transportation .
Americans used 8 percent more energy on transportation in 2007 than in 2003 .
Between 2002 and 2006 — the most recent data available — they drove 6 percent more miles in a year , and drove 13 percent more miles in SUVs , pickups and vans .
All that driving used 175 billion gallons of fuel .
We do n’t yet know what those numbers will look like in 2008 , but it ’s a good bet they ’ll be lower .
As Ana Campoy reported yesterday , Americans are driving less .
To prevent a recurrence with artemisinin therapies , the United States has put aside political considerations and approved a malaria monitoring center in military - run Myanmar , formerly Burma .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , one of the largest donors to malaria research , is giving $ 14 million to the Thai and Cambodian governments to help pay for a containment program .
That program includes efforts to supply the area with mosquito nets , a screening program for everyone living in affected areas and follow - up visits by health workers to assess the effectiveness of the drugs , said Dr. Duong Socheat , director of Cambodia ’s National Malaria Center .
On the Thai side of the border , the government has “ motorcycle microscopists ” who take blood samples from villagers and migrant workers , analyze them on the spot and distribute antimalaria drugs .
But some experts would like to see an even more aggressive approach .
“ Many of us think this should be treated on the same order as SARS , ” said Col. Alan J. Magill , a researcher at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland .
“ This should be a global emergency that is addressed in a global fashion . ”
SARS , the respiratory disease that spread rapidly through Asia and beyond in 2003 , killed more than 700 people .
The falciparum parasite is one of four types of malaria and by far the most virulent .
It enters the bloodstream through a mosquito bite , and after incubating about two weeks , it multiplies and takes over red blood cells .
There it causes fever , chills , headaches and nausea , among other symptoms .
If untreated , the infected cells can block blood vessels and fatally cut off blood supply to vital organs .
The recent studies show that artemisinin - based drugs are becoming less effective in removing the parasite from the bloodstream .
While a few years ago it took the drugs 48 hours to clear the bloodstream of parasites , it now can take 120 hours .
“ What our study demonstrates is that therapy for some patients fails  the malaria goes away and comes back , ” said Lt. Col .
Mark M. Fukuda , a United States Army doctor whose study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December .
Different regions rely on different artemisinin combinations .
The Cambodian government recommends that artemisinin be combined with mefloquine , which was developed by the American military and is known commercially as Lariam .
Artemether , a derivative of artemisinin , is often combined with another antimalarial drug , lumefantrine .
This was recently judged to be the most effective combination in a study of children in Papua New Guinea .
The output of the world 's gold mines fell by 4 % last year , according to estimates in a new report from the GFMS , a consultancy .
More than half the 88 - tonne fall in production was accounted for by a slump in gold mining in Indonesia .
Supply from South Africa , once the world 's largest producer , fell by 14 % — the biggest drop since the Boer War .
Last year 's fall was partly owing to new safety procedures , which helped reduce the industry 's fatality rate .
Skills shortages and power cuts also affected operations .
Australia 's output fell by 14 % , too , amid reports that some fledgling mining firms faced closure because of scarce credit .
Of the world 's six big producers , China , Russia and Peru all increased output last year .
Across Israel , Arab leaders are reporting the same thing : the are called in by Israeli police , or by Shin Bet , and are threatened over the growing protests in their communities against the military operation against the Gaza Strip .
“ The call in imams , distinguished sheikhs , and even school teachers – all under threats , ” complained MP Abas Zkoor .
“ They are told that they will be held responsible for all the riots and if they continue security forces will make sure they can no longer serve in their offices . ”
In Jaffa , leaders of the significant Arab minority were summoned for meetings with Shin Bet .
Local Balad chairman Sami Abu Shahada says “ every meeting went over the same things :
‘ There is a limit to democracy .
What ’s happening in Jaffa in an expression of disloyalty toward Israel .
You are responsible for inciting , and for every stone thrown . ”
But what is happening in Jaffa ?
From media reports , not much .
The annual street festival was canceled by officials on Saturday , citing “ tensions , ” and 2,000 people were reported to have “ silently commemorated the dead ” in the Gaza Strip .
There were no reports of violence , no reports of stones thrown .
Since then there have been some protests , but seemingly little of the violence that has plagued rallies elsewhere in the country .
But tensions in Jaffa are hardly surprising … the growing toll in Gaza has sparked outcry across Israel ’s Arab community , and growing distrust against them for their war opposition .
In addition , the war started only a week after an incident in which persons unknown spray - painted “ Death to Arabs ” and other slogans on one of the major mosques in this mixed community .
Little appears to have been done by police over that incident , though they are out in force now to silence protesters .
Apple has finally started allowing developers to issue free promotional copies of their iPhone applications .
Once an application has been accepted to the App Store by Apple , developers can issue up to 50 promotional codes .
The codes allow the recipient to download a full copy of the application for free .
Presently , these codes can only be used in the U.S. iTunes Stores by using the " Redeem " link in the App Store .
As an example , Smudge Apps sent us a promotional copy of Jam : Vol 1 [ App Store ] .
Codes can be issued for existing applications and the 50 code limit is reset for each new version of an application .
In the past , it has been difficult for developers to provide review or promotional copies , instead having to reply on Ad - hoc distributions or the issuing of gift certificates .

Paul Krugman is desperate for answers ; in Fifty Herbert Hoovers , he asks how we got here , ( “ here ” , of course , being a severe recession ) and offers the typical Keynesian stimulus prescription to get us out of here , and back to a more prosperous time and place .
After all , we did n’t suddenly become less productive , did we ?
Think about it …
Our capacity has n’t been diminished ; our workers have n’t lost their skills ; our technological know - how is intact .
Why ca n’t we keep doing good things ?
It ’s a damn good question , and unfortunately the only sentence of any worth in the entire editorial .
I ’ve recently asked the same question :
Jobs , wealth , productivity , capital : all squandered , destroyed .
And now they say , “ The free market has failed you ! ”
Now , they say , “ You need Government more than ever before ! ” — How 80,000 Jobs Disappeared , 24 Nov. 2008
The difference is that Krugman views the government , which failed to prevent this recession , which failed to protect its citizens from economic cataclysm , as the appropriate solution , and since I view it as the proximate cause of this ( and almost all ) human suffering , I reel at the idea of giving it yet more power , more control over us .
Where I argue for free markets which permit or encourage people to create and develop real and sustainable wealth , Krugman wants to see more public spending .
No modern American president would repeat the fiscal mistake of 1932 , in which the federal government tried to balance its budget in the face of a severe recession .
I would argue that no modern economist , especially not a Nobel Laureate , should look only at the fiscal policies of the depression era , in prescribing a solution for the current recession .
And that furthermore , a Nobel Laureate , one would presume , should be able to examine the crash of 1929 and the subsequent depression , and identify the policies that created the downturn in the first place , primarily the massive inflation of the money supply from 1921 to 1929 ( an annualized growth of 7.7 % ) .
Krugman can’t even set up a good Straw Man !
Some policies pursued during ( and in order to alleviate ) the Great Depression would include , but are not limited to inflation : massive public works spending , farm subsidies , tariffs on foreign goods , maintaining wage rates / price controls , raising taxes , etc .
When people needed desperately to be relived of governmental burdens , the dead weight of government rose from 16.4 % to 21.5 % of the gross private product … .
[ President Hoover had ammassed ] the largest peacetime deficiet yet known to American history .
— Murray N. Rothbard .
America ’s Great Depression , 5th Edition , pp263-264
What is it , with the Keynesian fetish for “ consumption ” ?
Why do they harbor such ill - will towards those who would save their money , especially in uncertain times ?
Like many economists , Krugman maintains a variant of the “ underconsumption ” theory of depression , private investors and individuals , they say , simply are n’t investing enough , or spending as much as they should be spending .
Krugman , for instance , argues that :
It ’s true that the economy is currently shrinking .
But that ’s the result of a slump in private spending .
It makes no sense to add to the problem by cutting public spending , too .
Since people are n’t spending enough , businesses lose money , and people are laid off , so they spend less , and the downward cycle continues .
Therefore , it is necessary for government to make up the difference through public spending on ditch - diggers and work camps .
And , one could almost make an argument for public spending , had the public any money to spend , but it does n’t .
Not at the state level , and not at the national level .
Krugman ’s advice , to “ spend ” now , is like telling the unemployed person not to get a job for minimum wage , but instead to load up his high - interest Capital One card with debt .
It ’s telling someone who is in financial distress , that the only way to remedy what ails him , is to spend more money that he does n’t have .
The Keynesian prescription for unemployment rests on the persistence of a “ money illusion ” among workers … Governmental inflation , then , is supposed to eliminate unemployment by bringing about such a fall in real wage rates .
— Rothbard , p. 37
Since the government simply does n’t have any money , they can only begin spending on public works by raising taxes or inflating the money supply , the latter being the preferred ( and easiest ) solution .
But , inflation has a price : it decimates savings , renders business and economic forecasting essentially impotent , and through teh dread malinvestment , causes resources to be used up in the production of unwanted goods and services .
Just as no man ever spent his way to a fortune , ever made himself sustainably wealthy by consuming , by destroying valuable goods and resources , and no nation will ever find prosperity along that path , either .
Asking for more spending when the money is not there , is pure nonsense .
Pure , fucking nonsense .
Ever wonder why nobody trusts an economist ?
For 2009 , here are my 10 resolutions for saving more taxes :
Resolution # 1 : Open a TFSA .
The new tax - free savings account , launched Jan. 1 , is the ideal place to put up to $ 5,000 of savings and earn tax - free income and / or gains for life .
Any withdrawals are not taxed , do not negatively affect eligibility for government - tested benefits and can be re-contributed the following calendar year .
Resolution # 2 : Maximize RRSP contributions .
The RRSP limit for 2009 is the lesser of 18 % of 2008 earned income or $ 21,000 .
Get a head start on your 2009 contribution today .
Resolution # 3 : Set up a spousal RRSP .
The primary benefit of a spousal RRSP is that funds withdrawn can generally be taxed in the hands of the ( hopefully ) lower - income spouse .
Resolution # 4 : Earn tax - efficient investment income .
For those who have maxed out their RRSP and TFSA contributions , consider tax - efficient investment income outside of these tax - sheltered plans by investing in Canadian dividends , which are eligible for the dividend tax credit , and capital gains , which are only half - taxable .
Resolution # 5 : Open up RESPs for kids .
Do n’t forget to make at least $ 2,500 of contributions to each child ’s registered education savings plan ( RESP ) this year to take advantage of the $ 500 Canada Education Savings Grant .
You may also be able to catch up on missed CESGs from prior years .
Resolution # 6 : Investigate pension splitting
If you ’ve received pension income in 2008 , be sure to investigate whether splitting up to half of that income with your spouse or partner makes sense when you file your 2008 tax return this spring .
Resolution # 7 : Consider income splitting .
A spousal income - splitting strategy whereby the higher - income spouse or partner loans funds to the lower - income spouse or partner to invest may be ideal given the record low prescribed rate , which is set at 2 % this quarter .
Resolution # 8 : Donate “ in kind ” to charity .
When planning your charitable giving for 2009 , consider donating appreciated securities directly to your charity of choice and eliminating all tax on any accrued capital gains .
Resolution # 9 : Plan now to avoid a tax refund .
If you regularly get a large tax refund each spring , consider applying for a reduction of tax at source using CRA Form T1213 .
This needs to be repeated each year .
Resolution # 10 : Consider opening an RDSP for a disabled person .
If you or someone you care about has a disability , consider opening up a registered disability savings plan .
Contributions to RDSPs , limited to $ 200,000 over the disabled beneficiary ’s lifetime , may be augmented by up to $ 90,000 in Canada Disability Savings Grants and Bonds .
Late last month , the government extended the deadline for opening an RDSP , making contributions and applying for the 2008 Grant and Bond to March 2 .
Next week : More on RDSPs .

PORTLAND , Maine ( AP ) �
An Old Orchard Beach woman who spent three days in the Cumberland County Jail has sued the county , alleging that she was strip - searched repeatedly and forced to shower in front of male inmates and guards as they ridiculed her .
PORTLAND , Maine ( AP ) �
An Old Orchard Beach woman who spent three days in the Cumberland County Jail has sued the county , alleging that she was strip - searched repeatedly and forced to shower in front of male inmates and guards as they ridiculed her .
The claim by Marci Ladakakos rekindles the legal debate over strip searches at Maine jails , which were the focus of class - action lawsuits in recent years in York and Knox counties .
In her lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court , Ladakakos , 30 , is seeking damages for what she claims was a violation of her civil rights .
" She has been traumatized and embarrassed by this entire incident , " said her lawyer , Neal Weinstein .
" It 's amazing to me that they think they are above the law . "
Cumberland County Sheriff Mark Dion says the allegations do n't hold up .
He says Ladakakos was on suicide watch at the time the incidents allegedly occurred and the jail 's strip - search policies make such misconduct impossible .
" Our protocols are pretty clear , in terms of the place it 's done , the manner it is done , " Dion said .
" As far as this gawking , parade type of thing happening , no .
As a matter of practice , that can't happen . "
The jail 's policy on searches matches the model policy recommended by several national corrections agencies , Dion said .
" Our goal is to make sure that we preserve people 's dignity and sense of privacy " while also maintaining a secure environment , he said .
The incidents allegedly began on July 10 , 2007 , when Ladakakos was arrested and brought to jail for failure to appear in court on five theft charges , four of them felonies .
The sheriff said a female guard strip - searched Ladakakos as she changed into jail clothes and was placed in an isolated cell in the jail 's medical unit .
Weinstein questioned why repeated searches were needed when his client remained in an isolated cell during the three days of her incarceration .
" She could n't bring anything into or out of the cell , so why do they need to strip - search her twice a day ?
It makes no sense at all , " he said .
Weinstein also said that while the jail may have a worthy policy regarding searches , mistreatment of inmates is covered up by a " code of silence " among guards .
York and Knox counties each paid out more than $ 3 million to hundreds of former inmates to settle class - action lawsuits centered on strip - search policies .

The procedure will transplant cells onto the cornea
A new surgical treatment offering hope to patients with corneal blindness is to be trialled in Scotland .
Doctors in Edinburgh and Glasgow will work together using an innovative technique involving adult stem cells .
About 20 patients will take part in the initial tests , using cells cultivated before being transplanted onto the surface of the cornea .
Millions of people worldwide suffer from corneal blindness , 80 % of whom are elderly .
Stem cells are a source of great scientific interest as a result of their ability to renew and multiply indefinitely , potentially regenerating entire organs from only a few cells .
On a larger scale , it 's a significant problem
Prof Bal Dhillon
Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion
The trial is being led by Prof Bal Dhillon at the Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh , working with the Gartnavel General Hospital in Glasgow .
Prof Dhillon said : " This study is the first of its kind anywhere in the world and it is exciting to be involved in such groundbreaking work .
" I probably see two or three new cases of corneal disease every month .
On a larger scale , it 's a significant problem . "
The trial will hope to emulate the success of a similar study in the US in September last year .
In trials at the University of Pennsylvania , subjects with inherited blindness experienced dramatic improvements in vision after a corrective gene was injected into the eye .
Not too long ago , Eric J. signed up for Thawte ’s Personal E-mail Certificates service .
While reviewing the various account settings , he noticed something odd .
One of his “ Lost Password ” security questions read What was your alarm code to the Lindsay Bar in Trinity 1999 ?
Seeing that Eric did n’t have a house alarm in 1999 and , in fact , did n’t even know where Trinity was ( let alone the Lindsay Bar ) , Eric was pretty sure that it was some kind of mix - up .
He changed the security question back to What was your alarm code ?
and hit submit .
No dice .
When the page reloaded , it added the Lindsay Bar right back in the question .
A bit concerned at that point , Eric tried another question :
What was your first cat ’s name ?
Upon submitting the page , Thawte decided that he would rather have the question be What was your first cat ’s name ( uppercase ) , despite the fact that he had typed “ fur ball ” in lowercase .
And it also insisted that the question have a space between the word “ cat ” and the question mark .
It did n’t take Eric too long to realize what was happening .
For some bizarre reason , Thawte was completing his questions by using other user ’s questions .
When he typed in simply
What was , it shot back What was Seti 1 .
Typing in What did returned What did I find on Romsley hill ?
After Eric shared this with me , I signed up for a personal e-mail certificate at Thawte .
Within a few minutes , I not only had my my very own certificate , but limited access to all the fun questions that other people use .
Here are a few interesting security questions that Eric and I were able to dig up ( with the “ search ” question emphasized ) :
Personal :
What did i do 25/08/2005 10h AM ?
what did you do to herman ?
Where do I hide my conscience ?
Is this the best I can be ?
Will I ever be fat ?
How did I break a rib ?
Where did you find the holsters ?
Very Personal :
Who did you first sleep with ?
Who did you have a baby with ?
Who did you have sex with at VIPP ( 1st & last name ) ?
Does my wife have a pierced navel ?
Does your wife have a big butt ?
did I ever had sex ?
Do you love Allan ?
Questions we all want answered :
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow ?
How do baby wood ducks get down ?
why are chickens happy ?
Why was the 4th element introduced ?
Where did it all began ?
Is this a dream ?
Who know reading other people ’s secret questions could be such fun ?
Thankfully , this does n’t work on the answers .
As for why Thawte chose to implement shared questions in this manner ...
I ’ll leave that as an exercise in speculation for the reader .
Jan. 19 , 2009  --
The country is in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression , which is n't stopping rich donors and the government from spending $ 170 million , or more , on the inauguration of Barack Obama .
The actual swearing - in ceremony will cost $ 1.24 million , according to Carole Florman , spokeswoman for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies .
It 's the security , parties and countless Porta - a - Potty rentals that really run up the bill .
The federal government estimates that it will spend roughly $ 49 million on the inaugural weekend .
Washington , D.C. , Virginia and Maryland have requested another $ 75 million from the federal government to help pay for their share of police , fire and medical services .
And then there is the party bill .
" We have a budget of roughly $ 45 million , maybe a little bit more , " said Linda Douglass , spokeswoman for the inaugural committee .
That 's more than the $ 42.3 million in private funds spent by President Bush 's committee in 2005 or the $ 33 million spent for Bill Clinton 's first inaugural in 1993 .

Douglass said that this will be the " most open and accessible inauguration in history , " with members of the general public able to participate on a greater scale than ever before .
" The money is going toward providing events which we hope are going to connect people , make them feel like we are all in this together and reinforce the notion that when we pull together , we 're stronger , " Douglass said .
" And we need to pull together to face the challenges that are before us today . "
Among the expenses : a Bruce Springsteen concert , the parade , large - screen TV rentals for all - free viewing on the national Mall , $ 700,000 to the Smithsonian Institution to stay open and , of course , the balls , including three that are being pitched as free or low cost for the public .
But there are plenty of rich donors willing to pick up the tab .
" They are not the $ 20 and $ 50 donors who helped propel Obama through Election Day , " said Massie Ritsch , communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics .
" These are people giving mostly $ 50,000 apiece .
They tend to be corporate executives , celebrities , the elite of the elite . "
Best Seats in the House
The biggest group of donors were none other than the recently bailed - out Wall Street executives and employees .
" The finance sector is well represented , despite its recent troubles , " Ritsch said .
" Those who worked in finance still managed to pull together nearly $ 7 million for the inauguration . "
The donors will get some of the best seats in the house for the inauguration , as well as admittance to some of the best balls and other events .
" I do n't think that they 're going to get a whole lot of face time with the new president himself , " Ritsch said , " but they are certainly establishing themselves from day one as his biggest financial supporters .
And if there 's something they need or to tell him down the road , they will have an easier time doing that than everyone else . "
Besides Wall Street firms , a large chunk of the money came from employees at companies such as Microsoft , Google and DreamWorks Animation , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Microsoft CEO
Steven Ballmer and his wife , Connie , each gave $ 50,000 .
So did Microsoft chairman and co-founder Bill Gates and his wife , Melinda .
DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife , Marilyn , each gave $ 50,000 .
Filmmaker and DreamWorks co-founder Steven Spielberg and his wife , Kate , both also gave $ 50,000 .
And DreamWorks employees gave a total of $ 275,000 .
Billionaire investor George Soros and his family contributed $ 250,000 to the inauguration , and Google co-founder Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt each donated $ 25,000 .
Other big - name donors who gave $ 50,000 include filmmaker George Lucas , artist Dale Chihuly , Los Angeles Dodgers President Jamie McCourt .
Citigroup managing director Raymond J. McGuire ; Oracle President Charles E. Phillips Jr. ; actresses Halle Berry and Sharon Stone ; and Melvin Simon , co-founder of Simon Property Group , the largest mall owner in the United States .
Despite all the donations , Obama 's team has made donations much more restrictive than in the past .
Obama capped donations at $ 50,000 per person , which is still more than 10 times what individuals could give to his campaign , but a lot less than the $ 250,000 cap President Bush had at his last inauguration .
Contributions from corporations , labor unions , political action committees and registered lobbyists are not being accepted by Obama .
The Real Money
For Bill Clinton 's second inaugural in 1997 , contributions were capped to $ 100 .
But that committee had some leftover money from the previous inauguration and charged people up to $ 3,000 for inaugural tickets .
" We have the broadest fundraising restrictions in inaugural history , " Douglas said .
The inauguration team is also posting all donations of $ 200 or more on the Internet almost as quickly as they are coming in .
The law only requires it to disclose the information 90 days after the actual swearing - in .
" The transparency of this inaugural fundraising effort is unprecedented as far as we can remember , " Ritsch said .
" We see that as a positive step and hope it's an indication that President Obama will use technology to make government more responsive and transparent to people . "
That 's all the play money .
The bulk of cash will actually be spent on security and logistics .
In a letter to members of Congress , the governors of Maryland and Virginia , and the mayor of Washington said that their combined costs could exceed $ 75 million .
That 's on top of the $ 49 million the federal government is spending , again mostly for security .
" The historical significance of inaugurating the first African - American president of the United States alone makes the event unprecedented , " they wrote .
" Given its political significance , we expect that the event will be attended by hundreds , if not thousands , of elected U.S. government officials and foreign dignitaries .
Turnout by the general public for the swearing - in ceremony alone is likely to exceed 2 million .
Transportation officials estimate that roughly 10,000 charter buses will enter the District with approximately 500,000 riders alone , a number which nearly matches the city 's population . "
The emergency managers for the three jurisdictions said they expect this to be the most complex and challenging inaugural in history .
" The mass of attendees expected will challenge fire , law enforcement , emergency medical and mass transit capabilities , " the governors and mayor wrote .
" Moreover , the high volume of buses / traffic , weather factor and other threats will create additional demands . "
With reporting from ABC News ' Nick Tucker .
" I can't for a moment speculate what 's going on but it certainly does n't seem to be running as a project on time and they 're certainly not communicating with the people that they need to - that is , the ISPs that have offered to test this thing , " said White .
Senator Conroy - despite his promises before Labor was elected that people would be able to opt out of any internet filters - has said the first tier of the Government 's censorship policy will be compulsory for all .
This would block all " illegal " and " inappropriate " material , as determined in part by a secret blacklist administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority .
A second tier would filter out content deemed harmful for children , such as pornography , but this would be optional for internet users .
Australia 's largest ISP , Telstra , and Internode have said they will not take part in the trials .
The second - largest ISP , Optus , will run a scaled - back trial of just the first tier , while iiNet , the third - biggest provider , has also said it will only trial the first tier , simply to show the Government that its scheme will not work .
The Government said this week it had received 16 applications from ISPs looking to take part in the trials and more details would be available within days but the lack of participation from the major ISPs indicates that the trial participants will be small players with few users .
This may mean the trials will not provide much useful data as to the effects of internet filtering in the real - world .
Cooperation from the large ISPs has been so poor that makers of internet filtering hardware - mindful of the revenue they could generate if the internet censorship plan goes ahead - are petitioning small ISPs , offering to provide them with all the equipment they need to take part in the trials .
" I know that some vendors have been approaching ISPs and saying we 're happy to support your participation in the trial and then on that basis they put in an application , " said Peter Coroneos , CEO of the Internet Industry Association .
Greens Senator Scott Ludlam , who has long campaigned against the censorship plan , said the delays in starting the trials indicated the Government may have hit the wall of technical impossibility that the industry had been warning it about for 12 months .
" Considering the intention was to launch a live trial before Christmas , we 've got a six week delay and no commitment to testing on actual people , " he said .
" This is n't a great advertisement for the workability of any large scale scheme .
The proposal has always been unpopular , now perhaps the Government is starting to come to grips with what the industry has been saying all along : if your policy objective is to protect children online , this is not the way to go about it . "
Ludlam posed a series of questions to the Government about the web censorship scheme late last year and responses were received this month .
Asked to provide evidence to support the claimed public demand for filtered internet connections , the Government said the plan was an election commitment .
" I do n't think it 's good enough to refer back to an election promise that no one even knew existed ... they certainly did n't campaign on it , " Senator Ludlam said .
" You get a sense of the degree of public demand by the fact that the voluntary opt - in [ NetAlert ] scheme [ that was started by the Howard government and provided free software filters ] was so barely subscribed that they closed it down . "
The Government also admitted that any internet filters it would introduce could be bypassed using easily available technological tools .
And despite Senator Conroy claiming that most of the content on the ACMA blacklist was child pornography , the Government revealed that only 674 sites out of the 1370 sites currently listed related to depictions of a child under 18 .
506 sites would be classified R18 + and X18 + , which is legal to view in Australia but would be blocked for everyone under Labor 's mandatory censorship scheme .
The policy has attracted opposition from online consumers , lobby groups , ISPs , network administrators , some children 's welfare groups , the Opposition , the Greens , NSW Young Labor and even the conservative Liberal senator Cory Bernardi , who famously tried to censor the chef Gordon Ramsay 's swearing on television .
A recent survey by Netspace of 10,000 of the ISP 's customers found 61 per cent strongly opposed mandatory internet filtering with only 6.3 per cent strongly agreeing with the policy .
An expert report , handed to the Government last February but kept secret until December after it was uncovered by the Herald , concluded the proposed scheme was fundamentally flawed .
It says the filters would slow the internet - as much as 87 per cent by some measures - be easily bypassed and would not come close to capturing all of the nasty content available online .
They would also struggle to distinguish between wanted and unwanted content , leading to legitimate sites being blocked .
Entire user - generated content sites , such as YouTube and Wikipedia , could be censored over a single suspect posting .
" It 's definitely not going to be workable to get a very significant reduction in access to this [ unwanted ] content that is available out there - it's fundamentally just not viable , " said one of the report 's authors , University of Sydney associate professor Bjorn Landfeldt .
The 111th Congress is being sworn in today and what ’s first on their
list ?
In a moment of divine goodness , the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
looks to be the first piece of legislation to address .
As we near the end of the world as we know it and swear in President Elect Obama , there is near certainty that should it come across his desk , he will sign it .
The Lily Ledbetter
Fair Pay
Act has been living on the edge of passage since 2007 , in the 110th Congress ,
when it was blocked by Republicans and died in the Senate .
President
Bush was clear that had it passed , he would have vetoed it anyway .
After all , it was his two friendly Supreme Court Justice appointees who registered their opposition to allowing victims of wage
discrimination to advocate for themselves in court without time limits .
In other words , they decided that regardless
of whether or not someone actually has been discriminated against , the
Constitution deems there to be a time limit on actually doing anything about said discrimination .
In a 5 - 4 ruling , the case , Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , decided for all victims of wage discrimination ( the majority of whom are women ) that the discriminators have only to delay any kind of litigous action in order to avoid taking any responsibility for their actions .
I do n’t have to tell any of our readers how critical ensuring wage justice is for women , and by extension , women ’s health .
Women in the United States are poorer than men , in general .
Women , depending on the color of their skin , and / or their ethnicity , are paid less , per dollar , than men for the same positions .
Without legal recourse – without the freedom to seek justice – women who are discriminated against ( millions of women ) by being paid less than their male counterparts are not able to correct the issue .
If women continue to be paid less and remain living in lower income levels than men , women are also not able to obtain the critical health care they need to maintain control over and autonomy in their lives .
Prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections , family planning , reproductive health services like Pap smears and breast exams : these all cost money – especially for women who fall between the cracks .
These are women who make too much to be covered by Medicaid but either do n’t have private insurance or whose insurance does n’t cover enough to make health care affordable .
Want to help women be able to seek justice and summit one more mountain in the journey towards equality ?

As much as anything else , my travels have always been about finding new music .
Not that I ’m hunting for it ( although on occasion I ’ve made field recordings ) but more just being out there with my ears open .
I ’m always ready for the right factors to materialize , say a Saturday night in Cidreira , Brazil when an 18 - wheeler converted into a stage with a full Samba band unexpectedly rolls into the town square .
Or a quiet afternoon in El Salvador where your host family ’s dad breaks out the rum and the guitara .
In the right moments it almost seems as if the music has come looking for you .
Hearing something for the first time .
But oftentimes you keep hearing the same music for a long time without really absorbing it .
When I first arrived in Latin America ( San Jose , C.R. 1999 ) , everything the bus drivers played — salsa , merengue , bachata — sounded like wheels turning on a broken axle .
It took getting out of the city and up to the cloudforest , and an aguardiente - maddened night where a local dj was dropping merengue on the crowd .
I do n’t know what it was exactly , but suddenly I could feel the clave .
The rhythm .
It went with the terrain , the howler monkeys and hummingbirds .
The way people chopped wood with machetes .
Music which defines a moment .
Beyond the music rooted to the places you travel , there is also the music that seems to travel itself , migrating from one area to the next — making its way into hostels and dj stacks , becoming part of local culture abroad , and also returning home with you .
Here are some of those artists and groups producing music which , for the last 10 years , has helped define what world travel sounds like .

1. Manu Chao
1999 .
Montanitas , Ecuador .
Manu Chao ’s Clandestino was playing from every hut .
It was said he ’d been through there earlier with an entire carnival - tribe .
Those of us who ’d been traveling for months or years or lifetimes knew immediately : only someone who has spent the better part of his life living with and loving local people could write music like this .
It ’s taken a while for him to catch on in the US , but for the last three years he ’s been hitting key spots on US tours , and headlined Lollapalooza last summer .
2. Sublime
Sublime , especially the album 40 oz to freedom , was pushed up and down the pacific coast throughout the late 90s and early 2000s by surfers , and picked up by local groms wherever they lived .
I remember hanging out in baja and hearing the kids asking to put on Sub — lee —may .
What kind of music would Bradley Nowell be creating right now were he still alive ?
What a loss .
3. Balkan Beat Box
In their own words , BBB is “ a natural reaction of musicians who wanted to erase political boundaries . ”
Balkan Beat Box ’s two Israeli - born and Brooklyn - based founders , Tamir Muskat and Ori Kaplan , routinely collaborate with Palestinians ( at one point having Israeli and Palestinian rappers side by side on stage in Jerusalem ) , Syrians , Bulgarians , and Moroccans , among others , in a constantly evolving group of musicians and artists around the world .
Last year , Matador interviewed Ori Kaplan just after a break from tour in Tel Aviv .
4. Bajofondo Tango Club
One night after going out in Buenos Aires , I waited at the Correo Central for the 22 to take me back to Quilmes .
That ’s before I learned the bus does n’t pull into the Correo at night .
It got super late and I was completely alone but I kept listening to Bajofondo , this drum and bass remix of an old tango .
It felt like the city was all mine .
Bajofondo is made up of veteran musicians and producers from Argentina and Uruguay who mash up tango , candombe , and other South American rhythms with breaks , drum and bass , and hip hop .
Member Gustavo A. Santaolalla has also produced soundtracks for Amores Perros and 21 Grams , and later received a 2006 Academy Award for Achievement in music written for motion pictures ( original score ) for Brokeback Mountain , then a second Academy Award in 2007 for the film score to Babel .
5. Daft Punk
Photo by Caesar Sebastian
Daft Punk built on early Detroit techno , perfecting a brighter , funkier sound that ’s remained in clubs no matter where you ’ve gone over the last decade .
Anytime I hear “ Around the World ” I get flashbacks of discoballs in San Jose clubs at the end of the millennium .
6. Buena Vista Social Club
Buena Vista ’s story is one of the greatest in modern music .
American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder went to Cuba and reunited musicians who had performed at the club 50 years earlier — some of whom had n’t touched an instrument or performed in decades .
Their recordings and performances were international successes throughout the late 90s .
7. Bebel Gilberto
Bebel is the daughter of bossa nova legend João Gilberto .
Bebel ’s music is a fresh and smooth and has spread from Rio and New York ( where she lives ) worldwide .
8. Amon Tobin
Another Brazilian , Amon Tobin is a key innovator and producer of electronic music , and one of the all - stars on the Ninja Tune label .
He has collaborated with various artists and influenced countless djs and producers worldwide .
9. Kevin Johansen
Kevin Johansen is half Argentinean , half American , and plays a mix of rock , cumbia , reggae , tango , and other rhythms .
He keeps getting better known each year .
10 . Marley Family
Damian , Stephan , Julian , Ziggy , Rita — no other family has so many projects and tours going in so many places around the world .
From Ziggy ’s new album Love is My Religion to Damian and Stephan ’s recent albums which have taken dance hall emceeing to new levels of social consciousness , this entire clan just keeps bringing more fire .
These are my top picks for the heavyweight musicians shaping travel culture over the last decade .
There are many more to be sure .
What ’s yours ?
The Great Detroit Bailout of 2008 is nearing status as a done deal .
Reuters covers the possible outcomes quite well .
Coyote Blog and CFR have good reasons the bailout should n’t happen in the first place .
I ’m not going to focus on the many reasons giving a drowned man a lifesaver is pointless , because there ’s something much more interesting afoot :
The Car Czar ( from Reuters ) :
In addition to providing loans , the proposal would force automakers to answer to a presidentially appointed trustee — or “ car czar ” — and make the government their biggest shareholder .
The overseer will have powers to shape a restructuring of the companies , withholding further loans if progress toward a turnaround stalled .
Supposedly , the government is eyeing former Fed chairman and Obama economic advisor Paul Volcker for the job .
It ’s a bad choice , not because Volcker is n’t qualified , but because the country needs his brainpower focused on its aggregate survival , not the dynamics of keeping the Big Three afloat .
We need someone with the balls to strong - arm Detroit into shape .
We need someone with zero tolerance for corruption .
We need someone with a keen eye for errors and cover-ups .
We need someone with imperturbable tenacity .
We need Ross Perot .
I know he ’s 78 years old , but he has the verve of a man at least 20 years his junior .
Here are 8 reasons Perot would make an ideal car czar :
1 . He is the “ Father of Fiscal Charts . ”
Have you seen perotcharts.com ?
The man could measure and graph Dick Cheney ’s disappearances , if he felt like it .
If given the position of Car Czar , he would immediately set about quantifying the big mess that is the Big Three , adding an element of transparency as well as employing armies of out - of - work analysts .
2 . He listens to customers .
Perot ’s business advice :
Spend a lot of time talking to customers face to face .
You ’d be amazed how many companies do n’t listen to their customers .
Hear that , GM ?
3 . He has experience as a czar .
In the early 1980s , Perot reformed Texas ’ drug laws and education system .
For the latter , he devised systems that held principals and teachers accountable for student performance , which he in turn standardized using tests .
That kind of systemization might not be ideal for human education , but it sure would work well in manufacturing .
4 . He exposes corruption .
During the Regan years , Perot did not hesitate to privately investigate possible cover-ups around missing POWs in Southeast Asia .
He publicly attacked the Department of Defense in the process .
Perot is n’t afraid to play government watchdog , which is precisely what we need during times when the government requires transparency of everyone but itself .
5 . He rallies for domestic jobs .
Perot opposes NAFTA and outsourcing , but supports the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , making him an ideal figurehead to rally for homegrown , green auto production .
6 . He ’s an activist .
Consider this quote :
The activist is not the man who says the river is dirty .
The activist is the man who cleans up the river .
Perot ’s notorious impatience will ensure the Big Three job gets done , fast .
His popularity will keep eyes on himself and the industry .
Heck , he may even make GMs worth buying again .
7 . He ’s a salesman .
After restructuring the Big Three with the help of his many charts , Perot will know how to sell the revamped American automobile .
He started his career as a star salesman for IBM ; since then , he has politically sold himself as a popular Reform Party candidate , despite the challenges of doing so in a strongly bipartisan system .
8 . He sat on GM ’s board 24 years ago .
At that time , he complained about the cars ’ low quality .
GM eventually bought up his shares , but Perot ’s convictions remain .
He has a bone to pick with the way GM operates .
Perhaps it ’s time to unleash him on the Big Three once again .
( Hank Paulson makes any mention of “ conflict of interest ” here moot . )
Who better to be Detroit ’s Car Czar than a ruthless , effective control freak like Perot ?
He knows how to run a business , he knows how to whistle - blow , and he has a keen eye for whipping people into shape .
If the government is serious about not giving the Big Three more than the $ 15 billion it has already promised , it ’s time to call the Perot hotline .
Barack Obama ’s nominee for Interior Secretary , Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado , says he has some unfinished business to take care of before he leaves the Senate and takes the helm at the Interior Department .
Salazar will be in the unique position of working on legislation that would give new protections to public lands and then ushering those new protections along with him to Interior .
[ social_buttons ]
Sporting his trademark cowboy hat , the denim - clad Salazar held a press conference in Denver before leaving for Washington on Sunday , saying he ’d like to pass eight bills dealing mainly with wilderness and conservation issues , as soon as possible .
One of the bills would define bans on mining , timber harvesting and new roads and constructions in Rocky Mountain National Park .
Others would establish the Sangre de Cristo National Heritage Area , South Park National Heritage Area , and the Baca National Wildlife Refuge Management .
“ I have high expectations from the strong Republican and Democratic support that , perhaps even in this week , ” the bills will pass , he said .
The bills passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and were included in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2008 .
Salazar also indicated that Senate President Harry Reid would continue with the bills should they not get finished before Salazar moves on .
Because Obama ’s selection of Salazar to head - up Interior brought mixed reactions from the environmental community , the announcements might go a little way towards easing the concerns of those who feel Salazar is too cozy with the oil , gas , and other extractive industries .
The bills supported by Sen. Ken Salazar in his waning days include ( from the Denver Post ) :
• The Arkansas Valley Conduit Authorization
Act establishes a 35 percent federal cost share for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit , a proposed 130 - mile water delivery system from Pueblo Dam .
• The Dominguez - Escalante National Conservation Area
Act designates 210,000 acres of federally owned land on the Uncompahgre Plateau as the Dominguez - Escalante National Conservation Area .
• The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Area
Act designates 249,339 acres in the park as wilderness .
• The Sangre de Cristo National Heritage Area Act includes Conejos , Costilla and Alamosa counties .
• The South Park National Heritage Area
Act includes 19 ranches and 17,000 acres of wetlands and agricultural lands in the headwaters of the South Platte River .
• The Jackson Gulch Rehabilitation
Act authorizes federal funding to rehabilitate the Jackson Gulch irrigation canal near Mancos .
• The Northern Front Range Backdrop Study
Act identifies ways to protect natural resources and open spaces near the Arapahoe - Roosevelt National Forest .
• The Baca National Wildlife Refuge Management
Act defines the purpose of the refuge as one “ to restore , enhance , and maintain wetland , upland , riparian , and other habitats for native wildlife , plant , and fish species in the San Luis Valley . ”
• The Upper Colorado River Basin Fund
Act provides funding to continue endangered fish recovery implementation programs .

Snow and sleet are forecast to fall across swathes of Britain on Sunday and Monday .
TORONTO , Jan 15 ( Reuters ) - A California company plans to build a network of stations to recharge or swap electric car batteries in Ontario , a move that could expand the market for electric cars in Canada ’s most populous province .
Closely held Better Place plans to build an electric recharging grid that will sell power to motorists under a subscription service , similar to the model that cellphone companies use to sell airtime .
Consumers would have the option of exchanging their depleted batteries at the company ’s stations or recharging them at homes , businesses or parking lots equipped with the company ’s “ power spots . ”
It would take drivers less time to pull into an exchange station and swap a depleted battery for a fresh one than it would take to fill a tank with gasoline , the company said on Thursday .
Better Place would need about three years to build the network , and the company plans to open a demonstration center in Toronto in about a year to educate the public and let them test - drive electric vehicles .
Better Place has partnered with Renault RENA .
PA and Nissan 7201.T to develop electric car infrastructure .
“ This is an exciting step towards building a network in Ontario , ” Better Place Chief Executive Shai Agassi said in an interview .
“ It ’s a road that we started with a lot of prodding from the ( Ontario ) government . ”
Ontario , home of a sprawling parts industry and several auto - assembly plants , has been hard hit by the crisis in the sector .
Premier Dalton McGuinty said the province will issue a study in May that looks at ways to encourage adoption of electric vehicles , including financial incentives for consumers and government purchasing policy .
Agassi said the project , which he called “ the project of our generation , ” was an easy sell , despite the tough economic conditions .
“ If you have a template for a massive infrastructure project that can save governments future energy bills , is conducive to the creation of local jobs , reduces their carbon emissions and introduces new jobs for industries like cars , you are in high demand , ” he said .
Governments around the world have been earmarking spending towards infrastructure projects to create work and lessen the impact of the global recession .
The economic downturn has also put a huge dent in the price of oil .
U.S. crude oil CLc1 has fallen to around $ 35 a barrel from its high of over $ 147 a barrel in July .
Agassi said he is confident that when the economy picks up , oil prices will rebound sharply and consumers will more easily see the cost benefits of driving an electric vehicle .
At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week , Ford Motor Co F.N and Magna InternationalMGa .
TO announced a partnership to build an electric car that is expected to be market ready by around 2011 .
Most auto manufacturers had at least one electric vehicle at the Detroit show .
The auto industry has seen demand plummet due to the weak economy and the Detroit automakers -- Ford , General Motors Corp GM.N and Chrysler [ CBS.UL ] -- have been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy .
A collapse of the troubled Detroit Three would put nearly 600,000 Canadians out of work within five years , most of them in Ontario , according to a recent report by a provincial advisory panel .
Canada said in late December that it would provide C$ 4 billion ( $ 3.2 billion ) in emergency loans to the Canadian branches of the Detroit Three to keep them operating while they restructured .
The funding pledge followed a $ 17.4 billion U.S. package for the Detroit auto industry .
Toronto - based Bullfrog Power , a green electricity retailer in Ontario and Alberta , will power the network while Macquarie Group will act as financial adviser to develop a rollout plan .
Better Place , launched in 2007 with $ 200 million of venture funding , is planning similar networks in Israel , Denmark , Australia , California and Hawaii , with activations starting in 2010 .

Using a harmless virus to insert a corrective gene into mouse blood cells , scientists at St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital have alleviated sickle cell disease pathology .
In their studies , the researchers found that the treated mice showed essentially no difference from normal mice .
Although the scientists caution that applying the gene therapy to humans presents significant technical obstacles , they believe that the new therapy will become an important treatment for the disease .
Sickle cell disease , which affects millions of people worldwide , arises because of a tiny genetic defect in the gene for beta - globin , a protein component of hemoglobin .
This defect causes hemoglobin - containing red blood cells to tend to deform , clump and break apart .
The resulting clogged blood vessels can lead to cognitive dysfunction by causing small strokes in the brain and cause damage to kidneys , liver , spleen and lungs .
The only permanent cure for the disease is a bone marrow transplant to give recipients blood - forming cells that will form normal beta -globin .
However , such transplants are rare because of the lack of compatible donors .
Researchers have long known that symptoms of the disease could be alleviated by persistence in the blood of an immature fetal form of hemoglobin in red blood cells .
This immature hemoglobin , which usually disappears after birth , does not contain beta - globin , but another form called gamma - globin .
St. Jude researchers had found that treating patients with the drug hydroxyurea encourages the formation of fetal hemoglobin and alleviates disease symptoms .
" While this is a very useful treatment for the disease , our studies indicated that it might be possible to cure the disorder if we could use gene transfer to permanently increase fetal hemoglobin levels , " said Derek Persons , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant member in the St. Jude Department of Hematology .
He and his colleagues developed a technique to insert the gene for gamma - globin into blood - forming cells using a harmless viral carrier .
The researchers extracted the blood - forming cells , performed the viral gene insertion in a culture dish and then re-introduced the altered blood - forming cells into the body .
The hope was that those cells would permanently generate red blood cells containing fetal hemoglobin , alleviating the disease .
In the experiments , reported in the advanced , online issue of the journal Molecular Therapy , the researchers used a strain of mouse with basically the same genetic defect and symptoms as humans with sickle cell disease .
The scientists introduced the gene for gamma - globin into the mice 's blood - forming cells and then introduced those altered cells into the mice .

The investigators found that months after they introduced the altered blood - forming cells , the mice continued to produce gamma - globin in their red blood cells .
" When we examined the treated mice , we could detect little , if any , disease using our methods , " said Persons , the paper 's senior author .
" The mice showed no anemia , and their organ function was essentially normal . "
The researchers also transplanted the altered blood - forming cells from the original treated mice into a second generation of sickle cell mice to show that the gamma - globin gene had incorporated itself permanently into the blood - forming cells .
Five months after that transplantation , the second generation of mice also showed production of fetal hemoglobin and correction of their disease .
" We are very encouraged by our results , " Persons said .
" They demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to correct sickle cell disease with genetic therapy to produce fetal hemoglobin .
We think that increased fetal hemoglobin expression in patients will be well tolerated and the immune system would not reject the hemoglobin , in comparison to other approaches . "
While Persons believes that the mouse experiments will lead to treatments in humans , he cautioned that technical barriers still need to be overcome .
" It is far easier to achieve high levels of gene insertion into mouse cells than into human cells , " he said .
" In our mouse experiments , we routinely saw one or two copies of the gamma - globin gene inserted into each cell .
However , in humans this insertion rate is at least a hundred - fold less . "
Persons ' laboratory is currently working with other animal and human cells to develop methods to achieve a high enough gene insertion rate to make the gene therapy clinically useful .
Other authors of this paper include Tamara Pestina , Phillip Hargrove , Dennis Jay , John Gray and Kelli Boyd ( all of St. Jude ) .

Sarah Palin at the Republican National Convention ( WDCpix )
ANCHORAGE , Alaska — Since Gov. Sarah Palin became the Republican vice presidential candidate , she ’s been shaped to fit a new image .
From debate boot camp at Sen. John McCain ’s Arizona ranch to a high - end makeover costing $ 150,000 , the Palin on the national campaign trail is not the politician that voters here remember .
The governor of Alaska seems transformed after a team of seasoned advisers helped craft a new political persona for her .
Standing on stage in red designer heels , her tone has sharpened and her partisan rhetoric has heightened .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
In Alaska , Palin supporters and critics alike have said the woman they see stumping in swing states and being interviewed on national TV is not the hockey mom-turned politician they once knew .
In talking with voters around Alaska , from Anchorage shopkeepers to government employees , as well as lawmakers and political insiders over the last three weeks , it ’s clear that Palin has been re-branded , both in message and style , for the national arena .
Critics and supporters agree that they see a change .
Recent news coverage of Palin demonstrates that she did n’t reinvent herself , but that members of the McCain campaign shaped her .
Palin was heavily coached in preparation for the vice presidential debate with Sen. Joe Biden .
She was kept from the press for weeks before granting any interviews .
Her first appearance with Katie Couric was marked by a series of canned , though often jumbled , talking points .
Even her new sleek , pulled - together look was taken care of by McCain adviser Jeff Larson .
Larson is also in charge of the campaign ’s robocalls .
Over the next two weeks , it appears that Palin will be surrounded by more , not fewer , McCain staffers , according to an email from a campaign spokeswoman Caroline Gransee .
Gransee noted that the Alaska governor ’s campaign plane may start accommodating fewer members of the press to make room for more staff .
This thick insulation of strategists around Palin is something new for her .
Palin rose to power in Alaska with support from a small paid staff and an army of volunteers , but without the help of a robust strategy team .
She relied on her own judgment and that of her closest adviser : Todd Palin .
Interviews with people close to the governor , political observers and long - time Alaska politicos found that Palin was never surrounded by an entourage of advisers and strategists .
Instead , Palin relied on her own instincts and leaned on her husband for an outside perspective .
A former top political aide to Palin , who requested anonymity , said in an interview that the governor has an innate political sense and turns to her husband for advice .
The adviser now works in the private sector , but says he is still a friend of the Palins .
“ The two Alaskans that advise Sarah Palin are Sarah and Todd Palin , ” the aide said in an conversation .
“ Her husband is her No. 1 adviser . ”
The former aide also said that this is not so uncommon for politicians new to the political arena in Alaska , noting the absence of long - time political families or major think tanks .
Others involved in Alaska politics disagree .
Longtime GOP strategist Art Hackney has served as an adviser to both Sen . Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young , the state ’s lone House member .
Stevens is on trial on charges of failing to disclose gifts worth $ 250,000 from the oil services firm , Veco Corp .
The jury is currently deliberating .
Young is under federal investigation for his ties to the same company , though he has not been charged with a crime .
Hackney , a Republican , is not a Palin supporter as either a state or national candidate .
“ Most of us [ in Alaska politics ] just scratch our heads as to who she gets her advice from , ” Hackney said .
“ With Palin , it ’s Todd Palin and some of her friends … that none of the rest of us would know . ”
Palin hired several of her old friends from Wasilla to join her administration .
She put one family friend , Debbie Richter , who attended college for one year , in charge of the state ’s $ 40 - billion oil and gas dividend fund program .
A lawyer from the Wasilla area , Talis J. Colberg , serves as her attorney general .
One former aide , John Bitney , went to high school with Palin .
He was fired abruptly after he began dating Richter , who had recently divorced her husband , a longtime friend of Todd Palin’s .
Bitney now serves as chief of staff to the state Senate president .
In an email message , Bitney said he is not familiar with who Palin keeps in contact with from the campaign trail .
Palin ran as an insurgent candidate in 2006 , just as the state was enveloped by a wide - ranging political scandal involving a federal probe into the dealings between lawmakers and the oil services firm , Veco Corp .
A few weeks before the election , the FBI raided 12 legislative offices , including that of Stevens ’ son , Ben Stevens , the president of the Alaska Senate at the time .
It ’s not surprising that Palin would decide not to align herself with old - guard political advisers , though Hackney said she did approach him once about the possibility of working together .
He said he turned her down because he did not believe she had enough experience to serve as governor of Alaska .
“ Normally someone who rises to this kind of political career would have people around them with expertise who can advise them , ” he said .
“ There is n’t such a defined group around her .
Basically , the Palins shoot from the hip . ”
Todd Palin ’s role in the governor ’s administration has become increasingly apparent .
According to a report released after an investigation into whether Sarah Palin abused her power in pressuring her commissioner of public safety to fire her former brother - in - law , Todd was present during official meetings , made requests of members of Palin ’s administration and was copied on emails about state business .
“ I have heard criticism that I am too involved with my wife ’s administration , ” Palin wrote in a statement he submitted as part of the investigation .
“ My wife and I are very close .
We are each other ’s best friend .
I have helped her at every stage in her career the best I can , and she has helped me . ”
Todd Palin is the only Alaskan traveling with Palin as part of her national campaign .
So in this stage of her career , it looks like he is still in his role as chief adviser .
Questions about the archives ’ capacity have added a new element to the uneasiness felt by open - government advocates and historians , who already fear that departing White House officials , particularly Vice President Dick Cheney , may not turn over everything .
Mr. Cheney asserted this month in a court case that he had absolute discretion to decide which of his records are official and which are personal , and thus do not have to be transferred to the archives ,
The National Archives has already begun trucking boxes of paper records from the White House to a warehouse it is leasing in Lewisville , Tex. , not a great distance from where Mr. Bush ’s presidential library is to be built , at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
The archives invoked its emergency plan to deal with problems in transferring two types of electronic files : a huge collection of digital photographs and the “ records management system , ” which provides an index to most of the textual records generated by Mr. Bush and his staff members in the last eight years .
Archivists said it could be weeks or months before these files could be indexed and searched .
In their plan , archives officials wrote , the transition poses “ unique challenges ” because of the huge volume of electronic records , some of them in “ formats not previously dealt with . ”
Even though archivists have been working with the White House to survey the documents , “ there is always a possibility that some electronic records may be overlooked , ” the officials wrote .
If the electronic records of the Bush White House total 100 terabytes of information , as archives officials estimate , that would be about 50 times the volume of electronic records left behind by the Clinton White House in 2001 and some five times the contents of all 20 million catalogued books in the Library of Congress .

OTTAWA–Liberal MP Michael Ignatieff , a candidate to replace Stéphane Dion , says the party may decide to select a new leader much sooner than the scheduled May convention .
" I have been informed that discussions are ongoing , " he told the Toronto Star when asked about expectations that Dion , the caretaker leader , might step down imminently .
The possibility of moving up the leadership contest was raised in Thursday 's closed - door caucus meeting but went unresolved , a source said .
Dion , 53 , is under mounting pressure to step down shortly to strengthen his party in its continuing showdown with Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservatives .
Later , in an interview with CBC - TV , Ignatieff said Liberals are concerned the party finds itself in the middle of a leadership contest at a time of political crisis .
" What the party is discussing is whether there are ways in which the leadership race can be accelerated in such a way that we can present clear alternatives to the country , because Mr. Dion ... has already announced his resignation , " Ignatieff said .
But he added that he is not involved in these discussions .
Also running for the leadership are MPs Bob Rae and Dominic LeBlanc .
A Liberal spokesperson said that so far party officials have not taken any steps to move up the leadership convention .
`` The convention has been called for May 2 and nothing has changed , '' said Daniel Lauzon .
However , officials said the party executive and the caucus are empowered to appoint an interim leader in the event that Dion steps down .
Yesterday , Dion was reportedly hunkered down with his inner circle pondering his options , but some Liberals expect him to announce his departure soon , possibly at a caucus meeting next Wednesday .
" There 's a good possibility that he will step down early , " said one Dion associate .
Liberals ' already weak confidence in Dion evaporated this week when his amateurish videotaped statement on national television was a subject of widespread ridicule .
In Thursday 's Liberal caucus , MPs ' impatience with Dion 's bumbled performance in the high - stakes political clash with Harper was heard loud and clear .
Yesterday , MP Scott Brison said the party needs to pick a new leader in time to be ready to head to the polls early next year if the Liberal - New Democrat coalition decides , with the support of the Bloc Québécois , to defeat the Conservative minority over its upcoming budget .
" I believe it 's very important for the party to be election - ready for the end of January or early February , " Brison said .
" We need a leader in place for that election . "
Dion 's office had no comment on his immediate future .
But the Liberal leader is scheduled to be in Toronto today to attend a rally in favour of the Liberal - NDP coalition at noon at Nathan Phillips Square .
The coalition has been the subject of fierce national debate since it was cobbled together in response to the lack of a major economic stimulus package in the Conservatives ' Nov. 27 policy statement .
The Liberals and NDP planned to defeat Harper 's government this Monday in a parliamentary vote of confidence but were thwarted when Governor General Michaëlle Jean agreed to the Prime Minister 's request to suspend the House of Commons until Jan. 26 .
Besides Dion 's survival as interim leader , the now - delayed standoff between the coalition and the Conservatives has left the Liberals facing a host of complex , intertwined strategic questions .
Chief among them is how the current leadership race will affect the party 's readiness to stick with the Liberal - NDP coalition and the commitment to defeat the Harper minority after its Jan. 27 budget .
Rallying the party to be ready to force an election , Rae has adopted a position that appeals strongly to the many Liberals who believe Harper will never reach out as promised to the opposition parties to help create a pro-growth budget .
" We need to keep going , we need to keep moving , and we need to keep going forward " to sell the idea of the Liberal - NDP coalition , said Rae , who was in Toronto yesterday discussing the accord .
" We need to talk very directly to Canadians about our economic program , what we want to do for the future , how we want to do it and how we think an alternative government to Mr. Harper 's is necessary , " he said .
Rae , 60 , dismissed the suggestion that it might be difficult to sell the coalition to Canadians while he is also running to replace the man who leads it .

" There 's very strong support in our caucus for the approach that 's set out in the ( coalition ) document , " he said .
This aggressive stance has given Rae , who is thought to be trailing Ignatieff in the early stages of the leadership contest , a tactical advantage – at least for the moment – as he mounts a national speaking campaign .
Ignatieff , 61 , has taken a position more in line with many MPs who appreciate the pressure the coalition has brought against Harper but are taking a wait - and - see attitude toward defeating the Conservatives next month .
That decision ultimately depends on whether Harper presents a budget with significant measures to help Canadians cope with the economic slump , these Liberals say .
But behind much of this thinking is also an awareness of Harper 's success this week in generating a massive popular backlash against the coalition and its sovereignist supporters among the Bloc Québécois .
Those second thoughts , however , do not mean the Liberals are ready to shelve the coalition yet .
" The party is united in using the coalition in this way to make sure Canadians get a budget that meets the needs of the economy , " Ignatieff said in a telephone interview from New Brunswick , where he was meeting with Liberals as part of his leadership campaign .
" Harper 's only chance of slipping out of his predicament is to divide the Liberal party .
He will not succeed . "
LeBlanc , the leadership candidate from New Brunswick , had planned to officially launch his bid in Moncton yesterday , but when the parliamentary crisis arose his campaign decided it would be more appropriate to wait a week or two .
A LeBlanc campaign strategist said the candidate is , for the moment , keeping clear of the debate that is portraying Ignatieff as trying to keep his distance from the coalition , while Rae travels the country to champion its cause .
" I think ( LeBlanc is ) going to hold his cards close to his chest , " the strategist said yesterday .
Liberals are seized with the question of how to put a new leader in place quickly , said one insider .
" The conventional wisdom for a lot of folks is that we 're not going anywhere with Mr. Dion .
We certainly wo n't win the next election with him – I think the Canadian electorate has showed that .
So , if there 's a graceful way for him to leave before May , the pressure may be on to do that . "
If Dion does step down , the party will face crucial decisions about selecting a replacement .
There is some talk about moving quickly to install Ignatieff – who has extensive support among the caucus and the party executive – as the new leader .
But it 's doubtful Rae would accept any attempt to shorten the contest , opening the possibility of a dangerous split within a party trying desperately to patch over years of bitter infighting .
Another option would be the appointment of a different interim leader than Dion .
Among those whose names are often suggested are MPs John McCallum , Ken Dryden and Ralph Goodale .

The strange case of The Pigeon - hole Principle
If you come to think about it , The Pigeon - hole Principle presents a case that is curious in more than one respect .
It has a remarkably high status : it has a special name , under which it is well - known ; Ross Honsberger even calls it " A fundamental tool of combinatorics " .
It is surrounded by some mystique .
Proofs using it are often regarded as something special , something particularly ingenious .
This feeling of awe is , for instance , nicely reflected by Honsberger when he concludes one of his examples with " ( Another triumph of the pigeonhole principle . ) " .
Its usual formulation is — as we shall see in a moment — unfortunate .
Let me quote Honsberger once more — there is nothing special about me quoting Honsberger all the time : one of his books just happens to lie on my desk — :
" if more than n objects are distributed into a set of n compartments , some compartment must receive [ for " must receive " read " receives " , EWD ] more than one of the objects . "
n
n
( Instead of " more than " one often encounters the more specific " + 1 " . )
My feeling is that these three observations are not unrelated .
* * *
To begin with , let me formulate the Purified Pigeon - hole Principle ( PPP ) :
" For a non-empty , finite bag of numbers , the maximum value is at least the average value . "
It is a generalization , because in the old formulation , it would be ( OFPP )
" If more than n · k objects are distributed into a set of n compartments , some compartment receives more than k of the objects . "
I think it is illuminating to analyze the differences between those two formulations ( in what I consider increasing order of seriousness ) :
PPP does not mention n and k explicitly ; this eases the application , because the conscientious application of OFPP would require explicit instantiations of n and k .
does not mention and explicitly ; this eases the application , because the conscientious application of would require explicit instantiations of and .
OFPP is very operational ; it would have been less so , had " are distributed " and " receives " had been replaced by " have been distributed " and " contains " respectively .
The metaphor drags a process into the picture , where only the final state matters .
( This is really serious , for what if " the objects are already in the compartments " ?
Well , of course we could have put them there , but then some people feel obliged to argue that we could have done so in " arbitrary " order : irrelevantia in the formulation of a theorem have the awkward consequence that the conscientious user of the theorem has to demonstrate their irrelevance . )

OFPP mentions " objects " and " compartments " , things that have nothing to do with the theorem .
I know that some people believe that the introduction of such things " ease the visualisation " , but I think the price too heavy to pay .
When dealing with natural numbers , we should be able to deal with them in their own right and not be forced to introduce " objects " counted by them !
( It is really like representing natural numbers in a unary number system , with the well - known difficulty of " the invisible zero " . )
Also , one may have to invent " compartments " that do n't " look " like compartments at all .
The " mystique " of the Pigeon - hole Principle is partly due the sometimes surprising invention of " objects " and the " compartments " .
* * *
Let me now relate to you two stories about the Pigeon - hole Principle that both amazed me ; for me — but perhaps I am sensitive to the point of allergy — they suggest that the traditional Pigeon - hole Principle is a focal point of how mathematics is ( but not should be ) taught .
A few weeks ago I was told " The Problem of the Soccer Toto " .
( Not knowing the rules of the soccer toto , I got the explanation ; for your benefit I shall repeat them . )
On a given Sunday , 13 soccer matches will be played .
Each match has one of three possible outcomes , denoted by " 1 " , " 2 " and " X " respectively .
Hence there are 313 possible Sundays .
For our purpose " Sunday " will be one of those 313 possible " columns " of height 13 , with in each line one of the three permissible entries 1 , 2 or X .
A toto form consists of a row of blanc columns of height 13 ; its user is free in his choice of the number of columns he is going to fill in .
The question is to devise a strategy for filling in the minimal number of columns so that at least 1 column coincides with Sunday in at least 5 entries .
Here we go .
Forget about the 5 : what if at least 1 column should coincide with Sunday in at least 1 entry ?
Two columns wo n't do , for Sunday then could contain for each line an outcome missing in the corresponding line of the toto form .
With 3 columns such that at least one row contains all three outcomes , at least one coincidence — in that row — is guaranteed .
So far we needed 3 columns and have used only one row .
Can we use the remaining 12 rows to increase the score ?
By filling those each with some permutation of the three outcomes , we force in each row precisely one coincidence with Sunday .
Make in each column the count of coincidences : their sum being 13 , their average is 4 ⅓ .
and their maximum ( PPP ) is ≥ 5 .
End of argument ( heuristics included ) .
Notice that there was no need at all to interpret the form as a table defining how , indeed , each object ( =match ) was placed in one compartment ( =column ) .
But suppose that the question had been different : given a form in which 4 columns have been filled in such that each row contains each of the three possible outcomes , can you show that at least 1 column coincides in at least 4 entries with Sunday ?
Now the total number of coincidences is ≥ 13 , the average count is ≥3 ¼ , and hence the maximum count is ≥ 4 .
Please notice that in this case the metaphor of putting objects ( =matches ) into compartments ( =columns ) creates problems : an object may " occupy " two compartments !
( It is utterly predictable how the average mathematician will save his face : " Sure !
If generalize the problem , I do n't take the matches but the coincidences as my objects !
I would have done so right at the start , would I have known that you would generalize the problem ! " )
So much for the avoidable obligation of identifying the " objects " .
But now the sad part of the story .
The colleague that posed me this problem had been challenged with it by one of his graduate students .
When we met again he was utterly amazed to hear that the problem could be solved without pen and paper , and when I told him my solution , he looked so puzzled that I am not sure he understood it .
" Of course I know the Pigeon - hole Principle , but I never ..... " , and then wandering thoughts prevented him from completing the sentence .
Was he still looking for the objects and the compartments ?
The way he had been introduced to the principle and all the imaginations that went with it was obviously a barrier to its straight - forward application .
I felt that I had had a glimpse of something frightening .
The second story concerns my preparation of a lecture on the Pigeon - hole Principle : I wanted to show my students the most spectacular application of it I had ever encountered .
I scratched my memory , and then I remembered : the lower bound for the length of the longest monotonic subsequence !
I remembered my thrill , but had forgotten the argument , which I then set out to construct .
Let me state the problem first .
We consider a sequence of numbers a .
i with 0 ≤ i < N .
We get a subsequence of length n by removing some N - n elements from the sequence and retaining the remaining ones in their original order .
It is called " an upsequence " provided for any a .
i and a .
j in the subsequence we have
i < j ⇒ a .
i ≤ a . j ;
i < j ⇒ a .
i ≥ a . j ;
in the case that we haveit is called " a downsequence " .
Let U be the length of a longest upsequence contained in the given sequence , and let D be the length of a longest downsequence contained in it .
Prove that N ≤ U · D holds .
The argument I came up with went as follows .
Let us construct U · D different labels ; if we can now devise a regime that assigns to each element a distinct label , then N — being the number of labels used — is at most U · D — being the number of labels available .
How do we construct U · D different labels ?
The simplest way I can think of is all the integer pairs ( u , d ) , with 1 ≤ u ≤ U and 1 ≤ d ≤ D .
How do we devise a regime that assigns for i < j different labels to a .
i and a . j ?
In order to relate the regime to up - and downsequences , we observe
i < j ⇒ a .
i ≤ a . j ∨ a .
i ≥ a . j
a
j
a
i
a
i
u
d
u
d
a
i
that distinct elements get distinct labels that each label ( u , d ) needed satisfies 1 ≤ u ≤ U and 1 ≤ d ≤ D .
i.e. can be used to extend either an upsequence or a downsequence ending at .
This observation reveals the regime : assign tothe pair ( ) with ( and ) the maximum length of an upsequence ( and a downsequence respectively ) that ends at .
This guarantees
I was quite pleased with the reconstruction of this argument , until I realized that what used to be " a triumph of the Pigeon - hole Principle " no longer used the Pigeon - hole Principle at all !
I could reintroduce an appeal to the Pigeon - hole Principle , but only by a contorted rephrasing .
[ Identify the elements with objects , the labels with compartments ; assume N — the number of objects — to exceed U · D — the number of compartments — ; then — PP — at least one compartment would contain more than one objects , which contradicts that distinct elements get distinct labels .
Hence N does not exceed U · D . ]
Remark
It is in this connection noteworthy that no one I asked formulated the Pigeon - hole Principle as follows : " With objects distributed into compartments such that each compartment contains at most one object , the number of objects is at most the number of compartments " .
It is logically equivalent to the original formulation , but looks quite different .
And that , presumably , is precisely the trouble .
( End of Remark . )
With its physical , object - oriented formulation , the classical Pigeon - hole Principle is very vivid , almost catchy .
And there lie precisely its major shortcomings : the problem caused by such object - oriented formulation is that A ⇒ B and the logically equivalent " counter - positive " ¬ B ⇒ ¬ A invite completely different visualisations .
The moral of the story seems to be that we should sharply distinguish between good mathematics and public relations .

United States of America
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Save the market 's decline , 2008 might seem like any other year for individual retirement accounts .
But that 's not so .
There were many new laws , court decisions , IRS notices and other rule changes affecting the retirement plan of choice for millions of Americans , according to Ed Slott , the nation 's preeminent IRA expert .
Here 's a snapshot of the top IRA changes in 2008 .
New laws on distributions
By far , the biggest changes came as part of the Worker , Retiree , and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 , or WRERA ( which might be an acronym for " we 're in big trouble " ) .
Under that law , required minimum distributions for IRA owners , plan participants and beneficiaries are waived for 2009 .
Of note , you are still required to take your RMD if you turned 701 / 2 in 2008 but decided to wait until this year to take that distribution .
Another provision of WRERA : Starting in 2010 , non-spouse beneficiaries are n't allowed to leave retirement plans with the former IRA owner 's employer .
They will have to transfer those plans to an IRA at a bank , brokerage or mutual - fund firm .
Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 , sometimes called the bailout bill , IRA owners who are 701 / 2 can transfer up to $ 100,000 to a charity in 2009 without having the amount included in their gross income .
Court decisions
If an IRA owner dies and has designated a revocable trust as the beneficiary , the expectation is that the money in the IRA would be exempt from claims by creditors of the decedent , as they say in estate planning circles .
Not so , according to Seymour Goldberg , author of J.K. Lasser 's " Inherited IRAs " and contributor to Slott 's newsletter .
In a recent Kansas court case , creditors were able to get at the money in an IRA that named a revocable trust as the beneficiary .
According to Goldberg , the lesson learned is this :
Do n't designate a revocable trust as the IRA beneficiary .
Instead , name an irrevocable discretionary trust with spendthrift language as the beneficiary , he said .
IRS takes note of Roth conversions
Uncle Sam cleared up a big issue with IRS Notice 2008 - 30 : A non-spouse beneficiary of a qualified retirement plan can transfer the account to an inherited Roth IRA so long as the transfer is allowed by the plan and the beneficiary meets the Roth conversion eligibility requirements , according to Slott 's newsletter .
Starting in 2010 , plans must allow such transfers .
IRS private letter rulings
In its private letter rulings ( PLRs ) , the IRS responds to a specific taxpayer 's request for relief .
But sometimes these rulings can help other IRA owners who might need guidance with similar problems .
Take , for instance , PLRs 200840054 and 200835033 , both of which deal with substantially equal periodic payments or 72 ( t ) payment plans .
Some IRA owners who are under age 591 / 2 can avoid having to pay the 10 % penalty on IRA distributions by taking money out in substantially equal periodic payments or SEPP .
In those two rulings , the IRA owner failed -- because of a mistake by the account custodian -- to take a distribution and then did a make - up distribution .
Typically , the IRA owner has to pay the 10 % penalty on all early distributions if he fails to take the SEPP .
But the IRS ruled in these cases that the custodian was at fault and the IRA owner did n't have to pay the penalty .
Given all the mergers of financial firms lately , it 's likely mistakes of this sort will increase , Slott said .
If you 're using a SEPP plan to withdraw money from your IRA and the custodian fails to make a payment , consider asking the IRS for relief .
Saving the ' stretch ' IRA
People who inherit IRAs use their life expectancy to calculate the amount of the distribution , in effect " stretching " the IRA over their lifetimes .
But in PLR 200811028 , the beneficiary failed to take the required distribution for a couple of years .
After realizing the mistake , the beneficiary took three years of distributions and even paid the 50 % penalty due on the late RMD .
In years past , the IRS would have forced the beneficiary to withdraw the rest of the IRA money over five years .
But in this PLR , the IRS gave the beneficiary permission to continue taking required distributions over her life expectancy .
" This PLR now indicates that IRS now treats a stretch IRA as the default mode , " according to Slott 's newsletter .
Identifying the beneficiary
No matter what else you do this year , be sure to designate a beneficiary on your IRA .
In PLR 200846028 , the IRA owner wrote that the beneficiary is " as stated in the will . "
Well , the IRS says the beneficiary must be " identifiable " and forced the IRA beneficiaries " as stated in the will " to take the IRA money out in five years instead over their life expectancies - the more tax - friendly way .
The takeaway ?
Make sure your beneficiary or beneficiaries are " readily identifiable . "
Rules on disclaimers
Often IRA beneficiaries will disclaim an inherited IRA to reduce any potential tax bills .
But there are right and wrong ways to do a disclaimer , according to Slott .
PLR 200837046 points to the right way .
In that case , two children , one of whom was the named beneficiary and the other who was born after the IRA owner had named the older child as beneficiary .
When the owner died , the oldest child disclaimed half of the IRA , in effect giving half of the IRA to the younger sibling .
The older brother got to use his life expectancy for the distributions and the younger brother had to take his share of the IRA over five years .
PLR 200846003 , meanwhile , was the wrong way to disclaim .
In effect , an IRA owner signed a prenuptial agreement saying a trust for her new husband would be the beneficiary .
Well , the wife died before she actually changed the beneficiary and all heck broke loose .
Her children , who were the named beneficiaries , disclaimed the IRA .
Now estate taxes might be due because the children failed to disclaim the IRA and trust assets the right way .
Suffice to say :
If you plan to disclaim IRAs , make sure you talk to a qualified professional .
IRA trust rulings
Many problems that arise with IRAs are the result of owners not naming beneficiaries correctly .
In PLR 200826028 , the IRA owner said in his estate plan that after specific gifts were made , all remaining assets , including an IRA , would go to charity .
Well , the IRS said the estate failed to pay any income tax when it transferred the IRA to the charity .
This tax could have been avoided , according to Slott 's newsletter , if the IRA owner had simply named the charity as the beneficiary .
In PLR 2008260008 , an IRA owner named his two children as beneficiaries , one of whom was a minor .
The minor 's guardian asked the court for permission to create a trust for the minor 's share of the IRA .
Not surprisingly , the IRS ruled that the transfer of the IRA to a trust would trigger taxable income , though that tax would n't be due until distributions came out of the IRA .
The lesson ?
If you have a beneficiary who 's a minor , it 's best to designate " a custodian or a trust to hold an inherited IRA for the minor " rather than have to ask for a ruling later .
What the future holds
What will be the top IRA rulings in 2009 ?
That 's impossible to say just yet .
The only certainty is that that there will be a list next year , too .
German scientists have reconstructed an extraordinarily detailed picture of the domestic life of Martin Luther , the 16th - century reformer and father of Protestantism , by trawling through his household waste uncovered during archaeological digs on sites where he used to live .
Beer tankards , grains of corn , cooking pots , even his toilet are among the finds dug up during the five - year project in the three places in Germany he spent his life .
The items include his wife 's golden wedding band , a collection of 250 silver coins and the medicines used to treat his various ailments from angina to constipation .
But some finds have upset the Protestant church in Wittenberg where the ex-monk lived with his wife , the ex-nun Katharina von Bora , and their six children .
The church has called " religiously irrelevant " the evidence that the peace - loving family used to throw dead cats into the rubbish bin and that the nails Luther used to secure his 95 theses to the church door in Wittenberg - which led to his ex-communication from the Catholic church and launched the reformation - were in fact drawing pins .
" We 've been able to reconstruct whole chapters of his life 's history , " said Harald Meller , one of the main researchers .
Protestants from around the world are expected to flock to an exhibition at the history museum in Halle , where the best of the discoveries are to go on display from Friday .
Despite the widespread belief that Luther lived in poverty , evidence suggests he was a well - fed man - weighing in at a hefty 150 kg ( 23st 8 lb ) when he died in 1546 at the age of 63 .
A search through the kitchen waste offers proof that the family ate well .
There are clues that they regularly dined on roast goose and the tender meat of piglets , while during fasting periods they tucked into expensive fish including herring , cod , and plaice .
Partridge , and song - birds - particularly robins - which the family hunted with clay whistles - often graced the Luthers ' dinner table .
Even Luther 's claim that he came from humble circumstances have been dismissed .
New evidence has shown that already as a young man , his father owned land and a copper mill and lent money for interest .
His mother was born into an upper middle - class family and it is unlikely , as Luther suggested , that she " carried all her wood on her back " .
The discovery in his boyhood home in Mansfeld of a skittles set made out of cow bones and glass marbles also suggests the family was relatively well to do .
The most extensive research carried out at the family home in Wittenberg showed that Luther wrote his celebrated texts with goose quills under lamps lit by animal fat , in a heated room which overlooked the River Elbe .
It obviously suited him because he churned out 1,800 pages a year .
It debunks something of the Luther myth to know he wrote the 95 theses on a stone toilet , which was dug up in 2004 .
But the claim by historians which will arguably be most upsetting for followers is the recently uncovered written evidence that it was not , as thought , a lightning bolt which led to the then 21 - year - old 's spontaneous declaration he wanted to become a monk .
Rather , it was his desperation to escape an impending arranged marriage .
Enough of socks ?
Ask for legos instead lol
Over the past few weeks , I 've been looking at various ( Java and Scala based )
Actor frameworks .
In an attempt to understand the API of these frameworks , I 've been porting the same toy example consisting of three pipelined Actors responding to a bunch of requests shoved down one end of the pipe .
To get a feel for how they compare , performance - wise , to one another , I 've also been computing wallclock times for various request batch sizes .
Mike Rettig ( author of the Jetlang project ) pointed out that the Jetlang numbers I published in my last week 's post appeared incorrect in comparison to the Scala numbers .
Rajesh Karmani ( one of the authors of the ActorFoundry project ) also expressed surprise that Kilim numbers were higher compared to Scala .
Mike was kind enough to take a look at the Jetlang code , and he suggested that the excessive amounts of console IO that the actors were making were causing it to perform worse than Scala .
Taking the println ( ) calls out from both the Scala and the Jetlang examples improved the performance of both significantly , and the Jetlang example ended up with lower elapsed time numbers than the Scala examples .
Apparently , the performance characteristics of the Scala println ( ) was different enough from the Java System.out. println ( ) to skew the results .
This week , I remove the console output from all the examples ( after verifying that they work correctly ) and republish the numbers .
Tim Jansen ( author of the Actor 's Guild framework ) , was also kind enough to build me an Actor 's Guild version of my example .
Rajesh also took a look at the code for the Kilim example at my request , and he pointed out several improvements that may make Kilim run faster .
I have incorporated his suggestions into the rewritten code .
He also pointed me to his ActorFoundry project , and , over the last couple of days , he has been of immense assistance ( via email ) in helping me to build an ActorFoundry version of my toy example .
This week , I provide the updated code for Kilim and Jetlang , and code to work with Actor 's Guild and ActorFoundry , and provide the elapsed time comparison between these frameworks ( as well as the Scala examples from last week ) .
In many ways , this post is largely due to the efforts of these three fine programmers .
Thank you , gentlemen !
Kilim - updated
The original Kilim code for my example used a Message object that was passed around between the Actors .
Since the Jetlang example just used a String messsage ( which was really all that my example needed ) , I changed it over to use a String instead of the Message object , thereby removing the extra instanceof checks to distinguish between a regular message and a poison pill termination messsage .
The code is explained in detail in my previous post , I just just post the updated code here .

Jetlang - updated
The original code for my Jetlang example can be found here .
Mike rewrote my example quite a bit and made it part of the Jetlang distribution examples .
You can browse the code in the Jetlang SVN repository .
The main change is the refactoring out of the System.out. println ( ) calls into the Main.log ( ) method ( the Main. java is the same as my ActorManager. java ) and commenting it out for benchmarking .
Other changes include changing the Message object into a String , and the addition of channels and listener to respond to the poison pill .
Overall , the resulting code is more elegant than mine , so I 've changed my code to reflect these changes .
Scala ( loop / receive ) - updated
The Scala versions ( originally described here ) remain almost unchanged , except that there is now a new function log in the ActorManager object , and all the Actors use this method to log the message .
As in the Jetlang example , it 's body is commented out .
I have also changed the while ( true ) call in the previous example to use the loop method of Actor .
Here is the code :

currentTimeMillis for ( i <- 1 until 1000000 ) { val payload =
" Requested " + i log ( payload ) DownloadActor !
payload } // ask them to stop DownloadActor !
StopMessage // wait for actors to stop latch .
await println ( " elapsed = " + ( System . currentTimeMillis - start ) ) } } case class StopMessage ( ) object DownloadActor extends
Actor { def act ( ) { loop { receive { case payload : String => { val new Payload = payload .
replaceFirst ( " Requested " , " Downloaded " ) ActorManager .
log ( newPayload ) IndexActor !
new Payload } case StopMessage => { ActorManager . log ( " Stopping download " ) IndexActor !
StopMessage ActorManager .
decrementLatch exit } } } } } object IndexActor extends
Actor { def act ( ) { loop { receive { case payload : String => { val new Payload = payload .
replaceFirst ( " Downloaded " , " Indexed " ) ActorManager .
log ( newPayload ) WriteActor !
new Payload } case StopMessage => { ActorManager . log ( " Stopping Index " ) WriteActor !
StopMessage ActorManager .
decrementLatch exit } } } } } object WriteActor extends
Actor { def act ( ) { loop { receive { case payload : String => { val new Payload = payload .
replace
First ( " Indexed " , " Wrote " ) ActorManager .
log ( newPayload ) } case StopMessage => { ActorManager . log ( " Stopping Write " ) ActorManager .
decrementLatch exit } } } } }
Scala ( loop / react ) - updated
The loop / react version of the above Scala example simply replaces the loop / receive calls with loop / react .
In the interests of brevity , I am not including it here - just change the receive call to react in three places and you have the loop / react version .
Actor 's Guild
The Actor 's Guild framework provides a nice annotation based approach to build Actors .
Methods that are marked as @Initializer roughly correspond to actor constructors , and methods annotated by @ Message correspond roughly to the Actor.act ( ) method .
Both return an AsyncResult .
@ Message methods may take parameters .
Actor 's Guild provides an Actor class which all application Actors must extend .
More information is available in the tutorial .

Unlike Kilim , which uses bytecode enhancement as a post - compilation step , Actor 's Guild uses bytecode enhancement at runtime to create several helper classes dynamically for each Actor .
This is done once , the first time the Actor is created .
Actor 's Guild uses asm 3.1 ( as opposed to asm - 2.2.3 for Kilim ) to do the bytecode enhancement .
The resulting code is quite easy to read .
The initial version was even easier , but because we are pre-allocating the array of AsyncResult objects to hold the results , when there are a large number of requests to be processed , my machine was thrashing with a 2GB heap and times for 1 million tasks were quite high .
So Tim made the change to batch them up in chunks , which yields much better times .
Benchmarks aside , the idiom for breaking up a large concurrent job into batches of smaller size is quite neat , and could possibly find uses in similar situations elsewhere .
ActorFoundry
ActorFoundry uses Kilim internally .
It provides a runner application ( called Foundry ) that the application Actors run within .
Like Actor 's Guild , it relies on annotations , and messages correspond to methods in the Actors .
Unlike Actor 's Guild , messages are sent using a send ( ) call , the parameters of which identify the target actor and method name - it looks a bit like method invocation using Reflection .
The methods which can be called as messages are marked with the @message annotation .
In ActorFoundry , all components run within the foundry and must be Actors , so the ActorManager in my example is also an Actor .
Here is the code .
I wrote an initial version of the code based on the examples in the distribution , which did n't work , and which Rajesh modified so it would .

There is actually no necessity to comment out the console IO calls in this case , since stdout is an actor and processes the println ( ) calls asynchronously , but I did this in any case , for consistency with the other examples .
Processing the code so it can be run is quite complex , and involves code generation before compilation and post - processing ( using the Kilim weaver ) after compilation .
Here is the snippet from my build.xml that selectively works on the ActorFoundry code in the compile target ( its mostly copied from the various targets from the build.xml file in the ActorFoundry distribution .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 < target name= " compile " depends= " get - deps " description =

If you are observant , you will notice that there is no mention in my code of the * Executor class names I provide for weaving .
These are actually code generated off the Actors shown by the ExecutorCodeGen code generator .
To run the code , I use the following shell script .
The class at the near end of the actor pipeline ( ActorManager ) is mentioned , and the parameter to its boot ( ) method is provided .
The - open means that the foundry remains running even after all the actors are finished .
In the code , I have a System.exit ( 0 ) which terminates the run .
1 2 prompt$ java - cp $ REPO / actorfoundry -1.0.jar:target/classes osl.foundry.FoundryStart \ com.mycompany.myapp.concurrent.actorfoundry.ActorManager boot 1000000 - open
One thing to note about ActorFoundry is its license , it is not free for commercial use .
There are plans for making the source repository visible to outsiders , and the distribution does come with lots of example code , but it would be nice if the project had a tutorial style user guide for new users to get started .

Please remember that these numbers are meaningless if you are trying to figure out which will perform the best for your application .
All that the actors in my application do is replace a string with another .
Real - world actors that you will write for your application are likely to do something less trivial that that , which could potentially cause threads to block , and perhaps result in very different performance characteristics .
To figure out which actor application would be best suited to your application , you should run your own benchmarks - now that you 've read this far , you are as familiar as I am with the various actor APIs , so writing your own application should be fairly simple .

Mats Henrickson pointed out that the Scala example was doing string concatenation and the Java examples were not , and also pointed out that a Message class was being used to pass the message as opposed to a plain string in the Java examples .
He was kind enough to send me an updated version of the code .
He noticed an 8 % speedup in the Scala code as a result of these changes on his box ( see comments below ) .
I have made the updates to the Scala example above .

Google also said it would offer its employees the opportunity to exchange their stock options for ones with a lower exercise price  the price employees would pay to convert an option into stock .
The company said that plan was intended to retain workers as the value of Google ’s stock plummeted near 60 percent since its November 2007 peak .
In a conference call with analysts , Eric E. Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive , said about 85 percent of the company ’s workers had stock options with an exercise price higher than the current price of Google ’s shares .
Vesting of the new options will be delayed by one year , which should help Google retain employees , he said .
The total number of options would not change , Mr. Schmidt said , but the number that would ultimately be exercised and converted into stock would probably rise .
“ It is a good deal for shareholders and for employees as well , ” he said .
Google will take a charge of about $ 460 million over five years to account for the changes .
The compensation research firm Equilar said that stock option exchanges and plans to reset the price of stock options were becoming increasingly common , as companies try to insulate workers from the declining value of the stock market .
In January , 25 American companies announced repricing or option swap plans , half as many as in all of 2008 , Equilar said .

Five sticks of explosives have been found and made safe in a top Paris department store , French police say .
The Printemps Haussmann store was evacuated and cordoned off , and police directed traffic away from the area .
French news agency AFP received a letter signed by a group calling itself the Afghan Revolutionary Front , warning of " several bombs " placed in the store .
President Nicolas Sarkozy urged caution in reacting to the incident .
There was no detonator linked to the explosives .
" All we can do is to be prudent and moderate , " Mr Sarkozy said at a news conference in the European Parliament .
Send the message to your president that he must withdraw his troops from our country before the end of February 2009 or else we will take action in your capitalist department stores
Letter sent to news agency AFP " My belief has not changed since 2002 that vigilance in the face of terrorism is the only possible line to take . "
The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the incident is a scary warning to the French people and a reminder that they are not immune to the scourge of terrorism , despite there being no significant attack on French soil for more than 10 years .
Unknown group Officials said the explosives , planted in washrooms on several floors , were first located by sniffer dogs .
They consisted of old sticks of dynamite held together with a piece of cord , according to an officials quoted by news agency AFP .
" Based on what we know , it was not a device that was set to explode .
We are going to carry out an investigation to find the perpetrators , " AFP quoted Interior Minister Michele Alliot - Marie as saying at the scene .
The store , on the city 's central Boulevard Haussmann , was evacuated as the area was busy with shoppers ahead of Christmas .
One shopper told AFP the evacuation was calm and orderly .
The Afghan Revolutionary Front is a previously unknown group .
" If you do not send someone to intervene before Wednesday December 17 , they will explode , " said its letter , which was taken by police investigating the explosives .
" Send the message to your president that he must withdraw his troops from our country before the end of February 2009 or else we will take action in your capitalist department stores and this time , without warning . "
France has about 2,600 troops serving with Nato in Afghanistan , after reinforcements were sent earlier this year .
In a video broadcast last November , a Taleban military leader , Faruq Akhun Zadeh , warned that " our reaction will be heard in Paris " if the troops were not withdrawn .

ROANOKE COUNTY ( WSLS ) - Several fire departments are on the scene of a brush fire on Catawba Mountain .
Smoke could be seen from the 4100 block of Bradshaw Road where the first calls came in Sunday afternoon .
Roanoke County Fire EMS spokeswoman Jennifer Sexton says it started at the base of the mountain then spread .
Career and volunteer crews from our Catawba , Masons Cove , Fort Lewis , and Hollins stations have been on scene after being called in to assist at 2:30 p.m..
They 're now working to dig a fire line .
It is now contained .
A crew will watch it throughout the night and mop up will begin Monday .
A team from the Virginia Department of Forestry is also on scene .
No houses were threatened , Sexton said .
Early estimates put the fire at as many as five acres .
Firefighters are working to determine the exact size by walking the line and entering GPS points , she explained .
January 5 , 2009
The Greek socialist newspaper Workers '
Left looks in this editorial at the roots of the revolt that began with the killing of a teenage student by police in Athens -- and what the protests mean for the future .
THE WAVE of struggle that has burst out after the police murder of Alexandros Grigoropoulos has been justly characterized as a social rebellion by youth in Greece .
Thousands upon thousands of young people -- high school and university students , and young workers -- have taken over the streets of all the important cities in the country , sending a loud message : " We are not going to take it no more ! "
By targeting the police , they made clear their decision to confront the suffocating repression used against them .
By the targeting the banks -- the symbol of capitalist greed -- they showed their intention to fight against the exploitation that crushes the whole of the working class .
The movement has withstood a repressive counterattack by the conservative government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis , using tear gas , unrestrained violence by club - waving riot police , and gunfire against high school students .
It has also stood up against a slander campaign organized by the government , with the support of the media and , unfortunately , the Communist Party , and the silence of PASOK , the main social democratic party .
The propaganda about " blind violence " was designed to divert attention from the actual activities of the movement and to force the youth into retreat .
A mass protest against the Karamanlis government winds its way through the streets of Athens
Two weeks later , the movement is still in the streets .
The combination of mass demonstrations and occupations of high school and university campuses threatens to go on , pushing the Karamanlis government beyond what it can endure .
The resilience of this movement can only be understood as a result of the solidarity that the demonstrators have enjoyed among the majority of people in Greece .
The explosion of anger that followed Alexis ' murder brought together all sorts of pressures that people have been subjected to for years : Rising prices and continuous austerity that have slashed workers ' income .
The spread of flexible labor relations that have filled up workplaces with " part - timers " and " temps . "
Systematic cuts in social spending that have driven hospitals , schools and retirement funds to the threshold of collapse .
To this already severe reality has been added the nightmare of financial crisis .
At the same time as the capitalists and their government are spending 28 billion euros ( $ 35 billion ) to " save " the banks , they are asking us willingly to accept even harsher sacrifices to save the system from the crisis they created .
At the same time , the explosion that followed Alexis ' murder brought together all of the major and minor struggles of the previous period :
The great movement of the last year against privatization of education and proposed changes to Article 16 of the constitution , which protects the rights of youth to free education .
The teachers ' strike in autumn 2006 .
The flood of protest against plans to change the pension system .
The hundreds of strikes that did n't quite win and even those that went down in defeat .
These popular struggles have kept resistance alive with the demand for an end to neoliberalism -- and that " bill " is today being presented to Karamanlis .
THE RESISTANCE is international in character .
Throughout Europe , after 20 years of neoliberal attacks , with the economic crisis growing worse , the question is being raised :
What kind of struggles can really provide an alternative ?
It is because of this that Nicolas Sarkozy , Angela Merkel , Silvio Berlusconi and Gordon Brown are in a panic , fearing the consequences of the " Greek example . "
We do not have any trace of national self - importance .
A few years back , inspired by the student uprising in the streets of Paris , we demonstrated with the slogan : " Here will become like France . "
Today , we are elated not only because of the international shows of solidarity for our struggle , but because the wave of protests that followed Alexis ' murder is being understood by millions of people all across Europe as an invitation to a more generalized uprising -- for a new May ' 68 , to be our answer to the crisis .
After two weeks in the streets , our duties are the politicization and broadening of the movement .
To the voices that demand de-escalation and a return to " normalcy , " we must put forward the need for resilience and continuing the struggle .
The slogan " Down with the government of murderers " is absolutely central .
The Karamanlis government is falling apart , and it must be overthrown from below by the actions of the movement .
This means not only removing from power the discredited personnel of Karamanlis ' New Democracy , but also overturning the policies dictated for years by the industrialists and the bankers -- policies that the experience of the preceding Simitis government shows could be continued by a social neoliberal government of PASOK .
It is because of this experience that we have no reason to wait for the certain electoral defeat of New Democracy .
We should not allow Karamanlis any more time to go on with his anti-labor , anti-social policies .
But even more importantly , with our struggle today to overturn the government , we are setting political limits on any successor government to stop any " two - party " transition ( and even more so the idea of a coalition government of PASOK and New Democracy ) .
We are opening up the prospect of victories and real gains for workers and youth .
With respect to that perspective , actions in the streets are not sufficient by themselves anymore .
While not abandoning demonstrations , we need to turn our efforts to actions inside the schools , with student strikes , occupations and mass general assembly meetings .
At the same time , the movement needs to broaden further in society .
The right cannot withstand the pressure of a fighting front of students and workers .
At the present time , the labor movement is facing the challenge of the newly passed budget .
It is clear that the trade unions are n't doing even the most basic things to mobilize opposition .
During the December 10 general strike , the unions retreated in terror , initially canceling a strike rally in the center of Athens .
Eventually , the demonstration did take place , and the large turnout and its fighting spirit gave union leaders the most proper answer .
But in the few days before the budget vote in parliament , the unions avoided any calls for serious actions to escalate the struggle .
That duty now falls on the shoulders of activists inside the unions at the grassroots level .
Now is the time for strike actions -- and coordination between sections of workers already in struggle -- to generalize our demands and fight for victories .
IN A time of crisis , the real politics of each party have become clear .
PASOK limited its activities to organizing peaceful , silent and small candlelight marches , to show that it was " in mourning " for Alexis .
PASOK let it be known to one and all that in this critical time for Karamanlis , it would n't " pour oil on the fire , " and it was willing to wait peacefully until elections for changes .
This is n't just a tactic chosen for electoral purposes .
It is a clear warning sign that a PASOK government will follow the same policies that Karamanlis did .
The real surprise and disappointment was the actions of the Communist Party .
Not only did it not make any effort to organize and further politicize the protests , but it brought out of its Stalinist closet slanders about " provocateurs , " and it placed itself among the parties demanding that priority be given to restoring " peace and order . "
Once more , the Communist Party has proven that the left character of any party should be judged not by its program on paper , but by its concrete political position on questions posed by real struggles .
The leadership of the radical reformist party Synaspismos , the largest organization in the Coalition of the Radical Left ( SYRIZA , by its Greek initials ) , withstood the political pressure and refused to go along with condemning the protests under the pretext of denouncing the " violence of the black bloc " -- though not without some vacillation , such as the retreat from the original call for the strike rally on December 10 .
Overall , SYRIZA emerged as a valuable network of political support for the movement ( as was shown by the organizing of protests in smaller cities ) .
We are now entering a critical phase .
The international crisis is going to sharpen the confrontations .
In such a period , what is needed politically is a really radical left -- a political force willing and capable of making the case for the replacement of capitalism with socialism , and of connecting this aim with the great struggles that will inevitably break out against the intensification of exploitation and oppression .
Simply put , the Palm Pre is the most hyped phone since the original iPhone .
It 's coming out in two weeks , on June 6 .
Here 's everything we know — we'll update this as more info comes in .

Should I get the Pre over the iPhone ?
WIll it make a good replacement for my old Phone ?
It depends .
I 'm glad you 're educating yourself by reading this FAQ , but read our Palm Pre review full of videos , fresh photos and a complete run down of how this phone stacks up .

PALM PRE LAUNCH
When and where can I buy It ?
June 6 , and you can buy it at Sprint Stores , Best Buy or Radio Shack .
Sprint Premier customers — if you do n't know what that is , you 're not one of 'em — will be able to hit up a special launch party in select cities on June 5 .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
How much is it gonna cost me , really ?
Sprint 's touting $ 199 .
That 's with a two - year agreement and $ 100 mail - in rebate ( which we think is pretty irritating ) .
However , if you buy it at Best Buy or Radio Shack , the rebate is instant , so it 'll be $ 199 out the gate at either of those fine establishments .
If you do n't want to deal with an icky contract , most signs point to $ 549 , though Sprint has n't confirmed that .
Advertisement
It will require an Everything Data or Business Essentials With Messaging and Data plan , both of which start at $ 70 .
If you 're special and have a Sprint 's Everything Plus referral plan , which starts at $ 60 , that 'll work too .
Will I have to camp outside ?
Good question !
Mostly ' cause we 're not exactly sure , for a couple of reasons .
Advertisement
For one , we do n't know how many are gonna be available at launch .
Sprint 's CEO talking up just how badly they wont ' be able to meet demand does n't make us feel any better , even if he 's just trying to add to the hype .
And there were some scary numbers floating around , like 30 - 40,000 total , with 3-4,000 allocated to Best Buy .
The latest we 've heard on the Best Buy front is that " large box Best Buy stores will only have at most about 15 - 20 and smaller stores at best 7 - 10 " units .
Advertisement
We 've got fairly solid info Radio Shack is getting 11,000 units , so 30,000 total seems a bit low , since it seems like Best Buy would get at least as many as Radio Shack — if not more — and Sprint 's definitely going to keep the bulk of the phones for themselves .
From what we 've heard , not every Best Buy or Radio Shack will have one .
On the Best Buy front , we 're told the allocation is going to depend on how well they 've sold other high - profile phones , as well as general Sprint stores .
Some wo n't get any at all , at least at first .
Supposedly , the stock will get more plentiful in July / August .
We 're not sure how Radio Shack is divvying up their stock , just that not every Radio Shack will get one .
Advertisement
Demand is the other part of the equation .
Will it match the hype ?
Hard to say !
Do I Really Have to Go With Sprint to Get Some Pre Action ?
If you 're in the US of A , it looks that way , at least for 2009 .
But that does n't mean you have to go Sprint to get a phone with the Pre's WebOS .
Palm 's confirmed there 's more than one WebOS phone in the pipeline , and the Centro of the family — the Palm Eos — has already leaked out .
Rumor has it this little WebOS phone will hit AT&T this fall , maybe as cheaply as $ 99 ( after contract and rebate voodoo ) .

HARDWARE
Innovative Design
Palm's
Pre smartphone is unusual in that it slides vertically to reveal the QWERTY keyboard .
It uses the same curved sliding action found on phones like the Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 .
The vertical keyboard was used partially to stand out from other phones , and partially to adhere to the philosophy of easy one - handed use .
The phone has a multitouch screen and , when the keyboard is hidden , just three physical controls :
A top button , a side volume rocker , clickable button at the bottom .
It also has a 3.5 mm headphone jack , 3MP camera on the back ( w/ LED flash ) all in a 4.8 - ounce package .
It 's smaller than the iPhone in surface area , but it 's noticeably thicker — even thicker than the BB Bold .

Gesture Area
The gesture area is the black space that extends below the screen of the Pre .
Like the screen itself , that area is fully multitouch - capable , and allows you to perform various gesture - based actions within WebOS .
Palm said they implemented the gesture area because they feel one - handed control directly on the touchscreen itself can be difficult at times .
They say the gesture area will make it easier to move through WebOS without the need for a second hand .
One touted use for the gesture area is the wave dock , which appears whenever you drag your finger up from the gesture area to the screen .
Up pops the dock — viewable in the homescreen but otherwise invisible when you 're doing stuff — for a quick change of activity .
( This is a bit reminiscent of the Mac OSX Dock . )
Advertisement
TI OMAP Chip
The TI 3430 OMAP chip is the great wizard running the show in Pre 's Emerald City .
It 's an ARM - based CPU likely clocked at 600MHz with built - in graphics acceleration that 's high - powered enough to handle multiple apps running ( 15 - 20 ) .
Let 's just hope that performance does n't cost too much in battery life .
Advertisement
Touchstone Wireless Charger
Touchstone is a wireless charging base for the Palm Pre , one of the first magnetic induction chargers to make its way out of the bathroom .
( Sonicare and Oral - B toothbrushes power up using a similar system . )
It 's referred to as " The Puck , " and you just click the back of the Pre onto its flat surface and the juice starts to flow .
It 'll be $ 70 .
******
SOFTWARE
Cards
Advertisement
Cards , whose flick - friendly interface promises to make smartphone multitasking simple , are arguably the biggest revolution in the WebOS interface .
Each app is represented by a panel or " card " with all its relevant info .
To the side of each card are similar cards for other running apps .
You can flick your way from one to the next , and do things like pause a song , or launch a new email .
If you tap the card , you can enter the full app and really get to work .
WebOS is designed to handle many apps running at once , and the Palm Pre has the power to support that .

Synergy
Despite its lame 1990s corporate - culture name , Synergy is a very cool feature that integrates contact info , calendars , messaging clients and search capabilities into a seamless menu system .
Synergy takes contact info from sites like Gmail and Facebook ( plus any other site that takes advantage of the SDK ) , and presents all that info for any contact on a single screen , then shows all the ways you can contact that person electronically .
Most of this is done automatically , but if WebOS can't detect multiple online accounts for the same contact , you can manually link contacts together .
Advertisement
Even better , whether you 're texting , emailing , or IMing , all those conversations are placed into one chat style screen , so you can see all the conversations you 've had with a person over a given period of time .
Advertisement
Universal Search
The entire contents of your phone are searchable .
Whether it 's contacts , old conversations , appointments , media file , etc. , you can easily find what you need on your phone with all the results provided in a single screen .
But if what you 're looking for is n't on the phone locally , you can take that same search to the internet with a tap or two of the screen , where it will be run through sites like Google and Wikipedia .
Advertisement
Notifications
Palm tried to master that all - too - fickle smartphone feature : background notifications .
The problem is , notifications tend to be either too distracting or not distracting enough .
Palm 's notification system pops up on the bottom half of the screen , but the app UI adjusts so you can still carry out whatever you 're doing .
Obviously , you 'll have to acknowledge the message ( or cancel it ) eventually , but this feature will definitely save you some frustration .
Advertisement
Multitouch Browser
WebOS 's browser is the first since Mobile Safari to support multitouch gestures .
And like the iPhone 's Mobile Safari and Android 's browser on the G1 , it 's built on top of WebKit , which means you can expect the same speedy , responsive performance found on those phones .

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
( Many of our answers were pulled from our interview with Palm during our Pre hands - on . )
Advertisement
Will there be a GSM Palm Pre ?
Yes , but it will be a UTMS , Europe - only phone available later this year .
No announcement for a US GSM phone has been made as of yet .
What kind of internet connectivity does the Palm Pre have ?
The Pre has an EVDO rev .
A mobile broadband chip ( for average connectivity upwards of 1 Mbps ) in addition to Wi - Fi ( b / g ) .
Advertisement
How long will the battery last between charges ?
Palm has n't officially revealed any info on this yet , but Pre Central , based on photos of the battery , have made a highly educated guess that the battery is identical to that found in the Centro ( 1150 mAh - 1350 mAh ) .
As John Herrman points out in his post , the Treo Pro has a 1500 mAh battery that goes about two days between charges ; the iPhone has a 1400 mAh battery that 's okay but sometimes runs out too fast ; and the G1 has an 1150 mAh , considered woefully inadequate in the eyes of many .
Advertisement
A Palm PR rep told PalmInfoCentral to expect the battery to have a 1200 mAh life , though how long that lasts in real time depends on the processor and the demands of the OS .
Advertisement
Is the battery removable ?
Yes .
What does the top button do ?
The dedicated button found on top of the phone not only slides between silent and normal modes , but you can also press it to turn airplane mode on or off .
Advertisement
Does the Pre 's screen auto - rotate between portrait and landscape mode ?
Yes , like most other high - end smartphones , the Pre has built - in accelerometers that are quite responsive .
Does the Pre have a standard headphone jack ?
Yes , the Pre uses the standard 3.5 m m headphone jack , located on top of the phone , that works with all mainstream portable headphones .
Advertisement
Does the Palm Pre have expandable storage ?
Nope .
The 8GB that comes with the phone is what you 're stuck with .
Did Palm discuss the availability of a 16GB or 32 GB Pre ?
No .
Advertisement
Will apps from the older Palm OS ( aka Garnet ) work on WebOS ?
This was a total surprise , but yes .
The Pre 's got an built - in emulator coming to run classic Palm apps .
Do n't expect everything to work 100 percent amazingly , though .
Advertisement
Does WebOS have an on - screen keyboard ?
No specific mention has been made , but from what we have seen so far , it does not .
This could be a specific omission , since the Pre already has a physical keyboard .
It would be hard to believe that WebOS does not have provisions for a software keyboard in future phones .
Is HTC involved with the design or manufacturing of the Palm Pre ?
No .
The Palm Pre and WebOS were designed entirely in house , using only Palm employees .
Some worked on the original Palm OS , while others were new to the project this time around .
As for manufacturing , Palm has n't revealed who is assembling the phones , but it has been confirmed that it is n't HTC .
Advertisement
Does the Pre record video ?
Palm said the Pre will not have video recording capability when it first launches , but it is something they are looking into for future updates .
Is there visual voicemail ?
No .
Palm Pre Does n't Have Visual Voicemail Palm 's official Twitter account revealed that Palm Synergy does n't have visual voicemail , … Read more

Whaaat ?
What about MMS ?
Yep .
Is there Flash support on the Pre / WebOS
Probably not at launch , but it 's definitely coming .
Advertisement
Do apps really run in the background ?
Yes .
Any app will be allowed to function in the background .
They wo n't close out or go dormant when you switch to another app or return to the home screen .
This is different from the iPhone , which can only run Apple - created apps in the background at this time .
Advertisement
How many can run at once ?
No official number has been given , but Palm thinks it 's reasonable to assume the Pre will be able to run 15 to 20 apps simultaneously .
Advertisement
I CAN HAZ COPY AND PASTE ?
Yes , the Pre has copy and paste ( now enough with the LOLspeak , dammit ) .
How will I get apps ?
How much will they cost ?
There will be a central apps store that will serve as the only method of distribution for the Palm Pre and future WebOS phones .
As of now , pricing models have not been released , but we assume there will be free and cheap apps .
Advertisement
Will you be able to sync apps via computer ?
No .
The app store will function entirely within WebOS .
Is there an app approval process ?
Will it be as strict as Apple's ?
Yes , there will be an app approval process for WebOS apps .
However , according to Palm , they 're less concerned with what the apps do , and more focused on making sure there are n't any security exploits or stability glitches .
( Here 's how it stacks up with every other mobile OS store . )
Advertisement
Will the SDK be open to everyone ?
Yes , Palm will make the SDK available to anyone who wants to develop apps .
Advertisement
Will apps be as good as those on iPhone or Android ?
That 's a question still up for discussion .
Palm 's SDK , as we understand it so far , will allow developers to create apps that lie somewhere between web apps and native apps in complexity .
While apps will be installable directly to the phone , developers will not have the same level of hardware access that iPhone and Android developers have .
What does this mean ?
The average Yelp / Mint / Pandora type app will probably work , look , and act the same on WebOS as it would any other mobile platform .
But when it comes to those trying to code resource - heavy apps — video and gaming apps for example , that require optimization and special hardware access — they will probably run into development issues using the SDK alone .
Palm says they 'll work with selected developers to give them more access to the intricacies of the phone , such as Telenav on the GPS app , for example .
Advertisement
Where can I get a closer look at some apps ?
Palm Goon has some suspiciously good — like a little too good — screencaps and walkthroughs of Google Maps , the web browser , Tasks and Memos apps .
We got some hands - on time with Google Maps and Pandora .
Advertisement
Will the Pre sync to PCs via Outlook or some other desktop program ?
There 's no special client application that we know of .
You can connect the Pre as a mass - storage device and drag - and - drop media ( music , video , photos ) into preexisting folders made for those files , allowing them to appear in the media player .
As for other types of syncing , such as Outlook , we 're not quite sure how that will work yet .
We 've heard and seen things about it having online backup and remote wipe through a " Palm profile . "
Advertisement
Does WebOS have a thin and beautiful figure ?
Well Palm does n't like to talk about its own software , but they did manage to imply that Mobile OS X is an obese , Crisco - guzzling lard ass .
******
CES ORIGINAL HANDS-ON IMPRESSIONS
Neither the Pre hardware or WebOS software are anywhere near final , so it 's tough to draw too many conclusions from our brief exposure , but I can say that Palm is rivaling Apple in the user experience department with this new phone .
Advertisement
The screen is responsive and accurately detects the position of your finger .
I did n't feel like I had to pay special attention to what I was touching or how I went about it .
The multitasking cards for app management are really intuitive , letting you zoom in and out , add and remove , and cycle through cards with a mere flick of a finger .
And having the WebOS desktop sit as a sort of frame around the cards prevents you from feeling too overwhelmed by the amount of data you might be flipping through ( sort of like Xbox 360 's newly revised " blades " ) .
The gesture area below the screen interacts really well with the onscreen UI .
I never had a problem launching the wave dock from that area , for instance .
Advertisement
The hardware feels like it's a quality build .
It 's plasticky , but it does n't feel too light or cheap , and the phone 's size works well for one - handed control .
The hinge design is smooth , though it would have been nicer to have a spring - loaded design — it does not .
The buttons are reminiscent of those found on the Treo Pro , that is , not spectacular but good enough not to be a nuisance .
The phone 's design is a little too pebbly and roundish in shape for me personally , but as far as usability goes , that 's hardly a problem .

Historical Background
Palm has come a long way since their days making PDAs for the business crowd , and as the saying goes , to truly understand where Palm is going with the Pre , you 've got to understand where they 've been .
So here 's a brief recap of software , devices and events leading up to the Pre / WebOS announcement .
Advertisement
Palm OS / Treo
Palm OS , the first major platform for the company was first designed for the Pilot line of PDAs back in 1996 .
The early Palm OS ( 1.x - 4.x ) releases had forward - thinking features such as stylus touch control , handwriting recognition , a grid - based app home screen ( adopted by most handset UI designers in the following years ) , eventually adding mobile internet support , mobile web clippings , email and USB support .
Handspring 's first Palm - based phone — the Treo — came out in 2002 .
It caught on among the smartphone crowd , with mainstream features such as high - res color displays , threaded text messaging , multimedia playback , homebrew apps such as NES emulators and arguably the worst mobile browser ever , Blazer .
Advertisement
In 2003 , Palm bought Handspring and launched the first Palm - branded Treo , the 600 .
Palm continued to build phones with QWERTY keyboard on the front , SD card slots , and cameras .
( Fun fact : Palm CEO Ed Colligan left the company , which he helped establish , in order to create Handspring ; he returned to Palm only when they bought Handspring in 2003 . )
The Palm Centro , launched in 2007 , was the last Palm device to run the Garnet OS ( v5.4.9 ) .
But by then the software — as well as the hardware — had begun to show signs of aging , prompting calls for a new OS and industrial design .
Palm OS II Announcement
In May 2007 , Palm announced they were working on a completely new , Linux - based operating system for their future phones , tentatively calling it Palm OS II .
No other details were given at the time .
Advertisement
Between Summer 2007 and Fall 2008 , Palm OS II was constantly pushed backed , delayed and ignored as Palm 's stock tumbled .
Many believed the company would disintegrate beyond repair before the OS would reach market .
Advertisement
Nova
In the fall of 2008 , Palm OS II rumors resurfaced , this time mentioning the platform carried the codename " Nova . "
Later news confirmed it would be revealed at CES 2008 .
Still , many remained skeptical as to how much of Nova Palm would show , if anything at all .
Advertisement
Shortly before CES , rumors started popping up about a Palm phone which would accompany the Nova OS .
The phone was said to be a squarish , touchscreen device with a slide - out keyboard .
Advertisement
CES Unveiling
On January 8 , 2009 , Palm announced the Pre smartphone and WebOS platform at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas to much fanfare .
Multitouch functionality and seamless web integration were the two big points of emphasis for their new product .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse and New York counterpart NYSE Euronext plan to merge into what would be the world ’s biggest exchange group , according to a German magazine report .
The report in weekly Der Spiegel , made available ahead of Monday ’s publication , comes two days before the German exchange group ’s supervisory board is scheduled to meet .
A combined entity would become the world ’s top securities and derivatives trading company , at a time of unprecedented turmoil for providers and users of financial market services .
NYSE Euronext runs the New York Stock Exchange -- the world ’s biggest by market cap of listed companies -- as well as the Paris , Amsterdam , Brussels and Lisbon bourses and derivatives platform Liffe .
Analysts said a merger could bring cost savings that would insulate the mammoth exchange operator from an expected drop in trading volume next year , and better position it to act as a central counterparty for over - the - counter products such as credit default swaps .
“ A merger would make sense .
They could trade more globally with more liquidity , ” said industry analyst Wolfgang Gerke .
HOLDING COMPANY
Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would set up a holding company in the Netherlands , which then would make a takeover offer to Deutsche Boerse shareholders , the magazine said .
In a next step , NYSE would merge with a U.S. unit of the Dutch entity , Der Spiegel said , citing as its source an “ internal paper ” that it said has been presented by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni to the group ’s management .
“ We have nothing to announce and , as a general policy , do not comment on speculation , ” Deutsche Boerse said in a statement .
It said it was “ constantly evaluating a multitude of options to enhance the value of the company .
This includes frequent contacts with almost every major market participant . ”
NYSE Euronext spokesman Rich Adamonis said the company had “ no comment on the Der Spiegel report . ”
Deutsche Boerse supervisory board member Johannes Witt told Reuters that the supervisory board had not been informed .
“ Francioni will have to answer some questions on Monday , that ’s for sure , ” Witt said by telephone .
In addition to the Frankfurt stock exchange , Deutsche Boerse operates derivatives exchange Eurex and settlement and custody house Clearstream .
The group ’s cash equities trading volumes and revenue have come under pressure due to the financial markets crisis and as a result of competition from rival trading platforms such as Chi-X , Turquoise and BATS .
Competition in clearing , where costs in Europe are higher than in the United States , is expected to intensify through U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ’s ( DTCC ) proposed $ 975 million takeover of European clearing house LCH .
Clearnet .
‘ OPERATIONAL NIGHTMARE ’
A deal with Deutsche Bourse would bring together the two top European contenders -- Eurex and Liffe -- for clearing credit default swaps , or CDS , the private OTC market often blamed for its roll in the current credit crisis .
European and U.S. regulators want a central counterparty for CDS , which are contracts that insure against the default of a debt issuer .
A merger would also create the largest U.S. options entity , combining the businesses of NYSE ’s Arca Options unit , its American Stock Exchange , as well as International Securities Exchange , which is owned by Eurex .
“ The problem is that any deal right now would be an operational nightmare , ” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy , analyst at Raymond James and Associates .
“ NYSE Euronext currently has its hands full integrating and upgrading its European and North American technologies , and adding another level of integration to the mix would be a very difficult task . ”
DEPRESSED SHARES
Shares in NYSE Euronext have fallen 75 percent this year .
Deutsche Boerse ’s shares have fallen 63 percent .
The FTSE / Mondo Visione Exchanges Index .
FTMV > is down just over 70 percent .
Activist investment funds TCI and Atticus , which together own almost 20 percent of Deutsche Boerse , have called on the German company to take action to boost shareholder value .
In 2006 , NYSE and Deutsche Boerse both bid for Euronext , with NYSE pipping the German company to the post .
The battle for Euronext came after Deutsche Boerse had failed to take over the London Stock Exchange , Europe ’s top stock market , after a shareholder rebellion that cost both the German group ’s then chairman and chief executive their jobs .
Der Spiegel said Francioni was to become chairman of the new company , while his counterpart at NYSE Euronext , Duncan Niederauer , would become chief executive .

Breaking news on Friday 's Countdown .
Senator Barack Obama 's campaign has written a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey asking for an investigation into improper leaks from DOJ officials involving their ACORN investigation and whether or not people within the DOJ , perhaps with the help of the White House , are working in concert with the McCain campaign to further the ACORN myth for his political advantage .
Keith Olbermann talked with an Obama campaign attorney about this brilliant strategy by the campaign -- they are linking the ACORN / DOJ scandal with the U.S. Attorney firing scandal .
If you will recall , several of the improperly fired attorneys were let go primarily because they would n't play along with Rove / GOP demands that they prosecute bogus voter fraud cases .
We 're working on video and will post it as soon asap .
Mr Burris ( L ) ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 1984 Barack Obama says he agrees with Senate Democrats that they should not accept the man chosen by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to replace him as senator .
Mr Blagojevich is the subject of a criminal inquiry and has been charged with attempting to " sell " Mr Obama 's now - vacant seat to the highest bidder .
The governor defied pressure and picked Roland Burris , the state 's former attorney general , to fill the position .
The controversy is set to hang over the Senate when it convenes on 6 January .
Democratic senators have vowed to veto anyone appointed by Mr Blagojevich .
The president - elect said he agreed the Senate " cannot accept " a new senator chosen by Mr Blagojevich , adding that Mr Blagojevich himself should resign .
Mr Blagojevich , himself a Democrat , denies wrongdoing and has rejected calls for his resignation .
' Fine public servant '
Mr Burris , 71 , became the first African - American to be elected to statewide office in Illinois when he won the 1978 election to be state comptroller .
The Senate Democrats made it clear weeks ago that they cannot accept an appointment made by a governor who is accused of selling this very Senate seat
Barack Obama
He was state attorney general from 1991 to 1995 and made unsuccessful bids for the US Senate and the Illinois governorship , including in 2002 , when he lost in the Democratic primary to Mr Blagojevich .
" Roland Burris is a good man and a fine public servant , " said Mr Obama .
" But the Senate Democrats made it clear weeks ago that they cannot accept an appointment made by a governor who is accused of selling this very Senate seat .
I agree with their decision . "
Appearing with Mr Burris to announce his choice , Mr Blagojevich said : " Please do n't allow the allegations against me to taint a good and honest man . "
But Harry Reid , the leader of the Democrats in the Senate was not impressed .
" It is truly regrettable that ...
Governor Blagojevich would take the imprudent step of appointing someone to the United States Senate who would serve under a shadow and be plagued by questions of impropriety , " said Mr Reid .
" Anyone appointed by Governor Blagojevich cannot be an effective representative of the people of Illinois and ... will not be seated by the Democratic Caucus . "
However comments by Illinois Representative Bobby Rush indicated that charges of racism may hang over the Senate if it does not allow Mr Burris to take his seat .
" There are no African - Americans in the Senate .
And I do n't think anyone , any US senator who 's sitting in the Senate right now , wants to go on record to deny one African - American from being seated in the US Senate , " Mr Rush said .
The Constitution gives the Senate wide powers to determine who can be seated in the chamber , but the authority is not absolute .
In 1969 , the Supreme Court ruled that the House of Representatives had acted unconstitutionally when it excluded a congressman , Adam Clayton Powell , who had been accused of financial impropriety .
Adding to the complications , the Illinois Secretary of State , Jesse White , has said he will refuse to certify the paperwork Mr Blagojevich must present to the Senate regarding Mr Burris 's appointment .
' Pay - to - play ' deals
An internal review conducted by the Obama team concluded last week that neither the president - elect , nor his staff , had had any " inappropriate discussions " with Mr Blagojevich about who should fill the seat .
Mr Blagojevich has vowed to " fight the false accusations " made by what he has termed a " political lynch mob " .
CHARGES AGAINST BLAGOJEVICH
Federal agents say Mr Blagojevich : Tried to obtain campaign contributions in exchange for official actions
Tried to use state funds for the private purpose of inducing the Tribune Company to fire Chicago Tribune editorial board members critical of him Tried to obtain personal financial benefits for himself in return for his appointment of a US senator
Profile : Rod Blagojevich
The Illinois state legislature has formed a committee to investigate the possibility of impeaching Mr Blagojevich .
There have been calls from many politicians , including Mr Obama , for the governor to step down .
He was charged on 9 December with a number of offences including soliciting a bribe .
The charges relate to a variety of corruption schemes in which the governor was allegedly involved , including so - called " pay to play " deals - the doling out of jobs , contracts and appointments in return for campaign contributions .
On the day of his arrest , investigators released transcripts of conversations between Mr Blagojevich and others intercepted by court - authorised wiretaps .
In the conversations , the Democratic governor allegedly discussed offering Mr Obama 's Senate seat in return for a well - paid position at a non-profit organisation or a group affiliated with trades unions , according to the affidavit .

About a month ago , Google dropped StarOffice from the Google Pack , a downloadable package of free Internet and productivity software for Windows users .
StarOffice is a desktop office suite based on the open source OpenOffice.org program and distribute by Sun , and we theorized that Google was laying the ground work for a future push to get users to dump their desktop software in favor of Google ’s own web - based application offerings .
“ If pushing people toward their own suite of tools is what Google is playing it , we expect that there is a possibility that we ’ll see Firefox dropped from the Google Pack eventually as well and replaced with Chrome ( at least once that browser is out of beta ) , ” we predicted .
That prediction has almost come true .
Google removed the beta label from their Chrome web browser last week , and now , they ’ve demoted Firefox in the Pack .
They have n’t outright removed the web ’s # 2 browser — which makes sense because the integrated Google Toolbar and their status as the default search engine in Firefox is worth tens of millions of dollars each year — but they have pushed Firefox aside in favor of Chrome .
Above :
The default software checked as part of the Google Pack download no longer includes Firefox .
Firefox used to be the default , recommended browser in the Google Pack , but over the weekend , Google - watching blogger Garett Rogers noticed that Google replaced Firefox with Chrome as the default download .
Firefox is still technically part of the pack , but it is unchecked by default and its description has been pushed way down the information page .
It makes sense for Google to push people toward Chrome because it is built specifically for running web applications .
The more people using Chrome , the better the user experience for those people running Google brand web applications like Gmail , Reader , Docs and Spreadsheets , and others .
As we ’ve noted , Chrome is an important part of Google ’s three - pronged Web OS strategy .
Along with Gears ( offline data store ) and Native Client ( local CPU resources for web apps ) , Chrome gives Google a compelling platform for the delivery of web applications .
Google needs to push more people onto Chrome in order to legitimately have a shot at winning the Web OS war that is brewing between them and companies like Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and to a lesser extent Facebook .

About the Author Walt Brown received a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , where he was a National Science Foundation Fellow .
He has taught college courses in physics , mathematics , and computer science .
Brown is a retired Air Force full colonel , West Point graduate , and former Army Ranger and paratrooper .
Assignments during his 21 years of military service included : Director of Benét Laboratories ( a major research , development , and engineering facility ) ; tenured associate professor at the U.S. Air Force Academy ; and Chief of Science and Technology Studies at the Air War College .
For much of his life Walt Brown was an evolutionist , but after years of study , he became convinced of the scientific validity of creation and a global flood .
Since retiring from the military , Dr. Brown has been the Director of the Center for Scientific Creation and has worked full time in research , writing , and teaching on creation and the flood .
For those who wish to know more about Walt Brown , a new book ( Christian Men of Science : Eleven Men Who Changed the World by George Mulfinger and Julia Mulfinger Orozco ) devotes a chapter to Brown .

Written Debate
The issue is : Does the scientific evidence favor creation or evolution ?
Dr. Brown ’s standing offer for a strictly scientific , written , and publishable debate is on page 570 .
Note that a few initially agreed to a strictly scientific debate , but later changed their minds , insisting they would only take part if the exchange included religion .
One evolutionist is so upset that a written debate will not include religion that he now misleads by saying that Walt Brown has refused to debate him .
( Correspondence in our files shows how he no longer wanted a strictly scientific debate after reading the 6th edition of this book . )
Dr. Brown has consistently maintained his position for 31 years : the debate should be limited to scientific evidence .
If someone says , “ Walt Brown has refused to debate , ” we suggest you ask to see that person ’s signed debate agreement .
Oral and Written Refereed Exchange
For anyone who disagrees with the hydroplate theory ( explained in Part II of this book ) , the refereed exchange is appropriate .
Anyone , regardless of their scientific credentials , can engage Dr. Brown , provided they have read the theory .

A legally blind Massachusetts phone hacker admitted this week to federal computer intrusion and witness intimidation charges that could put him away for as long as 13 years .
Matthew Weigman , 18 , pleaded guilty to two felonies before U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul D. Stickney in Dallas on Tuesday .
Known in the telephone party - line scene as " Li’l Hacker , " Weigman is widely considered one of the best phone hackers alive .
Relying on an ironclad memory and detailed knowledge of the phone system , the teenager is known for using social engineering to manipulate phone company workers and others into divulging confidential information , and into entering commands into computers and telephone switching equipment on his behalf .
The FBI had been chasing Weigman since he was 15 years old , at times courting him as an informant .
He was finally arrested last May , less than two months after celebrating his 18th birthday .
" I ’ve been interested in phones since I ’ve been about 8 , " Weigman said in a 2007 interview with Wired.com .
" I talked to technicians when they came down here to do things on my phone . "
" I will shoot . " Listen to the Colorado Springs hostage hoax .
Disconnecting a phone .
Audio of Matthew Weigman at work .
In his plea deal with prosecutors , Weigman , who was born blind , admitted to a long criminal resume ( .pdf ) .
Among other things , he confessed to conspiring with other telephone hooligans who made hundreds of false calls to police that sent armed SWAT teams bursting into the homes of their party - line enemies .
In a new revelation , Weigman also admitted eavesdropping on customer service calls to Sprint , by dialing into a phone line used by Sprint supervisors to monitor their employees .
Weigman parked on the spy line to overhear customers giving out their credit card numbers , which he memorized and passed to accomplices .
Weigman and his friends used the numbers to purchase computers and other electronics .
The FBI began investigating Weigman after he staged a 2005 hostage hoax that sent police to the Colorado home of Richard Gasper , a TSA screener whose daughter refused phone sex with Weigman .
When the FBI caught up with him more than a year later , cybercrime agent Allyn Lynd offered to make him a confidential informant , but called off the deal when AT&T discovered that Weigman was still manipulating the phone company .
Lynd later told a police detective that Weigman could n’t stop hacking for more than 72 hours .
Weigman ’s current troubles began in April , the month he reached adulthood .
William Smith , a Verizon security investigator who ’d been monitoring Weigman ’s hacking and phoning in updates to the FBI , noticed that Weigman had used the name and identifying information of a Texas woman to turn on phone service at the East Boston apartment he shared with his mother and siblings .
When Smith disconnected the fraudulent account , Weigman turned it back on again .
Then Weigman began making harassing phone calls to Smith at his house .
To trick the security worker into picking up the phone , the hacker socially engineered phone company employees into sharing Smith ’s billing records in near - real time , then used Caller ID spoofing to make Smith think someone was returning his own calls , according to court records .
" For example , Smith would call a travel agency to arrange for a flight , " the FBI ’s Lynd wrote in an affidavit .
" A few minutes later , he would receive a phone call which appeared to be coming from the travel agency that he had just booked a flight through .
When Smith answered the phone , Weigman would begin harassing him again . "
Then on May 18 , Weigman showed up at Smith ’s New Hampshire home with his burly older brother .
Smith felt intimidated and called the police , who arrested the hacker .
Weigman is set for sentencing on April 24 .
Under the terms of his plea agreement , he can withdraw his guilty plea if sentencing judge
Barbara M. G. Lynn gives him more than 13 years in prison .

US data yesterday showed that Producer prices dropped - 1.9 % , m / m in Dec .
This was very much in line with expectations and was the first y/y decline since Oct. 2006 .
All this was made possible by weaker commodity and food prices and reduced pricing power .
Gas prices plummeted - 25.7 % , m / m , the 3rd consecutive monthly decline , while energy dropped - 9.3 % along with food ( - 1.5 % ) and consumer goods ( - 2.6 % ) .
Excluding energy , producer prices retreated by a modest - 0.2 % , m / m .
It is also interesting to note that prices also continued to moderate at the intermediate and crude stage of processing .
This would suggest that prices for finished goods are not being pressured by pipeline gains .
A pleasant surprise was that the Philadelphia Fed index improved more than expected this month but continues to show that the manufacturing sector contracted for the 13th consecutive month .

January NFP is looking horrible so far !
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that the future activity index rebounded from - 10.4 to - 7.4 , as businesses expected new orders and shipments to start to grow in 6 - months .
However , the rest of the components remained negative , with the number of employees weakening even further .

Demand destruction remains the order of the day .
Crude prices once again come under renewed pressure as OPEC said that demand for its black - stuff will decline - 4.2 % this year as the recession in the US , Europe and Japan curbs fuel consumption .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expected that consumption of OPECÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oil will shrink - 1.4 m barrels a day to +29.5 m barrels .
This weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report has ended up being more of a hindrance than an aid for crude prices .
The data showed that crude stockpiles climbed to a 16 - month high as fuel demand continues to deteriorate .
Crude stocks increased + 1.14 m barrels to +326.6 m last week , the highest since August 2007 .
Fuel demand has dropped 6 % to an average +18.6 m barrels a day , surprisingly the largest 1 - week decline in 5 - years .
Gas inventories rose +2.07 m barrels to +213.5 m , higher than the anticipated + 1.85 m expected .
On the other hand supplies of distillate fuels ( includes heating oil and diesel ) surged +6.35 m barrels to +144.2 m , the biggest gain again in 5 - years .
The disappointing US data this week has not helped either , the data solidified global concerns that fuel demand will decline even further because of the global recession .

The DAX index in Europe was at 4,444 up +107 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,200 up +80 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields backed up 7 bp yesterday ( 2.23 % ) and a further 7 bp O/N ( 2.30 % ) .
Treasuries pared some of this weeks gain after US economic data yesterday did not sway too far from market consensus .
But , with global equities and specifically financial stocks remaining under pressure should provide better buying of the FI market on deeper pullbacks .

Looking for something sufficiently spooky or terrifying to tantalize and frighten the players at your next game or RPG match ?
Perhaps you 've come looking for that delightfully ghoulish plot twist to inspire you for that next tromp through the cthonic darkness of a haunted graveyard ?
Look no further than here , child of the night .
Even if your game is n't dark , frightening , or even horror in slant , you might find something delicious here you can twist , or that might give you just the push you need to come up with the ultimate adventure !
1. The Priest
The characters meet a priest with a tarped - over wagon and a thin - looking horse in a dark and misty ( and unusually spooky ) area , like an alleyway or a lonely avenue .
He tries to gain their trust ( either because he 's afraid about being out in this spooky place all alone , or because of some much more ... insidious reason . ) and may even offer to trade with them ( he keeps the wagon covered to hide what 's inside , reaching under the tarp , maybe beating something back that moves ... etc. )
You can do a lot of things with this guy — he could just be a poor , simple priest with some goods on his way to a distant monastery , or he could be a lot shadier - maybe he's a vampire or a psychopath or a demonic conjurer with a wagon full of evil minions , demons , zombies , goblins , dismembered corpses , or worse ... maybe the equipment he has to trade is cursed , or coated with poison .
Maybe the wagon is actually the focal point for a gateway to the nine hells ... abyss is the limit !
2. Close to Home
The characters are having a moment of cheer or are celebrating their victory over some powerful undead or demonic foe when a little boy or someone the characters know bursts into the room and shouts that there 's been an attack , begging for the PCs to come quickly .
As they follow the NPC , have them realize , slowly , that they 're getting closer and closer to someplace familiar , someplace where someone close to at least one of the characters ( like a parent , a spouse , a wise sage , etc. ) lives .
When the NPC goes sprinting through the broken - down door of the house where this close - to - the - characters person lives , it hits them .
Make the scene grisly , blood splashed up the walls , soaking curtains , dripping from bony , gristly bits embedded in the ceiling .
There 's nothing left that can be identifiable , except maybe an item , like a ring or something that the characters recognize ( It 's up to the DM whether the person is actually dead or just elsewhere ) and maybe a note scrawled in blood that says something like " You 're next , so - and - so " with one of the character 's names written in .
Make it really clear that whatever did this was powerful , and probably very pissed off .
3. The Other Wife
The characters are called in to handle a hostage situation of an otherworldly nature .
Seems a man and his second wife are being held hostage by the undead corpse of his first wife .
Her demands ?
That his marriage to the new woman be nullified and her marriage be renewed .
If her demands are met , she kills the husband , and then rushes the characters , yelling : " I 'll be with you soon , sweet baby ! "
4. The Dealer
Several townsfolk have started looking healthier suddenly , are suddenly much more active , and one or two even begin to perform superhuman feats , but when one of them is found insane , undead , and rotting , questions begin to fly .
The characters are asked to check things out .
( Either by a contact as a paid assignment , or by a friend who is a relative of the undead person , etc .
The culprit is a creature of the night ( demon , conjurer , vampire , warlock , etc. ) dealing a drug known as " Orange " or " Cetracetaline " that comes in snortable amber - colored crystals .
It restores youth and vigor , but is highly addictive and comes at a really high cost per dose .
The dealer makes it by distilling souls through his magically steel - augmented arm , and runs a tab for each client .
If a client can't pay , he distills them into his next dose of " Orange . "
5 . The House That Maw Built
The characters are sent to check out a haunted house in some dark and spooky end of town .
( Like on a misty hilltop , or in the fields , etc . )
It " sleeps " during the day , so must be investigated at night if the characters expect to get anywhere with it .
On the whole , it looks like a perfectly ordinary house , very normal and contemporary for the period in which the characters live ( log cabins or stucco - whatever 's normal , etc. ) and will even let the characters walk inside if they dare .
But the house is n't ordinary , and it 's very smart about not letting on about it .
One by one it will try to pick off the characters , preferring to strike at them one at a time by transmuting a piece of furniture into a tendril or something of that nature .
Being inside the house is basically like being in the beast 's mouth , and so once it grabs someone , it 'll suck them through the floor or a wall and start to digest them .
It works like a great big mimic , and if it gets injured enough , it gets pissed , half reverts to it 's actual form , ( becoming a house with big talons and teeth and a demonic - looking maw that sticks out ) and chases the characters .
If they kill it in time , characters who were " eaten " , including anyone else who disappeared before they investigated it , can probably be rescued , if they 're still alive .
( You might also consider letting characters cut " eaten " characters right out of the wall if they can . )
6. An Unholy Situation
A Darkly - hooded man appears ahead of the characters as the mists swirl away .
He does not talk , but stands with his hands together ( in the sleeves ) and his head downward .
If the Party moves in the other direction , the mists swirl and he disappears , but if they stay still or move toward him , he remains .
After a moment , more of these darkly hooded men will appear from the mists , forming a circle around the party ( at a distance ) followed by more and more , until there are roughly 40 - 100 acolytes walking toward them , slowly .
None are armed , but four are carrying censors that exude a strange musky incense , and after a moment , strange dark chanting can be heard .
They try to get close enough to touch the party , as they are all inhumanly strong , and they aim to overwhelm the characters with sheer brute strength .
They have incredible morale , and will not deviate even if slain .
If they overwhelm the characters , a rope is brought , the characters are tied , and knocked unconscious , then brought to a strange , unholy temple , where they will attempt to sacrifice the characters to the avatar of an evil god .
How the characters get out of this one might take some trickiness .
Could be a chance to humble a really successful party of adventurers by putting them at the brink of death ( maybe letting one or two get the blade , if you feel like being mean - really gets the suspense going ) before someone new ( or maybe a rival character that works in the same field ) finally comes to rescue them .
7. Sanctuary ...
Or Not
The characters come across a small marble church with a high steeple .
The church appears ordinary , and is manned by four silent friars ( secretly undead - think heucuva or something similar ) and a fat priest who is a different kind of undead ( probably something suave , like a vampire . )
If at any time , the party moves away ( not looking at the church ) it will dissipate into the mists and vanish .
( Maybe bringing it back down the line would be eerie ) fat priest waits at the door , and he looks tubby , acts non-threatening and cordial , welcoming the party inside for rest , food , healing , etc. all free of charge .
Inside , the church is dark and lit only by candlelight .
In every pew sit parishioners , Each a corpse carefully disguised and maintained to appear alive ( with eyes closed ) .
Inside , the four healthy - looking , equally non-threatening friars mill about , quietly " checking " on the people in the pews , but will not talk to the party , only nod and walk away .
The fat priest , however , will inform them ( if they try to talk to anyone except him ) that today is a high holy day , and the parishioners therefore wait in silent meditation .
The five undead will wait for the party to fall asleep before they attack ( unless the party tries to leave , at which point they attack . )
If the party sticks around long enough to be fed , they are given a thick , meaty stew and a thick , syrupy red wine ( which are heavily drugged . )
8. The Rescue
The characters come across a woman in hysterics , yelling " Help !
Save my daughter !
Please ! "
There are a lot of ways you could go with this - it could be genuine , a mother unable to save her lovely and helpless maiden of a daughter from something big and horrible that the characters are more than capable of slaying , ( insert your favorite lurking monster here ) or it could be a trick .
Maybe when the characters get close enough , the woman 's head flies off and latches onto one of them with big nasty fangs that do damage , drain blood , and maybe poison or infect - maybe when they run past her , they find nothing , and she mutates into something huge and bulbous and starts to attack the characters .
Or maybe it 's the daughter who 's the monster and the mother is just an illusion - maybe when they find the daughter , she 's sunken up to her chest in the dirt / heath / etc .
And when they go to pull her out , she reveals her true form as a giant naga or something nastier that uses the proximity of the characters to her advantage , making it easier for her to snag them and drag them under .
9 . The Toymaker
The party comes across a merchant 's wagon on it's side , the driver 's corpse is half - crushed beneath it , and the exposed flesh has been chewed on and eaten .
It appears he was a toymaker , as his wagon is filled with 2d20 porcelain dolls of a variety of different appearances , as well as a small chest full of long stitching needles and string .
( In truth , he was an insane necromancer who was planning a devious operation with his doll golems . )
If the party takes any of the dolls , they wait until the party gets into a battle , then they break out , grabbing anything sharp ( and small ) they can to use as a weapon and start attacking the party .
It does n't take long before the rest of their brethren ( if any are left at the wagon ) charge into the fight as well , armed with stitching needles and carrying enough extra for those without weapons .
If the party does n't take any of the dolls , they wait and attack later ( i.e. the reinforcements become the entire army . )
Feel free to get creative with the dolls - maybe some of them throw the sewing needles like javelins , maybe others have fashioned crude bows and are using the needles like arrows .
The more versatile these things are , the more terrifying they become .
10 . Scorched Earth
The Characters come across a patch of ground burnt in a perfect circle about 50 ft. in diameter , in the center of which is a pair of burnt leather boots and the remains of a stout leather belt .
( In a harsh , violent battle for survival against a some powerful evil , a Transcendent or similar type of character burned himself out .
This created a revenant - like spirit which is waiting beneath the heath for someone to inspect , touch , or take the boots . )
As soon as a character is close enough , an ethereal hand seizes him / her and pulls them beneath the heath where he will attempt to transmit his essence into them ( possession . )
If successful , he tries to act like the original person and tries to get the players to rescue him .
He makes up a story about a weird ghost grabbing him and letting him go , and waits until the party goes to sleep and then runs off in the night , taking as much of their gear as he can carry with him as he goes .
Ultimately , his goal is to prepare himself for a battle with the same powerful evil that defeated him last time , and he will stop at nothing until it is dead and gone .
11 . " Run Away ! Run Away ! "
Or " We 're Gonna Need a Bigger Gun . "
Throw something ridiculously massive at the characters , something of Lovecraftian proportions , like an elder Cthulu god or an immortal vampire lord or a town - spanning poltergeist effect .
Something that makes people think the end - times are upon them .
It should become very clear to the characters that they can't lick this thing as they are , and if they do n't lay low , it will hunt down and kill them all ruthlessly .
It 's the classic " hunters become the hunted " routine , but with a twist - looking around long enough will reveal a way for the characters to blow this thing out of the water and save the world .
It can be an invention , a machine or weapon that this thing is n't immune to , but that will take a lot of work and a real long shot to beat this thing with .
Or maybe it's an old friend ( or better - old enemy ) that they have to track down and convince to help them .
Either way , there 's one way , and it's a long , long shot .
Add corpses and close calls and dead characters to taste- make this one feel real .

A Chevron tanker truck unloads gasoline into underground storage tanks in Burbank , Calfiornia , June 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
QUITO ( Reuters ) -
An environmental expert told a court in Ecuador that oil company Chevron Corp should pay $ 27 billion in compensation for environmental damage in the country , the company said on Wednesday .
Chevron said in a statement that it rejected geologist Richard Cabrera ’s revised damage estimate by saying his work “ contains fabricated and erroneous evidence . ”
In April , Cabrera recommended to the court that the U.S. oil company should pay up to $ 16 billion in damages .
The lawsuit , which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought in the early 1990s , contends that Texaco , which Chevron bought in 2001 , polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons ( 68 billion liters ) of contaminated water from 1972 to 1992 .
Chevron questioned Cabrera ’s independence and charges the plaintiffs of helping him produce his damage assessment .
“ Cabrera ’s work was monitored , supported , and conducted by the plaintiffs .
They paid more than $ 200,000 to fund his ‘ independent ’ findings , ” Chevron said in the statement . “
One of plaintiffs ’ attorneys Steven Donziger denied helping Cabrera produce the report and said Chevron is trying to undermine the expert ’s findings to reject any eventual negative court ruling .
“ The party that asks for the technical work has to pay for it .
Chevron partially payed for Cabrera ’s work in a previous part of the case , ” Donziger told Reuters .
“ We had to fund his ( Cabrera ) budget because we were the only ones asking for the overall assessment .

Libertarian Feminism : Can This Marriage Be Saved ?
An earlier , abbreviated version was presented as remarks for the inaugural symposium of the Molinari Society , at the American Philosophical Association Eastern Division meeting , on 27 December 2004 .
I ask no favors for my sex .
I surrender not our claim to equality .
All I ask of our brethren is , that they will take their feet from off our necks and permit us to stand upright on the ground which God designed us to occupy — Sarah Moore Grimké , Letters on the Equality of the Sexes
There is not a feminist alive who could possibly look to the male legal system for real protection from the systemized sadism of men .
Women fight to reform male law , in the areas of rape and battery for instance , because something is better than nothing .
In general , we fight to force the law to recognize us as the victims of the crimes committed against us , but the results so far have been paltry and pathetic .
— Andrea Dworkin , Letters from a War Zone
§ 1 Let ’s start with what this essay will do , and what it will not .
We are both convinced of , and this essay will take more or less for granted , that the political traditions of libertarianism and feminism are both in the main correct , insightful , and of the first importance in any struggle to build a just , free , and compassionate society .
We do not intend to try to justify the import of either tradition on the other ’s terms , nor prove the correctness or insightfulness of the non-aggression principle , the libertarian critique of state coercion , the reality and pervasiveness of male violence and discrimination against women , or the feminist critique of patriarchy .
Those are important conversations to have , but we wo n’t have them here ; they are better found in the foundational works that have already been written within the feminist and libertarian traditions .
The aim here is not to set down doctrine or refute heresy ; it ’s to get clear on how to reconcile commitments to both libertarianism and feminism — although in reconciling them we may remove some of the reasons that people have had for resisting libertarian or feminist conclusions .
Libertarianism and feminism , when they have encountered each other , have most often taken each other for polar opposites .
Many 20th century libertarians have dismissed or attacked feminism — when they have addressed it at all — as just another wing of Left - wing statism ; many feminists have dismissed or attacked libertarianism — when they have addressed it at all — as either Angry White Male reaction or an extreme faction of the ideology of the liberal capitalist state .
But we hold that both judgments are unjust ; many of the problems in combining libertarianism with feminism turn out to be little more than terminological conflicts that arose from shifting political alliances in the course of the 20th century ; and most if not all of the substantive disagreements can be negotiated within positions already clearly established within the feminist and libertarian traditions .
What we hope to do , then , is not to present the case for libertarianism and for feminism , but rather to clear the ground a bit so that libertarianism and feminism can recognize the important insights that each has to offer the other , and can work together on terms that allow each to do their work without slighting either .
We are not the first to cover this ground .
Contemporary libertarian feminists such as Joan Kennedy Taylor and Wendy McElroy have written extensively on the relationship between libertarianism and feminism , and they have worked within the libertarian movement to encourage appeals to feminist concerns and engagement with feminist efforts .
But as valuable as the 20th century libertarian feminists ’ scholarship has been , we find many elements of the “ libertarian feminism ” they propose to be both limited and limiting ; the conceptual framework behind their synthesis all too often marginalizes or ignores large and essential parts of the feminist critique of patriarchy , and as a result they all too often keep really existing feminist efforts at arm ’s length , and counsel indifference or sharply criticize activism on key feminist issues .
In the marriage that they propose , libertarianism and feminism are one , and that one is libertarianism ; we , on the other hand , aver that if counseling cannot help libertarianism form a more respectful union , then we could hardly blame feminists for dumping it .
But we think that there is a better path forward .
McElroy and others have rightly called attention to a tradition of libertarian feminism that mostly been forgotten by both libertarians and feminists in the 20th century : the 19th century radical individualists , including Voltairine de Cleyre , Angela Heywood , Herbert Spencer , and Benjamin Tucker , among others .
The individualists endorsed both radical anti-statism and also radical feminism ( as well as , inter alia , allying with abolitionism and the labor movement ) , because they understood both statism and patriarchy as components of an interlocking system of oppression .
An examination of the methods and thought of these individualists — and of Second Wave feminism in light of the individualist tradition — does show what McElroy and Taylor have argued it does — but in a way very different from what they might have expected , and — we argue — with very different implications for the terms on which libertarianism and feminism can work together .
§2 The parallels between libertarian and feminist insights are striking .
“ The state is male in the feminist sense , ” MacKinnon argues , in that “ the law sees and treats women the way men see and treat women ” ( MacKinnon 1989 , Chapter 8 ¶ 11 ) .
The libertarian completion of this thought is that the state sees and treats everybody — though not in equal degree — the way men see and treat women .
The ideal of a woman ’s willing surrender to a benevolent male protector both feeds and is fed by the ideal of the citizenry ’s willing surrender to a benevolent governmental protector .
“ We are not among wild beasts ; from whom , then , does woman need protection ?
From her protectors , ” Ezra Heywood remarked ( McElroy 1991 , p. 227 ) ; in the same way , libertarians have often described the state as an entity that protects people primarily from harms caused or exacerbated by the state in the first place .
Just as , under patriarchy , forced sex is not recognized as real or fully serious rape unless the perpetrator is a stranger rather than one ’s husband or boyfriend , so , under statism , governmental coercion is not recognized as real or fully serious tyranny unless it happens under a non-democratic government , a “ dictatorship . ”
The marriage vow , as a rape license , has its parallel in the electoral ballot , as a tyranny license .
Those who seek to withhold consent from their country ’s governmental apparatus altogether get asked the same question that battered women get asked : “ If you do n’t like it , why do n’t you leave ? ” — the man ’s rightful jurisdiction over the home , and the state ’s over the country , being taken for granted .
It ’s always the woman , not the abusive man , who needs to vacate the home ( to go where ? ) ; it ’s likewise the citizen , not the abusive state , that needs to vacate the territory ( to go where ? ) .
Despite these parallels , however , many libertarians — libertarian feminists definitely included — seems surprisingly unsympathetic to most of what feminists have to say .
( And vice versa , of course , but the vice versa is not our present topic . )
When feminists say that gender and sexuality are socially constructed , libertarians often dismiss this as metaphysical subjectivism or nihilism .
But libertarians do not call their own Friedrich Hayek a subjectivist or nihilist when he says that “ the objects of economic activity , ” such as “ a ‘ commodity ’ or an ‘ economic good , ’ nor ‘ food ’ or ‘ money , ’ ” cannot be “ defined in objective terms ” [ CRS I. 3 ] , and more broadly that “ tools , medicine , weapons , words , sentences , communications , and acts of production , ” and generally all the “ objects of human activity which constantly occur in the social sciences , ” are not such in virtue of “ some objective properties possessed by the things , or which the observer can find out about them ” [ IEO III .
2 ] , but instead are “ defined in terms of human attitudes toward them . ” [ IEO II .
9 ] Libertarians are often unimpressed by feminist worries about social norms that disable anything a woman says from counting as declining consent to sexual access , but they are indignant at theories of tacit or hypothetical consent that disable anything a citizen says from counting as declining consent to governmental authority .
Libertarians often conclude that gender roles must not be oppressive since many women accept them ; but they do not analogously treat the fact that most citizens accept the legitimacy of governmental compulsion as a reason to question its oppressive character ; on the contrary , they see their task as one of consciousness - raising and demystification , or , in the Marxian phrase , plucking the flowers from the chains to expose their character as chains .
When radical feminists say that male supremacy rests in large part on the fact of rape — as when Susan Brownmiller characterizes rape as “ a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear ” ( Against Our Will , p. 15 ) — libertarians often dismiss this on the grounds that not all men are literal rapists and not all women are literally raped .
But when their own Ludwig von Mises says that “ government interference always means either violent action or the threat of such action , ” that it rests “ in the last resort ” on “ the employment of armed men , of policemen , gendarmes , soldiers , prison guards , and hangmen , ” and that its “ essential feature ” is “ the enforcement of its decrees by beating , killing , and imprisoning ” [ HA VI.27.2 ] , libertarians applaud this as a welcome demystification of the state .
Libertarians rightly recognize that legally enacted violence is the means by which all rulers keep all citizens in a state of fear , even though not all government functionaries personally beat , kill , or imprison anybody , and even though not all citizens are beaten , killed , or imprisoned ; the same interpretive charity towards the radical feminist analysis of rape is not too much to ask .
Brownmiller ’s and other feminists ’ insights into the pervasiveness of battery , incest , and other forms of male violence against women , present both a crisis and an opportunity for libertarians .
Libertarianism professes to be a comprehensive theory of human freedom ; what is supposed to be distinctive about the libertarian theory of justice is that we concern ourselves with violent coercion no matter who is practicing it — even if he has a government uniform on .
But what feminists have forced into the public eye in the last 30 years is that , in a society where one out of every four women faces rape or battery by an intimate partner , and where women are threatened or attacked by men who profess to love them , because the men who attack them believe that being a man means you have the authority to control women , male violence against women is nominally illegal but nevertheless systematic , motivated by the desire for control , culturally excused , and hideously ordinary .
For libertarians , this should sound eerily familiar ; confronting the full reality of male violence means nothing less than recognizing the existence of a violent political order working alongside , and independently of , the violent political order of statism .
As radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon writes , “ Unlike the ways in which men systematically enslave , violate , dehumanize , and exterminate other men , expressing political inequalities among men , men ’s forms of dominance over women have been accomplished socially as well as economically , prior to the operation of the law , without express state acts , often in intimate contexts , as everyday life ” ( 1989 , p. 161 ) .
Male supremacy has its own ideological rationalizations , its own propaganda , its own expropriation , and its own violent enforcement ; although it is often in league with the male - dominated state , male violence is older , more invasive , closer to home , and harder to escape than most forms of statism .
This means that libertarians who are serious about ending all forms of political violence need to fight , at least , a two - front war , against both statism and male supremacy ; an adequate discussion of what this insight means for libertarian politics requires much more time than we have here .
But it is important to note how the writings of some libertarians on the family — especially those who identify with the “ paleolibertarian ” political and cultural project — have amounted to little more than outright denial of male violence .
Hans Hermann
Hoppe , for example , goes so far as to indulge in the conservative fantasy that the traditional “ internal layers and ranks of authority ” in the family are actually bulwarks of “ resistance vis-a - vis the state ” ( Secession , the State , and the Immigration Problem § IV ) .
The “ ranks of authority ” in the family , of course , means the pater familias , and whether father - right is , at a given moment in history , mostly in league with or somewhat at odds with state prerogatives , the fact that it is so widely enforced by the threat or practice of male violence means that trying to enlist it in the struggle against statism is much like enlisting Stalin in order to fight Hitler — no matter who wins , we all lose .
Some of libertarians ’ sharpest jabs at feminism have been directed against feminist criticisms of sexual harassment , misogynist pornography , or sadomasochism .
Feminists in particular are targeted as the leading crusaders for “ political correctness ” , and characterized as killjoys , censors , or man-haters for criticising speech or consensual sex acts in which women are denigrated or dominated ; it is apparently claimed that since the harassment or the portrayal does n’t ( directly ) involve violence , there are n’t any grounds for taking political exception to it .
But the popularity in libertarian circles of Ayn Rand ’s novel The Fountainhead ( a deeply problematic novel from a feminist standpoint , but instructive on the present point ) indicates that libertarians know better when it comes to , say , conformity and collectivism .
Although its political implications are fairly clear , The Fountainhead pays relatively little attention to governmental oppression per se ; its main focus is on social pressures that encourage conformity and penalize independence .
Rand traces how such pressures operate through predominantly non-governmental and ( in the libertarian sense ) non-coercive means , in the business world , the media , and society generally .
Some of the novel ’s characters give in , swiftly or slowly , and sell their souls for social advancement ; others resist but end up marginalized , impoverished , and psychologically debilitated as a result .
Only the novel ’s hero succeeds , eventually , in achieving worldly success without sacrificing his integrity — but only after a painful and superhuman struggle .
It would be hard to imagine libertarians describing fans of The Fountainhead as puritans or censors because of their objections to the Ellsworth Tooheys of the world — even though Toohey ’s malign influence is mainly exercised through rhetorical and social means rather than by legal force .
An uncharitable reading that the situation unfortunately suggests is that libertarians can recognize non-governmental oppression in principle , but in practice seem unable to grasp any form of oppression other than the ones that well - educated white men may have experienced for themselves .
A more charitable reading of libertarian attitudes might be this : while the collectivist boycott of independent minds and stifling of creative excellence in The Fountainhead is not itself enacted through government means , collectivism clearly is associated with the mass psychology that supports statism .
So is patriarchy , actually , but it is most closely associated with a non-governmental form of oppression — that is , male supremacy and violence against women .
All this makes it seem , at times , that libertarians — including libertarian feminists — are suffering from a sort of willful conceptual blindness ; perhaps because they are afraid to grant the existence of serious and systematic forms of political oppression that are not connected solely or mainly with the state .
It ’s as though , if they granted any political critique of the outcomes of voluntary association , they would thereby be granting that voluntary association as such is oppressive , and that government regulation is the solution .
But such a phobic reaction only makes sense if you first accept ( either tacitly or explicitly ) the premise that all politics is exclusively the domain of the government , and as such ( given Mises ’s insights into the nature of government ) all political action is essentially violent action .
This is , as it were , a problem that has no name ; but we might call it “ the authoritarian theory of politics , ” since it amounts to the premise that any political question is a question resolved by violence ; many 20th century libertarians simply grant the premise and then , because they hold that no question is worth resolving by ( initiatory ) violence , they call for the death of politics in human affairs .
At least one libertarian theorist , the late Don Lavoie , makes our point when he observes that there is much more to politics than government .
Wherever human beings engage in direct discourse with one another about their mutual rights and responsibilities , there is a politics .
I mean politics in the sense of the public sphere in which discourse over rights and responsibilities is carried on , much in the way Hannah Arendt discusses it . ….
The force of public opinion , like that of markets , is not best conceived as a concentrated will representing the public , but as the distributed influence of political discourses throughout society .
…
Inside the firm , in business lunches , at street corners , interpersonal discourses are constantly going on in markets .
In all those places there is a politics going on , a politics that can be more or less democratic .
…
Leaving a service to “ the forces of supply and demand ” does not remove it from human decision making , since everything will depend on exactly what it is that the suppliers and demanders are trying to achieve . …
What makes a legal culture , any legal system , work is a shared system of belief in the rules of justice — a political culture .
The culture is , in turn , an evolving process , a tradition which is continually being reappropriated in creative ways in the interpersonal and public discourses through which social individuals communicate .
…
Everything depends here on what is considered an acceptable social behavior , that is , on the constraints imposed by a particular political culture . …
To say we should leave everything to be “ decided by markets ” does not , as [ libertarians ] suppose , relieve liberalism of the need to deal with the whole realms of politics .
And to severely limit or even abolish government does not necessarily remove the need for democratic processes in nongovernmental institutions .
It ’s true that a libertarian could ( as Karl Hess , for example , does ) simply insist on a definition of politics in terms of the authoritarian theory , and stick consistently to the stipulation , while also doing work on a systemic critique of forms of oppression that are n’t ( by their definition ) enacted through the “ political means ” ; they would simply have to hold that a full appreciation of oppressive conditions requires a thorough understanding of what “ the economic means ” or “ action in the market ” or “ civil society ” can include .
But given the curious misunderstandings that many libertarians seem to have of feminist critiques , it seems likely that the issue here is n’t merely terminological — it may be that the real nature of typical feminist concerns and activism is rendered incomprehensible by sticking to stipulations about the use of “ politics ” and “ the market ” when the ordinary use of those terms wo n’t bear them .
You could , if you insisted , look at street harassment as a matter of “ psychic costs ” that women face in their daily affairs , and the feminist tactic of women ’s “ Ogle - Ins ” on Wall Street as a means of reducing the “ supply ” of male leering by driving up the “ psychic costs ” to the “ producers ” ( using shame and awareness of what it ’s like to face harassment ) .
In this sense , the “ Ogle - In ” resembles , in some salient respects , a picket or a boycott .
But no - one actually thinks of an Ogle - In as a “ market activity , ” even if you can make up some attenuated way of analyzing it under economic categories ; it clearly fails to meet a number of conditions ( such as the voluntary exchange of goods or services between actors ) that are part of our routine , pre-analytic use of terms such as “ market , ” “ producer , ” and “ economic . ”
Just as clearly , an “ Ogle - In ” has something importantly in common with legislation , court proceedings , and even market activities such as boycotts or pickets that appeals to our pre-analytic use of “ political ” — even though neither the “ Ogle - In ” nor the market protests are violent , or in any way connected with the State : they are all trying to address a question of social coordination through conscious action , and they work by calling on people to make choices with the intent of addressing the social issue — as opposed to actions in which the intent is some more narrowly economic form of satisfaction , and any effects on social coordination ( for good or for ill ) are unintended consequences .
Libertarian temptations to the contrary notwithstanding , it makes no sense to regard the state as the root of all social evil , for there is at least one social evil that cannot be blamed on the state — and that is the state itself .
If no social evil can arise or be sustained except by the state , how does the state arise , and how is it sustained ?
As libertarians from La Boétie to Rothbard have rightly insisted , since rulers are generally outnumbered by those they rule , the state itself cannot survive except through popular acceptance which the state lacks the power to compel ; hence state power is always part of an interlocking system of mutually reinforcing social practices and structures , not all of which are violations of the nonaggression axiom .
There is nothing un-libertarian , then , in recognizing the existence of economic and / or cultural forms of oppression which , while they may draw sustenance from the state ( and vice versa ) , are not reducible to state power .
One can see statism and patriarchy as mutually reinforcing systems ( thus ruling out both the option of fighting statism while leaving patriarchy intact , and the option of fighting patriarchy by means of statism ) without being thereby committed to seeing either as a mere epiphenomenon of the other ( thus ruling out the option of fighting patriarchy solely indirectly by fighting statism ) .
§3 The relationship between libertarianism and feminism has not always been so chilly .
19th - century libertarians — a group which includes classical liberals in the tradition of Jean - Baptiste Say and Herbert Spencer , as well as individualist anarchists in the tradition of Josiah Warren — generally belonged to what Chris Sciabarra has characterized as the “ radical ” or “ dialectical ” tradition in libertarianism , in which the political institutions and practices that libertarians condemn as oppressive are seen as part of a larger interlocking system of mutually reinforcing political , economic , and cultural structures .
Libertarian sociologist Charles Dunoyer , for example , observed :
The first mistake , and to my mind the most serious , is not sufficiently seeing difficulties where they are — not recognizing them except in governments .
Since it is indeed there that the greatest obstacles ordinarily make themselves felt , it is assumed that that is where they exist , and that alone is where one endeavors to attack them . …
One is unwilling to see that nations are the material from which governments are made ; that it is from their bosom that governments emerge ….
One wants to see only the government ; it is against the government that all the complaints , all the censures are directed ….
From this point of view , narrowly directing one ’s efforts toward purely political reform without addressing the broader social context is unlikely to be effective .
Contrary to their reputation , then , 19th - century libertarians rejected atomistic conceptions of human life .
Herbert Spencer , for example , insisted that society is an organism , and that the actions of individuals accordingly cannot be understood except in relation to the social relations in which they participate .
Just as , he explained , the “ process of loading a gun is meaningless unless the subsequent actions performed with the gun are known , ” and a “ fragment of a sentence , if not unintelligible , is wrongly interpreted in the absence of its remainder , ” so any part , if “ conceived without any reference to the whole , ” can be comprehended only in a distorted manner .
But Spencer saw no conflict between his organismic view of society and his political individualism ; in fact Spencer saw the undirected , uncoerced , spontaneous order of organic processes such as growth and nutrition as strengthening the case against , rather than for , the subordination of its individual members to the commands of a central authority .
In the same way , American libertarian Stephen Pearl Andrews characterized the libertarian method as “ trinismal , ” meaning that it transcended the false opposition between “ unismal ” collective aggregation and “ duismal ” fragmented diversity .
Even the egoist - anarchist Benjamin Tucker insisted that society is a “ concrete organism ” irreducible to its aggregated individual members .
While the 19th - century libertarians ’ social holism and attention to broader context have been shared by many 20th - century libertarians as well , 19th - century libertarians were far more likely than their 20th - century counterparts to recognize the subordination of women as a component in the constellation of interlocking structures maintaining and maintained by statism .
Dunoyer and Spencer , for example , saw patriarchy as the original form of class oppression , the model for and origin of all subsequent forms of class rule .
For Dunoyer , primitive patriarchy constituted a system in which a parasitic governmental élite , the men , made their living primarily by taxing , regulating , and conscripting a productive and industrious laboring class , the women .
Herbert Spencer concurred :
The slave - class in a primitive society consists of the women ; and the earliest division of labour is that which arises between them and their masters .
For a long time no other division of labour exists .
Moreover , Spencer saw an intimate connection between the rise of patriarchy and the rise of militarism :
The primary political differentiation originates from the primary family differentiation .
Men and women being by the unlikeness of their functions in life , exposed to unlike influences , begin from the first to assume unlike positions in the community as they do in the family : very early they respectively form the two political classes of rulers and ruled . … [ In ] ordinary cases … the men , solely occupied in war and the chase , have unlimited authority , while the women , occupied in gathering miscellaneous small food and carrying burdens , are abject slaves …. [ whereas in ] those few uncivilized societies which are habitually peaceful … in which the occupations are not , or were not , broadly divided into fighting and working , and severally assigned to the two sexes … along with a comparatively small difference between the activities of the sexes , there goes , or went , small difference of social status . …
Where the life is permanently peaceful , definite class - divisions do not exist . …
[ T ] he domestic relation between the sexes passes into a political relation , such that men and women become , in militant groups , the ruling class and the subject class ….
Accordingly , Spencer likewise saw the replacement of militarized hierarchical societies by more market - oriented societies based on commerce and mutual exchange as closely allied with the decline of patriarchy in favor of increasing sexual equality ; changing power relations within the family and changing power relations within the broader society stood in relations of interdependence :
The domestic despotism which polygyny involves , is congruous with the political despotism proper to predominant militancy ; and the diminishing political coercion which naturally follows development of the industrial type , is congruous with the diminishing domestic coercion which naturally follows the accompanying development of monogamy .
The truth that among peoples otherwise inferior , the position of women is relatively good where their occupations are nearly the same as those of men , seems allied to the wider truth that their position becomes good in proportion as warlike activities are replaced by industrial activities ….
Where all men are warriors and the work is done entirely by women , militancy is the greatest . …
[ T ]he despotism distinguishing a community organized for war , is essentially connected with despotism in the household ; while , conversely , the freedom which characterizes public life in an industrial community , naturally characterizes also the accompanying private life .
…
Habitual antagonism with , and destruction of , foes , sears the sympathies ; while daily exchange of products and services among citizens , puts no obstacle to increase of fellow - feeling .
In Spencer ’s view , the mutual reinforcement between statism , militarism , and patriarchy continued to characterize 19th - century capitalist society :
To the same extent that the triumph of might over right is seen in a nation ’s political institutions , it is seen in its domestic ones .
Despotism in the state is necessarily associated with despotism in the family . … [ I ] n as far as our laws and customs violate the rights of humanity by giving the richer classes power over the poorer , in so far do they similarly violate those rights by giving the stronger sex power over the weaker . …
To the same extent that the old leaven of tyranny shows itself in the transactions of the senate , it will creep out in the doings of the household .
If injustice sways men ’s public acts , it will inevitably sway their private ones also .
The mere fact , therefore , that oppression marks the relationships of out - door life , is ample proof that it exists in the relationships of the fireside .
This analysis of the relation between militarism and patriarchy from the fantastically - maligned but seldom - actually - read radical libertarian Herbert Spencer is strikingly similar to that offered by the fantastically - maligned but seldom - actually - read radical feminist Andrea Dworkin : I mean that there is a relationship between the way that women are raped and your socialization to rape and the war machine that grinds you up and spits you out : the war machine that you go through just like that woman went through Larry Flynt ’s meat grinder on the cover of Hustler .
You damn well better believe that you ’re involved in this tragedy and that it ’s your tragedy too .
Because you ’re turned into little soldier boys from the day that you are born and everything that you learn about how to avoid the humanity of women becomes part of the militarism of the country in which you live and the world in which you live .
It is also part of the economy that you frequently claim to protest .
And the problem is that you think it ’s out there : and it ’s not out there .
It ’s in you .
The pimps and the warmongers speak for you .
Rape and war are not so different .
And what the pimps and the warmongers do is that they make you so proud of being men who can get it up and give it hard .
And they take that acculturated sexuality and they put you in little uniforms and they send you out to kill and to die .
( I Want a Twenty - Four Hour Truce During Which There Is No Rape ) Spencer , for his part , did not confine attention to those forms of patriarchal oppression that were literally violent or coercive in the sense of violating libertarian rights ; he denounced not only the legal provision that “ a husband may justly take possession of his wife ’s earnings against her will ” or the “ statute , which permits a man to beat his wife in moderation and to imprison her in any room in his house , ” but the entire system of economic and cultural expectations and institutions within which violent forms of oppression were embedded .
He complained , for example , of a variety of factors — more often cultural than legal — that systematically stunted women ’s education and intellectual development , including such facts as that women “ are not admissible to the academies and universities in which men get their training , ” that “ the kind of life they have to look forward to , does not present so great a range of ambitions , ” that “ they are rarely exposed to that most powerful of all stimuli — necessity , ” that “ the education custom dictates for them is one that leaves uncultivated many of the higher faculties , ” and that “ the prejudice against blue - stockings , hitherto so prevalent amongst men , has greatly tended to deter women from the pursuit of literary honours . ”
In the same way he protested against the obstacles to women ’s physical health and well - being deriving from patriarchal norms of feminine attractiveness and propriety that promoted in the training of girls “ a certain delicacy , a strength not competent to more than a mile or two ’s walk , an appetite fastidious and easily satisfied , joined with that timidity which commonly accompanies feebleness . ”
The 19th - century libertarians ’ attitude toward ( what was called ) the “ woman question ” has much in common with their attitude toward the ( analogously labeled ) “ labor question . ”
19th - century libertarians generally saw the existing capitalist order as a denial , rather than as an expression , of the free market .
For most of these thinkers , “ capitalism ” meant , not economic laissez - faire ( which as libertarians they favored ) , but rather government intervention in the marketplace on behalf of capitalists at the expense of laborers and consumers , and they condemned it accordingly as the chief prop of plutocratic class oppression .
But rather than simply calling for an end to pro-business legislation , they also favored private cooperative action by workers to improve their bargaining power vis -à - vis employers or indeed to transcend the wage system altogether ; hence their support for the labor movement , workers ’ cooperatives , and the like .
Similarly , while calling for an end to legislation that discriminated against women , 19th - century libertarians like Spencer did not confine themselves to that task , but also , as we ’ve seen , addressed the economic and cultural barriers to gender equality , “ private ” barriers which they saw as operating in coordination with the governmental barriers .
Such problems as domestic violence and crimes of jealousy , for example , derive , Stephen Pearl Andrews taught , primarily from the inculcation of patriarchal values , which encourage a man to suppose “ that the woman belongs , not to herself , but to him . ”
Although the best immediate solution to this problem “ may be to knock the man on the head , or to commit him … to Sing - Sing , ” the superior longterm solution is “ a public sentiment , based on the recognition of the Sovereignty of the Individual . ”
The ultimate cure for domestic violence thus lies in cultural rather than in legal reform : “ Let the idea be completely repudiated from the man ’s mind that that woman , or any woman , could , by possibility , belong to him , or was to be true to him , or owed him anything , farther than as she might choose to bestow herself . ”
( Andrews 1889 , p. 70 ) But Andrews ’ solution was not solely cultural but also economic , stressing the need for women to achieve financial independence .
Andrews criticized the system “ by which the husband and father earns all the money , and doles it out in charitable pittances to wife and daughters , who are kept as helpless dependents , in ignorance of business and the responsibilities of life , ” and “ liable at any time to be thrown upon their own resources , with no resources to be thrown upon . ” ( p. 42 ) One key to women ’s economic independence would be to have children “ reared in Unitary Nurseries ” ( p. 41 ) , i.e. , day care ( funded of course by voluntarily pooled resources rather than by the State , which Andrews sought to abolish ) .
Andrews looked forward to a future in which “ with such provision … for the care of children , Women find it as easy to earn an independent living as Men , ” and thus “ freed by these changes from the care of the nursery and the household , Woman is enabled , even while a mother , to select whatever calling or profession suits her tastes . ”
So the individualists ’ libertarianism was not cashed out in ignoring non-governmental forms of oppression , but in their refusal to endorse government intervention as a long - term means of combating them .
At first glance , contemporary liberals might find all this puzzling : “ So the 19th century libertarians recognized these problems , but they did n’t want to do anything effective about them ? ”
But “ effective political action ” only means “ government force ” if you buy into the authoritarian theory of politics ; and there are good reasons — both historical and theoretical — for contemporary feminists to reject it .
Feminists such as Kate Millett and Catharine MacKinnon have directly criticized conceptions of politics that are exclusively tied to the the exercise of State power , and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s , radical feminists continually fought against the patronizing response to their program by male Leftists who could not recognize women ’s “ personal ” circumstances as a political issue , or the actions and institutions suggested by Women ’s Liberation as a political program , precisely because they were outside of the realm of male public debate and government action .
And as historians of second - wave feminism such as Susan Brownmiller have shown , many of radical feminism ’s most striking achievements were brought about through efforts that were both clearly political in nature but also independent of State political processes — such as consciousness - raising groups , “ ogle-ins ” and WITCH “ hexes ” against street harassment and sexist businesses , and the creation of autonomous women - run institutions such as cooperative day - care centers , women ’s health collectives , and the first battered women ’s shelters and rape crisis centers .
Nineteenth century libertarians would hardly have been surprised that these efforts have been as effective as they have without the support of government coercion ; in fact , they might very well argue that it is precisely because they have avoided the quagmire of the bureaucratic State that they have been so effective .
If libertarian social and economic theory is correct , then non-libertarians typically overestimate the efficacy of governmental solutions , and underestimate the efficacy of non-governmental solutions .
The 19th - century libertarian feminists opposed state action not only because of their moral objections to state coercion but also because they understood the state — what Ezra Heywood called the “ booted , spurred and whiskered thing called government ” ( in McElroy 1991 , p. 226 ) — as itself a patriarchal institution , whose very existence helped to reinforce patriarchy ( or what Angela Heywood called “ he-ism ” ) in the private sector ; using the state to fight male supremacy would thus be like attempting to douse a fire with kerosene .
As Voltairine de Cleyre put it : Today you go to a representative of that power which has robbed you of the earth , of the right of free contract of the means of exchange , taxes you for everything you eat or wear ( the meanest form of robbery ) , — you go to him for redress from a thief !
It is about as logical as the Christian lady whose husband had been “ removed ” by Divine Providence , and who thereupon prayed to said Providence to “ comfort the widow and the fatherless . ”
In freedom we would not institute a wholesale robber to protect us from petty larceny .
( Economic Tendency of Freethought ¶ 35 ) The 19th - century libertarians would thus not have been surprised to learn that , in our day , anti-pornography law written with feminist intentions has been applied by male police and male judges to censor feminist publications , or that sex discrimination law has , in the hands of male legislators and judges , been used to reverse 19th century feminist gains in custody and divorce law .
Hand the he-ist state a club , and you can be sure the club will be used in a he-ist manner .
While adverse power relations in the private sector — whether between labor and capital or between men and women — were seen as drawing much of their strength from the support given to them by corresponding power relations in the political sector , these thinkers did not conclude that it would be sufficient to direct all their energies against the sins of government in the hope that the private forms of oppression would fall as soon as political forms did .
On the contrary , if private oppression drew strength from political oppression , the converse was true as well ; 19th - century libertarians saw themselves as facing an interlocking system of private and public oppression , and thus recognized that political liberation could not be achieved except via a thoroughgoing transformation of society as a whole .
While such libertarians would have been gratified by the extent to which overt governmental discrimination against women has been diminished in present - day Western societies , they would not have been willing to treat that sort of discrimination as the sole index of gender - based oppression in society .
Moses Harman , for example , maintained not only that the family was patriarchal because it was regulated by the patriarchal state , but also that the state was patriarchal because it was founded on the patriarchal family : “ I recognize that the government of the United States is exclusive , jealous , partialistic , narrowly selfish , despotic , invasive , paternalistic , monopolistic , and cruel — logically and legitimately so because the unit and basis of that government is the family whose chief corner stone is institutional marriage . ”
( In McElroy 199 , p. 104 ) Harman saw the non-governmental sources of patriarchy as analogous to the non-governmental sources of chattel slavery ( another social evil against which libertarians were especially active in fighting ) :
The crystals that hardened and solidified chattel slavery were … partly religious ; partly economic or industrial , and partly “ societary ” ….
And so likewise it is with the enslavement of woman . …
The control of sex , of reproduction , is claimed by the priest and clergy man as pre-eminently their own province .
…
Marriage is also an economic institution .
Women have an industrial value , a financial value .
Orthodox marriage makes man … ruler of the house , while the wife is … an “ upper servant without wages . ”
The husband holds the common purse and spends the common earnings , as he sees fit .
…
Marriage is a societary institution — pre-eminently so . … [ A woman ] must not only be “ strictly virtuous , but clearly above suspicion , ” else social damnation is her life sentence .
( In McElroy 1991 , pp. 113-4 )
Hence the fight against patriarchy would likewise require challenging not only governmental but also religious , economico - industrial , and societary obstacles ( such as the social sanctions against divorce , birth control , and careers for women , coordinate with the legal sanctions ) .
While the non-governmental obstacles drew strength from the governmental ones , Victor Yarros stressed that they also had an independent force of their own .
In addition to their “ burden of economic servitude , ” which Yarros optimistically opined “ would not outlive the State and legality for a single day , for it has no other root to depend upon for continued existence , ” women are also “ subjected to the misery of being the property , tool , and plaything of man , and have neither power to protest against the use , nor remedies against abuse , of their persons by their male masters ” — and this form of subjugation , he thought , could not be abolished overnight simply by abolishing the state , since it was “ sanctioned by custom , prejudice , tradition , and prevailing notions of morality and purity ” ; its abolition must thus await further economic and intellectual progress .
Among the private power relations sanctioned by “ custom , prejudice , and tradition , ” Yarros included those so - called “ privileges and special homage accorded by the bourgeois world to women , ” which the Marxist writer E. Belfort Bax had denounced as “ tyranny exercised by women over men . ”
Anticipating contemporary feminist critiques of “ chivalry , ” Yarros responded :
Not denying that such “ tyranny ” exists , I assert that Mr. Bax entirely misunderstands its real nature .
Man ’s condescension he mistakes for submission ; marks of woman ’s degradation and slavery his obliquity of vision transforms into properties of sovereignty .
Tchernychewsky takes the correct view upon this matter when he makes Vera Pavlovna say ; “ Men should not kiss women ’s hands , since that ought to be offensive to women , for it means that men do not consider them as human beings like themselves , but believe that they can in no way lower their dignity before a woman , so inferior to them is she , and that no marks of affected respect for her can lessen their superiority . ”
What to Mr. Bax appears to be servility on the part of men is really but insult added to injury .
And Voltairine de Cleyre ’s list of libertarian feminist grievances includes legal and cultural factors equally : Let Woman ask herself , “ Why am I the slave of Man ?
Why is my brain said not to be the equal of his brain ?
Why is my work not paid equally with his ?
Why must my body be controlled by my husband ?
Why may he take my labor in the household , giving me in exchange what he deems fit ?
Why may he take my children from me ?
Will them away while yet unborn ? ” ( Sex Slavery ¶ 11 ) 19th - century libertarians , especially in the English - speaking world ( French libertarians tended to be more socially conservative ) , were deeply skeptical of the institution of marriage .
“ Marriage is unjust to woman , ” Moses Harman declared , “ depriving her of her right of ownership and control of her person , of her children , her name , her time and her labor . … I oppose marriage because marriage legalized rape . ”
( In McElroy ** , pp100 - 102 ) A woman takes the last name first of her father , then of her husband , just as , traditionally , a slave has taken the last name of his master , “ changing names every time he changed owners . ” ( ** p. 112 ) Some , like Harman and Spencer , thought the solution lay in reconstituting marriage as a purely private relation , neither sanctioned nor regulated by the State , and thus involving no legal privileges for the husband .
Others went farther and rejected marriage in any form , public or private , as a legacy of patriarchy ; de Cleyre , for example , maintained that the “ permanent relation of a man and a woman , sexual and economical , whereby the present home and family life is maintained , ” is a “ dependent relationship ” and “ detrimental to the growth of individual character , ” regardless of whether it is “ blessed by a priest , permitted by a magistrate , contracted publicly or privately , or not contracted at all . ”
( “ They Who Marry Do Ill ” **)
Victor Yarros and Anselme Bellegarrigue nevertheless advised women to exploit existing gender conventions in order to get themselves supported by a man ; Benjamin Tucker and Sarah Holmes , by contrast , insisted that “ every individual , whether man or woman , shall be self - supporting , ” and “ have an independent home of his or her own . ”
19th - century libertarian feminists are not easily classifiable in terms of the contemporary division between ( or the stereotypes of ) “ liberal feminists ” and “ radical feminists . ”
We ’ve already seen that they recognized no conflict between the “ liberal ” value of individualism and the “ radical ” claim that the self is socially constituted .
They were also “ liberal ” in taking individuals rather than groups as their primary unit of analysis — but “ radical ” in their contextualizing methodology ; they would have agreed with MacKinnon ’s remark that thoughts and ideas are “ constituent participants in conditions — more than mere reflections [ à la Marxism ] but less than unilineral causes [ à la liberalism ] of life settings . ”
( MacKinnon 1989 , p. 46 ) They were “ liberal ” in their stress on negative freedom and their respect for the actual choices people make , but they were also “ radical ” in their recognition that outward acquiescence may not express genuine consent — since , in Andrews ’ words , “ wives have the same motives that slaves have for professing contentment , and smile deceitfully while the heart swells indignantly . ”
( Andrews ***)
Unlike some radical feminists ( such as Mary Daly ) , they did not treat patriarchy as the root cause of all other forms of oppression ; for them patriarchy was simply one component ( though the chronologically first component ) of a larger oppressive system , and to the extent that they recognized one of this system ’s components as causally primary , they were more likely to assign that role to the state .
But like radical and unlike liberal feminists , they did not treat sexism as a separable aberration in a basically equitable socio- economic order ; they argued that male supremacy was a fundamental principle of a social order that required radical changes in society and culture , as well as law and personal attitudes .
Thus they would gladly endorse MacKinnon ’s statement that “ powerlessness is a problem but redistribution of power as currently defined is not its ultimate solution ” ( MacKinnon 1989 , p. 46 ) .
19th century libertarian feminists vigorously debated the degree to which participation in electoral politics was a legitimate means and end for women ’s liberation ; they also offered radical critiques of the traditional family , and were willing to issue the kinds of shocking and extreme condemnations for which today ’s radical feminists are often criticized — as when Andrews and de Cleyre described the “ whole existing marital system ” as “ the house of bondage and the slaughter - house of the female sex ” ( Andrews 1889 , ** ) , “ a prison … whose corridors radiate over all the earth , and with so many cells , that none may count them ” ( de Cleyre , “ Sex Slavery ” ** ) , or when Bellegarrigue demystified romantic love by noting that “ [ t ] he person whom one loves passes into the state of property and has no right ; the more one loves her , the more one annihilates her ; being itself is denied her , for she does not act from her own action , nor , moreover , does she think from her own thought ; she does and thin ks what is done and thought for her and despite her , ” and finally concluded that “ Love is Hate . ”
As abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison ( also a libertarian and a feminist ) remarked , in another context , in defense of what some considered his extremist rhetoric : “ I have need to be all on fire , for I have mountains of ice about me to melt . ”
(**) 19th - century libertarian feminism was simultaneously liberal and radical , perhaps because libertarianism precisely is liberalism radicalized .
§ 4 Since the 19th century , libertarianism and feminism have largely parted ways — perhaps , in part , because libertarians allowed the advance of state socialism in the early 20th century to drive them into an alliance with conservatives , an alliance from which libertarians could not hope to emerge unmarked .
( Few libertarians today even remember that their 19th - century predecessors often called their position “ voluntary socialism ” — “ socialism ” to contrast it , not with the free market , but with actually existing capitalism , and “ voluntary ” to contrast it both with state socialism and with anti-market versions of anarchist socialism . )
Since this parting of ways , feminists have developed increasingly sophisticated analyses and demystifications of patriarchy , but their understanding of statism has grown correspondingly blurred ; libertarians have developed increasingly sophisticated analyses and demystifications of statism , but their understanding of patriarchy has grown correspondingly blurred .
A 19th - century libertarian feminist , if resurrected today , might thus have much to learn from today ’s libertarians about how statism works , and from today ’s feminists about how patriarchy works ; but she or he would doubtless also see present - day feminists as , all too often , extraordinarily insensitive to the pervasive and inherently destructive effects of state hegemony per se , and present - day libertarians as , all too often , extraordinarily insensitive to the pervasive and inherently destructive effects of male hegemony per se .
A contemporary marriage , or remarriage , of feminism with libertarianism thus seems a consummation devoutly to be wished — but not if it is now to be a patriarchal marriage , one in which the feminism is subordinated to or absorbed into or muffled by the libertarianism , a marriage in which one party retains , while the other renounces , its radical edge .
Our concern about the nature of libertarian feminism in its contemporary form is precisely that it tends to represent this sort of unequal union .
§ 5 Libertarian feminist Joan Kennedy Taylor has written extensively on the need for a more libertarian feminism and a more feminist libertarianism .
While her work has been admirable in highlighting the importance of synthesizing libertarian insights with feminist insights , and in her willingness to call fellow libertarians to task when it is needed , we worry that her attempt at a synthesis often recapitulates antifeminist themes , and hobbles her feminist program in the process .
Many of the most frustrating elements of Taylor ’s attempt at libertarian feminism are connected with what you might call her dialectical strategy : throughout Taylor ’s work she attempts to position herself , and her libertarian feminism , mainly by means of opposition — by her insistent efforts to ally it with “ mainstream ” , “ liberal ” feminism and thus to distance it from “ extreme ” , “ radical ” feminism .
The positioning strategy — which we might call “ Radical Menace ” politics — comes uncomfortably close to classical anti-feminist divide - and - conquer politics , in which the feminist world is divided into the “ reasonable ” ( that is , unthreatening ) feminists and the feminists who are “ hysterical ” or “ man-hating ” ( so , presumably , not worthy of rational response ) .
In antifeminist hands the strategy comes uncomfortably close to a barely - intellectualized repetition of old antifeminist standbys such as the “ hairy - legged man- hater ” or the “ hysterical lesbian . ”
Unfortunately , feminists aiming in good faith at the success of the movement have also responded to radical - baiting by falling into the trap of defining themselves primarily by opposition to the “ extreme ” positions of other feminists .
In both cases , the specter of “ That Kind of Feminist ” is invoked to give feminists the Hobson ’s Choice between being marginalized and ignored , or being bullied into dulling the feminist edge of their politics wherever it is threatening enough to offend the “ mainstream . ”
While Taylor ’s work shows a great deal more understanding of , and sympathy with , classical feminist concerns than antifeminist radical - baiters , her treatment of issues pioneered by radical feminists — such as sexual harassment in the workplace — do seem to combine the authoritarian theory of politics with Radical Menace rhetoric in ways that leave it limited and frustrating .
Her book on sexual harassment , oxymoronically subtitled “ A Non-Adversarial Approach to Sexual Harassment , ” much of what women experience as harassment in the workplace is simply a misunderstanding between the male and female subcultures , a misperception by women of such practices among men in traditionally all - male environments as hazing newcomers or telling sexist jokes .
For Taylor , “ male behavior that may seem directed at women in a hostile way may just be treating them as women often say they wish to be treated — like men . ” ( p. 7 ) Because women are the ones who are seeking to “ enter male workplaces that are permeated by male culture , ” Taylor concludes that “ it should be the woman , and not the man , whose behavior is modified . ” ( p. 200 ) But why , then , does n’t it equally follow that libertarians living in a predominantly statist culture should stop complaining about governmental coercion and instead adapt themselves to the status quo ?
After all , statists do n’t just tax and regulate libertarians ; they tax and regulate each other .
This is how statists have , for centuries , behaved toward one another in traditionally all - statist environments , and , one might argue , they ’re just innocently treating libertarians the same way .
If Taylor and other libertarians are nevertheless unwilling take such statist behavior for granted , why should women follow her advice to take the analogous male behavior for granted ?
As Elizabeth Brake writes :
But why is part of men ’s culture to tell “ dirty and anti-female jokes , ” as Taylor claims ?
She writes that women should shrug off such joking ….
Would the workplace situation that Taylor describes seem as harmless if she wrote , “ Whites tell dirty and anti-black jokes among themselves ” ?
Would she still counsel that the targets of such jokes should toughen up , rather than advocating a behavioral change on the part of the jokers ? …
It is staggering that Taylor forgets to ask why these jokes target women .
And why does the hazing or teasing of women take a sexual form ?
I take it that men do not grope each other as part of their hazing rituals .
To this we may add : and why are these still traditionally all - male or mostly - male environments , long after most purely legislative barriers to workplace equality have fallen ?
Is the behavior Taylor describes merely an effect , and not also in part a sustaining cause , of such workplace inequality ?
Taylor has much to say about the harmful effects of power relations in the political sphere , but she seems oddly blind to harmful power relations in the “ private ” sphere ; and much of her advice strikes us as counseling women to adapt themselves docilely to existing patriarchal power structures so long as those structures are not literally coercive in the strict libertarian sense .
This sort of advice draws its entire force from the authoritarian theory of politics — in assuming that state violence is the only politically effective means for combating patriarchy .
Taylor effectively renounces combating patriarchy ; in so doing she not only undermines feminism , but also reinforces the very idea that drives some contemporary feminists towards a statist program .
We have similar concerns about many of the writings of Wendy McElroy , another of today ’s foremost libertarian feminists .
We greatly admire much that she has to say , including her radical analyses of state power ; and her historical research uncovering the neglected radical individualist tradition of the 19th century is invaluable .
But , as with Taylor , we find her treatment of present - day feminism problematic .
Perhaps even more so than Taylor , McElroy ’s efforts at forging a libertarian feminism are limited by her tendency towards Radical Menace politics — a tendency which seems to have intensified over the course of her career .
In some of her earlier writings McElroy treats libertarian feminism and socialist feminism as two branches of “ radical feminism , ” and contrasts both with “ mainstream feminism . ”
Thus in a 1982 article she writes : Throughout most of its history , American mainstream feminism considered equality to mean equal treatment under existing laws and equal representation within existing institutions .
The focus was not to change the status quo in a basic sense , but rather to be included within it .
The more radical feminists protested that the existing laws and institutions were the source of injustice and , thus , could not be reformed .
These feminists saw something fundamentally wrong with society beyond discrimination against women , and their concepts of equality reflected this .
To the individualist , equality was a political term referring to the protection of individual rights ; that is , protection of the moral jurisdiction every human being has over his or her own body .
To socialist - feminists , it was a socioeconomic term .
Women could be equal only after private property and the family relationships it encouraged were eliminated .
( McElroy 1991 , p. 3 ) On this understanding , “ mainstream ” feminists seek equality in the weak sense of inclusion in whatever the existing power structure is .
If there are male rulers , there should be female rulers ; if there are male slaves , there should be female slaves .
“ Radical ” feminists seek a more radical form of equality — socioeconomic for the socialist form of radicalism , and political for the libertarian or individualist form of radicalism .
By political equality McElroy does not mean equal access to the franchise ; indeed , as a voluntaryist anarchist she regards voting as a fundamentally immoral and counterproductive form of political activity .
Rather , she means the absence of any and all political subordination of one person to another , where “ political ” is understood explicitly in terms of the authoritarian theory of politics :
Society is divided into two classes : those who use the political means , which is force , to acquire wealth or power and those who use the economic means , which requires voluntary interaction .
The former is the ruling class which lives off the labor and wealth of the latter .
( McElroy 1991 , p. 23 ) For McElroy , then , the sort of gender inequality that feminism needs to address is simply a specific instance of the broader kind of inequality that libertarianism per se addresses — the subordination of some people to others by means of political force :
The libertarian theory of justice applies to all human beings regardless of secondary characteristics such as sex and color . …
To the extent that laws infringe upon self - ownership , they are unjust .
To the extent that such violation is based upon sex , there is room for a libertarian feminist movement .
( p. 22 ) Notice how restrictive this recommendation is .
The basis for a libertarian feminist movement is the existence of laws that ( a ) “ infringe upon self - ownership , ” and ( b ) do so “ based upon sex . ”
Libertarian feminism is thus conceived as narrowly political in scope , and politics is conceived of exclusively in terms of the authoritarian theory .
But on what grounds ?
Why is there no room in McElroy ’s classification for a version of feminism that seeks to combat both legal and socioeconomic inequality , say ?
And why would n’t the concerns of this feminism have a perfectly good claim to the adjective “ political ? ” McElroy ’s answer is that “ [ a ] lthough most women have experienced the uncomfortable and often painful discrimination that is a part of our culture , this is not a political matter .
Peaceful discrimination is not a violation of rights . ” ( p. 23 ) Hence such discrimination is “ not a subject that libertarianism as a political philosophy addresses except to state that all remedies for it must be peaceful . ” ( p. 23 ) Now it is certainly true that no libertarian feminist can consistently advocate the use of political force to combat forms of discrimination that do n’t involve the use of violence .
But how should we classify a feminist who seeks to alter not only political institutions but also pervasive private forms of discrimination — but combats the latter through non-violent means only ?
What sort of feminist would she be ?
Suppose , moreover , that libertarian social theory tells us , as it arguably does , that governmental injustice is likely to reflect and draw sustenance from the prevailing economic and cultural conditions .
Wo n’t it follow that libertarianism does have something to say , qua libertarian political theory , about those conditions ?
McElroy is certainly not blind to the existence of pervasive but non-governmental discrimination against women ; she writes that “ our culture heavily influences sex - based behavior ” and “ even so intimate a matter as how we view ourselves as individuals . ”
Many of the societal cues aimed at women carry messages that , if taken to heart , naturally produce feelings of intellectual insecurity and inadequacy .
The list is long .
Women should not compete with men .
Women become irrational when menstruating .
Women do not argue fairly .
Women — not men — must balance career and family .
A wife should relocate to accommodate her husband ’s job transfer .
A clean house is the woman ’s responsibility : a ‘ good living ’ is the man’s .
A wife who earns more than her husband is looking for trouble .
Women are bad at math .
Girls take home economics while boys take car repair .
If a man sexually strays , it ’s because his wife is no longer savvy enough to keep him satisfied .
Women gossip ; men discuss . …
Whenever they stand up for themselves , women risk being labeled everything from “ cute ” to “ a bitch . ” …
Almost every woman I know feels some degree of intellectual inadequacy .
So is n’t this sort of thing a problem that feminists need to combat ?
McElroy ’s answer is puzzling here .
She writes : “ Although discrimination may always occur on an individual level , it is only through the political means that such discrimination can be institutionalized and maintained by force . ” ( p. 23 ) This statement can be read as saying that sexual discrimination becomes a systematic problem , rather than an occasional nuisance , only as a result of state action .
Yet she does not , strictly speaking , say that only through state action can discrimination be institutionalized ( though the phrase “ on an individual level ” certainly invites that interpretation ) .
What she says is that only through the political means can discrimination be institutionalized by force .
Since , on the authoritarian theory that McElroy employs , the “ political means ” just is force , the statement is a tautology .
But it leaves unanswered the questions : ( a ) can discrimination be institutionalized and maintained by means other than force ?
and ( b ) can discrimination be institutionalized and maintained by force but not by the state ?
Systematic non-governmental male violence would be an instance of institutionalizing patriarchy through means that are political , in McElroy ’s sense , but not governmental ; various non-violent forms of social pressure would be a means of institutionalizing patriarchy through non-political means .
McElroy is right to say that , for libertarians , discrimination that does not violate rights cannot be a “ political ” issue ( in her sense of “ political ” ) ; but it does not follow that feminism must be no more than “ a response to the legal discrimination women have suffered from the state . ”
In her more recent writings , McElroy seems to have grown more committed and more wide - reaching in her use of Radical Menace politics .
Rather than categorizing libertarian feminism as a tendency within radical feminism ( albeit one in opposition to what is usually called “ radical feminism ” ) , she now typically treats radical feminists per se as the enemy , adopting Christina Hoff Sommers ’ terminology of “ gender feminism ” for her analytical purposes .
But while Sommers ’ opposes “ equity feminism ” to “ gender feminism ” , and has been understood as aligning the latter with radical feminism , McElroy now clearly lumps liberal and radical feminists together as “ gender feminists , ” and opposes libertarian feminism ( individualist feminism , ifeminism ) to this aggregation .
At least she seems to treat liberal feminism as a form of gender feminism when she writes :
While libertarians focus on legal restrictions , liberals ( those fractious , left - of - center feminists ) are apt to focus additionally on restrictive social and cultural norms ) , which an individual woman is deemed helpless to combat . …
If the left - of - center feminists ( sometimes called gender feminists ) are correct in their view that cultural biases against women are stronger than the formal rights extended equally to both sexes , then justice for women depends on collective , not individual action , and on a regulated marketplace .
( McElroy 2002 , pp. ix -x. )
Apart from the non sequitur in this last , notice that “ liberal feminism , ” “ left - of - center feminism , ” and “ gender feminism ” are all apparently being treated as equivalent .
On the other hand , in her book Sexual Correctness : The Gender - Feminist Attack on Women ( a frustrating mix of legitimate and illegitimate criticisms of non-libertarian feminism ) , McElroy distinguishes the two .
Gender feminism “ views women as separate and antagonistic classes ” and holds that men “ oppress women ” through “ the twin evils of the patriarchal state and the free - market system . ”
The goal is “ not equality ” but “ gender ( class ) justice for women . ”
Liberal feminism is instead defined as “ an ideology in transition ” from a watered - down version of individualist feminism to a watered - down version of gender feminism .
( McElroy 1996 , p. ix )
So presumably “ gender feminism ” here becomes roughly equivalent to “ radical feminism . ”
But McElroy ’s definitions seem to leave no room for any version of feminism that agrees that women are oppressed by men not only through the state but through non-political means , but is also pro-market .
Yet why is n’t McElroy herself precisely that sort of feminist ?
The implicit suggestion is that to regard something as a legitimate object of feminist concern is ipso facto to regard it as an appropriate object of legislation .
On this view , those feminists who see lots of issues as meriting feminist attention will naturally favour lots of legislation , while those feminists who prefer minimal legislation will be led to suppose that relatively few issues merit feminist attention .
But without the conceptual confusions that all too often accompany the authoritarian theory of politics , it ’s hard to see any reason for accepting the shared premise .
Certainly McElroy ’s 19th - century libertarian feminist predecessors did not accept it .
It may seem odd to hold up 19th - century libertarian feminism as a model against which to criticize McElroy .
For no one has done more than McElroy to popularize and defend 19th - century libertarian feminism , particularly in its American version .
McElroy ’s career has been a steady stream of books and articles documenting , and urging a return to , the ideas of the 19th - century libertarian feminists .
Yet we know — and it is largely owing to McElroy ’s own efforts that we know — that if there are any “ gender feminists ” lurking out there , the 19th century individualists , while libertarian , would certainly be found among their ranks .
As we ’ve seen , McElroy contrasts the libertarian version of class analysis , that assigns individuals to classes based on their access to political power , with both the Marxist version ( based on access to the means of production ) and the radical feminist ( based , as she thinks , on biology ) .
Classes within ifeminist analysis are fluid .
This is not true of radical feminist analysis that is based on biology .
To radical feminism , biology is the factor that fixes an individual into a class .
To ifeminism , the use of force is the salient factor and an individual can cross class lines at any point . ”
There is a double confusion here .
First , radical feminist analysis is not “ based on biology . ”
On the contrary , a central theme of radical feminism has been precisely that gender differences are socially constructed , and that women are constituted as a politically relevant class by social institutions , practices , and imputed meanings , not by pre-social biological facts beyond anyone ’s control .
MacKinnon , for example , notes that while those actions on the part of women that serve the function of “ maintaining and constantly reaffirming the structure of male supremacy at their expense ” are “ not freely willed , ” they “ are actions nonetheless , ” and “ once it is seen that these relations require daily acquiescence , acting on different principles … seems not quite so impossible ” ( MacKinnon 1989 , pp. 101 - 2 ) .
Second , libertarian analysis traditionally understands the ruling class not just as those who make use of the “ political means ” ( i.e. , force ) — is a mugger thereby a member of the ruling class ? — but as those who control the state , the hegemonic and institutionalized organization of the political means .
The membership of that ruling class may not be strictly fixed at birth , but one cannot exactly move into it at will either .
Hence McElroy ’s description simultaneously overstates the rigidity of class as radical feminists see it and understates the rigidity of class as libertarians see it .
In her hostility to the so - called “ gender feminist ” version of class analysis , McElroy is momentarily led into a rejection of class analysis per se , forgetting that she herself accepts a version of class analysis : “ Self - ownership is the foundation of individualism , ” she writes ; “ it is the death knell of class analysis .
This is because self - ownership reduces all social struggle to the level of individual rights , where every woman claims autonomy and choice , not as the member of an oppressed subclass , but as a full and free member of the human race . ” ( p. 147 ) As McElroy remembers perfectly well in other contexts , there is nothing incongruous in upholding a doctrine of individual autonomy and at the same time pointing to the existing class structure of society to help explain why that autonomy is being systematically undermined .
Perhaps McElroy ’s attachment to the authoritarian theory of politics makes her suspect that a state solution must be in the offing as soon as a political concept like “ class ” is introduced .
This hypothesis gains support from McElroy ’s discussion of the problem of domestic violence .
McElroy distinguishes between “ liberal feminist ” and “ gender feminist ” responses to the problem .
According to McElroy , liberal feminists favour “ a sociocultural approach that examines the reasons why aggression against women is tolerated by our society , ” as well as “ a psychological approach that examines the emotional reasons why men are abusive and why women accept it . ”
Gender feminists , by contrast , are said to take “ an entirely political view ” in favouring “ a class analysis approach , by which men are said to beat women to retain their place in the patriarchal power structure ” [ Sexual Correctness , p. 110 ] .
But this false dichotomy is puzzling ; surely those who favour the “ political ” approach are not offering it as an alternative to “ psychological ” and “ sociocultural ” approaches .
Does McElroy assume that any political problem must have a governmental solution ?
McElroy ’s discussion of prostitution [ Sexual Correctness , chs. 9 - 10 ] is likewise frustrating .
On the one hand , she makes a good case for the claims that ( a ) many feminists have been condescendingly dismissive of the voices of prostitutes themselves , and ( b ) legal restrictions on prostitution do more harm than benefit for the women they are allegedly designed to help .
But McElroy neglects the degree to which critiques of prostitution by radical feminists such as Diana Russell and Andrea Dworkin ( who prostituted herself to survive early in her adulthood ) have drawn on the ( negative ) testimony of women in prostitution ; she often seems unwilling to accept — in spite of what is said by the very women in prostitution that she cites — that the choices women can make might be constrained by pervasive economic , sexual , and cultural realities in a way that ’s worth challenging , even if the outcomes are ultimately “ chosen . ”
When McElroy urges that feminist discussions of prostitution need to take seriously what women in prostitution say about it , she is making a point that every feminist ought to keep firmly in mind ; but her zeal to defend the choices of prostitutes , McElroy comes close to claiming that any critical attention to the authenticity of someone else ’s choices , or to the cultural or material circumstances that constrain , them is tantamount to treating that person as “ a child or a mentally incompetent person ” ( p. 124 ) — a claim that no - one in the world ought to believe , and one that no - one earnestly does .
§ 6 Catharine MacKinnon ’s discussion of “ consent ” in male supremacy offers a useful counterpoint to McElroy ’s limited discussion of choice — albeit from a source that is sure to provoke McElroy and many other libertarians .
MacKinnon ’s work suggests that consent — whether to intercourse specifically or traditional sex roles generally — is in large part “ a structural fiction to legitimize the real coercion built into the normal social definitions of heterosexual intercourse , ” and concludes that to the extent that this is so , “ it makes no sense to define rape as different in kind . ”
Liberal and libertarian feminists have often complained against radical feminists that such assimilation of social and institutional influence to literal compulsion slights women by underestimating their capacity for autonomous choice even under adverse circumstances ; from this standpoint , the radical feminist tendency to view all intercourse through rape - colored spectacles is open to some of the same objections as the patriarchal tendency to view all intercourse through consent - colored spectacles .
But MacKinnon and other radical feminists are best interpreted , not as claiming a literal equivalence between rape and ordinary intercourse , but only as claiming that the two are a good deal less different than they seem — objecting not so much to the distinction as to the exaggeration of the difference ’s extent and significance .
Even this more moderate claim , however , strikes many liberal and libertarian feminists as “ trivializing rape . ”
This is a fair complaint ; but the charge of trivialization is also a two - edged sword .
If understating the difference between two evils trivializes the worse one , overstating the differences trivializes the less bad one .
( And even calling the understating kind of trivialization “ trivialization ” may understandably strike some feminists as an instance of , or at least an invitation to , the overstating kind of trivialization . )
Now the distinction between literal compulsion and other forms of external pressure is absolutely central to libertarianism , and so a libertarian feminist , to be a libertarian , must arguably resist the literal effacing of these differences .
But it does not follow that libertarian feminists need to deny the broader radical feminist points that ( a ) patriarchal power structures , even when not coercive in the strict libertarian sense , are relevantly and disturbingly like literal coercion in certain ways , or that ( b ) the influence of such patriarchal power structures partly rests on and partly bolsters literally violent expressions of male dominance .
Libertarians have never had any problem saying these things about statist ideology ; such ideology , libertarians often complain , is socially pervasive and difficult to resist , it both serves to legitimate state coercion and receives patronage from state coercion , and it functions to render the state ’s exploitative nature invisible and its critics inaudible .
In saying these things , libertarians do not efface the distinction between coercion and ideological advocacy ; hence no libertarian favors the compulsory suppression of statist ideology .
Why not follow the 19th - century libertarians , who neither denied the existence and importance of private discrimination , nor assimilated it to legal compulsion ?
There is nothing inconsistent or un-libertarian in holding that women ’s choices under patriarchal social structures can be sufficiently “ voluntary , ” in the libertarian sense , to be entitled to immunity from coercive legislative interference , while at the same time being sufficiently “ involuntary , ” in a broader sense , to be recognized as morally problematic and as a legitimate target of social activism .
Inferring broad voluntariness from strict voluntariness , as many libertarians seem tempted to do , is no obvious improvement over inferring strict involuntariness from broad involuntariness , as many feminists seem tempted to do ; and libertarians are ill - placed to accuse feminists of blurring distinctions if they themselves are blurring the same distinctions , albeit in the opposite direction .
§7 If we dispense with the limitations imposed by Radical Menace rhetoric and the authoritarian theory of politics , then what sort of a synthesis between feminism and libertarianism might be possible ?
We do not intend , here , to try to set out a completed picture ; we only hope to help with providing the frame .
But while it can certainly draw from the insights of 20th century libertarian feminists , it will likely be something very different from what a Joan Kennedy Taylor or a Wendy McElroy seems to expect .
Taylor , for example , envisions libertarian feminism as a synthesis of libertarian insights with the spirit and concerns of mainstream liberal feminism ; but if what we have argued is correct , then it ’s not at all clear that mainstream liberal feminism is the most natural place for libertarians to look .
Liberal feminists have made invaluable contributions to the struggle for women ’s equality — we do n’t intend to engage in a reverse Radical Menace rhetoric here .
But nevertheless , the 19th century libertarian feminists , and the 21st century libertarian feminists that learn from their example , may find themselves far closer to Second Wave radical feminism than to liberalism .
As we have argued , radical feminist history and theory offer a welcome challenge to the authoritarian theory of politics ; radical feminists are also far more suspicious of the state as an institution , and as a means to sex equality in particular , than liberal feminists .
While liberal feminists have bought into to bureaucratic state action through mechanisms such as the EEOC and the proposed Equal Rights Amendment , Catharine MacKinnon has criticized the way in which feminist campaigns for sex equality “ [ have ] been caught between giving more power to the state in each attempt to claim it for women and leaving unchecked power in the society to men ” ( MacKinnon 1989 , Chapter 8 ¶ 10 ) , and R. Amy Elman argues in Sexual Subordination and State Intervention that feminist activism against rape and battery has met with considerably more success in the United States than in “ progressive ” Sweden because of the ( relative ) decentralization of political authority in the U.S.
These are remarks that would not be out of place in the works of radical libertarians such as Tom Bell or Murray Rothbard ; there is good reason to think that an explicitly libertarian feminism will have much to say to , and much to learn from , the radical feminist tradition .
It ’s true that in spite of their suspicions of the state as a tool of class privilege , radical feminists are sometimes willing to grant the State powers that liberal feminists would withhold — for example , to penalize pornographers for the misogynist content of their works .
To libertarians this may seem paradoxical : should n’t distrusting an institution make one less willing to augment its powers , rather than more ?
But this apparent disconnect is less paradoxical than it seems ; if state neutrality is a myth , if the state is by nature a tool in the struggle between sexes or classes or both , then it can seem as though the only sensible response is to employ it as just that , rather than trusting to its façade of juridical impartiality .
To libertarians , of course , this strategy is as self - defeating as donning the ring of Sauron ; but it is certainly understandable .
Moreover , if radical feminists are suspicious of the state , they are equally suspicious of society , especially market society , and so are disinclined to view as entitled to immunity from state interference .
“ The underlying assumption of judicial neutrality , ” MacKinnon writes , “ is that a status quo exists which is preferable to judicial intervention . ”
( MacKinnon 1989 , Chapter 8 ¶ 23 ) Hence MacKinnon ’s ambivalence about special legal protections for women ; such protections treat women as “ marginal and second - class members of the workforce ” ( Chapter 8 ¶ 20 ) , but since market society does that already , such laws may offer women some concrete benefits .
Here of course libertarians have reason to be less suspicious of market society , since on their theoretical and historical understanding , most of the evils conventionally attributed to market society are actually the product of state intervention itself .
Here , however , it would be a mistake for libertarians to assume that any persisting social evil , once shown not to be an inherent product of market society per se , must then be either a pure artefact of state intervention , or else not importantly bad after all .
Libertarian feminism , then , should seek to shift the radical feminist consensus away from state action as much as possible ; but the shift should not be the shift away from radicalism that libertarian feminists such as McElroy and Taylor have envisioned .
In an important sense , putting the “ libertarian ” in “ libertarian feminism ” will not be importing anything new into radical feminism at all ; if anything , it is more a matter of urging feminists to radicalize the insights into male power and state power that they have already developed , and to expand the state - free politics that they have already put into practice .
Similarly , a radical libertarianism aligned with a radical feminism may confront many concerns that are new to 20th century libertarians ; but in confronting them they will only be returning to their 19th century roots , and radicalizing the individualist critique of systemic political violence and its cultural preconditions to encompass those forms faced by female individuals as well as male .
Libertarianism and feminism are , then , two traditions — and , at their best , two radical traditions — with much in common , and much to offer one another .
We applaud the efforts of those who have sought to bring them back together ; but too often , in our judgment , such efforts have proceeded on the assumption that the libertarian tradition has everything to teach the feminist tradition and nothing to learn from it .
Feminists have no reason to embrace a union on such unequal terms .
Happily , they need not .
If libertarian feminists have resisted some of the central insights of the feminist tradition , it is in large part because they have feared that acknowledging those insights would mean abandoning some of the central insights of the libertarian tradition .
But what the example of the 19th century libertarian feminists should show us — and should help to illuminate ( to both libertarians and feminists ) in the history of Second Wave feminism — is that the libertarian critique of state power and the feminist critique of patriarchy are complementary , not contradictory .
The desire to bring together libertarianism and feminism need not , and should not , involve calling on either movement to surrender its identity for the sake of decorum .
This marriage can be saved : as it should be , a marriage of self - confident , strong - willed , compassionate equals .
The European commission is to investigate claims the CIA is holding al - Qaida captives at Soviet era compounds in eastern Europe .
The detention centres are part of a global internment network that includes Guantánamo Bay , Cuba and the Bagram air base in Afghanistan , according to the Washington Post .
The facilities - referred to as " black sites " in classified White House and CIA documents - allow the US agency to hold terror suspects for as long as it likes , but virtually nothing is known about who is kept in them .
Poland and Romania are thought the most likely locations in Europe , according to the New York - based Human Rights Watch and Polish press reports .
If the reports are true , the secret jails would violate European human rights law prohibiting unlawful detention .
A commission spokesman said it would informally question the 25 national governments on the claims .
" We have to find out what is exactly happening .
We have all heard about this , then we have to see if it is confirmed , " he said .
Hungary , Slovakia and Bulgaria have denied involvement .
The Czech interior minister , Frantiszek Bublan , said the US had approached Prague to build a camp but the request was turned down .
Bulgaria and Romania are scheduled to join the European Union in 2007 and are compelled to sign up to EU human rights standards .
Eight other former Soviet bloc nations , including the Czech Republic and Poland , became members in May 2004 .
Eastern European Nato members have been some of Washington 's staunchest allies in the " war on terror " and in Iraq .
The Washington Post said it knew the names of the European countries involved but was withholding them at the request of US officials , who argued disclosure could act as a spur to terrorist reprisals .
The exact location of the facilities is known only to a handful of officials in the US and the host countries .
The internment network as a whole has been kept almost entirely secret from the US Congress , which is charged with overseeing the CIA 's covert actions .
The report said the CIA was holding the top 30 al - Qaida suspects at the secret facilities , where they were kept in dark cells , sometimes underground , in isolation from the outside world .
They have no recognised legal rights , and no one outside the CIA is allowed to talk to them or see them .
The covert prison system was set up nearly four years ago in eight countries , including a facility in Thailand that was closed down after its existence was made public in 2003 .
Concerns over the CIA 's handling of prisoners escalated last week after it emerged that the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , and the agency 's director , Porter Goss , asked Congress to exempt the agency from legislation banning the cruel and degrading treatment of prisoners .
Sources told the Washington Post that the process has caused considerable internal debate within the CIA , where there is concern about the legality , morality and practicality of the system .
