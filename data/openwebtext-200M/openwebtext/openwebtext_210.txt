Ronald D. Moore , the executive producer who runs " Battlestar Galactica , " is gearing up for the long goodbye by taking on a new task .
He will step into the director ’s chair for the first time next season as his dramatic reinvention of the hokey 1970s ’ space opera treks toward the end .
The final 20 - episode run will kick off in — you read it here first — early April .
Moore ’s work on the show as a writer - producer landed " Battlestar " its first Emmy nomination in the drama writing category , where he faced off against the writers of " The Sopranos " and " Lost . "
A veteran of the " Star Trek " series " The Next Generation , " " Deep Space Nine " and " Voyager , " Moore is also juggling writing duties for the upcoming feature films " The Thing " and the sequel to " I , Robot . "
About his directing debut , Moore said , " It ’s the perfect opportunity to try and do it here with my family — the cast and crew of the show — who have been working together for years now .
" For all I know , I ’ll hate directing , but right now I ’m hungry for it . "
Story Highlights • NEW : Anti-war protesters disrupt Democratic press conference
• Bush says budget can be balanced by 2012
• President requests line - item veto power
• Democrat - controlled Congress takes office on Thursday

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress traded jabs over the budget Wednesday in what could be an indication of partisan fights to come .
In a White House statement and Wall Street Journal opinion piece Wednesday , the president asked lawmakers to give the White House line - item veto power to control spending .
As he prepares to deal with a Congress controlled by Democrats for the first time , Bush is also asking lawmakers to extend tax cuts .
" We 've got to make sure we spend the people 's money wisely , " the president said in a Rose Garden statement .
( Watch Bush declare what he sees as the ' most urgent needs of our nation ' )
The White House and Congress need to " keep this economy growing by making tax relief permanent , " Bush said .
Democrats were immediately circumspect .
( Interactive : Democrats ' priorities )
" I know people do n't like to pay taxes , but the fact of the matter is , is that this administration has produced a record deficit that is really threatening in long measure our ability to make the kind of investments we need to keep America safe , " Sen .
Mary Landrieu , D- Louisiana , said in a Fox News interview .
" We hope that when the president says ' compromise , ' it means more than ' do it my way , ' which is what he 's meant in the past , " Sen .
Charles Schumer , D - New York , said in a statement .
The line - item veto would allow the president to cut specific spending from legislation without vetoing the entire bill .
Previous presidents have also asked for line - item veto authority , but Congress has been unwilling to grant it , fearing that it would infringe on legislative power .
Congress granted President Clinton a form of the line - item veto , but the Supreme Court struck it down , saying it violated the Constitution 's separation of powers .
In the opinion piece , Bush warned that the Democrat - controlled Congress risks stalemate if it resorts to " politics as usual " and tries to " pass bills that are simply political statements . "
" It 's time to set aside politics and focus on the future , " he said in the statement .
" I 'm hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can find common ground to serve our folks , to do our jobs , to be constructive for our country . "
The new Congress takes office on Thursday .
The 110th Congress will be the first time Democrats have controlled the House and the Senate in 12 years .
( Watch what poll finds about expectations of new Congress )
In February , Bush will submit a proposal to balance the federal budget by 2012 , he said Wednesday .
The plan will make defense against terrorism a budget priority while preserving tax cuts that Bush said have led to an improving economy .
Lawmakers must then tackle entitlement programs , Bush said .
" We need to reform Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid so future generations of Americans can benefit from these vital programs without bankrupting our country , " he said .
Line - item veto power would be a key tool in entitlement reform , Bush said , because money that could be used there is now wasted in a " secretive process " that often does n't ever face a vote in Congress .
But incoming House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland , said the line - item veto puts too much power in the hands of the president and cuts the ability of members of Congress to deliver for their constituents .
" Every president would like to say to the Congress only the president can add to the investments in communities , so that Congress would have to come hat in hand to the president to ask for investment " in their home districts , Hoyer said .
The president 's remarks in the Rose Garden came after his first meeting of the year with his Cabinet , whose members flanked Bush as he spoke .
On Wednesday evening , Bush has scheduled a White House reception for leaders of both parties during which he will hold " informal discussions about the year ahead , " administration officials said .
A new plan for Iraq is expected to be discussed , but Bush is not expected to tell the American people about his new war strategy until next week .
( Full story )
In Wednesday 's article , he reiterated his position that U.S. forces must stay in Iraq until the attacks by insurgents end .
" We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war , " he wrote .
A new poll conducted by Opinion Research Corp. for CNN found 77 percent of the 1,019 adults surveyed said they want to see " significant changes " in U.S. policy in Iraq .
The poll also found strong support for the Democrats ' legislative priorities : 87 percent of those polled favor allowing the government to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for senior citizens , 85 percent favor raising the minimum wage , 84 percent favor cutting interest rates on student loans , and 79 percent favor creating an independent panel to oversee ethics in Congress .
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Bush said that he has been encouraged by the productive meetings with the new Democratic leadership .
Protest silences Democrats
Democrats had hoped to present the Democratic takeover of Congress as a well - oiled machine .
However , Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , Democratic Caucus chairman , had to abruptly end a news conference meant to showcase the Democratic ethics legislation when anti-war protesters started chants demanding that the Democrats stop funding the war in Iraq .
" We 're here to let the Democrats know that the grass roots and the anti-war movement elected them to create change , " said Cindy Sheehan , whose son was killed in Iraq , after Emanuel ended the news conference .
Sheehan said she and 70 other protesters intended to hold the Democrats " accountable " and wanted the Democratic leadership to stop authorizing additional funds for the Iraq war .
She said continued funding would make the Democrats " co-conspirators " with the Republicans in what she called " war crimes . "
" There is already enough money in their killing budget to bring the troops home , " Sheehan said .

Protesters and police came face - to - face during the day of action
The BAA protest forms part of 24 hours of " direct action " by the Camp for Climate Action near the airport .
Eight protesters were later arrested after blockading British Airways ' world cargo centre on Sunday night .
The demonstrators were lying on the ground in a circle with their arms encased in steel tubing .
The group stopped vehicles getting into the Eastern Perimeter Road depot in a protest they claimed was highlighting how transporting food by air is contributing to climate change .
Organisers say 1,400 people have been taking part in the day of action , while police at the scene put the number at about 1,000 .
The BBC's Megan Lane , at the BAA offices near the west London airport , said there was a stand - off between the two sides as dusk fell on Sunday evening .
About 100 protesters were sitting down at the entrance to the headquarters ' car park , in the hope of blocking BAA staff from coming into work .
A further 100 or so protesters were supporting those sitting down in the entrance , in Bath Road .
There are certainly times when unlawful action is required in order to force changes that are n't happening fast enough
Alex Harvey
Campaigner
Colourful scenes at protest
Police said if protesters blocked a public highway , they risked being arrested .
Officers moved about 10 protesters , before allowing those clearly inside the grounds to stay .
Earlier , 50 protesters were contained in nearby Mondial Way , following confrontations between police and protesters in which missiles were thrown at officers .
Six people were arrested during the day - two for assault on a police officer , one for carrying Class A drugs , one for criminal damage , one for going equipped to cause criminal damage , and one for failing to give a name and address after anti-social behaviour .
' Pushing and shoving '
Alex Harvey , one of the campaigners at the camp , said the " siege " at BAA would last until Monday morning .
She said it would remain peaceful , but she could not guarantee it would be lawful .
There 's been some pushing and shoving but we 've managed them safely , and they 've been allowed to make their protest , but in a safe way
Commander Jo Kaye , Metropolitan Police
Police said there had been some " pushing and shoving " between the two sides as protesters approached the BAA site .
Commander Jo Kaye of the Metropolitan Police said : " We 've policed a number of marches and actions .
The number of officers and the types of tactics used has varied based on the situation with which we have been faced .
" I have stated right from the start that what we want to do is facilitate lawful protest , that is our duty and something we are committed to doing .
" We have had a very limited dialogue with the organisers and I would call for more - especially as they are continuing with their phase of mass action . "
BAA has said it will not be commenting on the day of action .
Protesters have been at the camp - situated between the M4 motorway and the airport 's northern perimeter in west London - for a week .
Activities have included talks and workshops and some sporadic direct action , such as protesters locking themselves to the gates of a nearby Israeli firm which flies produce to the UK .
Protesters staged a sit-in at BAA 's offices
On Sunday , protesters left the camp in separate groups at midday to begin their march to the BAA site .
Some protesters and members of the local community symbolically walked the 3 km ( 1.8 mile ) route of Heathrow 's proposed third runway .
Banners carried slogans such as " You Fly , They Die " , " Climate Change Kills " and " No Third Runway : Sipson Village RIP " .
Three teenage protesters scaled a fence near BAA , and unfurled a banner saying " Make Planes History " .
Protester Layla Harris said : " We have had enough of the prioritisation of economic growth over the future of our planet .
" We are part of a growing global movement of ordinary people that will stop climate change . "
A fifth terminal will open at Heathrow in March 2008 and a new runway has been proposed by the government for about 2020 .

A California court has issued a preliminary ruling overturning a 2004 election result because of problems stemming from the ( mis ) use of electronic voting machines .
The case concerns the November 2004 elections in Alameda County , which featured a vote on the medical marijuana referendum " Measure R . "
When all the votes were finally counted , the initiative lost by less than 200 votes , and backers of the measure wanted a recount .
When they looked into the election results , questions were raised about the electronic voting machines that the county used , and a lawsuit against the county was filed .
Instead of doing the obvious thing — hanging onto the voting machines in question — county officials shipped them back to Diebold , and the devices ended up in a Texas warehouse .
Members of the plaintiff 's legal team ( which included the EFF ) , flew to Texas in an attempt to find the original audit logs still stored on the devices , but when they arrived at the warehouse , they found that most of the machines had already been wiped .
" Without examining the redundant data , audit logs , and chain - of - custody records , no one can confirm whether any of the reported malfunctions were ever resolved or whether vote data was manipulated or lost , " said EFF staff attorney Matt Zimmerman in a statement .
" As a result , no one can ever confirm whether the vote result announced by the county was correct . "
The judge agreed and issued a tentative ruling against the county , indicating that a revote would need to be held and that plaintiffs would need to be compensated for the cost of their trip to Texas .
In the tentative ruling , the judge said , " The evidence necessary to determine whether Petitioners ' election contest is meritorious has been lost or destroyed due to Respondents ' failure to fulfill its obligation to preserve the information that was reasonable available to them at the time of the recount , and at the time of the filing of this litigation .
Therefore , sanctions the equivalent of issue or terminating sanctions are appropriate . "
Those sanctions will be finalized at a hearing this morning , but results for Measure R have been nullified , and it appears likely that the county will be forced to put the measure to a vote in the next election .
Diebold , which made the voting machines , was famously sued by California 's Attorney General a couple of months before the 2004 election and ended up paying the state cash to fix various problems with security and training .
Earlier this year , the company contemplated leaving the e-voting business over fiascoes like this , which have harmed its reputation .
In the wake of such problems , California has stepped up its standards for e-voting security .
We all know how annoying can spam be .
Although there are highly sophiscated tools nowadays , which can reduce the amount of spam in your mailbox to the minimum , it ’s still at least unpleasent to see all those “ penis enlargement ” mails .
But people working in this “ business ” are n’t safe anymore : Alexey Tolstokozhev ( btw , in Russian his name means ‘ Thick Skin ’ ) , a Russian spammer , was found murdered in his luxury house near Moscow .
He has been shot several times with one bullet stuck in his head .
According to authorities , this last head shot is a clear mark of russian hit men ( known as “ killers ” in Russia ) .
Tolstokozhev was a famous spammer who sent millions of e-mail promoting viagra , cialis , penis enlargement pills and other medications .
Links in these e-mails usually led to some pharmacy shop , which paid Tolstokozhev a share of its revenue .
This is a well known affiliate scheme employed by spammers worldwide .
Tolstokozhev is estimated to be responsible for up to 30 % percent of all viagra and penis enlargement related spam .
In order to send millions and millions of unsolicited letters , Tolstokozhev employed a network of infected computers ( so - called “ botnet ” ) , which he rented from hackers .
How profitable is spam ?
Well , the authorities say that Tolstokozhev has likely made more than $ 2 million in 2007 alone .
( in comparison : average russian monthly salary is $ 400 ) .
This is a second murder of a spammer in Russia .
Another russian spammer , Vardan Kushnir , was assassinated in 2005 .
Did n’t your momma tell you that sending spam is bad ?

As soon as Rep .
Ike Skelton gaveled a joint Congressional hearing to order this morning , protesters could be heard yelling “ war criminal ” at Army Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , who were about to testify about conditions in Iraq .
At least one woman could be heard shouting briefly , before Skelton ( D - MO ) ordered anyone who disrupted the proceedings to be removed from the hearing room .
“ Out they go , ” Skelton said .
He paused a few seconds , then asked no one in particular , “ Are they gone ? ”
Members of the anti-war group Code Pink have been a near constant presence at hearings on the Iraq war , and several members have been removed from hearings and arrested for other Capitol Hill protests .
It was not clear who was removed Monday , nor whether they were arrested or will face criminal charges .
Petraeus and Crocker are making their first appearance on the Hill Monday to assess the results of President Bush ’s troop surge , which began earlier this year .

Last week , we reported on mounting evidence that Comcast is targeting and disrupting BitTorrent traffic on its network .
Further digging by interested parties has turned up more indication that BitTorrent is n't the only popular P2P protocol being tampered with by the United States ' largest ISP .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation noticed the same sort of packet forging that the AP did ( and that Broadband Reports readers did some time ago ) , and continued its testing to see if other applications are affected .
The answer is a disturbing " yes . "
The results of additional testing done by the EFF indicate Comcast is sending forged reset packets with some Gnutella traffic .
When the EFF ran a Gnutella node on a Comcast connection , the forged reset packets disrupted communication between the nodes .
What 's particularly insidious about Comcast 's packet forging is that it 's transparent to both its customers and those on the opposite ends of the connection .
Applications such as BitTorrent and Gnutella retain some of their functionality , but they 'll also appear to malfunction for no apparent reason .
Even if you accept the argument that all P2P traffic is inherently evil , and that Comcast has the right to disrupt it in order to put a stop to copyright infringement , Comcast 's traffic - shaping efforts have apparently extended beyond the realm of P2P and into good old enterprise groupware .
Kevin Kanarski , who works as a Lotus Notes messaging engineer , noticed some strange behavior with Lotus Notes when hooked up to a Comcast connection last month .
When Lotus Notes users attempt to send e-mail with larger attachments over Comcast 's network , Notes will drop its connection .
Instead of a successfully sent e-mail , they 're greeted with the error message , " Remote system no longer responding . "
Kanarski did some digging and has managed to verify that Comcast 's reset packets are the culprit .
Instead of passing the legitimate e-mail through its network , Comcast 's traffic monitoring tool ( likely Sandvine ) is sitting in the middle , imitating both ends of the connection , and sending reset packets to both client and server .
So far , Comcast has been extremely tight - lipped about what 's going on here .
The only thing Comcast will admit to is using " the latest technologies to manage our network to provide a quality experience for all Comcast subscribers . "
From the look of things , that quality experience does n't extend to BitTorrent , Gnutella , and Lotus Notes — and we would n't be surprised to see more applications added to that list .
Whatever its methods and motivations are , Comcast 's actions are giving advocates of network neutrality legislation new ammunition .
Gigi B. Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , said that Comcast 's actions demonstrate the need for legislation .
" Add this incident to the Verizon behavior on text messaging and AT&T 's censoring of the Pearl Jam concert and it's clear that the policymakers who kept saying , ' Wait until there 's a problem ' before acting on legislation to keep the Internet free and non-discriminatory have to wait no longer , " said Sohn in a statement .
" We have a problem , and it 's time to act on it . "
We 've requested comment from Comcast on these latest developments and will update this post as they become available .
In fact , if you insist on code / data separation and you ’re an advocate of OOP , then you ’re talking out of both sides of your mouth .
If your gut reaction to having log entries know how to transform or process themselves is “ woah , that ’s just wrong ” , think again : you ’re imposing a world - view on the problem that ’s not consistent with your notions of data encapsulation and active objects .
Think about this , hard , the next time you are considering the virtues of putting everything in a Relational Database .
Code / data separation means that the applications of the future can operate on the data of today .
Fine .
But then you decide that all applications should access the database through stored procedures , encapsulating the data schema .
You just reversed yourself , you might as well have built middleware in a real programming language and exposed the data through web servcies or REST .
Either approach is fine .
But just recognize that separating code and data works towards the goal of reusability in a manner that is diametrically opposed to building an encapsulation layer .
Though the expansion will increase employment here , historically very few port jobs have gone to low - income residents .
Some critics contend that the main interest of state leaders in spending community development dollars is to help big businesses like shipbuilders and casinos and the port .
The state ’s spending plan “ moves business to the forefront and forgets about the people on the ground , ” said Anthony Thompson , pastor at Tabernacle of Faith Ministries , whose spotless church ( rebuilt by volunteers ) is next to a moldering subsidized housing project that he says has not been touched since the storm .
In his mostly black neighborhood in west Gulfport , Mr. Thompson said , “ I see a lot of people waiting on help ; I see a lot of houses still damaged . ”
State officials say that programs not limited to lower - income residents help them nevertheless .
The aid to utilities helped everyone on the coast , including renters , officials say .
And almost a third of the families who got money from the state ’s main housing compensation program were low - income , which in Gulfport would mean an annual income of less than $ 39,000 a year for a family of four .
The nature of that program helps explain the unhappiness in some neighborhoods .
It provided grants of up to $ 150,000 to homeowners who lived outside of the federally defined flood plain and so did not have flood insurance to cover their losses when their houses were swamped by the storm surge .

To be eligible , families had to have carried regular homeowners ’ insurance , so that , as the governor said when he was selling the plan to Congress , “ we ’re not bailing out irresponsible people . ”
A new report says binge drinking has increased to such an extent that cases of ' exploding bladders ' are on the rise in the UK .
Lucy Atkins reports
When doctors warn of the dangers of binge drinking , exploding bladders may not immediately spring to mind .
However , last week a report in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) made alarming reading .
In the report , the medics discuss the unprecedented appearance in emergency wards of women who have suffered alcohol - induced " bladder rupture " : their bladders have quite literally torn apart under pressure of a big night out .
There are over 28,000 hospital admissions as a result of alcohol misuse each year , and 22,000 premature deaths because of it .
But even so , it must surely be hard to drink so much that your bladder bursts ?
Until now , certainly , doctors expected to see bladder rupture only in people with abnormal or previously damaged bladders , or in men - who were more likely to be hardcore alcoholics .
In fact , alcohol - induced bladder rupture was considered an exclusively male problem .
However , women are now catching up with men when it comes to drinking : 86 % of women , compared with 91 % of men , consume alcohol regularly .
This drunken equality is starting to produce some serious side effects in women too .
In the BMJ report , urologist Dr Mohantha Dooldeniya and colleagues at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield , describe the cases of three young women who came into the hospital during the course of a year , initially confusing the doctors with their symptoms .
Each woman arrived at casualty the day after a bender , feeling significantly more unwell than they might expect to feel , even with the mother of all hangovers .
All complained of lower abdominal pain .
The doctors initially diagnosed a urinary infection in two of these cases , and prescribed antibiotics and rehydration .
However , on further investigation using abdominal scans , they were shocked to discover that the sickness was down to bladder rupture .
With the third case , they first suspected appendicitis because the woman 's pain was quite localised .
However , recalling the two previous cases , they ordered a laparoscopy , which showed that the suspected appendicitis was , indeed , another torn bladder .
In the end , all three women needed to have their bladders sewn back together by surgeons .
The mechanics of this gruesome problem are relatively straightforward .
Alcohol is diuretic - it makes you urinate more - hence the sight of drunk people urinating in the streets on a Saturday night .
Alcohol is also an anaesthetic : it dulls the urge to go .
The combination of large volumes of urine , and a dimmed , possibly non-existent urge to pee can result in a seriously over - full bladder .
While most people will just let the urine out one way or another ( possibly in their sleep ) , some will be so " dulled " that they will not feel the urge to " void " .
If it is not emptied , the bladder will eventually be unable to contain the volume , and - like any over - full bag - can burst apart under the pressure .
A minor trauma - say , falling down and bumping your over - full bladder during a drunken binge - can also increase the likelihood of this happening .
Men and women have different plumbing , and this , along with the fact that until now women have tended to drink much less than men , explains why alcohol - related bladder rupture has historically been a male - only phenomenon .
" Men have a longer urethra than women [ the tube that urine travels down to get out via the normal route ] , " explains Dooldeniya .
" You therefore need a lot more pressure to force the urine out of the bladder through the male urethra .
" We previously thought that women were more likely to leak than to rupture because they have a shorter urethra than men , and therefore it is easier for the urine to be forced out by the pressure , rather than to rupture . "
But this may no longer hold true : only one of the women who came to Pinderfields was a diagnosed alcoholic .
The other two had just been on a heavy night out .
All three were in their 20s to early 30s .
All had previously normal bladders .
" Everyone is different , so it is impossible to put a figure on exactly what volume you would have to consume to rupture your bladder , " says Dooldeniya , " But you would basically have to be so drunk that you can't remember anything , and have lost control over your body . "
The ruptures tend to be about 3 - 4 cm long , and are usually found at the dome , or top of the bladder , the part in women that is not connected to the pelvic bone .
This sounds agonising but , says Dooldeniya , " the bladder itself does not have a good ' nerve ' - so the pain tends not to be localised . "
There may be nausea , vomiting , general lower abdominal pain , fever , a failure to urinate , or urinating only tiny amounts and there may be blood in the urine .
But the symptoms are often general , and can be similar to those of a urinary tract infection ( a common problem for women ) .
The reason people with a ruptured bladder feel so ill is that they are literally being poisoned from the inside : " The urine leaks out and sits in the abdominal cavity , " says Dooldeniya .
" Urine contains toxins excreted by the kidneys .
These toxins are reabsorbed into the bloodstream via the lining of the abdomen , and this causes people to feel very ill , a condition known as uraemia . "
Since most doctors consider bladder rupture to be a very rare male - only catastrophe , it is possible that faced with a woman presenting these symptoms , they may initially misdiagnose the problem .
" We wanted to alert A&E doctors that bladder rupture might be something to consider in younger women presenting with lower abdominal pain , " says Dooldeniya .
Studies of men with burst bladders show a significant mortality rate - 1 - 5 % die of sepsis ( blood poisoning ) .
" We know that the earlier you get treatment for a ruptured bladder , the easier and faster your recovery will be . "
So , how do you know if your hangover is more than just a hangover ?
" The symptoms can be very non-specific , but you 'd know something was wrong , because your hangover would feel different from a normal hangover , " he says .
" The paracetamol or the fry - ups would have no impact . "
Dooldeniya continues : " we did not publish the report to alarm the public .
Though we do n't know the exact numbers , it 's important to remember that ruptured bladders are rare - these are the first documented cases in women in the world . "
It seems safe to say , though , that as the binge - drinking population grows , A&E departments will be seeing more women - and possibly men - in this sorry state .
" It is certainly not an epidemic , " agrees Frank Soodeen , spokesman for Alcohol Concern .
" It seems to be more about a few unlucky people who got completely smashed .
But this new development certainly highlights the fact that the risks of heavy drinking go way beyond liver cirrhosis .
There are any number of ways you can damage your body by drinking too much : this is just one more that most people have never considered " .
The error appeared to be the first major mishap leading to the invalidation of American scores on an international test , Dr. Schneider said .
But a string of similar incidents brought flawed results on other standardized exams , including the SAT ’s and the state math and reading tests used to judge schools under the federal No Child Left Behind Act .
“ We need to recognize that the testing industry is under immense pressure at a time when scores are being given immense importance , ” said Thomas Toch , who wrote a report last year detailing the problems of the American testing industry for Education Sector , an independent policy group , where he is a co-director .
Conducted every three years , the international test focused on science literacy in 2006 , but also included sections on reading and math .
The problem with last fall ’s test was that pages in the exam booklet were assigned incorrect numbers .
As a result , questions referred students to texts , said to be “ on the opposite page , ” but in reality printed on a previous page .
Nobody  not officials at the testing firm , within the federal government or at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  noticed the error until July 2007 , Dr. Schneider said .
Then O.E.C.D. experts concluded that the error had ruined the reading scores , and threw them out .
The same error affected math and science scores to a lesser degree , and they were not invalidated .
The contractor that printed the tests , RTI International , based in Research Triangle Park , N.C. , will repay the $ 500,000 it received for the reading part of the test as part of its overall $ 2 million contract to administer the exam .
The firm has 13 active contracts with the Department of Education , worth $ 196 million .
Patrick Gibbons , a spokesman , said that the contractor took “ great care ” to provide reliable research results , but that in this case quality - control procedures failed .
China is thought to be the highest emitter of CO2
Climate research body the Tyndall Centre , using 2004 data , estimates the emissions are double those of Britain for the same period .
It wants rich nations to take the lead in cutting the pollution they cause .
In the last year , UK imports from China rose by 10 % , nearing 6.5 million tonnes , according to a recent study .
' Rethink needed '
The Tyndall Centre report concludes that in 2004 - the most recent year in which comprehensive data is available - net exports from China accounted for 23 % of its total CO2 emissions .
The authors said the emission levels are due to China 's trade surplus , but are also due to the relatively high level of carbon intensity within the Chinese economy .
The report said : " The extent of ' exported carbon ' from China should lead to some rethinking by government negotiators as they work towards a new climate change agreement .
" It suggests that a focus on emissions within national borders may miss the point .
Whilst the nation state is at the heart of most international negotiations and treaties , global trade means that a country 's carbon footprint is international .
" Should countries be concerned with emissions within their borders ( as is currently the case ) , or should they also be responsible for emissions due to the production of goods and services they consume ? "
China is believed to be the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide .
The FCC , headed up by Bush crony Kevin Martin , is laying plans to take from you freedom of the Media , that is if you let them .
And yes , you can stop them , if enough of us join together to form a formidable army of opposition .
With millions of Internet users and a multitude of even more Newspaper readers , TV watchers , and Radio listeners , one would think stopping the grab would be a slam - dunk .
Do n’t kid yourself .
The enemy , those who would steal your freedom of the press , is counting on you sitting on your duff only to whine when the hammer falls .
The time to take action is now .
Martin plans to eliminate on December 11th , the FCC regulation that stops Conglomerate ownership of a Newspaper , a Radio Station , and / or a Television Station in the same City .
This is a protection for the public from a Media that could be utilized , by those like Bush and his Cronies ; to subject the area public with saturated 24/7 propaganda , spun news , and likely censorship .
Imagine that if all the news and information you could get came from one source , could you ever be sure of just what exactly was going on .
For an illustrative scenario read the book 1984 by George Orwell .
They are also after the Internet .
See , the Bush appointee Kevin Bush ( and his Big Business Corporate Friends ) would have you believe that the Internet is going to crash and at that time you will lose your Internet and only if you give it away to them now can it be saved .
The FCC underlying message is this : “ By Internet Users taking control of their Internet , they are straining the net to its top the limit .
The only way to save the Internet from the coming “ exaflood ” , as Martin proposes ( as reported to USA ) , is to pay usage money and Federal Dollars to the likes of AT&T and let them gut Net Neutrality protections so they can fix the problem .
Ever wonder how the Internet got to its current level without Government control ?
Do you think the Net would be so successful if it had been managed by the Government all along ?
Ok , Ok , that was a dumb question .
Just what might be the real problem ?
Being an old retired Engineering type I recall problem solving being accomplished by the “ Peel the Onion Exercise ” .
Works like this :
Peel the first layer of the onion and see what is revealed .
I believe that if you peel off that first layer you will find who will benefit from the proposed FCC change .
See what I ’m saying ?
It ai n’t you is it ?
Yep , there , laid bare , is the real winner - Corporate control of the Media .
Agree ?
Peel the next layer and see a developing incestuous relationship between Government and Corporate America .
Lets see , 1+1 =Control + Power ,
Ok now we ’re in trouble .
Are we about to lose our Freedoms , maybe our Democracy ?
What is freedom of the press worth to you ?
I submit it is worth every thing you ever had and every thing you ever would have .
You do n’t have to give it up without a fight .
I said earlier that the time to take action is now .
How do you do that ?
Simply by clicking below a message will be sent for you , or you may write your own message .
I was originally writing a much more ambitious post that tried to introduce category theory and its uses , but have been having a hard time writing it .
Unfortunately it is not something that I think can be easily explained tersely , although my attempts to do so have lead me to learn a lot more about category theory than I thought I ’d ever want to know .
Yet , I would still like to expose monads in a way that Schemers and Lispers would relate to them and perhaps grok the potential usefulness of the concept , which at times may seem to be a strange dodge performed by those “ pure ” functional people .
I am forgoing some of the background theory I learned in exchange for trying to highlight some of the key ideas as applied to writing programs by example and narrative .
The only obvious prerequisite knowledge here is that of higher order functions and using functions as data .
These concepts are well - covered and taught by a variety of computer science texts , such as the venerable SICP , webcast university lectures , and many other mediums .
I assert that this is an important prerequisite because monads provide you is a rigorous and structured abstraction for dealing with data transformations and the application of higher order functions .
Maybe
Consider the “ Maybe ” monad that is often used as a primer .
We ’re going to offer a quick rough translation into Scheme .
The semantics we ’re interested in of the Maybe monad are as follows :
Any function should be able to be applied to the monad
Not necessarily successfully such as in the case of a type error , although with a little more work we could get these semantics as well via dynamic - wind or unwind - protect .
The monad will prevent us from operating on the value NIL , and instead simply ignore computations that would attempt to operate on NIL .
This is similar to how computer architecture will propagate NaNs in computations .
We only need three tools to get this behavior :
A procedure to construct the monad from some object in the category of Scheme values A procedure to transform functions that would normally operate on those values into a function that will operate on the monad value A procedure to merge double - wrapped “ Maybe ” monads to normalize them
Without further ado , here are some function definitions :
( define ( make - maybe value ) value ) ( define ( map - function - to - maybe fn ) ( lambda ( maybe- object ) ( if ( null ? maybe- object ) '( ) ( make - maybe ( fn maybe - object ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( join - maybe maybe - object ) maybe - object )
This may seem incredibly pointless , but consider this motivating example :
> ( define maybe - cdr ( map- function - to - maybe cdr ) ) > ( maybe -cdr ( make - maybe ' ( 1 2 ) ) ) ( 2 ) > ( maybe - cdr ( maybe-cdr ( make - maybe ' ( 1 2 ) ) ) ) ( ) > ( maybe - cdr ( maybe - cdr ( maybe -cdr ( maybe-cdr ( make - maybe ' ( 1 2 ) ) ) ) ) ) ()
As you can see you would have normally had to have check for NIL values to prevent crashing in the last expression , but we now have a generic way to instrument functions with checks .
The result is a function that accepts and returns the monad ’s type .
This is the essence of Functors ( of which monads are a special type of ) to take home : Functors are morphisms between categories , categories themselves contain objects and morphisms , and in order to a be a functor we must be able to transform both the objects in a category and the morphisms between them .
There are few additional properties and rules to be considered a functor or monad that can be useful in proving correctness or getting certain guaranteed behavior , but the main take - away idea is writing a uniform “ layer ” that will map both functions and the data they operate on to another “ type ” with different semantics .
Monads also have to obey rules for compositions of “ join ” and “ map ” to maintain invariants , but it is sometimes okay to bend these rules : there are many not - quite - monad functors that can prove very useful .
Consider the monad and the functor as guiding metaphors .
Moving on :
Why do we bother at all with make - maybe and join - maybe ?
It so happens that the underlying representation is simple in this case ( since we only need to tweak functions ) and thus the construction and join operators are trivial .
This would not be the case in say , Haskell , where the typing system will prevent happy accidents like this one ; ( make - maybe ( make - maybe ‘ ( 7 ) ) ) would actually have a double - wrapped Maybe - type and “ join ” would have to do some thinking on how to sensibly put the nested Maybes together .
( This is also called “ multiplication ” in category theory parlance )
Also notice there is no way to “ get out of ” the monad .
Getting “ out of ” the monad type is an additional functionality that goes above and beyond what it means to be a monad ; it would be a monad with an additional transformation to whatever is seen to be fit .
However , once again , dynamic typing provides us a happy accident in this particular case and we can actually use this particular monad ’s representation directly in our programs .
Generally this is not the case and probably should not be encouraged : one should think carefully before breaking into a monad to deal with its representation ad - hoc , otherwise we lose some benefits of containment .
List , the monad you ’ve used before
Let ’s just rephrase “ list ” as a monad here :
( define ( make - list value ) ( list value ) ) ( define ( map - function - to - list fn ) ( lambda ( list - object ) ;; " Map " has the proper return type " for free " ( map fn list - object ) ) ) ( define ( join - list value ) ( apply append value ) )
We have now defined a monad .
Again , it may seem stupidly trivial , but consider what it has in common with “ Maybe ” :
We can accept anything and create a list monad instance
We have some transformation that modifies a function to operate on list - monads instances .
We can get rid of monad layers Notice that this definition maintains composition , a useful property of monads .
This means you can perform a map of a join and then another join on the result or simply perform two joins to get the same value .
This presumes the lists are well - formed , i.e. have no non-lists as elements when join is called .
Otherwise we rightly should have a type error because you are applying “ join ” to a non-list , although you could imagine writing a more forgiving implementation with Maybe - like qualities , or force all internal values to be singleton lists rather than scalars .
Such is the flexibility of thinking in terms of this abstraction .
We have no way of getting anything out of the monad , and this time it ’s more visible : we can never go from ‘ ( 1 ) -> 1 , unless we provide another transformation , such as “ car ” , which would have the type “ List - Monad -> * ” .
Something less contrived , a “ Watchful ” monad
The final example I will be presenting here is not - quite useful , but pretty close .
It is not complicated , but it is non-trivial .
We seek to accomplish the simple task of letting us hook into the application of a function to a value , useful in debugging or notifying other components of a system of changes .
This is often a task given over to mutation because it ’s a pain to pass around this state all the time .
Here is an attempt to try to give an alternative to mutating global state while allowing arbitrary procedures to be notified of when a value is being operated on by any function that has been transformed by our “ map- function - to - watchful ” procedure .
I implement some simple functionality using this monad to attach arbitrary functions ( called “ snoopers ” ) that are allowed to look at the value being passed to a function being applied to the monad and their own previous state .
In this section I will first show how one can use define and use the snoopers , how using them appears in an interpreter , and then finally the monad implementation itself .
Using the Watchful monad
Here is how one would define some “ snoopers ” to watch a value , along with defining a watched - value instantiation for the number zero .
;; Some watchers ( define ( modification - watcher state thing ) ;; Counts the number of times the value has functions applied to it .
;; Notice that we do not use " thing , " but we must accept it to have the ;; proper number of arguments ( if ( null ? state ) 1 (+ state 1 ) ) ) ( define ( previous - values - watcher state thing ) ;;
Retains previous values in the stat ( cons thing state ) ) ;; Using watchers ;; Add both watchers , notice how each add - watcher call returns a monad in turn .
( define zero - being - watched ( add - watcher previous - values - watcher ( add - watcher modification - watcher ( make - watchful 0 ) ) ) ) ;;
Let 's transform a function ... say an increment function ( define watcher - incr ( map - function - to - watchful ( lambda ( x ) (+ x 1 ) ) ) )
Showing use of the watched - value and the watch - increment function in the interpreter
Here ’s an example interaction :
> zero-being - watched ( (( #< procedure : previous - values - watcher > ( ) ) ( #< procedure : modification - watcher > ( ) ) ) . 0 ) 0 )
> ( watcher - incr zero - being - watched ) ( (( #< procedure : previous - values - watcher > ( 0 ) ) ( #< procedure:modification - watcher > 1 ) ) .
1 )
> ( watcher - incr ( watcher - incr zero - being - watched ) ) ( (( #< procedure : previous - values - watcher > ( 1 0 ) ) ( #< procedure:modification - watcher > 2 ) ) .
2 )
> ( watcher - incr ( watcher - incr ( watcher - incr zero - being - watched ) ) ) ( (( #< procedure : previous - values - watcher > ( 2 1 0 ) ) ( #< procedure:modification - watcher > 3 ) ) .
3 )
As you may be able to tell from the above , the internal representation format of the monad is an association list paired with the watched value .
That association list contains procedures and state that they are allowed to store things in ( you could do an even cleaner job with continuations , but then they would n’t print as nicely ) , so right now all state - saving has to be done explicitly .
If this example were to be used for anything serious one would have to fix up a couple of things , but it ’s pretty functional as - is ( And purely functional in the other meaning of the word ) .
The following definition is not as long as it looks ; there are lots of comments and some stuff ( like filter and the merge - and - remove - duplicates for “ join ” ) that eat up lines without being intrinsically related to monads .
There is no subtle twist ; it ’s exactly the same as the previous two examples ( make , map , and join ) with an additional function ( add - watcher ) that operates on the monad directly to add snoopers .
Notice that functions passed through map - function - to - watchful are instrumented to call all the snoopers and construct a new list full of the procedure reference and the new state each snooper returns for its next invocation .
One final thing deserving explanation is that my add - watcher reuses the join operator : basically , I construct a new monad with the input monad as the wrapped value , then run join .
This is so that I can get the duplication elimination and state list construction for free .
It certainly makes the definition of add - watcher short .
( Despite its relatively huge commenting )
The watchful monad implementation
;; Watchful Monad ( define ( make - watchful value ) ;; the car of the monad is a list of snoopers , the cdr is the value being watched ;;
Each snooper is in the form ( function state ) , where state is returned ; ; by the snooper after every invocation so it can store things as it chooses . ;;
The snooper function should accept two args : state and data , so that they ; ; can have some memory and report on the data being operated on by the ; ; watched procedure .
( cons '( ) value ) ) ( define ( map - function - to - watchful fn ) ( lambda ( watchful - object ) ( let* ( ( snoopers ( car watchful - object ) ) ( arg - data ( cdr watchful - object ) ) ) ;;
Compute new snooper state , now they all know what " fn " is operating on .
( cons ( map ( lambda ( snooper ) ( let ( ( snooper - fn ( car snooper ) ) ( snooper - state ( cadr snooper ) ) ) ( list snooper - fn ( snooper - fn snooper - state arg - data ) ) ) ) snoopers ) ( fn arg - data ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( join - watchful value ) ( letrec ( ( inner - snoopers ( car ( cdr value ) ) ) ( outer - snoopers ( car value ) ) ( inner- value ( cddr value ) ) ;;
The standard " filter " we all know and love , but not included in ;; R5RS ( filter ( lambda ( predicate seq ) ( if ( null ? seq ) '( ) ( if ( predicate ( car seq ) ) ( cons ( car seq ) ( filter predicate ( cdr seq ) ) ) ( filter predicate ( cdr seq ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;;
Merge the outer - snoopers and inner-snoopers , outer - snoopers win in event ; ; of a collision , which in this case means the same procedure with the same ;; state .
( cons ( append outer - snoopers ( filter ( lambda ( inner - snooper ) ( not ( member inner- snooper outer - snoopers ) ) ) inner-snoopers ) ) inner-value ) ) ) ;; functions that operate on the watcher - monad directly ( e.g. Watcher - Monad -> Watcher - Monad ) ( define ( add - watcher watcher - fn watcher - object ) ;; watcher - fn must accept two args : state and the value in the monad when a ;; function is called on that value and return a new state .
We abuse the ;; join - watchful function I wrote by first encapsulating the watcher - object ;; as a value inside another watcher - object and then employing " join - watchful " ( join - watchful ;;
We make a singleton assoc - list with watcher - fn with state NIL to start . ;;
We know our monad internally is just a cons pair , for brevity break the ; ; abstraction here ... ( cons ` ( ( , watcher - fn ( ) ) ) watcher - object ) ) )
Conclusion
Hopefully these examples shed more light on monads and their uses for those who come from the Lisp - ish backgrounds , or dynamic typing backgrounds in general .
I often found the Haskell - annotated versions caught up in typing which sometimes made it more difficult than absolutely necessary to explain the generalities the idea and motivation for monads with languages where mutation is more convenient and typing is more relaxed .
As such , I wrote this for the programmer already adept in using higher order functions and thinking of functions as data yet unsure of what the fuss is about monads and how they can be useful .
For the first time since the Carter administration , homeownership in the United States is set to decline over a president ’s tenure .
When President Bush took office in 2001 , homeownership stood at 67.6 percent .
It rose as the mortgage bubble inflated but is projected to fall to 67 percent by early 2009 , which would come to 700,000 fewer homeowners than when Mr. Bush started .
The decline , calculated by Moody ’s Economy.com , is inexorable unless the government launches a heroic effort to help hundreds of thousands of defaulting borrowers stay in their homes .
These days , modest relief efforts are in short supply , let alone heroic ones .
Some officials seem to think that assistance would violate the tenet of personal responsibility that borrowers should not take out loans they cannot afford .
That is simplistic .
The foreclosure crisis is rooted in reckless  and shamefully underregulated  mortgage lending .
Many homeowners  mainly subprime borrowers with low incomes and poor credit  are now stuck in adjustable - rate loans that have become unaffordable as monthly payments have spiked upward .
Their predicament is not entirely of their own making , and even if it were they would need to be bailed out because mass foreclosures would wreak unacceptable damage on the economic and social life of the nation .
The relief efforts so far have been too little , too late .
In August , the White House established a program to allow an additional 80,000 borrowers to refinance their loans through the Federal Housing Administration  on top of 160,000 who were already eligible .
That ’s not enough .
Foreclosure filings soared to nearly 244,000 in August alone .
Although it can't be shown as the direct cause , global warming like we 're experiencing now has taken place during past mass extinctions .

Do you ever walk around with the vague feeling that you 're going to die soon ?
That could be because -- according a recent study -- the Earth might be due for a catastrophic mass extinction .
Population ecologists -- scientists who study the relationship between species and the environment -- from the Universities of York and Leeds in Great Britain took a closer look at the fossil record recently .
They found that , historically speaking , we 're living in a climate that traditionally has seen the extinction of large numbers of species .

The fossil record is the history of our planet .
It 's composed of information gathered from fossils , rock layers , ice samples and other geological phenomena .
When put together , this information forms a picture of life and climate on Earth over the past 550 million years .
The population ecologists compared 520 million years of Earth 's climate change with species extinction throughout the same period .
What they found is somewhat alarming .
During times of cool weather -- called icehouse periods -- biodiversity thrives .
Biodiversity is the presence of a large number of different species .
If an ecosystem ( or planet ) is diverse , then the conditions are right to support evolution , reproduction and genetic divergence .
In other words , if our planet was a business , then biodiversity means business is good .
But during warm greenhouse periods , biodiversity suffers .
This lack of biodiversity appears to be due to mass extinction -- the loss of large numbers of different species .
According to the British population ecologists ' study , as the global climate has heated up in the past , large numbers of species have died out .
So why might this be a big deal for us ?
Some of the worst mass extinctions found in the fossil record took place during climates very similar to the one in which we currently live .
The York and Leeds researchers suggest that , based on predicted increases in temperatures over this century , Earth could see another mass extinction event as soon as a few generations from now .
That means our younger readers ' grandchildren could be around when this mass extinction occurs .
But science can't say for certain that it will .
There 's no evidence that periods of global warming have been directly responsible for mass extinctions .
But researchers are able to show direct correlations between global warming and mass extinctions in the past .
Higher temperatures loom conspicuously during these periods of extinction .
The worst mass extinction found in the fossil record took place 251 million years ago , during the Permian Period at the end of the Paleozoic Era .
At that time , 95 percent of all of the species on Earth met their demise [ source : University of York ] .
No one can say exactly why this mass extinction took place .
Some scientists believe that a series of comets hit the planet and caused the oceans to become acidic ( also creating acid rain inland ) .
Others believe that poisonous gas from erupting volcanoes caused the same acidic cataclysm .
Either way , it 's clear that during this same period the global temperature also rose .
Regardless , why should we humans care if the planet may soon see another mass extinction like the one at the end of the Permian Period ?
After all , we 've beaten acid rain before .
And even if it gets hot outside , we have air conditioners .
We ( and our pets ) should be okay , even if a mass extinction occurs -- right ?
Probably not .
Find out on the next page why losing 95 percent of all species is really , really bad for the surviving 5 percent .

Fuel protesters could cripple Britain with rolling roadblocks within the next ten days in response to soaring petrol prices , it was claimed last night .
The average price of petrol broke through the £ 1 barrier last week for the first time , angering hauliers .
And Transaction 2007 , the reincarnation of organisations involved in the 2000 fuel protests , has warned of imminent action .
A spokesman for the group said : " I think it will happen in the next seven to ten days .
I can't say much about it . "
During the blockades of seven years ago hospital operations had to be cancelled because NHS staff could not get to work , while supermarkets were forced to ration food because of shortages .
As the cost of oil soared towards $ 100 ( £ 47.70 ) a barrel last week , retailers warned that prices at the pumps will rise by a further 3 p a litre before Christmas .
According to the AA , the average petrol price in the UK last week was 100.08 p per litre .
At the start of the year , it was 88.32 p .
Fuel protester and member of Transaction 2007 Andrew Spence , a former BNP candidate , said he 'd attended a ' secret summit ' at which business leaders had demanded a new blockade .
The father - of - three said : " We 'll be firing a message to the Government which can't be ignored in the next week . "
He confirmed that protests would " definitely " include blockades of terminals .
But Mr Spence , 37 , a farmer from Leadgate , County Durham , assured drivers their interests would come first .
" This is n't a case of our group flexing its muscles , " he said .
" This is to send a message to the Treasury that drivers can't cope . "
The Road Haulage Association said hauliers were frustrated by the high prices and said duty rates were much higher in Britain than in other European countries .
Jack Semple , RHA director of policy , said : " Prices have gone up every week for the past ten weeks .
" The impact of that is quite a severe one for very many hauliers .
There should n't be an increase in fuel duty at a time of clear volatility in oil prices . "

World 's Smallest Radio Fits in the Palm of the Hand . . . of an Ant
Single carbon nanotube is fully functional radio , receiving music over standard radio bandwidth
This image , taken by a transmission electron microscope , shows the carbon - nanotube radio .
October 31 , 2007
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
Harnessing the electrical and mechanical properties of the carbon nanotube , a team of researchers has crafted a working radio from a single fiber of that material .
Fixed between two electrodes , the vibrating tube successfully performed the four critical roles of a radio -- antenna , tunable filter , amplifier and demodulator -- to tune in a radio signal generated in the room and play it back through an attached speaker .
Functional across a bandwidth widely used for commercial radio , the tiny device could have applications far beyond novelty , from radio - controlled devices that could flow in the human bloodstream to highly efficient , miniscule , cell phone devices .
Developed at the National Science Foundation 's ( NSF ) Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems , a research team led by Alex Zettl of the University of California at Berkeley announced the findings online on Oct. 31 , 2007 ( http://pubs.acs.org/journals/nalefd/index.html).
The findings are scheduled to be printed in Nano Letters in November .
" This breakthrough is a perfect example of how the unique behavior of matter in the nanoworld enables startling new technologies , " says Bruce Kramer , a senior advisor for engineering at NSF and the officer overseeing the center 's work .
" The key functions of a radio , the quintessential device that heralded the electronic age , have now been radically miniaturized using the mechanical vibration of a single carbon nanotube . "
The source content for the first laboratory test of the radio was " Layla , " by Derek and the Dominos , followed soon after by " Good Vibrations " by the Beach Boys .
One of the primary goals for the center is to develop minuscule sensors that can communicate wirelessly , says Zettl .
" A key issue is how to integrate individual molecular - scale components together into a system that maintains the nanometer scale .
The nanoradio achieves this by having one molecular structure , the nanotube , simultaneously perform all critical functions , " he adds .
The new device works in a manner more similar to the vacuum tubes from the 1930s than the transistors found in modern radios .
In the new radio , a single carbon fiber a few hundred nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) long , and only a few molecules thick , stands glued to a negatively charged base of tungsten that acts as a cathode .
Roughly one millionth of a meter directly across from the base lies a positively charged piece of copper that acts as an anode .
Power in the form of streaming electrons travels from an attached battery through the cathode , into the nanotube , and across a vacuum to the anode via a field - emission tunneling process .
" The field emission process could be likened to a runner jumping across a ditch ; you only make it across if you have enough speed , i.e. energy , to begin with , " says Zettl .
" So electrons jump the physical gap from cathode to anode when you supply enough energy to the device from the battery . "
The stream of electrons along the nanotube changes when a radio wave encoded with information -- simply a wave of photons that travels in a controlled manner -- washes across the tube and causes it to resonate .
This mechanical action is what amplifies and demodulates , or decodes , the radio signal .
Returning to Zettl 's runner analogy , the vibrating nanotube is akin to a ditch with a constantly changing width .
Just as the runner 's chances of making the leap depend on how far the gap is , the chances of electrons making the leap depend on the distance of the nanotube tip from the anode .
" This coupling of the mechanical waving motion of the nanotube to the success rate of electrons jumping the gap is key to the functioning of the radio , " says Zettl .
" What emerges from the anode is then the information signal , which can be transferred to additional amplifiers and a speaker to reveal the originally encoded music or any other data . "
By permanently lengthening or shortening the nanotube , a modification resulting from sending a short - lived larger - than - normal electrical current through the device , the researchers were able to control the frequency of the radio signal that the device could receive .
The researchers believe it would be easy to produce such nanotube radios for receiving signals in the 40 -400 megahertz range , a range within which most FM radio broadcasts fall .
The researchers fine tune the nanoradio to a frequency , akin to a channel , by using the electrostatic field between the cathode and anode to tighten or loosen the nanotube , a process the researchers relate to the tightening or loosening of a string on a guitar .
According to Zettl , the sensitivity of the nanotube radio can be enhanced by attaching an external antenna or by using an array of nanotubes that maintain the extremely small size .
While the concept of a miniaturized receiver for picking up broadcast music signals has appeal , the technology has the potential to assist in a range of interesting uses .
Adds Bruce Kramer , " The application of a fully functioning radio receiver less than 50 millionths of an inch in length and one millionth of an inch in diameter potentially allows the radio control of almost anything , from a single receiver in a living cell to a vast array embedded in an airplane wing . "
The lead author on the study was graduate student Kenny Jensen from Zettl 's research group and he was joined on the paper by postdoctoral researcher Jeff Weldon and graduate student Henry Garcia , also members of the Zettl group at the University of California at Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
In addition to support from NSF , the work also received funding from the Department of Energy .
The research was supported through NSF award number EEC - 0425914 .

LEXINGTON , Ky . ( Nov. 1 , 2007 ) − Nursing mothers need n't worry .
A new study shows that breastfeeding does not increase breast sagging .
University of Kentucky plastic surgeon Dr. Brian Rinker and his colleagues conducted the study with patients at UK HealthCare Cosmetic Surgery Associates .
The study found that breastfeeding does not adversely affect breast shape .
" A lot of times , if a woman comes in for a breast lift or a breast augmentation , she 'll say ' I want to fix what breastfeeding did to my breasts ' , " Rinker said .
As a result , Rinker decided to find out if breast sagging was a direct result of breastfeeding .
Rinker and his colleagues interviewed 132 women who had come to UK for a breast lift or augmentation between 1998 and 2006 .
The women were , on average , 39 years old ; 93 percent had had at least one pregnancy , and most of the mothers - - 58 percent -- had breastfed at least one child .
Additionally , the research team evaluated the patients ' medical history , body mass index , pre-pregnancy bra cup size , and smoking status .
The results showed no difference in the degree of breast ptosis ( TOE - sis ) - the medical term for sagging of the breast -- for those women who breastfed and those who did n't .
However , researchers found that several other factors did affect breast sagging , including age , the number of pregnancies , and whether the patient smoked .
" Smoking breaks down a protein in the skin called elastin , which gives youthful skin its elastic appearance and supports the breast ... so it would make sense that it would have an adverse effect on the breasts , " Rinker concluded .
Rinker presented the findings of the study this week at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons conference in Baltimore .

Erlangを始めてから感じたことは，今までPerlでやっていた時に比べて，いろいろなやり方が出来るようになる，ということ．Webアプリに限らず，いろいろなアプリケーションで，より柔軟な設計が出来るようになると思う．Perl（や同種のスクリプト言語では）基本的に1プロセス1スレッドの範囲内に縛られていて，コストを考えるとコードの一部の処理だけ並列処理することは出来なかったし，複数のプロセスでデータを共有しようと思うと基本的にはDBに入れるしかなかった．たとえば，Perlで作られている大規模なサイトでは，DBの負荷を軽減するためにmemcachedが使われていることが多い．もしErlangでサイトを作っていれば，memcachedなどをわざわざ使うまでもなく，同様のことが簡単に書けてしまう．単にmemcachedと同じ事をするだけであれば大きなメリットは無いけれども，自前で書いた場合は仕様を簡単に変えられる．たとえば，・ワイルドカード指定でデータを消したい・複数のデータの更新をatomicに行いたい・複数台に分散するときの分散アルゴリズムを自前のものに差し替えたい・キーの長さが250文字じゃ足りない・2次元もしくは多次元のデータを入れて，行単位・列単位などでキャッシュデータを削除したいなんて事をやりたくなったとき，自前で用意していれば容易に実装することが出来る．ちなみに，非常に単純な場合，以下のようなコードで可能．サーバ側：クライアント側：ちょっとテストした限りでは，性能もそれなりに出る模様．（とりあえずPerlからmemcachedを呼び出したら，Perl側がボトルネックになってmemcached側にたいした負荷をかけられなかったので，詳しい測定は諦めた）上のErlangのサンプルコードでは，キーは任意のデータ構造が使えるので，文字列だけじゃなく，{RowID , ColumnID} とか { CommunityID , ThreadID , ArticleID} みたいな構造で もOK ．長さの制限も特になし．これだけでも結構魅力的なのではないかと思う．memcachedは一例だけれども，これ以外にも，たとえばレスポンスタイムを速くしたいために，処理の一部（たとえばアクセスログの記録）を別プロセスで非同期に行うようにするとか，今まで言語の仕様で縛られて出来なかったことが，Erlangだと色々出来る．Erlangで書いていたら，こう出来たのに…という風に最近考えてしまうことが多い．Webで使おうとすると，日本語対応のフレームワークとかが無いようなので，その辺が難しいところだけども．．．
If you are starting here , linked from somewhere else , it is in your best interest to read the original post listed below and , even more importantly , the intro to the list so you will understand how this list was formed and came about ( and why some of your favorites are n't here ) .
There is also a Ray Memorial List Index in the sidebar that contains links to all related posts .
174 ballots were submitted to determine this list .
I tried to use as many different people who sent quotes as possible .
For most of the balloting , the top two films seemed to trade the lead with each new ballot , but in the final weekend , the one that finished No. 1 took off .
( I swear it 's not a fix . )
Bill Maisannes wrote , " I believe Kurosawa is that much better than the field .
The Babe Ruth of cinema . "
There 's certainly a case for that with the list .
Kurosawa had the most possible titles going in , but only one failed to make the top 100 , his next - lowest ranking was No. 64 and he had four finish in the top 20 .
If you missed the original post that explained how we whittled down to these 122 films , click here .
Now , here is the list :
For the first time since the fall of the Iron Curtain , Russia plans to re-operate the Tartus and Latakia ports in Syria as permanent bases for the Russian Navy in the Mediterranean basin , according to recent western media reports .
Rumors on the growing Russian activity in the Mediterranean began spreading following a statement by Russian Navy commander , Admiral Vladimir Masorin , as he visited the Russian Navy base in the Sebastopol port in Ukraine .
Regional Ties Report : Russia delays Iran nuclear plant to 2008 Reuters Nuclear subcontractor said Tehran 's first atomic power plant in Bushehr will not be finished before autumn 2008 , a delay of more than year to earlier plans Report : Russia delays Iran nuclear plant to 2008
The Qatar - based television network al - Jazeera quoted a senior Russian Defense Ministry official over the weekend , who declared that Russia must be permanently present in the Mediterranean again .
According to the reports , Syria plans to let Russia use its ports as part of the large arms deal signed between the two countries in the past year .
The breakthrough which led to the arms deal was made possible after the two parties resolved their financial differences .
Over the years , Syria had accumulated a huge debt of approximately $ 11 billion to Russia .
The Russians recently conceded more than 70 % of the debt .
The remaining debt will be returned by Syria partly in cash and partly through permanent port services to the Russian Navy ships in Latkia and Tartus .
Israeli security officials estimated that the renewed Russian activity in these bases , which were active throughout the Cold War , was related to the renewed tensions between Russia and the United States , mainly in light of the American plan to station antimissile missile systems in Europe – a plan Moscow views as a threat to its security .
" The bases will allow Russia to protect its interests in the region , " the sources estimated .
While US naval forces are permanently present in the Mediterranean , Russian Navy ships have so far settled for exercises and friendly visits to different countries in the region .
Since the Soviet Union 's disintegration the Russian Navy has been experiencing a crisis , but in the past two years efforts have been made to rehabilitate the warships and the submarines .
The Russian Navy is known to massively operate spy ships .
Israeli officials estimated on Sunday that a renewed base in Syria will help the Russians carry out spy missions also against Israel , particularly electronic spying aimed at observing new weapon systems and the flow of information in channels used by the army and the defense establishment .

Update
For those of you who have n't noticed , there 's a further perspective live on the main Google corporate blog that sheds more light on the company 's views .
As for me , I wholeheartedly believe we should work to improve the quality of health care in America and support the discourse that will drive this change .
Well , I 've learned a few things since I posted on Friday .
For one thing , even though this is a new blog , we have readers !
That 's a good thing .
Not so good is that some readers thought the opinion I expressed about the moviewas actually Google 's opinion .
It 's easy to understand why it might have seemed that way , because after all , this is a corporate blog .
So that was my mistake -- I understand why it caused some confusion .
But the more important point , since I doubt that too many people care about my personal opinion , is that advertising is an effective medium for handling challenges that a company or industry might have .
You could even argue that it 's especially appropriate for a public policy issue like healthcare .
Whether the healthcare industry wants to rebut charges in Mr. Moore 's movie , or whether Mr. Moore wants to challenge the healthcare industry , advertising is a very democratic and effective way to participate in a public dialogue .
That is Google 's opinion , and it 's unrelated to whether we support , oppose or ( more likely ) do n't have an official position on an issue .
That 's the real point I was trying to make , which was less clear because I offered my personal criticism of the movie .
About two years ago , a group of federal researchers reported that overweight people have a lower death rate than people who are normal weight , underweight or obese .
Now , investigating further , they found out which diseases are more likely to lead to death in each weight group .
For the first time linking causes of death to specific weights , they report that overweight people have a lower death rate because they are much less likely to die from a grab bag of diseases that includes Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson ’s , infections and lung disease .
And that lower risk is not counteracted by increased risks of dying from any other disease , including cancer , diabetes or heart disease .
As a consequence , the group from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute reports , there were more than 100,000 fewer deaths among the overweight in 2004 , the most recent year for which data were available , than would have been expected if those people had been of normal weight .
Their paper is being published in The Journal of the American Medical Association .
The researchers also confirmed that obese people and people whose weights are below normal have higher death rates than people of normal weight .
But , when they asked why , they found that the reasons were different for the different weight categories .

LONDON — Prime Minister Gordon Brown laid out Wednesday what he called Britain ’s first national security strategy since the Cold War to combat terror , military and even climactic threats that have “ changed out of all recognition . ”
The strategy , Brown said , integrates security and emergency - response measures at home with military and diplomatic efforts overseas to better battle terrorism , war , poverty , disease and climate change that put Britons ’ safety at risk .
“ New threats demand new approaches , ” Brown told the House of Commons in a noon - hour speech outlining the strategy .
“ A radically updated and much more coordinated response is now required . ”
As part of it , Brown said the government would make public its registry of risks to the country so that Britons knew the dangers they faced and be better enlisted to fight them .
“ Our new approach to security also means … building and strengthening local capacity to respond effectively in a range of circumstances from floods to possible terrorism incidents , ” he said .
“ Not the old Cold War idea of civil defense but a new form of civil protection that combines expert preparedness for potential emergencies with greater local engagement of individuals and families themselves . ”

The upper hand , legal experts say , was certainly held by Ms. Kroes .
“ She was really negotiating from a position of strength , which she did not have before the ruling by the Court of First Instance , ” said Andrew I. Gavil , a law professor at Howard University .
The move by Microsoft , according to industry analysts , is a significant step that the company wants to remove the lingering cloud that the European antitrust has cast over the company ’s business and its stock price .
“ Financially , the antitrust issues have not had a material effect on Microsoft , and it ’s not yet clear that this agreement will have much impact on the software market , ” said Charles di Bona , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein .
“ But it does help to remove the European cudgel that has been hanging over the company ’s head .
It removes an element of uncertainty , which shareholders hate . ”
Microsoft has paid nearly 1 billion euros , or $ 1.43 billion , in fines since the commission ’s initial ruling and could face up to 1.6 billion euros more , which began accumulating in December 2005 after Microsoft failed to provide the protocols .
Ms. Kroes said she would decide before the end of the year whether Microsoft must pay the additional fines .
Ms. Kroes cast the agreement as a big win for Microsoft ’s rivals , especially companies that rely on open - source software like the Linux operating system , an increasingly popular alternative to Microsoft .
Linux has done particularly well on server computers , where its main competitor is Microsoft ’s server software .
To thrive in the marketplace , open - source software must work well with Microsoft ’s desktop programs , notably the Windows personal computer operating system .
More than 90 percent of all PC ’s run on Windows .
The European order mandates that Microsoft share its technology information on fair terms , so that competing software can work smoothly , or interoperate , with Windows desktop software .
It was those terms of interoperability that will be much more favorable to Microsoft competitors , so that the company ’s dominance in product cannot thwart competition in another , closely related software market .
It 's not quite the PSP 2 some might 've hoped for , but Sony is giving its handheld console a serious refresh in the form of a slimmer , lighter and faster " updated " PSP .
The new unit still includes the 4.3 - inch LCD and UMD , but is 33 percent lighter , 19 percent slimmer , has sped up game load times and improved battery life .
The only real " new " features is a video output capability to allow you to play your PSP games on a big screen TV .
You can score one in September in the original Piano Black , a new Ice Silver color , and a Star Wars Battlefront special edition .
The latter two PSPs come in $ 199 bundles with related games and a 1GB Memory Stick in the case of Ice Silver .
More pics after the break . :
Also worth noting is the fact that this new model " is equipped with enhanced feature to temporarily store game data from UMD , reducing load time during game play . "
No complaints about that !
OHAI .
File this under ' Humor ' , barely .
Hey , I 'm somewhat of a futurist , although , not an expert , ( are any futurist really experrts , come on ? ) , I 'm really more of a ' hobbyist ' futurist .
I just like making projections based on wild ideas ... if they come to pass .. I look great !
( It 's that old full court shot at the buzzer strategy ! )
If they do n't , well nobody really cares anyhow and will probably forget about them in short order .
Here 's where I agree with George W. Bush , however : " Oh , I do n't know ... I 'll be dead when they figure it out . "
But , anyhow , here goes : THE COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL TAX AND POWER LOTTERY PROGRAM
A possible future programs that ,
1. reduces taxes by a big chunk , and ,
2. makes paying taxes kinda like a game , ( but , shhh , it seems like a game , but it 's really a tax ) .
A uniform tax would be levied on every adult citizen this tax would be collected through sales , income , and use of resources , and property taxes at a set percentage rate .
However , this tax would only comprise one half of total federal revenues , the other half would be represented by income derived from selling a lottery !!!
Yay !
The lottery drawing would be held weekly , one drawing per state or territory .
with a fixed percentage of lottery sales going to the winners ... ah , redistribution of wealth !
How do you enter the lobby , you might ask ?
Well , every time you buy something , you the NATIONAL POWER TAX LOTTERY , with a drawing monthly , nationwide .
This program will provide for federal programs , you know , the federal budget social security supplemental financing comes to mind right away , ( I suspect by this program comes to reality social security will need a little outside cash ha , ha . ) .
Otherwise , you 'll buy lottery tickets of your choice ranging from $ 1 to $ 20 , these will be for designated government programs , i.e. , schools , education , public safety , roadways , water , sewerage , hospitals , assisted living centers , health care ,
So you see , you could buy a $ 1 National Power Tax Lottery Ticket , and $ 5 worth of instant win , scratch off tickets targeted for state programs , like , " Hey , give me five of those $ 1 scratch offs - - one of the ' schools ' , one ' hospital ' , and , oh , yeah , give me three ' sewers ' . "
States , and local governments would receive revenue not from their own taxes but based on available resources , industries , and service OUTPUT .... the more output the more revenue received .
Build a bridge , get money from the federal government , build a sports arena , get fed money from the tax lottery !!
Smaller local governments and municipalities would receive revenue the same way , if a community built a new school , money from the fed tax revenue program arrives .
Just like that .
TA , DA !
How would this money be apportioned ?
Ahah !
I 'm glad you asked :
By gauging through regular polls -- A SMART TAX !-- that is how educated the citizenry is , or not ... how many slackers the community has , alcohol , tobacco , and marijuana sales ( oh , did I mention hemp would be legal ? ) , and also health - - i.e. , who is dying , and at what age .
So a total loser community made up of low income properties , non-achievers , welfare recipients ( yeah , there still would be handouts , but aged and infirm and children of need would receive fed government support for living , healthcare , of course ) .
But for the rest of society , citizens need to advocate , and vote the projects into being , building needed schools , infrastructure , healthcare facilities , business parks , what have you , projects for the common good .
The mechanics of the free market will supply goods and services , as before , ( that 's ' before ' as in ' past ' , which of course , means like ' now ' ) .
But do n't short change the LOTTERY ... once a week in fifty or so markets , at every level of society --- some one , somewhere becomes a millionaire !
And once a month , nationally , someone becomes a MULTI - MILLIONAIRE !
Whew , talk about redistribution of wealth !
THANKS ,

One of the announcements to come out of the IDF keynote this afternoon was Pat Gelsinger 's discussion and demonstration of USB 3.0 technology .
Although still in the prototype stage , USB 3.0 is aiming for 10 times the bandwidth of current USB2.0 solutions , or approximately 5 Gbps .
Since this requires fiber optic cabling , USB 3.0 will add a length of optical data cable to the mix , though USB 3.0 will retain full compatibility with USB 2.0 ( and , one assumes , USB 1.0 as well ) .
Gelsinger expects the final version specifications to be finished by the first half of 2008 , with USB 3.0 peripherals realistically appearing in 2009 or 2010 .
There are an increasing number of devices that could potentially take advantage of the additional bandwidth , including external hard drives , flash readers , video cameras , and the all - new USB - compliant llama expected to be genetically delivered from the Andes sometime in late 2011 .
Obviously a USB llama would n't be much use without a USB 3.0 device — ever tried downloading from a llama over an old 10 BaseT network ?
Yeah .
It 'd be worse .
As for the other , official features of USB 3.0 , there remains quite a bit of information we do n't know , and it would have been nice for Intel to have included additional information .
USB has long been criticized for relatively high CPU usage .
This has inevitably become less of an issue as CPU performance has improved , but devices capable of using USB 3.0's higher bandwidth capabilities could make CPU usage a problem again unless the issue is addressed during spec development .
Issues like cable length , available power provided , and the number of devices per channel are all unrevealed as yet , and possibly unresolved .
The Inquirer has a few more details on the spec ( and the rest of the keynote ) if you 're interested .
As far as future market competition , its target of 5 G bps puts USB 3.0 ahead of current eSATA ( 3 Gbps ) , which is really the only other device protocol under active development that might challenge it as a peripheral interconnect .
Although an IEEE 1394c protocol has been developed and published as of June 8 2007 , no company has announced an intent to produce a product or chipset that utilizes the standard .
FireWire remains supported in certain sectors , but I 'd personally be surprised if the combination of USB 3.0 and eSATA does n't push FireWire out of the market completely .
As for the nascent specification , the proposed 5 Gbps speed is great and all , but hopefully the development committees will acknowledge some of the other concerns regarding the USB 2.0 protocol and incorporate solutions for them , rather than carrying them over into another product generation .
Ken Siegel does n't beat around the bush .
He does n't like e-mail .
" I do n't even have an e-mail account , " he says .
" When I tell that to the executives I work with , first they look at me with surprise , and then they look at me with envy . "
Dr. Siegel , a psychologist and president of Impact Group , management consultants in Los Angeles , is on a bit of a crusade .
He wants there to be less e-mail in the world .
So he 's helping his business clients organize activities such as a " no e-mail Friday " in order to increase productivity .
That 's right : increase productivity .
" E-mail is not a communication device , it 's a broadcasting device , " says Siegel .
" It will actually truncate communication .
And in the truest sense of the word , it has become a psychological dependency .
We have convinced ourselves that we can't live without it . "
E -mail takes up more and more of our time at work , according to Radicati Group , a Palo Alto , Calif. , research and consulting firm .
E-mails sent by a company 's workers are projected to increase 27 percent this year , to an average of 47 a day – up from 37 a day in 2006 .
And that 's not the upper ranks of a company , where even more e-mails can accumulate .
The question then becomes " Do we really want our company to be spending so much of its time doing something that ultimately is n't productive ? "
But how can we live without it ?
Take , for example , my full - time job at National Public Radio .
I get e-mails nonstop all day long : e-mails about stories , e-mails from human resources , e-mails about people looking for lost Blackberrys or books that they left in a recording booth , e-mails purportedly from high - ranking folks in Nigeria who want to give me lots of money , e-mail about ....
You get the picture .
I can almost hear Siegel smiling on the phone as I recite this litany .
He 's obviously heard this before .
" And how many of those e-mails are you really glad you got ? "
Truthfully ?
Not all of them , for sure .
That 's his point exactly .
Siegel says people need to consider how much e-mail adds " to the value of their days . "
Most of the executives he works with say they spend two to three hours a day on e-mail ( about 150 to 250 messages ) and on average only 16 to 19 percent of those messages met the value - added criterion .
Siegel is also blunt about another use for e-mail .
" E-mail has become the 21st century 's ' cover your butt ' technique of choice , " he says .
" It 's also become the interpersonal coward 's device of choice . "
People will send e-mail as a way to avoid dealing with an issue , by pointedly not dealing with it in a quick , prompt manner , he says .
If you have a problem that needs to be solved quickly , e-mail is almost always the worst way to approach that solution .
And the problem has grown worse as more and more businesses expect employees to use personal digital assistants such as Blackberrys and Treos .
Once upon a time , we only had to worry about e-mail when we were at our desks .
Now it follows us around , virtually tugging at our sleeves , demanding that we pay attention .
When Siegel works with business executives , he tries to give them strategies to tame the digital beast and get more value from their work .
Thus " No e-mail Fridays " were born .
But it was not a painless birth for many who tried it .
In a recent piece in The Wall Street Journal , Nancy Flynn , executive director of the ePolicy Institute , a Columbus , Ohio , training and consulting firm , supported the idea of no e-mail one day a week .
But she included a warning : " When you try to take e-mail away from some users , they 're going to panic . "
Panic ?
I would expect riots .
Ever seen people with their Blackberrys ?
It 's like watching Pavlov 's dog .
The moment the stimulus is given ( an e-mail arrives ) , the response is provoked : " Must answer now ! "
Siegel agrees that it 's not easy .
But the benefit , he says , is – yes – increased productivity once you get over those initial panic attacks .
Siegel says once people can't rely on e-mail , problems are solved more quickly .
An e-mail string that might bounce back and forth in six to 12 messages over a day or two sometimes can be solved with a 10 - minute face - to - face meeting .
And that face - to - face thing actually improves relationships .
Siegel offers other ideas .
One executive he worked with started blocking all messages on which he was cc'd .
After a while , people realized that if they wanted this executive to help solve an issue , they would have to talk to him in person .
Siegel knows that e-mail is a part of our working world now , and there 's no turning back .
But he also believes that it 's time we grabbed the e-mail bull by its horns and wrestle it into submission .
E - mail should not dictate how we operate at work , or even at home , he says .
" E-mail is a tool with clear and viable uses and benefits , " Siegel concludes .
" Communication is n't one of them .
Businesses and individuals need to set guidelines when it should be used and when it should n't be used .
And we 'll all be better off once we do it . "
NOTE : I am no longer updating this page .
Michael Bernstein has a copy at Python Parsing Tools that will be easier to keep up - to - date .
The python.org wiki also has a page called LanguageParsing .
A few years ago , I went looking for Python parsing tools .
I spent a long time researching the various options .
When I was done , I had a cheat sheet on the different alternatives .
This is that cheat sheet , cleaned up a bit .
It is very spotty .
Because this is a compilation of factoids freely available on the web , it is in the public domain .
The tools are presented here in random order .
I tried organizing them , but I could n’t find a scheme that seemed to help .
Some points of comparison :
Lexical analysis technology : the two choices seem to be Python regular expressions , or deterministic finite automata .
DFA ’s are faster ( linear with the number of characters lexed ) .
Parser technology : what algorithm is used to parse ?
There are a spectrum of choices .
See wikipedia ’s Parsing Algorithms page for a start .
Specification style : traditional parser generators use a separate file in a new language to describe the grammar .
Some of these tools do also , but many choose to put production rules in docstrings .
Others use Python data structures for grammars .
Reliance on other tools : some of these are pure Python , some rely on existing parser generators such as Bison .

Is the olive oil you ’re using really olive oil ?
According to the New Yorker , chances are good that what ’s in that bottle is cut with hazelnut , sunflower seed , or canola oil .
Trafficking in adulterated olive oil has been a problem unto antiquity .
Italian authorities are trying to change that , the country ’s agricultural minister tells the New Yorker .
In April , he announced that 205 olive oil producers out of 757 investigated were guilty of cutting their olive oil with other products , and would be prosecuted .
One recent investigation broke up a ring using soy and canola oils colored with industrial chlorophyll and packaged in extra - virgin olive oil tins “ emblazoned with pictures of Italian flags or Mt. Vesuvius , and with folksy names of imaginary producers — the Farmhouse , the Ancient Millstones . ”
It ’s not just made - up brands that are accused ; leading companies like Carapelli , Bertolli , and Rubino have been caught with less - than - pure oil .
“ In 1997 and 1998 , olive oil was the most adulterated agricultural product in the European Union , ” the New Yorker says .
One investigator tells the writer that profits for this snake oil “ were comparable to cocaine trafficking , with none of the risks . ”
Alison Benjamin over at food blog the Cleaner Plate Club is ticked :
[ T] here ’s some serious heart disease in [ my husband ]
Blair ’s family , and — since we want him around for a long , long time — we ’re very aware of what kind of oil we ’re using on a regular basis .
The idea that someone could be tricking us into a less - healthful alternative just feels like an entire industry is flipping us the bird .
So how can we tell if what we ’re buying is really olive oil ?
According to Squidoo , be suspicious of low prices , and look for imported oils certified by the International Olive Oil Council .
Olive oil made in California must also adhere to strict labeling laws .
Trusting the authorities on these matters never leaves a good taste in my mouth , however .
Maybe buying local , from a farmers ’ market supplier you can talk to face - to - face , is the best option .
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia ( AP )  Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tells Dow Jones Newswires he will consult with Arab nations on a plan to enrich uranium outside the region in a neutral country such as Switzerland .
" We will be talking with our ( Arab ) friends , " he said in exclusive comments to Dow Jones Newswires on the sidelines of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ' heads of state summit in Saudi Arabia .
Under a proposal put to Tehran by the six - member Gulf Cooperation Council , a multinational consortium established by the GCC would provide enriched uranium to power plants in Iran , the Middle East Economic Digest reported earlier this month , citing Saudi Arabia 's Foreign Affairs Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal .
The facility would produce nuclear fuel that the consortium would supply to Iran and other Middle East states looking to build their own nuclear power programs .
" We believe it should be in a neutral country — Switzerland , for instance , " al - Faisal was quoted as saying .
The plan would allow Iran to develop its nuclear energy program while at the same time removing fears it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .

Objects Have Failed
( Opening remarks by Richard P. Gabriel , November 6 , 2002 )
What can it mean for a programming paradigm to fail ?
A paradigm fails when the narrative it embodies fails to speak truth or when its proponents embrace it beyond reason .
The failure to speak truth centers around the changing needs of software in the 21st century and around the so - called improvements on OO that have obliterated its original benefits .
Obsessive embrace has spawned a search for purity that has become an ideological weapon , promoting an incremental advance as the ultimate solution to our software problems .
The effect has been to brainwash people on the street .
The statement " everything is an object " says that OO is universal , and the statement " objects model the real world " says that OO has a privileged position .
These are very seductive invitations to a totalizing viewpoint .
The result is to starve research and development on alternative paradigms .
Someday , the software we have already written will be a set of measure 0 .
We have lived through three ages of computing the first was machine coding ; the second was symbolic assemblers , interpreter routines , and early compilers ; and the third was imperative , procedural , and functional programming , and compiler - based languages .
Now we are in the fourth : object - oriented programming .
These first four ages featured single - machine applications .
Even though such systems will remain important , increasingly our systems will be made up of dozens , hundreds , thousands , or millions of disparate components , partial applications , services , sensors , and actuators on a variety of hardware , written by a variegated set of developers , and it wo n’t be incorrect to say that no one knows how it all works .
In the old world , we focussed on efficiency , resource limitations , performance , monolithic programs , standalone systems , single author programs , and mathematical approaches .
In the new world we will foreground robustness , flexibility , adaptation , distributed systems , multiple - author programs , and biological metaphors for computing .
Needless to say , object - orientation provides an important lens through which to understand and fashion systems in the new world , but it simply cannot be the only lens .
In future systems , unreliability will be common , complexity will be out of sight , and anything like carefully crafted precision code will be unrealistic .
It ’s like a city : Bricks are important for building part of some buildings , but the complexity and complicated way a variety of building materials and components come together under the control of a multitude of actors with different cultures and goals , talents and proclivities means that the kind of thinking that goes into bricks will not work at the scale of the city .
Bricks are just too limited , and the circumstances where they make sense are too constrained to serve as a model for building something as diverse and unpredictable as a city .
And further , the city itself is not the end goal , because the city must also in the best case be a humane structure for human activity , which requires a second set of levels of complexity and concerns .
Using this metaphor to talk about future computing systems , it ’s fair to say that OO addresses concerns at the level of bricks .
The modernist tendency in computing is to engage in totalizing discourse in which one paradigm or one story is expected to supply all in every situation .
Try as they might , OO ’s promoters cannot provide a believable modernist grand narrative to the exclusion of all others .
OO holds no privileged position .
So instead of Java for example embracing all the components developed elsewhere , its proponents decided to develop their own versions so that all computing would be embraced within the Java narrative .
Objects , as envisioned by the designers of languages like Smalltalk and Actorslong before C++ and Java came around were for modeling and building complex , dynamic worlds .
Programming environments for languages like Smalltalk were written in those languages and were extensible by developers .
Because the philosophy of dynamic change was part of the post - Simula OO worldview , languages and environments of that era were highly dynamic .
But with C++ and Java , the dynamic thinking fostered by object - oriented languages was nearly fatally assaulted by the theology of static thinking inherited from our mathematical heritage and the assumptions built into our views of computing by Charles Babbage whose factory - building worldview was dominated by omniscience and omnipotence .
And as a result we find that object - oriented languages have succumbed to static thinkers who worship perfect planning over runtime adaptability , early decisions over late ones , and the wisdom of compilers over the cleverness of failure detection and repair .
Beyond static types , precise interfaces , and mathematical reasoning , we need self - healing and self - organizing mechanisms , checking for and responding to failures , and managing systems whose overall complexity is beyond the ken of any single person .
One might think that such a postmodern move would have good consequences , but unlike Perl , the combination was not additive but subtractive as if by undercutting what OO was , OO could be made more powerful .
This may work as a literary or artistic device , but the idea in programming is not to teach but to build .
The apparent commercial success of objects and our love affair with business during the past decade have combined to stifle research and exploration of alternative language approaches and paradigms of computing .
University and industrial research communities retreated from innovating in programming languages in order to harvest the easy pickings from the OO tree .
The business frenzy at the end of the last century blinded researchers to diversity of ideas , and they were into going with what was hot , what was uncontroversial .
If ever there was a time when Kuhn ’s normal science dominated computing , it was during this period .
My own experience bears this out .
Until 1995 , when I went back to school to study poetry , my research career centered on the programming language , Lisp .
When I returned in 1998 , I found that my research area had been eliminated .
I was forced to find new ways to earn a living within the ecology created by Java , which was busily recreating the computing world in its own image .
Smalltalk , Lisp , Haskell , ML , and other languages languish while C++ , Java , and their near - clone C# are the only languages getting attention .
Small languages like Tcl , Perl , and Python are gathering adherents , but are making no progress in language and system design at all .
Our arguments come in several flavors :
The object - oriented approach does not adequately address the computing requirements of the future .
Object - oriented languages have lost the simplicity some would say purity that made them special and which were the source of their expressive and development power .
Powerful concepts like encapsulation were supposed to save people from themselves while developing software , but encapsulation fails for global properties or when software evolution and wholesale changes are needed .
Open Source handles this better .
It ’s likely that modularity keeping things local so people can understand them is what ’s really important about encapsulation .
Objects promised reuse , and we have not seen much success .
Despite the early clear understanding of the nature of software development by OO pioneers , the current caretakers of the ideas have reverted to the incumbent philosophy of perfect planning , grand design , and omniscience inherited from Babbage ’s theology .
The over - optimism spawned by objects in the late 1990s led businesses to expect miracles that might have been possible with objects unpolluted by static thinking , and when software developers could not deliver , the outrageous business plans of those businesses fell apart , and the result was our current recession .
Objects require programming by creating communicating entities , which means that programming is accomplished by building structures rather than by linguistic expression and description through form , and this often leads to a mismatch of language to problem domain .
Object design is like creating a story in which objects talk and interact with each other , leading people to expect that learning object - oriented programming is easy , when in fact it is as hard as ever .
Again , business was misled .
People enthused by objects hogged the road , would not get out of the way , would not allow alternatives to be explored not through malice but through exuberance and now resources that could be used to move ahead are drying up .
But sometimes this exuberance was out - and - out lying to push others out of the way .
But in the end , we do n’t advocate changing the way we work on and with objects and object - oriented languages .
Instead , we argue for diversity , for work on new paradigms , for letting a thousand flowers bloom .
Self - healing , self - repair , massive and complex systems , self - organization , adaptation , flexibility , piecemeal growth , statistical behavior , evolution , emergence , and maybe dozens of other ideas and approaches we have n’t thought of including new physical manifestations of non-physical action should be allowed and encouraged to move ahead .
This is a time for paradigm definition and shifting .
It wo n’t always look like science , wo n’t always even appear to be rational ; papers and talks explaining and advocating new ideas might sound like propaganda or fiction or even poetry ; narrative will play a larger role than theorems and hard results .
This will not be normal science .
In the face of all this , it ’s fair to say that objects have failed .
A handful of consumer groups , including members of the Savetheinternet.com coalition , have asked the Federal Communications Commission to stop Comcast from interfering with BitTorrent and other P2P traffic .
A new complaint ( PDF ) filed by Public Knowledge and Free Press accuses Comcast of " secretly degrading " P2P traffic , calling it a violation of network neutrality principles , and asks the FCC to enjoin Comcast from blocking P2P traffic in the future .
The complaint comes in the wake of revelations the Comcast is using Sandvine to actively interfere with and block some BitTorrent , Gnutella , and even Lotus Notes traffic .
The ISP is using forged TCP reset packets , which tell both ends of a connection that the other party has reset the connection , to accomplish the task .
Comcast admits to managing traffic on its network to ensure a " good Internet experience " for all of its customers .
The company argues that its management techniques will occasionally " delay " traffic , but denies that it blocks or degrades traffic , despite evidence to the contrary .
Ben Scott , policy director of Free Press , disagrees , and believes something fishy is going on .
" Comcast 's defense is bogus , " said Scott in a statement .
" The FCC needs to take immediate action to put an end to this harmful practice .
Comcast 's blatant and deceptive BitTorrent blocking is exactly the type of problem advocates warned would occur without Net Neutrality laws . "
The complaint accuses Comcast of engaging in " deliberately secretive " traffic " jamming " practices that are designed to obscure its actions from users .
It also argues that the ISP 's actions violate the FCC's Internet Policy Statement ( PDF ) .
That statement outlined four policy principles , which are subject to " reasonable network management " :
Consumers are entitled to access their choice of lawful Internet content
Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice , subject to the needs of law enforcement
Consumers can connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network
Consumers are entitled to competition from ISPs and content providers
Free Press and Public Knowledge believe that Comcast 's actions violate the first three principles .
In the complaint , they remind the Commission of Chairman Kevin Martin's February testimony before a Congressional committee , in which he pledged to enforce those principles : " Although we are not aware of current blocking situations , the Commission remains vigilant and stands ready to step in to protect consumers ' access to content on the Internet , " Martin said .
With the Commission having argued that it 's capable of addressing net neutrality violations after the fact , argues the complaint , the moment of truth is here .
The complaint wants the FCC to put its money where its mouth is — in addition to permanently barring Comcast from blocking P2P traffic , the consumer groups want the ISP fined $ 195,000 ( $ 97,500 for discrimination and $ 97,500 for deception ) for each consumer affected by the problem .
In response to the complaint , Comcast reiterated its carefully - worded stance that it does not block access " to any Web sites or online applications , " including BitTorrent .
" As the FCC noted in its policy statement in 2005 , all of the principles to encourage broadband deployment and preserve the nature of the Internet are ' subject to reasonable network management , ' " Comcast executive VP David Cohen told Ars .
" The Commission clearly recognized that network management is necessary by ISPs for the good of all customers . "
Comcast is hoping that the FCC will agree that its blocking P2P traffic does indeed fall under the category of " reasonable " traffic management and dismiss the complaint .
If that does n't happen , the ISP faces the possibility of massive fines and being forced to substantially alter how it handles P2P traffic .
If nothing else , the complaint gives more fodder to recently reanimated discussions over network neutrality .
A major expansion of the criminal DNA database to include people accused of even minor offences such as dropping litter is being considered by the Home Office .
Ministers confirmed that they wanted to add significantly to the four million profiles now held after a senior judge called for the DNA of everyone to be stored .
DNA : Judge calls for all Britons to be put on a DNA database
The DNA database grows by 30,000 samples each month
Lord Justice Sedley , an Appeal Court judge , even proposed that all foreign visitors should have their DNA taken .
His suggestion provoked the anger of civil liberties campaigners but was backed by police chiefs .
Tony McNulty , the security minister , said there were no plans for a national , universal DNA database but he was ' ' broadly sympathetic ' ' to the idea .
" There is a logic and cohesion to what Sir Stephen is saying , '' he said .
'' We would never say never . ''
He said a review of the DNA database was due to report in February .
A consultation paper on police powers suggests that suspects be fingerprinted , photographed and have their DNA sampled , regardless of the offence of which they are suspected .
At present , fingerprints and DNA samples can be taken only in relation to so - called recordable offences - generally those that carry a potential prison sentence .
The Home Office wants to give the police that power for all criminal offences , including anti-social behaviour , littering and shoplifting .
The consultation paper also suggests that there should be scope to " remove the operational constraints " on inputting DNA into other anti-crime databases .
Lord Justice Sedley 's comments came in a BBC interview , though he has been advocating a national database for several years .
He conceded that such a move would be '' authoritarian ' ' but said the current random additions to the database were unfair and indefensible .
" We have a situation where if you happen to have been in the hands of the police , then your DNA is on permanent record .
If you have n't , it is n't , '' he said .
" It also means that a great many people who are walking the streets , and whose DNA would show them guilty of crimes , go free " .
He was concerned , too , about the disproportionate number of ethnic minorities on the database .
There are more than four million profiles on the database , which was set up in 1995 and is now the world 's largest .
Shami Chakrabarti , a director of Liberty , said a database with DNA from convicted sexual and violent offenders was a " perfectly sensible crime - fighting measure " .
But she added : " A database of every man , woman and child in the country is a chilling proposal , ripe for indignity , error and abuse . "
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said : " Whilst Lord Justice Sedley 's disregard for concerns about privacy is misplaced , at least he has the honesty to put forward a suggestion for a universal DNA database .
" This contrasts with the Government 's cloak and dagger strategy of creating a universal database behind the backs of the British people . "
Sir Stephen is ex-member of the Communist Party
Unusually - perhaps uniquely for an Appeal Court judge - Lord Justice Sedley is a former member of the Communist Party .
In the 1970s and 1980s , Stephen Sedley was renowned as a radical lawyer .
Born in 1939 , he was called to the bar in 1964 after coming down from Cambridge and became a QC in 1983 .
He became a High Court judge 10 years later and joined the Appeal Court in 1999 .
The judge was a strong supporter of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law through the Human Rights Act .
He has long had an interest in the retention of DNA .
In 2002 , he was among the Appeal Court judges who dismissed a case brought on behalf of a 12 - year - old boy whose DNA was kept on the database even though he had been declared innocent of any offence .
The court said it did not breach human rights laws .
County Attorney Thomas , admitting major mistakes and backing off the criminal prosecution of New Times .
In a stunning capitulation to an overwhelming public backlash , Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas announced in a press conference this afternoon charges against New Times founders Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin are being dismissed and that Dennis Wilenchik will no longer work for the CA 's office as a special prosecutor .
Thomas admitted that the grand jury subpoena in the case , as discussed in this week 's cover story by Lacey and Larkin Grand Jury Targets New Times and Its Readers , was too broad .
" We are not going to proceed with this investigation , " stated Thomas .
" The charges are going to be dismissed .
And the matter is going to end . "
Thomas ate crow before a crowd of fired - up journalists , claiming the subpoena in the case offended him as an American and a writer .
( Apparently , Thomas has written a couple of right - wing tomes in the past . )
" There is a right way and a wrong way to bring a prosecution , " said Thomas , whose office has been the subject of withering public criticism in the wake of the arrests of Larkin and Lacey late last night .
" And what happened here was the wrong way .
I do not condone it .
I do not defend it .
And so it ends today . "
Incredibly , Thomas defended his choice of Wilenchik , his former boss , as special prosecutor in a case against New Times , even though Thomas admitted that he did not feel comfortable investigating New Times ' alleged violation of an obscure law that makes it a crime to publish a law enforcement official 's address ( in this case Arpaio 's address ) over the Internet .
So he kicked the investigation over to Pinal County .
When they chose not to pursue it , Thomas persisted , with his very well - paid ally Wilenchik as special prosecutor .
Thomas disavowed all responsibility for the arrests of Lacey and Larkin , and said that the matter had been " badly mishandled . "
However , Thomas himself said he would not resign over the matter , and apparently , Wilenchik will continue to serve his former employee , though not as a prosecutor .
Thomas called the New Times reckless in publishing Arpaio 's address three years ago during an investigation of cash purchases by Arpaio of parcels of land worth $ 1 million .
And despite this egregious violation of the First Amendment by the County Attorney 's office , Thomas offered no apology to New Times ' founders , and instead demanded an apology from the New Times for publishing Arpaio 's address .
Asked if Thomas would go after the many Web sites that have published Arpaio 's address online , he made a major legal flub .
" There 's a big difference between that and putting his name and address on the front cover , " as the New Times did late in 2006 .
This reporter had to point out to Thomas that the law in question did not apply to print publication of such addresses , only Internet publication of same .
Thomas mumbled a response , to which I shot back : " So the law does n't matter to you ? "
" That 's not what I said , " he frowned .
The extent of Thomas ' retreat became apparent when MCAO flack Barnett Lotstein later admitted that attorney Wilenchik will no longer serve the MCAO in criminal matters , though he will continue to represent the County in civil matters when someone like Arpaio requests him .
Obviously , Wilenchik this week crossed the line into political liability territory , and Thomas threw him under the bus .
Interestingly , New Times reporter Ray Stern 's disorderly conduct citation for looking at public documents has not been dismissed .
Stern was viewing MCSO press releases at the PHX law offices of Michelle Iafrate , press releases the MCSO refuses to e-mail to New Times .
Stern took some digital snaps of these public docs .
They asked him to leave .
There were words between he and Iafrate , and he left .
Then they hit him with a citation later in the evening as part of this mess .
More as the situation demands it .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 4  The Bush administration signaled Sunday that it would probably keep billions of dollars flowing to Pakistan ’s military , despite the detention of human rights advocates and leaders of the political opposition by Gen.
Pervez Musharraf , the country ’s president .
In carefully calibrated public statements and blunter private acknowledgments about the limits of American leverage over General Musharraf , the man President Bush has called one of his most critical allies , the officials argued that it would be counterproductive to let Pakistan ’s political turmoil interfere with their best hope of ousting Al Qaeda ’s central leadership and the Taliban from the country ’s mountainous tribal areas .
Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that while the United States would “ have to review the situation with aid , ” she said three times that President Bush ’s first concern was “ to protect America and protect American citizens by continuing to fight against terrorists . ”
“ That means we have to be very cognizant of the counterterrorism operations that we are involved in , ” she said .
“ We have to be very cognizant of the fact that some of the assistance that has been going to Pakistan is directly related to the counterterrorism mission . ”

At the age of six months he is already making social judgements
But , according to new research , they can already assess someone 's intentions towards them , deciding who is a likely friend or enemy .
US scientists believe babies acquire the ability to make social evaluations in the first few months of life .
It may provide the foundation for moral thoughts and actions in later years , they write in the journal Nature .
" By six months , babies have learnt quite a lot and they are taking things in , " said Kiley Hamlin , lead author of the research .
" We can't say that it is hard - wired ( exists in a newborn baby ) but we can say it is pre-linguistic and pre-explicit teaching , " she told BBC News .
" We do n't think this says that babies have any morality but it does seem an essential piece of morality to feel positive about those who do good things and negative about those who do bad things - it seems like an important piece of a later more rational and moral system . "
Infant lab tests
Like all social creatures , humans are able to make rapid judgements of other people based on how they behave towards others .
But the roots of this behaviour and when it develops are not well understood .
Kiley Hamlin and colleagues at Yale University devised experiments to test whether babies aged six and 10 months were able to evaluate the behaviour of others .
They used wooden toys of different shapes that were designed to appeal to babies .
The babies were sat on their parents ' laps and shown a display representing a character trying to climb a hill .
The climbing character , which had eyes to make it human - like , was either knocked down the hill by an unhelpful character ( a toy of a different shape and colour ) or pushed up the hill by a helper cartoon figure ( another shape and colour ) .
After watching the " puppet show " several times , each baby was presented with the helper and hinderer toys and asked to pick one .
Humans engage in social evaluation far earlier in development than previously thought
Yale researchers
Further experiments were carried out to rule out other explanations for the behaviour - such as a preference for pushing up or down actions or the appearance of certain characters .
" Our findings indicate that humans engage in social evaluation far earlier in development than previously thought , and support the view that the capacity to evaluate individuals on the basis of their social interactions is universal and unlearned , " the authors wrote in Nature .
Social creatures
Evidence that babies so young show some social intelligence comes as no surprise to Kiley Hamlin .
She said one message for parents is that babies are able to figure out a lot on their own .
Babies are smarter than we think
" They are quite competent social creatures early on , " she said .
" They figure out the good guys to hang out with without much help . "
Professor Oliver Braddick of the University of Oxford , UK , who was not part of the research study , agreed .
" It shows how prepared babies are to learn the basics of social interaction at a very early age , " he said .
But he said it is not yet clear whether the capacity described by the Yale group relates to a real understanding of social life .
" These babies are recognising interaction between other beings they are watching , " he said .
" These interactions we can imagine are a foundation for social understanding but I 'm not sure yet they truly reflect social understanding in the sense we would apply to an adult or older child . "
Previous research has shown that babies in the first six months of life show preferences for others based on the attractiveness of their face .
But it is not until the age of 18 months that toddlers are true social creatures , and will cooperate with others of their own accord .
A view of the Puppis A supernova remnant with a close - up image of the fast - moving neutron star RX J0822-4300 .
X - ray data ( pink ) and optical data ( purple ) highlights oxygen emission .
One of thefastest moving stars ever seen is challenging theories to explain itsblistering speed .
The cosmiccannonball , a neutron star known as RX J0822-4300 , was discovered with NASA 'sChandra X-ray Observatory .
Astronomersused five years of Chandra observations to show that therogue star is careening away from the Puppis A supernova remnant , leftoversof a star that exploded about 3,700 years ago .
The neutron star is racing out ofour Milky Way Galaxy at about 3 million mph ( 4.8 million kph ) .
" Justafter it was born , this neutron star got a one - way ticket out of the galaxy , " said co-author Robert Petre , an astronomer at NASA 's Goddard Space FlightCenter in Greenbelt , Md. " Astronomers have seen otherstars being flung out of the Milky Way , but few as fast as this . "
Otherhypervelocity stars known to be exiting the Milky Way move at speeds about one - thirdas great — likely shot toward interstellar space by an aggressive , supermassiveblack hole at our galaxy 's center .
In the caseof RX J0822-4300 , however , a tremendous lopsided supernova explosion rocketed theneutron star to its blinding speed .
It has traveled 20 light - years thus far , and will take millions of years to escape theclutches of the Milky Way .
Despiteusing advanced computer models to simulate how such a stellar rocket couldform , astronomers are at a loss of words .
" Theproblem with discovering this cosmic cannonball is we are n't sure how to makethe cannon powerful enough . " said Frank Winkler , an astronomer at Middlebury College in Vermont .
" The high speed might be explained by an unusuallyenergetic explosion , but the models are complicated and hard to apply to realexplosions . "
Winkler and Petre 's research is detailed in a recent issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
“ THERE is no natural successor at Citigroup because the company is itself an unnatural act , ” argued the Wall Street Journal 's Deal Journal blog after Chuck Prince , Citi 's boss , quit on November 4th , before he could be fired .
The gist of the argument is that “ Citigroup has proven itself so complex as to be ungovernable .
So ungovernable that even the man once given the levers of the U.S. economy , former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , has begged off the task . ”
The only person Deal Journal thinks is equipped to do the job is Joe Torre , who managed the New York Yankees brilliantly for the last dozen years before quitting at the end of last season .
Mr Torre “ has proven he can inspire loyalty from a group of the overpaid and petulant . ”
Alas for Citi , he already has a new job managing the Los Angeles Dodgers .

Off with his head
Dealbreaker , a website that covers Wall Street , has joined the throng nominating “ someone for Citi CEO who 's so completely inappropriate for the position , whose nomination is so totally insane that it might actually work ” , by unfunnily suggesting Hitler .
Its readers favour , among others , Maria “ Money Honey ” Bartiromo , a CNBC anchor , presumably because of her familiarity with the bank 's executive jet ( which scandal contributed to the firing by Mr Prince of one potential successor , Todd Thomson ) ; Greg Norman , a professional golfer — presumably because of revelations that , whilst the credit markets froze during the summer , Wall Street bosses seemed to spend most of their time on the golf course ( when not smoking joints ) ; and Stan O'Neal , fired last week as boss of Merrill Lynch .
Indeed , Mr O'Neal might have some appeal to those Citi board members who think the firm is bloated and in need of a boss willing to wield an axe - which he certainly was at Merrill .
The last thing Citi needs , it seems , is someone like Mr Prince , a former lawyer who seems to have struggled with most of his duties at Citi .
Admittedly , he did brilliantly the one thing he was asked to do when he took the job : he kept his predecessor , the 74 - year - old Sandy Weill , out of trouble ( and perhaps jail ) , for his part in the bank 's key roles in many of Wall Street 's worst moments at the turn of the century .
If Citi's board wants another political operator , perhaps it could tempt Dick Parsons , who announced on November 5th that he is giving up the chief executive role at Time Warner .
He certainly did a decent if unspectacular job of steadying a troubled ship , following Time Warner 's disastrous merger with AOL .
The legacy of an ill - advised merger or three is one of Citi 's biggest problems .
Mr Parsons , however , is likely to opt for spending time enjoying his new vineyard whilst contemplating a run in New York 's next mayoral election .
Given Mr Thomson 's departure , and dissatisfaction at the performance of head of wealth management , Sallie Krawcheck , when she was chief financial officer , internal candidates are thin on the ground .
This presumably why the board have opted for a temporary double act at the top : Mr Rubin as chairman and Sir Win Bischoff , a European banking éminence grise , an interim chief executive
It is generally assumed that Citi needs to be broken up , as it is unmanageable in its current form , which resulted from Mr Weill 's throwing together of Travelers Group with Citibank back in 1998 .
It is a sprawling financial supermarket , spanning wealth management , consumer banking and investment banking , that has never delivered the synergy Mr Weill promised .
But it is not clear that any serious effort has ever been made to find that synergy .
The years immediately after the merger were dominated by such fierce infighting between Mr Weill and Citibank 's veteran chairman John Reed that Mr Rubin was recruited to make peace between the warring factions — something he never really managed to do .
Intriguingly , however , in recent months , due to pressure from Citi 's biggest shareholder , Prince Waleed bin Talal , and an outside activist investor , Eddie Lampert , the bank is rumoured to have actually started to put economics before internal politics .
In particular , the new chief financial officer , Gary Crittenden , has been leading a crusade to allocate capital between business units on the basis of expected return on investment , not on whose back the business - unit boss has been scratching .
Indeed , Mr Crittenden , recruited in March from American Express , looks a decent bet for the top job .
Business.view 's top choice , however , is Shaukat Aziz .
The 58 - year - old joined Citibank in 1969 , and worked in various parts of its global empire — including Britain , Greece and Malaysia — before eventually becoming global head of Citi 's private bank .
So he knows the firm well , and certainly has good international experience .
He left in 1999 to become the finance minister of Pakistan ; he is now prime minister .
Pakistan 's economy has flourished during this time , even as its politics have deteriorated .
Given the country 's current state of emergency , he may be tempted to find an exit .
He would surely be alone amongst potential recruits in regarding the job as an opportunity for a quieter life .
The people 's choice , of course , is Jamie Dimon , the boss of JP Morgan , a rival banking giant .
For many years he was regarded as Mr Weill 's adopted son and heir apparent , until he quit Citi in November 1998 after the two men fell out .
One book about Mr Weill was entitled , “ King of Capital ” .
Having already been succeeded by one Prince , will Mr Weill 's crown now pass to the real dauphin ?
Or , stranger still , will the king himself reclaim the throne from which he was so rudely ejected four years ago , under pressure from the regulators .
I ’ve spent three decades learning how to alter people ’s memories .
I ’ve even gone so far as planting entirely false memories into the minds of ordinary people – memories such as being lost in a shopping mall , cutting your hand on broken glass or even witnessing demonic possession as a child , all planted through the power of suggestion .
Psychological scientists have learned so much about planting false memories that some say we almost have recipes for doing so .
But we have n’t seen anything yet .
Over the next 50 years we will further master the ability to create false memories .
We will learn …
How Difficult is it to Write a Compiler ?
Recently I was discussing Converge with someone , and mentioned how little time the core compiler had taken to implement ( no compile - time meta - programming , limited error checking , but a functioning compiler nonetheless ) - only a few days .
The chap I was talking to looked at me and told me that he did n't believe me .
I laughed .
Actually , he really did n't believe me .
Initially that surprised me , and I wondered why he might think that I was pulling his leg .
But then I thought back , and only a few years ago I would probably have had the same reaction .
This article is my attempt to explain his reaction , and why it 's no longer the case .
When I was younger , there were three things in computing that seemed so complex that I had no idea how anyone had ever created them ; certainly , I did n't think I would ever be capable of working on such things .
The imposing triumvirate were hardware , operating systems , and programming languages .
Although electricity has always baffled me , the hardware people have done an amazing job on interoperability of components in recent years , such that I 've never felt the need to gain a low - level understanding of how electrons whizz around my systems .
Operating systems were partially demystified for me as I moved into the world of open source UNIX - like operating systems ( for the record , I 've been an OpenBSD user for 8 years or so ) , where one could poke and prod virtually any aspect - although kernels retain an aura of mystery for most of us .
Despite the fact that I was familiar with several languages , and had even implemented a primitive assembler language ( which , to my surprise , found its way into a real system - my first large - ish programming success ) , real programming languages remained a mystery to me for much longer .
The obvious question is : why ?
Programming languages are , for most of us , an integral part of the computing infrastructure .
Only a small handful of languages have ever had a wide impact , and by the time a programming language becomes popular it already probably has a decade or more of history behind it .
This means that when the average programmer first comes across a new language , it has had substantial development behind it , libraries and documentation , developed its own culture , and undoubtedly had several flaws uncovered ; not to mention lots of little platform portability hacks , and often complex optimisations .
Faced with this wodge of sheer stuff , most peoples reaction is either to shrug their shoulders and accept it at face value ( the majority ) , try to understand it but not know where to start ( a minority ) , or spot how similar it is to every other language ( a tiny handful of people ) .
Because the first two categories massively outnumber the third category , a general feeling - which we 're not necessarily consciously aware of - has developed that programming languages are special , and therefore that only special people can create them ( a veiled insult , if ever I saw one ) .
Thus if I suggest to people that , despite having created a fairly fully featured programming language , I 'm no more capable a programmer than the next man , they dismiss it as false modesty .
So let 's start looking at things in more detail .
If you break a programming language down , it only has a handful of things to it .
What 's more , the variance between different languages is - despite the unfortunate zealotry which often clouds debate - exceedingly small .
In fact , at a high level there are really only two things which any language must have : a definition and an implementation .
Sometimes a paper definition is produced up front , and only when this is complete is an implementation created .
Sometimes the latter defines the former ; but conceptually these are two separate things .
Basically the definition says things like statement S does X , and the implementation actually takes in a source file and compiles S such that it really does do X .
Defining a language is very simple : any fool can do it ( the skill comes in defining a good language , but that 's a different story ) .
We can then break the implementation down into three components : a compiler , libraries , and a run -time system .
Again , these are conceptually separate things , although sometimes they are combined ( e.g. most Python programmers do not distinguish the compiler from the run-time system ) .
Libraries are not difficult to create , although they are time consuming .
Sometimes the run-time system will be a VM , sometimes it will be bundled up with the executable created by a compiler ; regardless , we 'll assume for the purposes of this article that a reasonable VM is already available .
Most people do n't have much trouble understanding the high level view , but it's when they start trying to understand the compiler - the thing that ultimately they interact with - that things start getting more complex .
The problem is that looking at implementations like Python ( quite complex ) , Java ( very complex ) , or GCC ( something beyond merely very complex ) , reveals too much detail to easily uncover the big picture .
The Converge compiler , at the moment at least , is rather simpler ( although , like any other program , it is growing slowly but surely as it accretes features ) and is a nice snapshot of a compiler .
It has three basic stages : Read in a source file , and create a parse tree .
Turn the parse tree into an abstract syntax tree .
Turn the abstract syntax tree into object code .
Although the terminology might be a little different from language to language , these three stages are fairly common ( although they might be augmented by extra stages e.g. for optimisation ) .
Unfortunately my experience is that even at this stage , people look at those three codes and think magic .
Let 's break them down a little more .
Parsing Parsing is the process of reading in a big wodge of text , discovering its underlying structure , and then creating a parse tree which is easy to operate on .
For English , this is a bit like taking in a sentence and discovering what its subject , its verb , and so on is .
Parsing does n't really uncover meaning as such : that 's for later stages .
If we have an input file such as the following : import Sys func main ( ) : Sys :: println ( 2 + 3 ) What is its parse tree ?
Well , in order to uncover that , we use a parsing system , which given a description of a language structure - a grammar - can automatically create a parse tree .
Parsing has a bad reputation , often deservedly so : commonly used parsing technologies are often horrible to use , although it is perfectly possible to make much more pleasant parsing technologies .
Regardless of that , this is the only thing in a compiler where you will need to check an external source to understand a bit more about grammars ( Wikipedia 's page on formal grammars is a decent start ) .
An indicative chunk of the Converge grammar is as follows : top_level ::= definition ( " NEWLINE " definition ) * ::= definition ::= class_def ::= func_def ::= import ::= var_def ( " , " var_def ) * " : = " expr ::= splice ::= insert import ::= " IMPORT " import_name import_as ( " , " import_name import_as ) * import_name ::= " ID " ( " : : " " ID " ) * import_as ::= " AS " " ID " ::=
In essence this says : a program consists of zero or more definitions ; a definition is a class , a function etc. ; an import is one or more module name imports , each of which can assign to a different variable name than the module name ( using as ) .
Given that and our input program , the following parse tree is produced ( using only a couple of lines of code to call a library function or two ) : top_level -> definition -> import -> < IMPORT import > -> import_name -> < ID Sys > -> import_as -> < NEWLINE > -> definition -> func_def -> func_type -> < FUNC func > -> func_name -> < ID main > -> <(> -> func_params -> <) > -> <:> -> < INDENT > -> func_decls -> expr_body -> expr -> application -> expr -> module_lookup -> expr -> var_lookup -> < ID Sys > -> <::> -> < ID println > -> <(> -> expr -> binary -> expr -> number -> < INT 2 > -> binary_op -> <+> -> expr -> number -> < INT 3 > -> <) > -> < DEDENT >
This might look a bit imposing at first , but it 's trivial to convert this back into the original input ( although information about blank lines and comments would disappear reversing the transformation ) .
If you want to see what the parse tree is for other Converge inputs , Converge helpfully includes a little program called convergep which given a source file input automatically prints out its parse tree ( the above output is cut ' n ' paste straight from convergep ) .
If you 've understood this part , congratulations - you 've got over the main stumbling block to creating a compiler .
From parse tree to abstract syntax tree
As stated earlier , a parse tree captures structure , but it does n't capture meaning as such , beyond that which is captured in the structure .
This can be seen by the fact that the parse tree still contains things like the : token , despite the fact this is for the users ' visual benefit , rather than effecting the meaning of the program .
What the second stage of a compiler does is to understand the meaning of the program ( in some sense ) , strip out all the stuff which does n't effect that , and convert it into another , very similar , data structure - the Abstract Syntax Tree ( AST ) - which captures this .
For example the text 2 + 3 is converted from its parse tree equivalent : -> expr -> binary -> expr -> number -> < INT 2 > -> binary_op -> <+> -> expr -> number -> < INT 3 > into an AST along the lines of Add ( Int ( 2 ) , Int ( 3 ) ) .
Notice that typically the parse tree and the AST have almost identical structure .
Because of this , the conversion from parse tree to AST is generally very simple .
For Converge , this conversion is captured in the compiler / Compiler / IModule_Generator.cv file .
As the language grows , clearly this conversion gets larger , but because it is largely mechanical ( and therefore often a simple cut ' n ' paste job ) , it is not a difficult task .
For example in Converge 's early days , when it had approximately the same expressivity as Python , this conversion took around 2 - 3 days to code from scratch .
From abstract syntax tree to object code Object code is an intentionally vague term - it might be machine code , VM bytecode , or even an intermediary programming language .
Basically here we take an AST like Add ( Int ( 2 ) , Int ( 3 ) ) and turn it into instructions such as : INT 2 INT 3 ADD
In a language such as Converge , where the VM is designed explicitly to be used with the language , then there is a strong relationship between the AST and the object code .
In other words , this means that the conversion to object code is about the same size and complexity as the conversion from parse tree to AST .
If you 're converting to , say , assembly code then this will be a trickier task , but even then there will still be a largely mechanical element to the conversion .
You can see this in Converge 's compiler / Compiler / Bytecode_Generator.cv file .
Conclusion
That 's it .
You do n't need to know , or do , any more to create a compiler .
When it 's broken down in this simple way , I hope that it partly demystifies what a compiler is .
There 's nothing particularly magical about a compiler , and with the exception of parsing ( which regretfully is often more involved than it should be ) , nothing particularly complex .
I hope you get some sense of how little work there is in creating a compiler for a simple language .
Of course , if you want to do something a little more complex , then things become rapidly more work , but you'd be amazed how few languages require such complexity .
In conclusion , the main difficulty for most of us in creating a compiler is overcoming the cultural absurdity which tells us that mere mortals can't create compilers .
They can .
I did .
You can too .

The prospect of a wobble on the credit markets is disturbing many
The euro rose to a new peak of $ 1.379 against the dollar early on Thursday , before pulling back to $ 1.3782 .
The pound , already at 26 - year highs against the greenback , touched $ 2.0344 , before easing to $ 2.0297 .
Confidence in the dollar has fallen away as the crisis in the US sub - prime lending sector risks wider volatility and retrenchment in credit markets .
Credit crunch ?
It is feared that banks and other firms with exposure to the riskier US sub - prime mortgage market - which is suffering a wave of repossessions - may scale back investments elsewhere .
Weakness in the housing market has weighed on the dollar with expectations that problems could spread to the wider economy and lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates .
As long as the market is biased toward a Fed cut rather than a hike , the trends stay in place
Derek Halpenny , BTM-UFJ
This comes at a time when rates are rising in most other industrialised economies .
The European Central Bank has been raising rates steadily this year while the Bank of England raised rates for the fifth time in a year earlier this month .
The Bank of Japan opted to keep rates on hold on Thursday , leading the yen to rise temporarily against the dollar , but experts still expect rates to rise again soon .
" As long as the market is biased toward a Fed cut rather than a hike and the European Central Bank and others are raising rates , the trends stays in place , " said Derek Halpenny , senior currency strategist at BTM - UFJ .
Political row
The weak dollar is good news for Europeans travelling to the US this summer .
In contrast , US visitors to the UK and Europe will find life more expensive .
European firms exporting goods to the US may lose competitiveness in the market there , but the cost of raw materials and oil , priced in dollars , will come down .
The currency equation is good for British visitors to the US
The robust euro has become a political issue in recent days with French President Nicolas Sarkozy criticising its impact on French businesses and calling for eurozone members to have more influence over rate - setting policy .
This led to a rebuke from German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said the European Central Bank 's independence was sacrosanct , describing it in an interview with German television as " the alpha and omega " of the organisation 's existence .
" The competitiveness of European economies is decided not on the currency markets but by their capacity for restructuring and innovation , " German finance minister Peer Steinbrueck added on Thursday .
Remember when the Right had a near - monopoly on censorship ?
If so , you must be in your sixties , or older .
Now the champions of censorship are mostly on the left .
And they are thickest on the ground in our colleges and universities .
Since the late 1980s , what should be the most open , debate - driven , and tolerant sector of society has been in thrall to the diversity and political correctness that now form the aggressive secular religion of America ’s elites .
The censors have only grown in power , elevating antidiscrimination rules above “ absolutist ” free - speech principles , silencing dissent with antiharassment policies , and looking away when students bar or disrupt conservative speakers or steal conservative newspapers .
Operating under the tacit principle that “ error has no rights , ” an ancient Catholic theological rule , the new censors are n’t interested in debates or open forums .
They want to shut up dissenters .
In October , for instance , a student mob stormed a Columbia University stage , shutting down speeches by two members of the Minutemen , an anti-illegal - immigration group .
The students shouted : “ They have no right to speak ! ” Campus opponents of Congressman Tom Tancredo , an illegal - immigration foe , set off fire alarms at Georgetown to disrupt his planned speech , and their counterparts at Michigan State roughed up his student backers .
Conservative activist David Horowitz , black conservative columnist Star Parker , and Daniel Pipes , an outspoken critic of Islamism , frequently find themselves shouted down or disrupted on campus .
School officials seem to have little more interest in free speech .
At Columbia this fall , officials turned away most of a large crowd gathered to hear former PLO terrorist - turned - anti- jihadist Walid Shoebat , citing security worries .
Only Columbia students and 20 guests got in .
Colleges often cite the danger of violence as they cancel controversial speeches — a new form of heckler ’s veto : shrinking an audience so that an event will seem unimportant is itself a way to cave to critics .
In 2003 , Columbia , facing leftist fury at the scheduled speeches of several conservatives ( myself included ) , banned scores of invited nonstudents who had agreed to attend .
Though some schools cancel left - wing speakers , too — including Ward Churchill and Michael Moore , or abortion - supporters Anna Quindlen and Christie Whitman at Catholic universities — right - of - center speakers are the campus speech cops ’ normal targets .
Official censorship — now renamed speech codes and antiharassment codes — pervades the campuses .
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) recently surveyed more than 300 schools , including the top universities and liberal arts colleges , and found that over 68 percent explicitly prohibit speech that the First Amendment would protect if uttered off campus .
At 229 schools , FIRE found clear and substantial restriction of speech , while 91 more had policies that one could interpret as restricting speech .
Only eight permitted genuine free expression .
A 2002 New York Times article reported that today ’s college kids seem more guarded in their views than previous generations of students .
The writer suggested several possible explanations — disgust with partisan politics and uncivil debates on cable news shows , perhaps , or simple politeness .
A more likely reason is that universities have made honest disagreement dangerous , making students fearful of saying what they think .
Much campus censorship rests on philosophical underpinnings that go back to social theorist Herbert Marcuse , a hero to sixties radicals .
Marcuse argued that traditional tolerance is repressive — it wards off reform by making the status quo . . . well , tolerable .
Marcuse favored intolerance of established and conservative views , with tolerance offered only to the opinions of the oppressed , radicals , subversives , and other outsiders .
Indoctrination of students and “ deeply pervasive ” censorship of others would be necessary , starting on the campuses and fanning out from there .
By the late 1980s , many of the double standards that Marcuse called for were in place in academe .
Marcuse ’s candor was missing , but everyone knew that speakers , student newspapers , and professors on the right could ( make that should ) receive different treatment from those on the left .
The officially oppressed — designated race and gender groups — knew that they were n’t subject to the standards and rules set for other students .
Marcuse ’s thinking has influenced a generation of influential radical scholars .
They included Mari Matsuda , who followed Marcuse by arguing that complete free speech should belong mainly to the powerless ; and Catharine MacKinnon , a pioneer of modern sexual harassment and “ hostile environment ” doctrine .
In MacKinnon ’s hands , sexual harassment became a form of gender - based class discrimination and inegalitarian speech a kind of harmful action .
Confusing speech and action has a long pedigree on the PC campus .
At the time of the first wave of speech codes 20 years ago , Kenneth Lasson , a law professor at the University of Baltimore , argued that “ racial defamation does not merely ‘ preach hate ’ ; it is the practice of hatred by the speaker ” — and is thus punishable as a form of assault .
Indeed , the Left has evolved a whole new vocabulary to blur the line between acts and speech : “ verbal conduct ” and “ expressive behavior ” ( speech ) , “ non-traditional violence ” ( Lani Guinier ’s term for strong criticism ) , and “ anti-feminist intellectual harassment ” ( rolling one ’s eyeballs over feminist dogma ) .
Campus censors frequently emulate the Marcusian double standard by combining effusive praise for free speech with an eagerness to suppress unwelcome views .
“ I often have to struggle with right and wrong because I am a strong believer in free speech , ” said Ronni Santo , a gay student activist at UCLA in the late nineties .
“ Opinions are protected under the First Amendment , but when negative opinions come out of a person ’s fist , mouth , or pen to intentionally hurt others , that ’s when their opinions should no longer be protected . ”
In their 1993 book , The Shadow University , Alan Charles Kors and Harvey Silverglate turned some of the early speech codes into national laughingstocks .
Among the banned comments and action they listed : “ intentionally producing psychological discomfort ” ( University of North Dakota ) , “ insensitivity to the experience of women ” ( University of Minnesota ) , and “ inconsiderate jokes ” ( University of Connecticut ) .
Serious nonverbal offenses included “ inappropriate laughter ” ( Sarah Lawrence College ) , “ eye contact or the lack of it ” ( Michigan State University ) , and “ subtle discrimination , ” such as “ licking lips or teeth ; holding food provocatively ” ( University of Maryland ) .
Later gems , added well after the courts struck down campus codes as overly broad , included bans on “ inappropriate non-verbals ” ( Macalaster College ) , “ communication with sexual overtones ” ( Lincoln University ) , and “ discussing sexual activities ” ( State University of New York–Brockport ) .
Other codes bar any comment or gesture that “ annoys , ” “ offends , ” or otherwise makes someone feel bad .
Tufts ruled that attributing harassment complaints to the “ hypersensitivity of others who feel hurt ” is itself harassment .
Brockport , which banned “ cartoons that depict religious figures in compromising situations , ” “ jokes making fun of any protected group , ” and “ calling someone an old hag , ” helpfully described for students what does not constitute sexual harassment : “ non-coercive interaction (s ) . . . that are acceptable to both parties . ”
Commented Greg Lukianoff of FIRE : “ The wonder is that anyone would risk speaking at all at SUNY Brockport . ”
Despite numerous court decisions overturning these codes , they have proliferated .
College officials point to the hurt feelings of women or minorities as evidence that a violation must have occurred , in part because they want to avoid charges of racism , sexism , and homophobia — an overriding fear in today ’s academe , where diversity offices can swarm with 40 or 50 administrators .
The Clinton administration ’s commissioner of civil rights in the Department of Education , Norma Cantú , reinforced this trend by interpreting racial and sexual harassment broadly , with an implied threat to withhold federal funds if universities did n’t vigorously counter it .
In 2003 , the DOE office of civil rights issued a weary clarification , explaining to universities that harassment does n’t mean merely feeling offended .
The letter has had little effect on the censoring fervor of the campuses , however .
Occidental College officials soon found a student radio shock jock guilty of sexual harassment for using various crude terms on the air , calling one student a “ bearded feminist ” and another “ half man , half vagina . ”
On many a campus , tastelessness equals harassment .
Georgia
Tech went so far as to ban “ denigrating ” comments on “ beliefs , ” which would make almost any passionate argument over ideas a violation .
Needless to say , the targets here are usually conservative .
Ohio State University at Mansfield launched a sexual harassment investigation of a research librarian , Scott Savage , for recommending the inclusion of four conservative books , including popular works by David Horowitz and ex-senator Rick Santorum , on a freshman reading list .
Two professors had complained that one of the books , The Marketing of Evil , by journalist David Kupelian , was “ homophobic tripe ” and “ hate literature . ”
This may have been the first time that a campus charged that a book recommendation qualified as sexual harassment .
After a burst of publicity and a threat to sue , the university dropped the investigation .
Student censors regularly spirit away whole print runs of conservative student newspapers , almost always without reproof from administrators .
Over the years , campus officials , including a few university presidents , have even encouraged such stealing .
After repeated thefts of the Dartmouth Review , an official egged on the thieves by calling the paper “ litter ” and “ abandoned property . ”
In a commencement speech , former Cornell president Hunter Rawlings III praised students who seized and burned copies of the conservative Cornell Review in retaliation for printing a gross parody of Ebonics .
Once in a blue moon , a college president vigorously defends free speech .
At Northern Kentucky University , president James Votruba rebuked and suspended a tenured feminist professor , Sally Jacobsen , who led a group that demolished a campus - approved right - to - life display .
Jacobsen cited two justifications : her deep feelings and her alleged free - speech right to tear down displays that offend her .
“ I did invite students to express their freedom of speech rights to destroy the display if they wished , ” she said .
“ Any violence perpetrated against that silly display was minor compared to how I felt when I saw it . ”
But far more typical than Votruba was Washington State University president V. Lane Rawlins , who hailed the disruption — and subsequent cancellation — of an intentionally offensive student play that irritated blacks , Christians , Jews , gays , and others .
Rawlins defended the disrupters , saying that they had “ exercised their rights of free speech in a very responsible manner . ”
Later documents showed that the university had actually organized and financed them .
In the real world , such a revelation would have cost Rawlins his job .
But on today ’s campus , it passes without comment , in part because students can point out , with perfect moral justification , that forcing the cancellation of speeches and stealing newspapers are just logical extensions of campus speech codes .
Nothing makes the campus censors angrier than someone who dares to question race and gender preferences , especially if he uses satire to do it .
That ’s why the anti-affirmative - action bake sales that conservative students have sponsored at many schools — white male customers can buy cookies for $ 1 , with lower prices for women and various minorities — have provoked such ferocious responses from campus authorities .
Grand Valley State University in Allendale , Michigan , provides a typical example .
A Republican club there staged a bake sale , and several students then said that they felt offended .
This amounted to a powerful argument , since hurt feelings are trump cards in the contemporary campus culture .
( At the University of Wisconsin , for example , a black student testified in defense of the faculty speech code , complaining bitterly that a professor had used the word “ niggardly ” while teaching Chaucer .
“ I was in tears , ” she said .
“ It ’s not up to the rest of the class to decide whether my feelings are valid . ” )
Next came the usual administrative scramble to suppress free speech while expressing great respect for it .
The university charged the club with a violation of the student code and threatened sanctions .
The students folded under administrative pressure and apologized .
When the Republican club president refused to back down , club members asked him to resign , and he did .
The students ’ retreat was understandable , if not very courageous .
The university in effect was trying them for bias , with the likelihood that a notation of racism would become part of their academic record and follow them to post - college job interviews .
The College Republicans at Northeastern Illinois University canceled an announced affirmative - action bake sale after the administration threatened punishment .
Dean of students Michael Kelly announced that the cookie sellers would be violating university rules and that “ any disruption of university activities that would be caused by this event is also actionable . ”
This principle — politically incorrect speakers are responsible for attacks on them by students who resent their speech — is dear to campus censors ’ hearts .
The university did n’t view itself as engaging in censorship — and double - standard censorship at that , since it freely allowed a satirical wage - gap bake sale run by feminists .
Absurdly , Kelly said that the affirmative - action sale would be fine — if cookie prices were the same for whites , minorities , and women .
Other administrators complained that differential pricing of baked goods is unfair , thus unwittingly proving the whole point of the parody .
Schools will use almost any tactic to shut the bake sales down .
At the University of Washington , the administration said that the sponsor had failed to get a food permit .
At Grand Valley , the university counsel argued that the sale of a single cupcake would convert political commentary into forbidden campus commerce .
At Texas A&M , the athletics director argued that a satirical bake sale would damage the sports teams by making it harder to recruit minorities .
One of the PC campus ’s worst excesses in suppressing unwanted speech is the drive by gays and their allies to banish or break Christian groups for their traditional beliefs on sexuality .
Some 20 campuses have acted to de-recognize or de-fund religious groups that oppose homosexuality ( as well as nonmarital sex ) , often accusing them of violating antidiscrimination rules — that is , refusing to let gays be members , or allowing them to belong but not serve as officers .
The language of many policies would require a Democratic club to accept a Republican president , a Jewish group to allow a Holocaust - denying member , or a Muslim organization to accept a leader who practices voodoo .
About half of the attempts to move against Christian clubs have failed .
The University of North Carolina–Chapel
Hill dropped its move against a Christian club three days after getting a friendly warning letter from FIRE .
“ UNC could n’t defend in public what it was willing to do in private , ” said FIRE president Alan Charles Kors .
“ If an evangelical Christian who believed homosexuality to be a sin tried to become president of a university ’s Bisexual , Gay and Lesbian Alliance , the administration would have led candlelight vigils on behalf of diversity and free association . ”
Such Marcusian double standards — freedom for me , but not for thee — now have a beachhead in the law , thanks to the legendarily left - wing Ninth Circuit .
In response to a “ Day of Silence ” sponsored by the Gay - Straight Alliance at his Poway , California , high school , Tyler Harper wore a shirt that proclaimed , on the front , “ Be Ashamed , Our School Embraced What God Has Condemned , ” and on the back , “ Homosexuality Is Shameful / Romans 1:27 . ”
The school principal ordered Harper to take off the shirt .
Harper refused , and sued .
He argued that the purpose of the “ Day of Silence ” was to “ endorse , promote and encourage homosexual activity ” and that he had a First Amendment right to use his T - shirt message as a rebuttal .
When the Poway case reached the Ninth Circuit , Judge Stephen Reinhardt and his colleague Judge Sidney R. Thomas argued in a two - to - one decision that it is permissible to exclude T - shirt messages from First Amendment protection if they strike at a “ core identifying characteristic of students on the basis of their membership as a minority group ” — with minority status conveyed by categories “ such as race , religion , and sexual orientation . ”
This ruling , unless the Supreme Court takes it up and overturns it , creates a large new category of viewpoints that the First Amendment does n’t safeguard , at least within the Ninth Circuit .
Based on the loose language — “ such as ” could apply to numerous groups — criticism of illegal aliens might now lack First Amendment protection , says UCLA law prof Eugene Volokh .
Presumably , too , one can no longer criticize any minority religious opinion , such as the Islamic view that cartoons mocking Mohammed are out - of - bounds .
But pictures of Christ in urine would be perfectly fine , since Christianity remains America ’s majority faith .
Some on the left applaud such Marcusian hairsplitting , arguing that First Amendment “ absolutists ” must learn to “ balance ” free speech and special protections for vulnerable groups .
But in dissent , Judge Alex Kozinski expressed “ considerable difficulty understanding the source and sweep of the novel doctrine the majority announces today ” — nothing in state , federal , or common law supports it , he noted .
To understand the rising disrespect for free expression in the U.S. , Kozinski might have been better off looking to Canada and Europe , both a bit ahead of us — if that ’s the right phrase — in embracing PC censorship .
Despite stated respect for free speech in its national constitution , Canada now has a national speech code and judges and elites eager to expand it .
The Canadian Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings stating that the government may limit speech in the name of worthwhile goals , such as ending discrimination , ensuring social harmony , or promoting sexual equality .
The state may now seize published material judged to “ degrade ” or “ dehumanize ” any group .
What free - speech supporters would regard as horrendous abuses have become commonplace .
In 1997 , for instance , the mayor of London , Ontario , ran afoul of Canada ’s Human Rights Code for refusing to declare a Gay Pride day , citing her Christian beliefs .
The British Columbia College of Teachers refuses to certify teacher education programs at Christian universities if they urge students to abstain from premarital sex , adultery , or homosexual sex .
The province ’s hate - speech laws use extremely broad language , criminalizing statements that “ indicate ” discrimination or that “ likely ” will expose a group or one of its members to hatred or contempt .
Ted Byfield , editor of the now - defunct Alberta Report , violated that province ’s human rights law by publishing an article noting that some children were grateful for the education they received at the government ’s residential schools for Indians , much despised by multiculturalists and admittedly abuse - plagued .
An injunction against the Alberta Report forbade stories on partial - birth abortions after Byfield ran a story quoting unnamed nurses and official documents saying that some babies subject to the procedure at a Calgary hospital were born alive and deliberately allowed to starve to death .
Canada has become “ a pleasantly authoritarian country , ” observes Alan Borovoy , general counsel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association .
Robert Martin , a constitutional law prof at the University of Western Ontario , is harsher : Canada is now “ a totalitarian theocracy , ” he says , devoted to the secular state religion of political correctness .
Things are no freer across the pond .
The Irish Council for Civil Liberties announced that it would prosecute any priests found distributing or quoting the pope ’s words forbidding gay marriage .
In England , author Lynette Burrows drew a police investigation for saying on a talk show that she opposes homosexual adoption .
An Oxford student fared worse after a night out to celebrate the end of exams .
Stopped by a mounted policeman , he drunkenly quipped , “ Excuse me , do you realize your horse is gay ? ”
Unfortunately , the humor - free local constabulary arrested the young man under the Public Order Act for making homophobic remarks .
By law , 11 European nations can punish anyone who publicly denies the Holocaust .
That ’s why the discredited Holocaust - denying British historian David Irving went to prison in Austria .
Ken Livingstone , London ’s madcap mayor , drew a monthlong suspension for calling a Jewish reporter a Nazi .
A Swedish pastor went through a long and harrowing prosecution for a sermon criticizing homosexuality , finally beating the rap in Sweden ’s supreme court .
Naturally enough , Muslims want to play the same victim game as other aggrieved groups .
The French Council of Muslims says that it ’s considering taking France Soir , which reprinted the Danish cartoons , to court for provocation .
When French novelist Michel Houellebecq said some derogatory things about the Koran , Muslim groups hauled him into court , which eventually exonerated him .
The late Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci wrote an angry anti-Muslim book , meant to waken the West to the gravity of the threat posed by Islam .
Her prosecution in Italy for writing the book was pending when she died in October .
Much of Europe has painted itself into a corner on Muslim - driven censorship .
What can Norway say to pro-censorship Muslims when it already has a hate - speech law forbidding , among other things , “ publicly stirring up one part of the population against another , ” or any utterance that “ threatens , insults or subjects to hatred , persecution , or contempt any person or group of persons because of their creed , race , color , or national or ethnic origin . . . or homosexual bent ” ?
No insulting utterances at all ?
Since most strong opinions can seem insulting to someone — can hurt someone ’s feelings — no insults means no free speech .
Chafing under First Amendment restrictions , many censorship - prone American leftists look longingly toward successful speech control up north or overseas .
That ’s what they want right here .
We are very lucky to have the First Amendment .
Without it , our chattering classes would be falling all over themselves to ban speech that offends sensitive groups , just as Canadian - and Euro - chatterers are doing now .
We know this because our campus speech codes , the models for the disastrous hate - speech laws elsewhere , were the inventions of our own elites .
Without a First Amendment , the distortions and suppressions of campus life would likely have gone national .
Mel Gibson , Michael Richards , and many rap artists would be in jail , or at least facing charges .
The cause of free speech can no longer expect much help from the American Civil Liberties Union , more concerned today with civil rights and multicultural issues than with civil liberties and free speech .
True , the ACLU still takes some censorship cases — it led the fight against the first wave of campus speech codes circa 1990 , for instance .
But the rise of the ACLU ’s internal lobbies or “ projects , ” such as the Lesbian and Gay Project and the Immigrants ’
Rights Project , has made the organization look more and more like a traditional left - wing pressure group , with little passion for the First Amendment .
The ACLU is also following the money : funds flow in because the group responds to concerns of feminist , gays , and other identity groups , not because of its historical defense of free speech and civil liberties .
These days , the ACLU visibly stands aloof from obvious First Amendment cases — such as the college speech and harassment codes — and even comes down on the anti- free - speech side .
Consider the group ’s stance in Aguilar v. Avis Rent - A - Car System , a case involving ethnic epithets aimed by supervisors at Latino employees of Avis in San Francisco .
A California court ruled that Avis had permitted a hostile environment .
The California Supreme Court , abetted by both the northern Californian and the national ACLU , agreed , and upheld the lower court ’s startling speech restriction : prior restraint on workers ’ speech , forbidding a judge - made list of specific words .
These words , not yet revealed or promulgated , will soon be taboo in every California workplace , even outside the earshot of Latino employees , and even if they are welcome .
As civil libertarian Nat Hentoff wrote : “ This may be the broadest and vaguest restriction of speech in American legal history . ”
Even with the ACLU , the mainstream media , school officials , and much of the professorate AWOL , the speech police have n’t gone unopposed .
Just ask former Clinton official Donna Shalala .
As chancellor of the University of Wisconsin in the late eighties , she proved a fervent early advocate of campus speech restrictions .
Though Shalala occasionally praised free speech , she and her team imposed not only a full - fledged student speech code , later struck down in federal court , but also a faculty code that provoked the first ( and so far , only ) pro-free - speech campus campaign strong enough to repeal such repressive restrictions .
The Wisconsin faculty code was a primitive , totalitarian horror .
Professors found themselves under investigation , sometimes for months , without a chance to defend themselves or even to know about the secret proceedings .
One female professor said : “ It was like being put in prison for no reason .
I had no idea what it was that I was supposed to have done . ”
A small group of free - speech - minded faculty formed the Committee for Academic Freedom and Rights ( CAFR ) .
The group asked for help from the Wisconsin chapter of the pro-free - speech National Association of Scholars , which enlisted as speakers such celebrated allies as Alan Dershowitz and National Journal columnist Jonathan Rauch .
The First Amendment forces got a lucky break when the university signed a foolish contract with Reebok , in which it received millions of dollars in exchange for the use of the company ’s footwear by campus sports teams .
The contract included a clause forbidding negative comments on Reebok products by any “ University employee , agent or representative . ”
The clause greatly irritated the anticorporate campus Left , which had usually been lukewarm or indifferent to free - speech concerns , helping convert some of its members to the anti-speech - code side .
Later , a strong defense of free speech by a homosexual professor , called a traitor to his identity group for his courage , brought in other campus leftist allies .
CAFR was amazed at how quickly many would - be censors backed down when confronted with controversy and threatened lawsuits .
Wisconsin rescinded its faculty code — the first university to do so without a court order .
New national groups have joined the fight for free speech on campus ( and off ) , among them the Center for Individual Rights , the Alliance Defense Fund , and FIRE , the most relentless of the newcomers .
FIRE usually starts a campaign with a polite letter to a university president , noting that some policy is either unconstitutional or a clear violation of civil liberties .
If it does n’t get the change it wants , it will then write to trustees , parents , and alumni , and take its case to the media .
FIRE now has an extensive network of campus free - speech “ spies , ” as its cofounder , Harvey Silverglate , jauntily calls them ( Alan Charles Kors , the other cofounder , prefers “ concerned members of the community ” ) .
The organization is seeking new ways to open up closed campus systems , too , such as suing administrators as individuals , which FIRE believes will get their full attention .
Another new tactic is to publicize what colleges spend on fighting for unconstitutional speech codes .
Most of all , FIRE is trying to show stubborn administrators that the era of hiding gross civil liberties violations behind a PC wall of silence is over : the group wins more than 95 percent of its cases .
Political correctness took hold when there were 40 radio talk shows , three networks , and no bloggers .
Today , the cross-referencing of PC outrages among bloggers , radio talkers , and rights groups makes it hard to run an old - fashioned repressive campus .
University presidents now understand that their reputations do not rest entirely with the PC platoons .
Donna Shalala escaped Wisconsin with her reputation intact .
Sheldon Hackney , former president of Penn , did not .
( I named my own annual award for the worst college president , the “ Sheldon , ” in his honor . )
When he stepped down from the Penn presidency , he did n’t become the head of a major foundation , as many expected ; instead , he wound up returning to Penn as a professor .
Other reputations hang in the balance .
Lee Bollinger , a First Amendment expert ( and affirmative - action advocate ) , was invisible during the free - speech debates at Michigan and is almost as recessive today as president of Columbia .
But it is getting harder for the Hackneys and Bollingers to waffle .
Perhaps the battle to release the campuses from the iron grasp of PC will take decades , but the struggle for free speech is being fought — and won — now .

Tough financial questions come your way all the time .
How much do I need to save ?
Should I buy or lease ?
Should I refinance my mortgage ?
It would sure be nice to have an easy guide on hand for those moments .
Now you do .
Home
1 . For return on investment , the best home renovation is to upgrade an old bathroom .
Kitchens come in second .
2 . It ’s worth refinancing your mortgage when you can cut your interest rate by at least one point .
3 . Spend no more than 21/2 times your income on a home .
For a down payment , it ’s best to come up with at least 20 % .
4 . Your total housing payments should not exceed 28 % of your gross income .
Total debt payments should come in under 36 % .
5 . Never hire a roofer , driveway paver or chimney sweep who is going door to door .
Invest
6 . All else being equal , the best place to invest is a 401 ( k ) .
Once you ’ve earned the full company match , max out a Roth IRA .
Still have money to invest ?
Put more in your 401 ( k ) or a traditional IRA .
7 . To figure out what percentage of your money should be in stocks , subtract your age from 120 .
8 . Invest no more than 10 % of your portfolio in your company stock – or any single company ’s stock , for that matter .
9 . The most you should pay in annual fees for a mutual fund is 1 % for a large - company stock fund , 1.3 % for any other type of stock fund and 0.6 % for a U.S. bond fund .
10 .
Aim to build a retirement nest egg that is 25 times the annual investment income you need .
So if you want $ 40,000 a year to supplement Social Security and a pension , you must save $ 1 million .
11 . If you do n’t understand how an investment works , do n’t buy it .
Plan
12 . If you ’re not saving 10 % of your salary , you are n’t saving enough .
13 . Keep three months ’ worth of living expenses in a bank savings account or a money - market fund for emergencies .
If you have kids or rely on one income , make it sixmonths ’ .
14 . Aim to accumulate enough money to pay for a third of your kids ’ college costs .
You can borrow the rest or cover it from your income .
15 .
You need enough life insurance to replace at least five years of your salary – as much as 10 years if you have several young children or significant debts .
16 .
When you buy insurance , choose the highest deductible you can afford .
It ’s the easiest way to lower your premium .
17 .
The best credit card is a no - fee rewards card that you pay in full every month .
But if you carry a balance , high interest rates will wipe out the benefits .
18 . The bestway to improve your credit score is to pay bills on time and to borrow no more than 30 % of your available credit .
19 .
Anyone who calls or e-mails you asking for your Social Security number or information about your bank or credit - card account is a scam artist .
Spend
20 .
The best way to save money on a car is to buy a late - model used car and drive it until it ’s junk .
A car loses 30 % of its value in the first year .
21 . Lease a new car or truck only if you plan to replace it within two or three years .
22 . Resist the urge to buy the latest computer or other gadget as soon as it comes out .
Wait three months and the price will be lower .
23 .
Buy airline tickets early because the cheapest fares are snapped up first .
Most seats go on sale 11 months in advance .
24 .
Do n’t redeem frequent - flier miles unless you can get more than a dollar ’s worth of air fare or other stuff for every 100 miles you spend .
25 .
When you shop for electronics , do n’t pay for an extended warranty .
One exception :
It ’s a laptop and the warranty is from the manufacturer .

SINGAPORE , Aug. 1 — Stock markets in Asia fell sharply today on concerns about widening mortgage woes in the United States and the threats they pose : that investors are being forced to sell Asian assets to cover losses in the United States , and that hard - pressed American homeowners will scale back their demand for Asian exports .
The Nikkei 225 stock average , the benchmark for the Japanese market , fell by more than 2 percent , erasing the gains it had made so far this year .
Widely watched indexes in Hong Kong and Australia fell by more than 3 percent each .
South Korea ’s key index slid by 4 percent .
European stock markets followed the declines in Asia in their morning trading , and were generally down by 1 to 2 percent at midday there .
The FTSE 100 index in Britain was off 1.4 percent , the DAX in Germany dropped 0.9 percent and the CAC 40 in France slid nearly 1.8 percent .
I have a message for our college campuses : People like Horowitz and Malkin speak at colleges because they WANT to be booed .
Then FOX can run the video over and over all day to play the poor little Conservative victim card .
The idiotic " Islamo - fasicsts " week is pure lunacy , but David craves your disapproval .
He uses the canard that he 's trying to also make people aware that women are being oppressed in the Middle East too .
I 'm sure he 's a big Feminist ...

A former marine points out Horowitz ' racism associated with this venture :
" There 's an inhernet racism behind this that I experienced first hand through my service with the Marine Corps in Iraq . "
David even tries to compare himself to the President of Iran .
Listen David , stop trying to spread fear and hatred in our country .
Even the wild dude Jimbo , from the right wing site Black Five called the event " lame " and the College Republicans were mad at him :
He was so uninspiring a speaker they did n't even really heckle him .
I will give credit to the Muslim Student Association and the other groups who were there in opposition , they maintained more decorum than Mr. Horowitz .
By the end he was saying " Well I guess you just are n't able to read " and " I do n't know what to do if you can't add two and two and get four "
We held out ' til the end and the Q&A had Horowitz launching the testy ad hominems I noted and complaining that the questions were too long in comparison to his epic length musings on how dumb his audience was .
I heard the College Republicans , who sponsored him , were wicked pissed .

Request to fit B - 2 bombers with bunker busting bombs raises questions on Iran John Byrne
Published : Thursday October 25 , 2007

It 's just what the White House would need to bomb Iran -- money to modify stealth B - 2 bombers to carry a bunker - busting bomb .
Buried in the White House 's $ 196 billion emergency funding request for Iraq and Afghanistan is a line that has some analysts watching the prospect of an Iran strike concerned : $ 88 million to modify US jets so they can carry a newly developed 30,000 - pound bomb called the massive ordnance penetrator .
According to ABC News ' Jonathan Karl , the one - line explanation for the request said it is in response to " an urgent operational need from theater commanders . "
Karl called CENTCOM to ask what the " urgent " need was for an article published Wednesday .
CENTCOM said they 'd look into it but never called back .
Last month , a national security source told The London Times that the Pentagon has " drawn up plans for massive airstrikes against 1,200 targets in Iran , designed to annihilate the Iranians military capability in three days . "
According to the paper , a Washington source said the " temperature was rising " to launch an Iranian attack inside the Bush administration .
This information comes on the heels of reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency last week that cited " significant cooperation " with Iran over its nuclear program , including the slowing of uranium enrichment .
The most recent report by the nuclear watchdog agency , however , said that Iran was three to eight years away from building a bomb .
Northrop Grumman , which developed the bomb in concert with Boeing starting in 2002 , announced earlier this year that they 'd begun integrating the bomb with B - 2s in July .
" The company is doing the work under a seven - month , $ 2.5 million contract awarded June 1 by the Air Force 's Aeronautical Systems Center , Wright Patterson AFB , Ohio , " the company wrote in a July 19 release .
" The new Massive Ordnance Penetrator ( MOP ) , which is being developed by The Boeing Company , is a GPS - guided weapon containing more than 5,300 pounds of conventional explosives inside a 20.5 - foot long enclosure of hardened steel , " the release added .
" It is designed to penetrate dirt , rock and reinforced concrete to reach enemy bunker or tunnel installations .
The B - 2 is capable of carrying two MOPs , one in each weapons bay . "
ABC notes that there appear to be few targets such a weapon would be useful for in Iraq .
It could be used on Taliban or Qaeda targets in Pakistan caves , though there 'd be scant need for a stealth bomber .
" You 'd use it on Natanz , " John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org told ABC , referring to a site inside Iran .
" And you 'd use it on a stealth bomber because you want it to be a surprise .
And you put in an emergency funding request because you want to bomb quickly . "
" It 's kind of strange , " Pike said .
" It sends a signal that you are preparing to bomb Iran , and if you were actually going to bomb Iran I would n't think you would want to announce it like that . "
Assuming Northrop 's seven - month contract began in July , the project would be complete in January .

Early last month , a bombshell hit the Internet on the Drudge Report .
A report had been posted that a New Jersey Assembly bill , No. 1327 to be precise , had been introduced with the intent of silencing dissent on the Internet .
The implications of this bill were immediately recognized by those of us committed to the truth as is available only on the Internet .
Not that the Internet and its alternative media [ AM ] is completely pure and pristine ­ there are more than enough websites serving as shills for the criminal Bush regime ­ but when compared to the Jewish owned and operated corporate establishment mainstream media [ MSM ] , the Internet offers the refreshing breath of truth .
As professor Stephen Walt , until just recently a dean of the prestigious Harvard University JFK School of Government , was removed from his position for daring to criticize the Jewish lobby which always puts Israeli interests over ours , his report , co-authored by professor John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago , also pointed out the egregious shaping of American political opinion against our own national interests via the MSM .
And nowhere in America can this unholy propaganda be best put on display but in ­ you guessed it !
­ the most corrupt state in the Union : the " Sopranos " State of New Jersey .
In my previous column for Rense , I referenced a November 21 , 2003 Rense piece by John Whitely entitled : " Seven Jewish Americans Control Most US Media . "
Whitely begins : " Today , seven Jewish Americans run the vast majority of US television networks , the printed press , the Hollywood movie industry , the book publishing industry , and the recording industry .
Most of these industries are bundled into huge media conglomerates run by the following seven individuals : Gerald Levin , CEO and Director of AOL Time Warner Michael Eisner , [ formerly ] Chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company Edgar Bronfman , Sr. , Chairman of Seagram Company Ltd Edgar Bronfman , Jr , President and CEO of Seagram Company Ltd and head of Universal Studios Sumner Redstone , Chairman and CEO of Viacom , Inc Dennis Dammerman , Vice Chairman of General Electric Peter Chernin , President and Co-COO of News Corporation Limited Those seven Jewish men collectively control ABC , NBC , CBS , the Turner Broadcasting System , CNN , MTV , Universal Studios , MCA Records , Geffen Records , DGC Records , GRP Records , Rising Tide Records , Curb / Universal Records , and Interscope Records . "
And now for the crucial link : " Most of the larger independent newspapers are owned by Jewish interests as well .
An example is media mogul is Samuel I. ' Si ' Newhouse , who owns two dozen daily newspapers from Staten Island to Oregon , plus the Sunday supplement Parade ; the Conde Nast collection of magazines , including Vogue , The New Yorker , Vanity Fair , Allure , GQ , and Self ; the publishing firms of Random House , Knopf , Crown , and Ballantine , among other imprints ; and cable franchises with over one million subscribers . "
" Si " Newhouse and his family own and operate New Jersey 's largest newspaper , The Newark Star - Ledger , now billing itself merely as The Star - Ledger .
I have long loathed and despised their " liberal " stance , especially on gun control , their trashing of the Boy Scouts of America , their loving and tender passion for big and ever - expanding government , and their love of the New Jersey Supreme Court and its penchant for writing and enforcing the state 's laws , especially laws affecting school and education spending .
The latter " legislation " ordered by the Court has saddled New Jersey taxpayers with the highest property taxes in America ; and this along with the highest car insurance premiums as well .
It was The Star - Ledger that launched and bled over the Billy Dale story , placing the rights of this admitted homosexual over those of the Boy Scouts of America and their exercise of " freedom of association " as protected in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights .
The Newhouse gang launched the campaign that attacked the Scouts from coast to coast , and turned cities and towns across the United States against them .
Even Donald Rumsfeld and the United Way took turns in smashing the Scouts .
And who launched " smart gun " legislation in New Jersey if not the Jewish Star - Ledger ?
As I had offered previously , Jews not only control our foreign policy putting Israel 's interests over our own , but shape public opinion on domestic issues as well .
And those domestic issues , more often then not , are direct attacks upon our Bill of Rights .
Returning now to New Jersey Assembly Bill No. 1327 , originating from the office of Peter J. Biondi , Assemblyman from the 16th District of Somerset and Morris Counties , the bill was clearly worded to provide traceability for any and all postings by individuals to allow for prosecution of " persons injured by false defamatory messages posted on public forum websites . "
That wording is on the very FIRST page of the proposed legislation .
Now let us for a moment consider laws and courts , as well as the role of justice .
And please recall the first premise of the establishment of American national government created by the people to " establish justice . "
There are two basic court systems in America : civil court and criminal court .
In matters where one party injures another , remedies are provided in law to enforce equity and justice .
If one person injures another , either monetarily in terms of property or reputation such that that injury will make the victim less than whole , then remedies are available either in terms of sanctions against the perpetrator for a crime committed , or for personal damage that can be adjudicated in a civil court .
There are no provisions for equity and justice in any court of law in America for " bad behavior " or incivility .
But the bill in question advocated by Assemblyman Biondi is now being represented by him and his office as being merely a proposed law to enforce " good behavior " in public forum postings on the Internet .
Since when is bad behavior and bad manners a crime ?
The first page of his bill mentions " persons injured " by " false " messages .
Are n't there already provisions and remedies in civil law to allow for redress of such injuries ?
Why do we need Biondi 's bill ?
The answer is painfully clear , even if not to Biondi and his staff .
I pointed out to them who the real driver of this bill was after receiving a reply to the letter I sent to the Assemblyman , copying representatives from my own District on the letterhead of my citizen 's activist group .
In an article entitled " Internet Backlash Stalls Jersey Civility Bill " posted on Alex Jones ' Prison Planet.com on March 15th by K.C. Jones , the article begins : " A New Jersey Assemblyman 's Internet civility bill is on ice since opponents [ including me ] blasted it as an assault on free speech . "
The article goes on : " Assemblyman Peter Biondi and his staff said they were trying to curb malicious exchanges on some local discussion boards when they introduced a bill requiring people to provide their real names and addresses before posting on public Web sites .
The bill also stated that hosts could be sued for failing to disclose the identities of people disseminating false or defamatory information .
Even without such information , my local police department was able to trace hate e-mails back to a Jew in the next town who was threatening me and my website provider after I posted some truthful commentary about Israel , not much unlike what Mearsheimer and Walt did on a more significant scale with their Harvard report on the influence minority Jews have on American foreign policy .
Fortunately for the Jew , the police did n't reveal his address , but I know they located him when they revealed what town he lived in .
I 'm from New York , and I 've got a temper .
I mention the foregoing incident only because I included this incident in the letter I wrote to Biondi .
In all fairness , even though I 'm not from his District , he responded quickly and politely .
By the way , check out the definition of " civility " in the dictionary , and you 'll see that the term has nothing whatsoever to do with libel , slander or defamatory and injurious falsehoods .
In his letter to me , Biondi points directly to the source of his concerns .
He cites the uncivil behavior in public forums as was mentioned in the Jones piece ; but he offers " in particular the forums on www.nj.com. "
NJ.com , huh ?
Well whatdyaknow !
Guess who owns and operates NJ DOT COM ?
Does the name " Newhouse " ring a bell ?
Does the name The Star - Ledger ring a bell ?
Are we speaking of uncivil behavior on that website that could be described as " hate crimes ? "
Nah , impossible !
After all , this is a Jewish MSM website , and we all know only Christians and Muslims are capable of " hate crimes . "
NJ DOT COM is owned and operated by Newhouse and his Star - Ledger !
It was the Reverend Ted Pike who wrote on Rense that behind every assault on Christianity or a Christian religious celebration , you 'll find a hateful , hurtful Jew .
And I have indeed found this to be true in my very own town that now celebrates the " Holiday Tree Lighting " ceremony at Christmas time .
It can now also be said , that whenever a right or freedom protected by the Bill of Rights is being assaulted , guess who is behind it .
Think of the pulled Rachel Corrie play in New York ; think of the pulled Ed Asner interview on CNN ; think of the demoted Harvard professor ; think of the constantly proposed " hate crimes " legislation and author David Irving ; think of the pulled Downing Street Memo report ; think of the pulled investigation and prosecution of the " Weehawken Five ; " and think of the pulled World Trade Center buildings and 3,000 of our fellow American citizens .

Hearing Their Side Soldiers watch documentary as Iraqi insurgents tell their side in the conflict .
BAGHDAD , Oct. 8 , 2007  --
It 's the strangest film screening I 've ever been to : a film in which Iraqi insurgents play the starring role , telling their story of why they kill Americans .
The venue : Faw Palace , headquarters for Camp Victory , the largest American base in Iraq .
The audience : American servicemen and servicewomen in Iraq — the toughest critics of all for a film meant to provoke strong reactions .
And where did this film come from ?
The deepest bowels of the Internet ?
A jihadist Web site , maybe ?
No .
It was a film made by two western journalists in 2003 , in the months after Baghdad fell .
" Meeting Resistance " will be released in New York , Washington , Nashville , Tenn. , and Los Angeles later this month , and then will go into wider release across the country in November .
To make the film , journalists Molly Bingham and Steve Connors interviewed dozens of Iraqis to record hundreds of hours of interviews .
After 10 months of shooting , completed in the Spring of 2004 , they concentrated on a handful of characters who tell the story of how Iraq 's insurgency was sparked and then grew into an inferno .
' Normal People Who Are Pissed Off '
The documentary raises questions that many soldiers fighting this war wrestle with every day .
Sgt. Mike Kelley , with the 3rd Infantry Division , says that the film gave him a perspective he rarely sees — the Iraqi side of things .
" They 're normal people who are pissed off because we 're here and we 're not welcome , " he said .
And though it is Spc. Travis Barnes ' second tour of Iraq , he says it 's important for all soldiers and all Americans to see this film , " because we do n't know the Iraqis very well .
I do n't know anything about them . "
Filming " Meeting Resistance " became increasingly dangerous during its 10 - month production schedule , as the U.S. involvement here deepened .
It ended shortly after pictures of U.S. guards humiliating Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib grabbed worldwide attention .
" We slipped through a rapidly closing window of opportunity , " said Connors .
" We got in there early .
We understood there was something big happening here … and that this war was n't one - sided . "
For Some Iraqis , Occupation Was Humiliating
The film traces the path to insurgency for a dozen Iraqis .
Their faces are blurred to obscure their identities , and they are called by simple descriptions , like the wife , the warrior , the teacher .
All the film characters complained bitterly about what they saw as a deeply humiliating U.S. occupation .
Out of pride , fear , shame , honor and duty , they all arrived at the same conclusion that American soldiers , and those " collaborating " with them , are legitimate targets for attack .
The way Bingham puts it , " When we spoke to them , they were n't anti-American just for being anti-American .
What they were was against the occupation , " she said .
" We got a sense that it did n't matter whether they were Chinese or French or Tunisian — if you came here and occupied Iraq , you were going to be met with the same sense of rejection . "
The film and the filmmakers were brought to Baghdad by the military 's Red Team — an organization whose sole mission is to present alternative views about the enemy to U.S. troops .
This was the last in a series of films on insurgencies sponsored by the Red Team .
Also in the series were classics of war and fighting insurgencies , like Gillo Pontecorvos ' 1966 " The Battle of Algiers , " the 2004 documentary " Control Room " about Al Jazeera , the Arabic satellite channel and the views it transmitted about the U.S. war in Iraq ; it even screened a western , Fred Zinnemann 's 1952 film " High Noon , " about a sheriff trying to bring order to a lawless town whose citizens are too afraid to lift a finger to help him .
" We are literally the devil 's advocate , " said Red Team leader Lt. Col. Jeff Ragland .
" It does n't make you a popular guy , but it 's a necessary thing . "
Necessary , said Ragland , because defeating an insurgency is about more than killing the bad guys .
" If we were to kill every insurgent tomorrow , would we win ?
If we do n't do something to the motivation and the root cause , we 're not likely to defeat it . "
As the Camp Victory screening let out , soldiers mingled and chatted inside the massive and lavishly decorated lobby of Faw Palace .
As if on cue , a mortar round exploded nearby , a sharp reminder that the insurgents are still out there .
It ’s time to make video a first - class citizen of the web .
We , the users , have video cameras in our pockets and the bandwidth to transfer more clips and streams than we can watch .
What ’s missing is a an easy way to integrate video into web pages , and native support for video in browsers .
We , the web community , should address this by adding a video element to HTML .
In addition to giving video an HTML element , we must also agree on a baseline video format that will be universally supported , just like the GIF , JPEG and PNG image format are universally supported .
It ’s important that the video format we choose can be supported by a wide range of devices an that it ’s royalty - free ( RF ) .
RF is a well - establish principle for W3C standards .
The Ogg Theora format is a promising candidate which has been chosen by Wikipedia .
At Opera , we have built an experimental version that has native support for Ogg Theora .
For now , it is only available on Windows .
Do not choose to start Opera in the installation process .
After installing , exit the installation process and start the experimental build manually .
How to Find or Validate an Email Address
The regular expression I receive the most feedback , not to mention “ bug ” reports on , is the one you ’ll find right on this site ’s home page : \ b [ A - Z0 - 9 ._%+-]+@[ A - Z0 -9.-]+\. [ A - Z ] {2, }\b .
This regular expression , I claim , matches any email address .
Most of the feedback I get refutes that claim by showing one email address that this regex does n’t match .
Usually , the “ bug ” report also includes a suggestion to make the regex “ perfect ” .
As I explain below , my claim only holds true when one accepts my definition of what a valid email address really is , and what it ’s not .
If you want to use a different definition , you ’ll have to adapt the regex .
Matching a valid email address is a perfect example showing that ( 1 ) before writing a regex , you have to know exactly what you ’re trying to match , and what not ; and ( 2 ) there ’s often a trade - off between what ’s exact , and what ’s practical .
The virtue of my regular expression above is that it matches 99 % of the email addresses in use today .
All the email addresses it matches can be handled by 99 % of all email software out there .
If you ’re looking for a quick solution , you only need to read the next paragraph .
If you want to know all the trade - offs and get plenty of alternatives to choose from , read on .
If you want to use the regular expression above , there are two things you need to understand .
First , long regexes make it difficult to nicely format paragraphs .
So I did n’t include a -z in any of the three character classes .
This regex is intended to be used with your regex engine ’s “ case insensitive ” option turned on .
( You ’d be surprised how many “ bug ” reports I get about that . )
Second , the above regex is delimited with word boundaries , which makes it suitable for extracting email addresses from files or larger blocks of text .
If you want to check whether the user typed in a valid email address , replace the word boundaries with start - of - string and end - of - string anchors , like this : ^ [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]+@[ A - Z0 -9.-]+\. [ A - Z ] { 2,}$ .
The previous paragraph also applies to all of the following examples .
You may need to change word boundaries into start / end - of - string anchors , or vice versa .
And you have to turn on the case insensitive matching option .
Trade - Offs in Validating Email Addresses
Before ICANN made it possible for any well - funded company to create their own top - level domains , the longest top - level domains were the rarely used . museum and . travel which are 6 letters long .
The most common top - level domains were 2 letters long for country - specific domains , and 3 or 4 letters long for general - purpose domains like .com and .info .
A lot of regexes for validating email addresses you ’ll find in various regex tutorials and references still assume the top - level domain to be fairly short .
Older editions of this regex tutorial mentioned \b [ A - Z0 - 9 ._%+-]+@[ A - Z0 -9.-]+\. [ A - Z ] {2,4}\b as the regex for email addresses in its introduction .
There ’s only one little difference between this regex and the one at the top of this page .
The 4 at the end of the regex restricts the top - level domain to 4 characters .
If you use this regex with anchors to validate the email address entered on your order form , fabio@disapproved.solutions has to do his shopping elsewhere .
Yes , the .solutions TLD exists and when I write this , disaproved . solutions can be yours for $ 16.88 per year .
If you want to be more strict than [ A - Z ] { 2 , } for the top - level domain , ^ [ A - Z0 - 9 . _ %+-]+@[ A - Z0 -9.-]+\. [ A - Z ] {2,63} $ is as far as you can practically go .
Each part of a domain name can be no longer than 63 characters .
There are no single - digit top - level domains and none contain digits .
It does n’t look like ICANN will approve such domains either .
Email addresses can be on servers on a subdomain as in john@server.department.company.com .
All of the above regexes match this email address , because I included a dot in the character class after the @ symbol .
But the above regexes also match john@aol ... com which is not valid due to the consecutive dots .
You can exclude such matches by replacing [ A - Z0 - 9 . -]+\. with ( ? :[ A - Z0 - 9 - ]+\. ) + in any of the above regexes .
I removed the dot from the character class and instead repeated the character class and the following literal dot .
E.g. ^ [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]+@(?:[ A - Z0-9-]+\. ) +[ A - Z ] {2, }$ matches john@server.department.company.com but not john@aol ...com .
If you want to avoid your system choking on arbitrarily large input , you can replace the infinite quantifiers with finite ones .
^ [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]
{1,64}@ ( ?:[ A- Z0-9-] {1,63}\ . ) {1,125}[A - Z ]
{2,63} $ takes into account that the local part ( before the @ ) is limited to 64 characters and that each part of the domain name is limited to 63 characters .
There ’s no direct limit on the number of subdomains .
But the maximum length of an email address that can be handled by SMTP is 254 characters .
So with a single - character local part , a two - letter top - level domain and single - character sub - domains , 125 is the maximum number of sub - domains .
The previous regex does not actually limit email addresses to 254 characters .
If each part is at its maximum length , the regex can match strings up to 8129 characters in length .
You can reduce that by lowering the number of allowed sub - domains from 125 to something more realistic like 8 .
I ’ve never seen an email address with more than 4 subdomains .
If you want to enforce the 254 character limit , the best solution is to check the length of the input string before you even use a regex .
Though this requires a few lines of procedural code , checking the length of a string is near - instantaneous .
If you can only use regexes , ^[ A - Z0 - 9@ . _ %+-]
{6,254} $ can be used as a first pass to make sure the string does n’t contain invalid characters and is n’t too short or too long .
If you need to do everything with one regex , you ’ll need a regex flavor that supports lookahead .
The regular expression ^( ?=[ A - Z0 - 9@._%+-]{6,254} $ ) [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]
{1,64}@ ( ?:[ A - Z0-9-] {1,63}\ . ) {1,8} [ A - Z ]
{2,63} $ uses a lookahead to first check that the string does n’t contain invalid characters and is n’t too short or too long .
When the lookahead succeeds , the remainder of the regex makes a second pass over the string to check for proper placement of the @ sign and the dots .
All of these regexes allow the characters ._%+- anywhere in the local part .
You can force the local part to begin with a letter by using ^ [ A - Z0 - 9 ] [ A - Z0 - 9 ._%+-]
{0,63} instead of ^ [ A - Z0 - 9 ._%+-]
{1,64} for the local part : ^ [ A - Z0 - 9 ] [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]
{0,63}@ ( ?:[ A - Z0-9-] {1,63}\ . ) {1,125}[A - Z ]
{2,63}$ .
When using lookahead to check the overall length of the address , the first character can be checked in the lookahead .
We do n’t need to repeat the initial character check when checking the length of the local part .
This regex is too long to fit the width of the page , so let ’s turn on free - spacing mode :
^( ?= [ A - Z0 - 9 ] [ A - Z0 - 9@._%+-]
{5,253} $ )
[ A - Z0 - 9 . _ %+-]
{1,64}@ ( ?:[ A - Z0-9-] {1,63}\ . ) {1,8}[A - Z ]
{2,63 } $
Domain names can contain hyphens .
But they cannot begin or end with a hyphen . [ A - Z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ A - Z0 -9 -] { 0,62}[ A - Z0 - 9 ] ) ?
matches a domain name between 1 and 63 characters long that starts and ends with a letter or digit .
The non-capturing group makes the middle of the domain and the final letter or digit optional as a whole to ensure that we allow single - character domains while at the same time ensuring that domains with two or more characters do not end with a hyphen .
The overall regex starts to get quite complicated :
^ [ A - Z0 - 9 ] [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]
{0,63}@
(?:[ A - Z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ A - Z0-9 -] { 0,62}[A - Z0 - 9 ] ) ?\. )
{
1,8} [A - Z ] { 2,63 } $
Domain names cannot contain consecutive hyphens . [ A - Z0 - 9 ] +(?:-[ A - Z0 - 9 ] + ) * matches a domain name that starts and ends with a letter or digit and that contains any number of non-consecutive hyphens .
This is the most efficient way .
This regex does not do any backtracking to match a valid domain name .
It matches all letters and digits at the start of the domain name .
If there are no hyphens , the optional group that follows fails immediately .
If there are hyphens , the group matches each hyphen followed by all letters and digits up to the next hyphen or the end of the domain name .
We ca n’t enforce the maximum length when hyphens must be paired with a letter or digit , but letters and digits can stand on their own .
But we can use the lookahead technique that we used to enforce the overall length of the email address to enforce the length of the domain name while disallowing consecutive hyphens : (?=[ A - Z0-9 -] {1,63}\ . ) [ A - Z0 - 9 ] +( ?:-[ A - Z0 - 9 ] + ) * .
Notice that the lookahead also checks for the dot that must appear after the domain name when it is fully qualified in an email address .
This is important .
Without checking for the dot , the lookahead would accept longer domain names .
Since the lookahead does not consume the text it matches , the dot is not included in the overall match of this regex .
When we put this regex into the overall regex for email addresses , the dot will be matched as it was in the previous regexes :
^ [ A - Z0 - 9 ] [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]
{0,63}@
(?:(?=[ A - Z0-9 -] {1,63}\ . ) [ A - Z0 - 9 ] +(?:-[ A - Z0 - 9 ] +) *\. ) {1,8}[A - Z ] { 2,63 } $
If we include the lookahead to check the overall length , our regex makes two passes over the local part , and three passes over the domain names to validate everything :
^( ?= [ A - Z0 - 9 ] [ A - Z0 - 9@._%+-] {5,253} $ ) [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]
{1,64}@
(?:(?=[ A - Z0-9 -] {1,63}\ . ) [ A - Z0 - 9 ] +(?:-[ A - Z0 - 9 ] +) *\. ) {1,8}[A - Z ] { 2,63 } $
On a modern PC or server this regex will perform just fine when validating a single 254 - character email address .
Rejecting longer input would even be faster because the regex will fail when the lookahead fails during first pass .
But I would n’t recommend using a regex as complex as this to search for email addresses through a large archive of documents or correspondence .
You ’re better off using the simple regex at the top of this page to quickly gather everything that looks like an email address .
Deduplicate the results and then use a stricter regex if you want to further filter out invalid addresses .
And speaking of backtracking , none of the regexes on this page do any backtracking to match valid email addresses .
But particularly the latter ones may do a fair bit of backtracking on something that ’s not quite a valid email address .
If your regex flavor supports possessive quantifiers , you can eliminate all backtracking by making all quantifiers possessive .
Because no backtracking is needed to find matches , doing this does not change what is matched by these regexes .
It only allows them to fail faster when the input is not a valid email address .
Our simplest regex then becomes ^ [ A - Z0 - 9 ._%+-]++@[ A - Z0 -9.-]++\. [ A - Z ] { 2,}+ $ with an extra + after each quantifier .
We can do the same with our most complex regex :
^( ?=[ A - Z0 - 9 ] [ A - Z0 - 9@._%+-] {5,253} +$ ) [ A - Z0 - 9._%+-]
{1,64}+@
(?:(?=[ A- Z0-9-] {1,63}+\. ) [ A - Z0 - 9 ] ++( ?:-[ A - Z0 - 9 ]++ ) *+\. ) {1,8} +[ A - Z ] {2,63} +$
An important trade - off in all these regexes is that they only allow English letters , digits , and the most commonly used special symbols .
The main reason is that I do n’t trust all my email software to be able to handle much else .
Even though John.O'Hara@theoharas.com is a syntactically valid email address , there ’s a risk that some software will misinterpret the apostrophe as a delimiting quote .
Blindly inserting this email address into an SQL query , for example , will at best cause it to fail when strings are delimited with single quotes and at worst open your site up to SQL injection attacks .
And of course , it ’s been many years already that domain names can include non-English characters .
But most software still sticks to the 37 characters Western programmers are used to .
Supporting internationalized domains opens up a whole can of worms of how the non-ASCII characters should be encoded .
So if you use any of the regexes on this page , anyone with an @ทีเอชนิค .ไทย address will be out of luck .
But perhaps it is telling that http://ทีเอชนิค.ไทย simply redirects to http://thnic.co.th even though they ’re in the business of selling .ไทย domains .
The conclusion is that to decide which regular expression to use , whether you ’re trying to match an email address or something else that ’s vaguely defined , you need to start with considering all the trade - offs .
How bad is it to match something that ’s not valid ?
How bad is it not to match something that is valid ?
How complex can your regular expression be ?
How expensive would it be if you had to change the regular expression later because it turned out to be too broad or too narrow ?
Different answers to these questions will require a different regular expression as the solution .
My email regex does what I want , but it may not do what you want .
Regexes Do n’t Send Email
Do n’t go overboard in trying to eliminate invalid email addresses with your regular expression .
The reason is that you do n’t really know whether an address is valid until you try to send an email to it .
And even that might not be enough .
Even if the email arrives in a mailbox , that does n’t mean somebody still reads that mailbox .
If you really need to be sure an email address is valid , you ’ll need to send an email to it that contains a code or link for the recipient to perform a second authentication step .
And if you ’re doing that , then there is little point in using a regex that may reject valid email addresses .
The same principle applies in many situations .
When trying to match a valid date , it ’s often easier to use a bit of arithmetic to check for leap years , rather than trying to do it in a regex .
Use a regular expression to find potential matches or check if the input uses the proper syntax , and do the actual validation on the potential matches returned by the regular expression .
Regular expressions are a powerful tool , but they ’re far from a panacea .
The Official Standard : RFC 5322
Maybe you ’re wondering why there ’s no “ official ” fool - proof regex to match email addresses .
Well , there is an official definition , but it ’s hardly fool - proof .
The official standard is known as RFC 5322 .
It describes the syntax that valid email addresses must adhere to .
You can ( but you should n’t — read on ) implement it with the following regular expression .
RFC 5322 leaves the domain name part open to implementation - specific choices that wo n’t work on the Internet today .
The regex implements the “ preferred ” syntax from RFC 1035 which is one of the recommendations in RFC 5322 :
\ A( ? :[ a- z0 - 9 !#$ %&'*+/=?^_‘{
|}~-]+(?:\.[ a- z0 - 9 !#$ %&'*+/=?^_‘{ |}~-]+ ) *
| " (?:[ \x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f ]
| \\[ \x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7 f ] ) * " )
@ (?:(?:[ a - z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ a- z0 - 9 -]*[ a - z0 - 9 ] ) ?\. ) +[ a - z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ a- z0 -9-]*[ a - z0 - 9 ] ) ?
| \[(?:(?:25 [0 - 5 ] |2[ 0 - 4 ] [ 0 - 9 ] |[ 01 ] ? [ 0 - 9 ] [ 0 - 9 ] ? ) \.) {3}
(?:25 [ 0 - 5 ] |2[ 0 - 4 ] [ 0 - 9 ] |[ 01 ] ? [ 0 - 9 ] [ 0 - 9 ] ?
|[ a - z0-9-]*[ a - z0 - 9 ] :
(?:[ \x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f ]
| \\[ \x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7 f ] ) +)
\ ] ) \z
This regex has two parts : the part before the @ , and the part after the @ .
There are two alternatives for the part before the @ .
The first alternative allows it to consist of a series of letters , digits and certain symbols , including one or more dots .
However , dots may not appear consecutively or at the start or end of the email address .
The other alternative requires the part before the @ to be enclosed in double quotes , allowing any string of ASCII characters between the quotes .
Whitespace characters , double quotes and backslashes must be escaped with backslashes .
The part after the @ also has two alternatives .
It can either be a fully qualified domain name ( e.g. regular - expressions .info ) , or it can be a literal Internet address between square brackets .
The literal Internet address can either be an IP address , or a domain - specific routing address .
The reason you should n’t use this regex is that it is overly broad .
Your application may not be able to handle all email addresses this regex allows .
Domain - specific routing addresses can contain non-printable ASCII control characters , which can cause trouble if your application needs to display addresses .
Not all applications support the syntax for the local part using double quotes or square brackets .
In fact , RFC 5322 itself marks the notation using square brackets as obsolete .
We get a more practical implementation of RFC 5322 if we omit IP addresses , domain - specific addresses , the syntax using double quotes and square brackets .
It will still match 99.99 % of all email addresses in actual use today .
\ A[ a - z0 - 9 ! # $ % &'*+/=?^_‘{
|}~-]+(?:\.[ a- z0 - 9 !#$ %&'*+/=?^_‘{|}~-]+ )*@
(? :[ a - z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ a- z0 - 9 -]*[ a - z0 - 9 ] ) ?\. ) +[ a - z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ a- z0-9-]*[ a - z0 - 9 ] ) ?\z
Neither of these regexes enforce length limits on the overall email address or the local part or the domain names .
RFC 5322 does not specify any length limitations .
Those stem from limitations in other protocols like the SMTP protocol for actually sending email .
RFC 1035 does state that domains must be 63 characters or less , but does not include that in its syntax specification .
The reason is that a true regular language cannot enforce a length limit and disallow consecutive hyphens at the same time .
But modern regex flavors are n’t truly regular , so we can add length limit checks using lookahead like we did before :
\ A( ?=[ a - z0 - 9 @ .!#$ %&'*+/=?^_‘{
|}~-]{6,254}\z)
(?= [ a - z0 - 9 .!#$ %&'*+/=?^_‘{
|}~-]{1,64}@)
[ a - z0 - 9 ! # $ %&'*+/=?^_‘{
|}~-]+(?:\.[ a- z0 - 9 !#$ %&'*+/=?^_‘{ |}~-]+ ) *
@ (?:(?=[ a-z0-9-] {1,63}\ . ) [ a - z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ a- z0 -9 -]*[ a - z0 - 9 ] ) ?\. ) +
(?=[ a-z0-9-] {1,63}\z ) [ a - z0 - 9 ] ( ?:[ a- z0-9-]*[ a - z0 - 9 ] ) ?\z
So even when following official standards , there are still trade - offs to be made .
Do n’t blindly copy regular expressions from online libraries or discussion forums .
Always test them on your own data and with your own applications .

It is as closely associated with Switzerland as the Matterhorn , muesli and the cuckoo clock .
But the Swiss army knife , considered by millions around the world to be an indispensable tool , is in danger of losing its Swiss identity .
The Swiss army , which is to order a fresh batch of 65,000 of the pocket knives with new specifications , has caused nationwide consternation by declaring that under World Trade Organisation rules , the tendering process must be opened to companies worldwide because of the high value of the contract .
China , which has been producing pirate copies of the knife for years , is thought to have the best chance of winning the contract , which is estimated at 1.7 m
Swiss francs ( £ 695,000 ) , followed by Taiwan and Bulgaria .
The issue has become one of the hottest political topics of the summer , with far - right politicians saying that national pride is at stake .
" If the Swiss army knife no longer comes from Switzerland , then we might as well stop producing it altogether , " said Thomas Fuchs , MP for the far - right Swiss People 's party .
Alois Kessler , a lawyer and a former colonel in the Swiss army , has taken up the campaign and launched a nationwide petition , Keep Soldiers ' Pocket Knives Swiss !
He said he had found that under WTO rules " stabbing weapons " - among them the Swiss army knife - are on a list of products that do not need to be put out to tender .
" I simply cannot imagine our soldiers carrying a Made in China knife in their knapsacks , " he said .
" It would be like us giving them German - made chocolate . "
The army is saying little , except that it is working on the technical specifications for the new product to make it suitable for modern soldiering , including a serrated blade with a locking mechanism , a saw , and a Phillips - crosshead - screwdriver .
It should also have a case , allowing it to be attached to a belt .
Victorinox , the company that makes the knives , said it was confident it would win the bid on the combined factors of quality and cost .
The knife , which was first produced in Ibach in the canton of Schwyz in 1897 , can be equipped with anything from a nail file and a tin opener to a fish - scaler and a USB stick , and features in the design collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
It is credited by everyone from balloonists and astronauts to surgeons and pilots with saving lives and is the official pocket knife for 16 armies around the world , including the US military .
It has also prompted many jokes , perceived as it is as the weapon of choice for the military of neutral Switzerland .
The US comedian Robin Williams once quipped : " How can you trust an army that has a wine opener on its knife ? "
“ shall not deny , limit , or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice … ”
“ no licensee may disable features on handsets it provides to customers … . ”
NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope took this photograph of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A , one of the youngest remnants we know of in the Milky Way .
The image was made up of 18 separate photos taken by Hubble using its Advanced Camera for Surveys , and it reveals the faint swirls of expanding debris .
Astronomers believe the star that used to live at the centre exploded as a supernova about 340 years ago ( as well as the 10,000 years it took for the light to reach us ) .
A new image taken with NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope provides a detailed look at the tattered remains of a supernova explosion known as Cassiopeia A ( Cas A ) .
It is the youngest known remnant from a supernova explosion in the Milky Way .
The new Hubble image shows the complex and intricate structure of the star ’s shattered fragments .
The image is a composite made from 18 separate images taken in December 2004 using Hubble ’s Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) , and it shows the Cas A remnant as a broken ring of bright filamentary and clumpy stellar ejecta .
These huge swirls of debris glow with the heat generated by the passage of a shockwave from the supernova blast .
The various colors of the gaseous shards indicate differences in chemical composition .
Bright green filaments are rich in oxygen , red and purple are sulfur , and blue are composed mostly of hydrogen and nitrogen .
A supernova such as the one that resulted in Cas A is the explosive demise of a massive star that collapses under the weight of its own gravity .
The collapsed star then blows its outer layers into space in an explosion that can briefly outshine its entire parent galaxy .
Cas
A is relatively young , estimated to be only about 340 years old .
Hubble has observed it on several occasions to look for changes in the rapidly expanding filaments .
In the latest observing campaign , two sets of images were taken , separated by nine months .
Even in that short time , Hubble ’s razor - sharp images can observe the expansion of the remnant .
Comparison of the two image sets shows that a faint stream of debris seen along the upper left side of the remnant is moving with high speed – up to 31 million miles per hour ( fast enough to travel from Earth to the Moon in 30 seconds ! ) .
Cas A is located ten thousand light - years away from Earth in the Cassiopeia constellation .
Supernova explosions are the main source of elements more complex than oxygen , which are forged in the extreme conditions produced in these events .
The analysis of such a nearby , relatively young and fresh example is extremely helpful in understanding the evolution of the universe .

Bauhaus Möbel - Klassiker des modernen Designs
Das Bauhaus , 1919 von Walter Gropius gegründet , ist die bedeutendste deutsche Geistesbewegung , die
alle Bereiche der Kunst in idealer Einheit verbinden wollte .
Der Künstler sollte durch neue pädagogische Methoden aus seiner akademischen Spezialisierung befreit werden und sich wieder auf seine handwerklichen Fähigkeiten besinnen .
1923 wurde diese Philosophie durch die Realität der technischen Zivilisation weiterentwickelt .
Fernab galt die Symbiose von industrieller Produktion und ästhetisch - funktionaler Gestaltung als Credo der Bewegung .
Das kurze Schaffen und Gestalten der Bauhausprotagonisten , die 1933 von den schrecklichen politischen Umständen aus Deutschland vertrieben wurden , hat dennoch eine Wirkung hinterlassen , die auch für die heutige Zeit bedeutsam ist .
Das läßt sich auch und gerade für die vom Bauhaus entworfenen Möbel sagen , die den Anspruch von Ästhetik und Funktionalität in idealer Weise widerspiegeln .
Wir liefern Ihnen hochwertige Reproduktionen berühmter Bauhaus und Designer Möbel von Le Corbusier , Mies van der Rohe , Charles Eames , Eileen Gray und vielen Anderen .
Für uns sind die Klassiker des modernen Möbeldesigns keine teuren Statussymbole , sondern zeitlos schöne Möbel , die sich jeder leisten können sollte .
Wir garantieren Ihnen , dass unsere Bauhaus - Nachbauten in Design , Fertigungsqualität und Materialauswahl mit den Originalentwürfen der Bauhausdesigner übereinstimmen .
Protest numbers have fallen since 50,000 attended Friday 's rally
He refused to hold early elections , saying he would not be blackmailed .
Huge crowds have gathered outside parliament in Tbilisi for the past three days , calling for early elections and for Mr Saakashvili 's resignation .
They were the largest protests since the Rose Revolution which brought Mr Saakashvili to power four years ago .
It seems that the Georgian president does not comprehend the heart of the matter
Levan Berdzenishvili
opposition MP
The Georgian opposition accuses Mr Saakashvili of leading an authoritarian government which has failed to tackle widespread deprivation in the country .
Mr Saakashvili promised to address the issues of poverty and unemployment .
But as he spoke , thousands of protesters again blocked the main street of the capital , maintaining their pressure for the Georgian president to step down .
Estimates vary but it seems at least 15,000 people turned out for the protest outside parliament on Sunday , chanting " Misha [ Mr Saakashvili ] must leave " .
Blaming Russia
I 'd like everybody to think what kind of threats Georgia will face during the Russian election period
Mikhail Saakashvili
Georgian president
Speaking on Georgian TV , the president said the next parliamentary and presidential elections would be held in Georgia " at the time envisaged by the constitution " , or the autumn of 2008 .
He suggested that politicians in Russia , which dominated Georgia in Tsarist and Soviet times , were stirring the current unrest for their own political reasons because of forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections there .
" A campaign of lies has begun working against the president , against Georgia and against the interests of the Georgian people , " Mr Saakashvili said .
" Two wars were started in the Russian Federation , in Chechnya , because of elections .
I 'd like everybody to think what kind of threats Georgia will face during the Russian election period . "
Georgian opposition politicians were quick to attack his speech , accusing him of failing to understand the situation inside Georgia .
" He said that the people who are standing in the street now are dark forces , that they are idiots and that they are marginal , " Tinatin Khidasheli , a leading Republican Party member , told local TV .
" I am very troubled at the fact that the Georgian president is talking to his people like this . "
" It seems that the Georgian president does not comprehend the heart of the matter , " Republican Party MP Levan Berdzenishvili added .
" The Georgian president is confusing Georgia 's problems with those of Russia , " the opposition politician added .
@ Fitty7lax : Well , I can certainly agree with you on the Breadvan .
But , I still likes me some 400 + hp Probe - doppelganger / bread loaf / I - did n't - know - that - was-a- Ferrari ... , um Ferrari .
OK , that did n't make much sense , but today on Jalopnik has got me all silly .

All the news , and all my saved - up links , are too depressing .
So today I want to write about sports .
I wonder if sports can save the world , by providing a healthy outlet for humanity 's worst flaw , our love of ingroup - outgroup conflict .
It would be cool if American cities could organize a bunch of capture - the - flag games between the red and blue tribes .
It always puzzles me that there are n't more straight men into women 's sports -- or more gay men into men's sports .
I think it 's just an unlucky accident of how we 're socialized .
Even on the NWSL subreddit , there 's an unspoken taboo against talking about who the hottest player is .
( It 's Kristie Mewis . )
Sports highlights are always about athleticism , but my favorite moments are about situational intelligence .
From Saturday 's NWSL action , this Crystal Thomas goal has the two funnest things an attacker can do -- steal a back pass , and slip past the goalie to an open net .
And this easy Bethany Balcer goal is set up by Sofia Huerta cleverly letting a pass go between her feet .

Some good stuff in this thread , What was your most profound realization you had whilst tripping ?
At the bottom of the page are all the comments that tried to be clever by interpreting " tripping " as stumbling , but the most downvoted answer is accidentally the most profound : " Wow the ground is much closer than I thought . "
Of all the writing I do , this blog is at best my third favorite .
Number two is my fiction , and number one is my poetry , because it 's the tightest .
Poetry has come to mean venting about your emotions with arbitrary line breaks , but the way I do it , it 's like watchmaking , where every word is a gear that makes the whole thing run .
This is one I wrote earlier this year , and just spliced it into book two of my novel .
You must ask the heart , says the head
And chases its own thoughts instead
The heart says , I must ask the gut
And raps on its sickroom floor -- But
that voice never stopped , deep inside
Be still my head , my heart go wide
( So grateful , the hips and the knees
To bear such a lovely disease )

Lots of feedback from the last post , including this heavy comment thread on weirdcollapse .
Also , Owen sends this video of a Jonathan Blow talk , " Preventing the Collapse of Civilization " .
He says little about prevention , and mostly talks about how technology has been lost in the past , and how it 's being lost now in the world of software .
Basically , the people who really know how to do things die , and it's hard to pass on everything they know to the next generation , because so much of it requires hands - on experience .
I wrote about this back in 2010 in this post :
And if a skill dies , even if there are still books about it , the human attention required to resurrect it from books is much greater than the human attention that would have been required to keep it alive in the first place .
So if we want to bring back a dead skill , without an increase in population or specialization , we have to sacrifice some living skills .
The technology I 'd most like to lose , of course , is the automobile .
And that 's realistic .
Cars are so complex now that it 's almost impossible to repair them .
They 're pretty much disposable , and if we stop making more , the ones we have will gradually stop working .
The technology I 'd most like to hold onto is old bicycles .
The one I ride is from 1981 , and it's not hard to strip it down to ball bearings and rebuild it .
The new technology I 'd most like to see is anything that makes good food with high efficiency , like vat - grown meat , or fruit trees with upgraded photosynthesis .

Important Twitter thread about infrastructure decay , specifically an electrical tower where a 97 year old hook broke , causing the 2018 Paradise fire that killed 85 people .
I 've been saying for a while now that we 'll get an economic collapse but not a tech collapse , but lately I 'm thinking there has to be a tech collapse , not only because of the diminishing returns on complexity , but because more of us are unhappy with the effect of technology on our lives .
Something that 's always puzzled me is that there 's so little infrastructure sabotage .
In war , it 's totally normal , and it 's also common in fiction .
Why does n't some terror group send its members out with shovels to cut fiber optic lines , or hacksaws to cut railroad tracks , or rifles to shoot transformers ?
I 'm thinking the only reason it has n't happened , is that everyone still thinks of the tech system as a net benefit to themselves .
If that ever changes , look out .

Something nice for the weekend , and also sad , a reddit thread , Have you ever missed someone who does n't even exist ?
It 's mostly about people in dreams , but there are also some fictional characters , and some projections of people better than they are .
This reminds me of my post from earlier this year about tulpas .

Some local news .
Last week my town was the number one COVID hot spot in the country , because we 're a small college town and the students came back and started partying .
Something I 've learned from this virus is that some people really , really like going to parties .
Certain extroverted personalities must reach a transcendent mental state similar to what I get on good drugs , or they would n't take such risks .
On the other hand , when you look at the numbers for our county , we have more than a thousand confirmed cases , only two hospitalizations , and zero deaths .
That seems really low even for young people , so I wonder if there 's some other local factor that 's making the virus less dangerous .
Of course it 's also been smoky .
This was our view on Saturday , and the worst thing is that our apartment is too hot .
We have no AC , because normally we can just open the windows at night , blowing fans if necessary , to bring in enough cold to get through the next day .
But the outside is too smoky to open .
I 've been keeping the inside air clean with a damp towel draped over the intake side of a box fan , and a Wein VI - 2500 ionizer .
By the way , all these fires are not just from climate change .
In the 1930's , the acreage burned per year in the American west was a lot more .
But those were lower - intensity fires , because the land had always been allowed to burn freely .
Only with the fire suppression policies of the late 20th century , did we build the massive dry biomass that is feeding these monster fires .

Lately I 've noticed , in American culture , an obsession with lying .
And also , a failure to understand what lying is .
Lying is not an ontological act .
It 's not about what 's true .
Lying is a social act .
It 's when someone derives what they say , not from whatever they 're talking about , but from the expected effect on their audience .
What we call a " lie detector " does n't even detect that .
It tries to detect when someone says something different from what they 're thinking .
If we had machines that did this perfectly , and we hooked them up to politicians , Donald Trump would pass every time , because he has mastered the skill of completely believing whatever he says .
In one sense , everything he says is a lie , because it's all derived from the expected effect on his audience .
In another sense , nothing he says is a lie , because he is never conscious of any tension between his mouth and his head .
That 's why he seems so authentic to his followers .
Another tool against political lying is a fact - checker .
But who decides what the fact - checker believes ?
How can we trust it ?
As the world gets more complex , there are more and more " facts " that we can't check first - hand , only second - hand through trusted sources .
That opens the door for someone like Trump , who with perfect sincerity , mirrors his audience .
If a democracy becomes too complex for a majority of people to understand , it 's inevitable that self - interested simplifiers will take power .
Here 's an idea for a new anti-lie tech , which might become realistic when we have better brain - hacking .
If we can somehow switch off the social regions of the brain , then the subject will be unable to even consider what kind of answer other people are looking for .

What David Graeber Noticed is a nice overview of his life 's work and why it 's important .
From the archives , here 's a post I made five years ago about Graeber 's essay on fun .
What If Certain Mental Disorders Are Not Disorders At All ?
This is not a new idea , just a true idea that we 're unable to do anything about .
As I wrote earlier this year : Every time the human - made world drifts farther from human nature , there 's another group of people who can't deal with it , and they 're diagnosed with some disorder that makes it their fault .
Teens ' anxiety levels dropped during pandemic .
" Researchers surveyed 1000 secondary school children in southwest England .
They said the results were a ' big surprise ' and it raised questions about the impact of the school environment on teenagers ' mental health . "
Of course , most kids hate school because it 's regimented , authoritarian , and makes learning unfun for the rest of your life .
A few kids love school , and they go on to rule society and make it continue to suck for everyone else .

Thinking more about Monday 's post , it does n't really work as a grid .
It 's two questions in sequence : 1 ) Where do you draw the line between in - group and out - group ?
2 ) To what extent , in each group , do you think might makes right ?
You could make a chart of the answers , but it would be more complicated than one - person one - dot .
Eric comments :
There is more going on than " do n't ask me to make sacrifices for people I do n't know personally . "
While that may be the basis for some of the reactions we see , there is also a militancy , striving to make others hold their own views .
I keep trying to get my friends to recognize that within their own ' in - group ' as you say , they are largely able to behave however they want , just so long as they do n't insist upon going public with it .
This gives me another idea ....
The five stages of culture war :
1. Self - acceptance .
You no longer think you 're crazy , immoral , or inferior .
2. Private communities .
You can do your thing with other people , even if it 's still illegal .
3. Public tolerance .
You have basic rights to do your thing , even if people do n't like it .
4. Public acceptance .
The difference between tolerance and acceptance is subtle , and the main benefit is you can have higher status , which is why I think it 's overrated .
5. Domination .
Everyone has to do your thing .
For example , gay rights .
In the 1950's , you were lucky to be at stage 1 .
Now , in most of America , you 're at stage 4 .
There is no plan for stage 5 , but some people seem to be afraid there is .
Or kneeling for the national anthem .
Colin Kaepernick is still blacklisted from the NFL for breaking into stage 3 , but this year 's NWSL games were pushing stage 5 , with uneasiness about players who did not kneel .
Having to kneel is bad , but it 's no worse than having to stand , which has been normal for decades .
What is it about anthems and conformity ?
Also , the movement through stages can go in the other direction .
Racism in America used to be almost at stage 5 , and now it 's fallen all the way to stage 2 .
September 1 .
Just heard the newscaster say , " We 're going to ping - pong between COVID and Kenosha , " and I thought , " The apocalypse has already happened , and we 're in fairyland . "
August 31 .
I 've been feeling uneasy about the words " left " and " right " .
At the moment , almost all the bad shit is coming from the right , but there have been times and places where the bad shit was coming from the left , and it could happen again .
Because the words have no intrinsic social meaning , they can mean anything .
And I do n't like that grid , with social freedom and economic freedom , because it has economic freedom backwards .
The popular definition of economic freedom is about freedom of money , when it should mean freedom from money -- so the less we have to think about money , the more economic freedom we have .
The grid that I 'm proposing , is based on what I call moral competence -- not moral intelligence , because we think of intelligence as fixed , and competence as something we can change .
The lower a person 's moral competence , the more they think that might makes right ; and the higher a person 's moral competence , the more they see others as friends .
There are two dimensions of this .
One is the range of actions for which you think might makes right , or does n't .
The other is the range of people against whom you think might makes right , or does n't .
Starting with actions :
In a society with no moral competence , it 's okay for a thug to beat up your grandmother and take all her stuff , because he 's bigger and stronger .
Our society is better than that , but not by much .
We do n't think that physical might makes right , but capitalism is grounded on the idea that financial might makes right , that it 's okay for someone with more money to use that advantage over people with less money .
In our politics and advertising , rhetorical might makes right , so it 's okay for persuasive people to use their advantage over gullible people .
In Silicon Valley , cerebral might makes right , so it 's expected that the people with the most brainpower will leverage it into social power .
And in the entire economy , motivational might makes right .
People who love to be busy all day are " hard workers " who have earned wealth and power , while people with low tolerance for busyness can barely survive .
So on the action - axis of moral competence , our society is low , but not zero .
The people - axis of moral competence is about the size of your in - group , the people you treat as friends and not as objects of your power .
At the low end is extreme individualism , an in - group of one .
At the high end , your in - group is all life everywhere , and there is no out - group .
The culture war in the west right now is between those who want everyone to expand their in - group , and those who want the freedom to keep their in - group small .
That 's what the new right means by freedom , and that 's the real message of the anti-maskers , the climate deniers , the social service slashers : do n't ask me to make sacrifices for people I do n't know personally .

Three more thoughts on race .
Race is a social construct , and whiteness is a trick to get pale - skinned people to buy into dominator culture .
One cool thing my ancestors did was fight the Romans .
On collective guilt : something other people did , that you did n't do , should not be held against you .
At the same time , wrong actions come out of wrong cultures , and cultures tend to be passed on .
And on reparations : someday , " owning " land could be defined as indigenous people defined it , as a partnership with the local ecology .
If you 're not making the land more alive , you have no legal standing over that land .
Golf courses would get really interesting .
August 28 .
What troubles me most about the events in Wisconsin , is not that police shot a guy seven times in the back for getting into his car .
That kind of thing is normal , not just in the American police , but all through history where one group has had more rights than ordinary citizens to use deadly force .
But in the ensuing protests , there was a guy with a rifle , who shot two people and then walked toward the police .
Everyone was shouting that he just shot two people , and the police did nothing .
I mean , they eventually arrested the guy -- but their instinctive first reaction was to see the shooter as an ally , because he was from their culture .
That means , if Trump and his supporters believe the election was stolen from them , and if they rise up , then in many places , the police will be on their side .
And then all they need is a good general , and they 'll march through the neighborhoods of people who do n't look like them , shooting anyone who resists .
If you think that 's unrealistic , that 's exactly what white people did only a few generations ago , to kill the Indians and get the land that we 're all living on .
If it does n't happen again , it 's because humans are getting nicer .
For example , German university offering grants to people who want to do absolutely nothing .
Only 80 years ago , Germany was the most mentally ill place in the world , and now they 're one of the best places .
How much better might America be in 80 years ?

With so many terrible things happening right now , I just want to point out how funny it is , that young right - wingers love the insult " cuck " , and now it turns out that Trumper evangelical Jerry Falwell Jr. likes to watch his wife have sex with another man -- the literal meaning of cuck .
But no one 's going to call him that , because the left does n't use derogatory terms for consensual sex acts , and the right does n't use the word in a literal sense , it 's just what they call guys they do n't like .
Also pure comedy : Melania Trump has renovated the White House Rose Garden , which Jackie Kennedy planted with many colors of flowers -- and now they 're all white .
And some good news : Portland just passed the best low - density zoning reform in US history .
That means they 're reforming low - density , in favor of high - density .

More generally , I expect the collapse , which is now fully underway , to be highly local : how bad it is , or how good it is , depends on what city or town you 're living in , and how mentally healthy the people are there .
The worst places will be ruled by violent warlords , and the best places will be the seeds for a better future .

I 've always liked Joe Biden .
I mean , he 's taken some terrible positions over the years , and actually believed in them , but he 's a good person and capable of being more progressive if the times call for it .
But I hate Democratic Party conventions .
In the days before television , conventions were functional .
Delegates would go in , sometimes not even having a candidate , and hash it out before the campaign .
Now conventions are the decorative centerpiece of the campaign .
They 're propaganda , which according to Jacques Ellul , can never be surprising .
The public face of the Democrats is so smarmy , you almost want to vote for Trump just to see them lose .
Their convention is like a feel - good Hollywood movie polished to death by test screenings .
They try to please everyone , when what they need is an exciting vision for the future .
But there is no exciting vision compatible with their donors .
I know there 's still a lot of work to be done on race and gender equality , but the Democrats are going to ride that horse to death before they do anything serious about wealth inequality -- which they have yet to even frame correctly .
It 's not rich people against poor people .
It 's a set of economic assumptions and values , designed for owning to leverage itself into more owning , against every last one of us , including the rich , whose wealth has made them stupid .
Meanwhile , under Trump , Republicans are so perfectly wrong that it 's like deep down they know what 's right , and they 're doing the opposite just to troll America .
About ten years ago , a young Republican staffer wrote an argument that they should embrace copyright reform .
I was like , wow , if they do that , I might vote for them .
He was fired .
It 's hard to remember that none of this is real .
Your job , your debt , your Twitter feed , are all just a game we 're playing that 's not fun anymore .
If the politicians and bureaucrats can just do one thing , if they can keep us from going hungry through economic collapse , then we can come up with a better game .

Going back two weeks , this subreddit post has some great thoughts on game changing 21st century technologies :
Mars is impossible to terraform without a magnetic field ; a caffeine shortage could cripple the industrial economy ;
AI will falter when it turns out that human labor is cheaper ; biotech and drones could be big .
My favorite idea is that " the cellulase gene could be transferred from snails to humans , " so that we could eat wood .
That would have huge political effects , because there has never been a repressive society where people could easily live off the land .
But I want to go off on a tangent about the psychology of automation .
The most powerful force in the world , and in the end , the only powerful force , is intrinsic motivation .
If you want to get squishy , you can call it love .
If people love doing something , you do n't need to pay them , you do n't need to burn oil or build windfarms to get the job done .
Money and energy are props to raise and hold up a system that 's built out of stuff that no one really wants to do .
Also violence .
So mechanization only seems like a good idea in the context of a society that 's already built out of onerous tasks .
Capitalists can concentrate wealth without having to deal with labor .
Progressives can disconnect production from repression .
At the logical extreme , everything useful is done by machines , and all human activity is fun and useless .
I mean , I 'd love to get high and play games all day while machines do all the work .
But that 's unrealistic , and more importantly , all things being equal , people would rather be useful .
This short video on desire lines is mostly about footpaths , and how the trend in college campus design is to not make paved paths until the informal paths reveal how people really want to walk .
Now we just have to do the same thing with the entire economy .

What if Donald Trump were a D&D character ?
I 'm using edition 3.0 , and I 'll start with the six ability scores , which for normal humans can range from 3 - 18 , where 10.5 is average .
Strength : 5 . He 's an old man .
Dexterity : 10 .
He 's an okay golfer .
Constitution : 14 .
He thinks exercise is bad for him , and he 's still somewhat healthy at 74 .
Intelligence : 7 . He 's probably never read a book all the way through .
Wisdom : 10 .
I 'm tempted to go much lower , but D&D wisdom includes self - control and intuition .
Charisma : 16 .
I 'm tempted to go higher , but his personal magnetism is better explained as a spell power .
Alignment : Neutral Evil .
He 's evil because he lacks compassion , seeks power , and has no moral code except what he can get away with .
Despite his talk of " law and order " , he has shown repeatedly that he 's against the rule of law when it contradicts his personal rule , and he takes every opportunity to push America toward disorder .
I do n't think he 's hot - headed or unpredictable enough to be chaotic evil , but this bit from the rulebook does fit him : " Thankfully , his plans are haphazard , and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized . "
Class : Sorcerer .
Sorcerers have fewer spells than Wizards , but can cast them more often .
Trump has only one spell , an upgraded Mass Charm , which allows him to affect an unlimited number of people through television and social media .
Or it could be Hallucinatory Terrain , modified to create a false social and scientific landscape .
Instead of feeling angry at Trumpers , I 'm just grateful that I made the saving throw .

PESHAWAR , Nov 6 : Militants seized the town of Madyan in Swat on Tuesday and hoisted their flags over buildings after security forces surrendered , police and residents said .
Madyan is the third town to come under the effective control of followers of Maulana Fazlullah , who is demanding enforcement of Sharia in Swat .
“ They seized Madyan town today , they have overrun Matta and Khwazakhela towns in their earlier push , ” a police official said .
Police gave up their weapons , vehicles and control of local police stations , the officer and local residents said .
The militants are continuing their advance , the official said .
Residents said the militants were patrolling the town .
Witnesses said Fazlullah ’s supporters hoisted their flags over government buildings and guarded important sites , such as banks and bazaars .
At least 37 police and paramilitary soldiers left the main police station without a fight after militants surrounded the town and assured them that they would not be harmed , residents said .
A militant source said police turned over 35 Kalashnikovs .
Police also retreated from two more police posts in nearby villages .
Earlier , the militants seized the Matta town after outnumbered security forces laid down their arms , militants and police said .
About two dozen police officers and several troops offered no resistance to militants who seized three police stations and a military post in and around Matta .
A Swat police official said authorities had sent helicopter gunships to target militant positions in the area .

Boris Yeltsin , the first democratically elected president in Russian history , died yesterday of heart failure , ending a spectacular political career that spanned the end of the cold war , the collapse of the Soviet empire , and a decade of chaos and liberty in Russia , halted and reversed by his successor , Vladimir Putin .
The burly Siberian with the shock of white hair clambered atop tanks on the streets of Moscow to face down KGB plotters , turned the same tanks on the Russian parliament , launched a disastrous war in Chechnya , won a second term in a flawed election and presided over Russia 's financial meltdown in 1998 .
He maintained his capacity to surprise , using the last day of the millennium in 1999 to stand down suddenly and hand power to Mr Putin .
In his 10 years at the Kremlin , Mr Yeltsin was hailed as a hero and a villain , at times a buffoon , at others a force of nature .
He died yesterday in a Moscow hospital more than seven years after being the first Russian leader to give up power voluntarily .
" A tragic fate , " said his peer and rival , Mikhail Gorbachev , the last Soviet leader .
" On [ his ] shoulders rest major events for the good of the country and serious mistakes . "
Tony Blair said : " He was a remarkable man who saw the need for democratic and economic reform and , in defending it , he played a vital role at a crucial time in Russia 's history . "
Mr Yeltsin 's former prime minister , Viktor Chernomyrdin , said : " The democratic and economic foundations he laid are irreversible .
There is no way back .
This was his main service to Russia . "
Mr Yeltsin 's primary historical achievement , perhaps , was to make irreversible the end of communism in Russia .
In achieving that , however , he encouraged or facilitated the crony robber capitalism that conferred fabulous wealth on a handful of unscrupulous oligarchs while pauperising the vast majority of the country .
His " shock therapy " economic reforms , masterminded by Anatoly Chubais and supported by Washington in the early 90s , were radical , causing a collapse in living standards from which Russians are only beginning to recover under the authoritarian regime of Mr Putin .
Mr Yeltsin 's finest hour came in the summer of 1991 when Soviet reactionaries led by KGB plotters kidnapped Mr Gorbachev in an abortive coup aimed at salvaging the Soviet Union .
Mr Yeltsin rallied resistance on the streets of Moscow , defeated the coup plotters , but then turned on the Soviet reformist to bury both the Soviet Union and Mr Gorbachev 's career .
By then , Mr Yeltsin had already used his popularity to become the first directly elected president of Russia , then exploiting the democratic legitimacy conferred by that office to undermine Mr Gorbachev .
On Christmas day that year , Mr Gorbachev resigned , handing victory to Mr Yeltsin who engineered the break - up of the Soviet Union and its transformation into 15 separate countries .
President Putin phoned Mr Yeltsin's widow , Naina , yesterday to voice his condolences .
But Mr Putin , who owes his career to Mr Yeltsin , represents the opposite of everything he embodied , and is known to be critical of the Yeltsin years .
Russia 's heavily controlled TV channels paid glowing tribute to Mr Yeltsin , praising him as a great man .
They showed archive footage of his early career as a communist party boss in Sverdlovsk , and of his rapid rise within the Politburo .
There was no mention of his disastrous decision to go to war in Chechnya in 1994 .
Russia 's third channel , however , did screen embarrassing footage of a bear - like Mr Yeltsin dancing on stage during his re-election campaign in June 1996 , as well as his slurring valedictory speech as president in December 1999 .
But last night , international leaders praised him .
George Bush called him " a historic figure who served his country during a period of momentous change " .
The EU and the Nato alliance hailed Mr Yeltsin as a healer of the cold war divide who opened up Russia to the rest of Europe .
" As president , he had enormous challenges and difficult mandates , but he certainly brought east and west closer together , " said Jose Manuel Barroso , president of the European commission .
Former prime minister John Major told the BBC : " He could be moody and introspective , but once he was a friend , he was a friend for life .
I think his tremendous work in terms of instilling democracy is what will stand out when people have forgotten the economic difficulties , and forgotten the miscellaneous matters about as whether he drank too much . "
In a statement , Lady Thatcher described Mr Yeltsin as a " patriot and liberator " .
Without him , she said , " Russia would have remained in the grip of communism " .
German chancellor Angela Merkel said : " Boris Yeltsin was a large personality in Russian and international politics , a courageous fighter for democracy . "
Spirited diplomacy
August 1991
At the height of the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev , the then foreign minister , Eduard Shevardnadze , found Mr Yeltsin passed out on the carpet with an empty vodka bottle beside him , not phoning round world leaders
August 1994
On a visit to Germany he jumped on to the stage in the middle of a champagne lunch , started to conduct the band and treated his audience to singing and dancing , as well as blowing kisses at them , visibly overcome with drink and nostalgia for the Russian folk tune the brass band were playing
September 1994
Mr Yeltsin was due to meet the Irish premier , Albert Reynolds , but never made it off the plane .
The Irish leadership waiting patiently at the end of the red carpet at Shannon airport was informed by Yeltsin 's advisers that he was " unwell " .
Journalists speculated that Mr Yeltsin was too drunk
December 1997
Whilst visiting Sweden Mr Yeltsin stunned everyone by announcing that he was cutting Russia 's nuclear arsenal by a third ; his press secretary later assured journalists it was not the case
February 1998
During a visit to Pope John Paul II , Mr Yeltsin offended his hosts by failing to salute the Italian flag , walking straight past it despite attempts by his embarrassed aides to stop him so that he could make a bow .
He appeared confused and vague during the visit and had to be propped up by aides several times .
He finished his state visit by declaring during a state banquet his " boundless love for Rome , Italy and Italian women "

Eating too much fructose and glucose can turn off the gene that regulates the levels of active testosterone and estrogen in the body , shows a new study in mice and human cell cultures that ’s published this month in the Journal of Clinical Investigation .
This discovery reinforces public health advice to eat complex carbohydrates and avoid sugar .
Table sugar is made of glucose and fructose , while fructose is also commonly used in sweetened beverages , syrups , and low - fat food products .
Estimates suggest North Americans consume 33 kg of refined sugar and an additional 20 kg of high fructose corn syrup per person per year .
Glucose and fructose are metabolized in the liver .
When there ’s too much sugar in the diet , the liver converts it to lipid .
Using a mouse model and human liver cell cultures , the scientists discovered that the increased production of lipid shut down a gene called SHBG ( sex hormone binding globulin ) , reducing the amount of SHBG protein in the blood .
SHBG protein plays a key role in controlling the amount of testosterone and estrogen that ’s available throughout the body .
If there ’s less SHBG protein , then more testosterone and estrogen will be released throughout the body , which is associated with an increased risk of acne , infertility , polycystic ovaries , and uterine cancer in overweight women .
Abnormal amounts of SHBG also disturb the delicate balance between estrogen and testosterone , which is associated with the development of cardiovascular disease , especially in women .
“ We discovered that low levels of SHBG in a person ’s blood means the liver ’s metabolic state is out of whack – because of inappropriate diet or something that ’s inherently wrong with the liver – long before there are any disease symptoms , ” says Dr. Geoffrey Hammond , the study ’s principal investigator , scientific director of the Child & Family Research Institute in Vancouver , Canada , and professor in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at the University of British Columbia .
“ With this new understanding , we can now use SHBG as a biomarker for monitoring liver function well before symptoms arise , ” says Dr Hammond , who is a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Reproductive Health .
“ We can also use it for determining the effectiveness of dietary interventions and drugs aimed at improving the liver ’s metabolic state . ”
Physicians have traditionally measured SHBG in the blood to determine a patient ’s amount of free testosterone , which is key information for diagnosing hormonal disorders .
In addition , SHBG levels are used to indicate an individual ’s risk for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
The discovery dispels the earlier assumption that too much insulin reduces SHBG , a view which arose from the observation that overweight , pre-diabetic individuals have high levels of insulin and low levels of SHBG .
This new study proves that insulin is not to blame and that it ’s actually the liver ’s metabolism of sugar that counts .
This research was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research , and the BC Children ’s Hospital Foundation .
Ever since " The Sixth Sense " , Hollywood producers have been trying to capitalize on its success by distributing horribly illogical twist endings , hoping desperately to recapture what made the film such a surprise hit .
And fail as they might , that certainly has n't stopped them from continuing to try .
We should warn you , there are spoilers below .
Not that you would ever want to watch the movies to begin with , we should just warn you because the twists are so stupid that reading about them might actually impair your motor functions for the next couple of hours .

10 Stay ( 2005 ) The gimmick :
All a dream
The twist :
The car crash at the beginning of the movie was the only real event , with Henry the main character having hallucinated the rest in the midst of death .
We 're going to assume this is due to all the acid he took before the car crash , because that 's the only way of explaining the incoherent mess he sees in the moments before death .
Why it sucks :
Apparently too busy sucking themselves off over the stylish transitions and slick effects to bother with actual plotting , the makers of " Stay " created a movie with a plot outline that was actually already used in a Saved by the Bell episode ( Rockumentary ) .
There is literally less than ten minutes of the movie that actually occurs .
You 'd figure that with only ten minutes of stuff that actually , you know , happens , they'd have managed to at least get that part right .
Instead we get two complete strangers hooking up immediately following a horrible car crash .
This apparently happens because they 're the same people that got to know each other in some dude 's dream .
We 're assuming this was supposed to be some sort of artful statement about death and dreams and seat belt safety , but expecting an audience to care about two people whose personalities were imagined by a man who was clearly under the influence of some sort of psychotropic drugs is pretty ridiculous ( basically the equivalent of making the last ten minutes of The Doors a subplot about the Indian getting it on with the Lizard King ) .
Of course , we 're supposed to overlook this minor dramatic incoherence because of the beauty inherent in two individuals being sexually aroused in the midst of several innocent people dying .
9 High Tension ( 2003 )
The gimmick :
Split personality .
Main character did it .
The twist :
In this French film , it turns out that the obese serial killing truck driver think Larry the Cable Guy except stronger and with more charisma was actually an alternate personality of Marie , a hot lesbian played by cutie Cecile de France .
Yes that French version of Natalie Portman is the one who stalked and killed a handful of grown men using seemingly super human strength to dispatch them with ease .
This leads to many puzzling questions , not least of which is , how in the hell did she manage to give herself a blowjob with that decapitated gal 's head ?
( By the way , it 's kind of a messed up movie . )
Why it sucks :
Violent , gory , and featuring a sequence of gratuitous lesbian masturbation , " High Tension " was on track to become one of the great horror films of our time .
That is , until its final ten minutes , where the filmmakers raised their middle fingers to the audience and said , " Hey , you know that awesome movie you were just watching ?
... yeah , well , fuck you .
None of it happened . "
This might not have been so irritating had there been a logical way of explaining why over half of what was shown on screen was physically impossible for Marie to accomplish like snapping people 's body parts off with bookshelves , and being in two different places at once .
We guess , as is often the case in life , the answer can be chalked up to superhuman lesbian strength and teleportation abilities .
Or maybe it can be chalked up to the fact that the filmmakers stole the entire plot from a Dean Koontz novel called Intensity , and in an effort to conceal their unoriginality , they tacked on an ending stolen from about a thousand split personality movies that came before it .
This one is so frustrating because it did n't even need a twist ending .
It could 've easily ended like any good slasher film : with a prolonged sequence of the villain being killed , but then not really being dead , and then appearing again at an inopportune moment , but then actually being killed , but oh wait his eyes open up an instant before the credits roll .
Except instead of credits , there 's a half hour session of the French chicks scissoring .
You know , like a good slasher film .
8 Signs ( 2002 ) The gimmick :
Aliens have ridiculous weakness .
Elaborate scheme ( of divine intervention ) .
The twist :
Aliens are H20 intolerant .
Bonus twist :
God has a lot of free time on his hands .
Extra bonus twist : Instead of being scary looking , the aliens look like naked burn victims .
Why it sucks :
Aliens have conquered interplanetary space travel , invaded and terrorized people across the globe , and yet , somehow , they 're incapable of figuring out that Earth is comprised almost entirely of water .
Kind of like humans deciding to land naked on the sun .
Further complicating things , it seems
God has seen fit to provide the protagonist , a troubled ex-priest , with a spiritual reawakening , in the form of every member of his family having an important quirk affecting their final encounter with those terrifying water - allergic , can 't - even - figure - out - how - to - open - locked - doors creatures .
It 's unclear why God went to all that trouble to work out that complex a plan , when he could have just made it rain .
We 're pretty sure Mel Gibson would have been just as thankful .
Apparently learning his lesson about twist endings , M. Night Shimmymamalamalan moved on to make " Lady in the Water " where the only twist is that he actually made a romantic comedy about mermaids starring Paul Giamatti .
7 Hide and Seek ( 2005 ) / Secret Window ( 2004 )
The gimmick :
Split personality .
Main character did it .
The twist :
In " Secret Window " , Johnny Depp plays a writer whose life is being wrecked by a mysterious character named John Shooter .
In Hide and Seek , Robert De Niro 's life is being wrecked by Dakota Fanning 's imaginary friend " Charlie . "
In both cases their wives are killed by the menacing characters .
In both cases , it turns out they have split personalities and are themselves the menacing character .
Both films attempt to dress up the clichd " split personality " cop - out by calling it " dissociative personality disorder . "
In both cases , you want to take the writers by the shoulders and violently shake them until they apologize .
Why it sucks :
Coming out within months of each other , two films that try desperately to have startlingly original endings made basically the exact same movie with the exact same twist ending .
Sure there were differences : one ending was obvious ( Secret Window ) while the other was irritatingly illogical ( Hide and Seek ) .
One managed to get an actor that was too good for the role by appealing to his fetish for playing writers while the other got an actor that was too good for the role by approaching him in the midst of a 17 year firesale on his artistic integrity .
But both movies boil down to " Husband investigates mysterious man only to find out he is the mysterious man .
Upon realizing this rather than being repentant , he for some reason becomes the bad guy and tries to kill stuff . "
You could describe the movies as eerily similar if the twist ending they employ was n't the laziest screenwriting clich that anyone 's ever employed .
So rather than looking on the two similar screenplays as eery , it should be looked on with the wonderment one reserves when finding out that two of their stoner friends both spent last Saturday laying on the couch watching a Friends marathon .
6 The Forgotten ( 2004 ) The gimmick :
Aliens did it .
The twist :
Julianne Moore 's kid was taken by aliens .
Goddamn aliens .
Why it sucks :
You honestly get the feeling that the idea for the movie started out having nothing to do with the aliens .
The movie certainly starts out having nothing to do with aliens .
For the first 45 minutes it 's like an ultra-intriguing Lifetime Movie .
Julianne Moore is grieving a child that died in a plane crash but she 's the only one who remembers him .
How could this be ?
We honestly wanted to know .
Apparently , so did the filmmakers .
And that 's when they had this conversation : Clich Hollywood Producer # 1 : OK , so how do we end that film where the broad loses her kid nobody but her remembers ?
We need a rock solid explanation that will give immediate understanding to all of the bizarre occurrences that have happened up to this point in the movie .
Any ideas ?
Clich Hollywood Producer # 2 : Aliens .
Clich Hollywood Producer # 3 : Yeah , aliens .
Clich Hollywood Producer # 1 : ... well that was easy .
Who wants lunch ?
5 Basic ( 2003 )
The gimmick :
Elaborate scheme .
Characters are n't really dead .
Rashomon effect .
The twist :
It took about eight viewings , but we think we 've finally worked it out .
Sector 8 was a super - secret anti-drug unit being led by John Travolta 's character and the whole thing was a meticulously planned con meant to make the army believe the team was dead so they could maneuver undetected in the future , and everything shown in scenes prior was simply part of the fabricated story they created to find out who was behind the drug dealing operation they were currently investigating .
Pretty simple , really .
Why it sucks :
Hearing characters get interrogated for an hour , only to find out everything they said was a lie , and then those lies were lies , and the lies about their lies were lies , and them admitting what lies were and were n't lies makes you stop caring , and start counting statistics such as number of characters that come back from the dead ( about a dozen ) and number of times that Samuel Jackson calls someone a motherfucker ( not enough ) .
The filmmakers behind " Basic " seem to follow the principle that as long as you throw out enough twists in a film , eventually one will stick and hold the picture together .
By the end you 're forced to conclude that " Basic " does n't want you to understand what 's happening .
There are flashbacks revealing parts of the plot that may or may not have happened before .
Just about everything you find out in the film is revealed to be false ten minutes later .
In Roshomon , this same technique is used to evoke the subjectivity of the truth .
In this film , it is used to evoke the feeling of being kicked in the nuts repeatedly while watching John Travolta try to act .
4 Perfect Stranger ( 2007 )
The gimmick :
Main character did it .
Elaborate scheme .
The twist :
Halle Berry was the killer .
Why it sucks :
Name any good twist ending movie , and you can rest assured it foreshadows its finale in earlier scenes .
" Perfect Stranger " attempts to emulate this with flashbacks of Halle Berry as a little girl , shots of a bathtub , and some weird guy eyeballing her .
We 've gotta say , as soon as we got to the ending , we smacked our forehead and cried out , " How could we have not seen that coming ?
There was that bathtub !
And that weird guy !
Not to mention shots of her as a young girl .
Of course Halle Berry is the killer ! "
That 's not to say those extremely revelatory flashbacks were our only indication .
The ending was also apparent in that Halle Berry 's character 's actions and emotions were clearly those of a person who was not the killer and did n't know what was going on , even when she was by herself .
For instance , when she snooped around Bruce Willis ' apartment trying to find evidence , and looked scared when she found pictures that indicated that he was a killer even though nobody was around , we should have known that she was just trying to get into the character of an innocent person , to throw people off her trail .
Because she 's so obviously the killer .
But the real mind fuck came from the promotion for the film , which brazenly advertised that it 's twist ending would blow our minds .
Based on this , we assumed it was going to be the only twist a film called Perfect Stranger could possibly use to blow our mind : Cousin Larry and Balki were really the same person all along .
3 The Number 23 ( 2007 ) The gimmick :
Main character did it .
Amnesia .
Unintentional elaborate scheme .
The twist :
Jim Carrey 's goes on an idiotic quest to find out who wrote a book he is reading about the number 23 .
When the ridiculous quest ends after two weeks , we find out he is the one who wrote the book , thus explaining both why the story gave off the vibe of a 5th grader 's failed English assignment and why it has ultimately taken him weeks to reach the end of a 100 - page novel .
Why it sucks :
In an attempt to conclude with as few plot holes as possible , " The Number 23 " spent its final half hour forcibly explaining an astoundingly convoluted chain of events adding up to some of the most convenient coincidences that would never logically happen .
Kind of like " Lost " , but with half the IQ points .
So , here 's a step - by - step guide explaining the wondrous nature of the film 's amazing twist : Jim Carrey 's dad killed himself and his suicide note merely consisted of things adding up to 23 .
Apparently not a Michael Jordan fan .
Jim Carrey became obsessed with the number 23 because of his father , regardless of the fact that his dad was a psychopath of " Norman Bates " proportions .
Jim Carrey stabbed a woman who cheated on him , and buried her in the park .
Jim Carrey went to his hotel ( room # 23 ) , wrote the book about the number 23 , left out chapter 23 ( which revealed his identity ) , put it on the walls of the hotel room , made every 23rd word in the book clues leading to that hotel room , and then jumped off the balcony .
Because when you think about it , why would n't he do all of that ?
Jim Carrey survived the fall , but suffered amnesia , so he forgot everything that happened in his past , allowing him to find the novel he wrote in a bookstore ( with the author 's handle listed as " Topsy Kretts " ZOMG ! Top Secrets ! ) , become obsessed with the number 23 all over again , and find out bit by bit the events leading up to his sordid past .
We do n't think we 're alone in the world when we say :
That 's retarded .
Also , it should be noted that Carrey does n't once talk through his ass throughout any of this .
2 Planet of the Apes ( 2001 ) The gimmick :
Ambiguity ...?
The twist :
We still have no idea .
We guess he goes back to Earth ...?
Or he was on Earth all along ...?
Or he goes back to the planet he was already on , which was n't Earth ...?
Except it 's further in the future ...?
And they 've somehow replicated Washington , D.C. in this place that may or may not be Earth ..?
And the place has magically ... uh ...
Screw it .
Nevermind .

I love productivity blogs — they ’re probably my greatest waste of time .
But as they teach me to better use my time , I do n’t consider it a waste .
If you like reading about productivity , goals , habits , GTD , time management and other such topics , I ’ve compiled a list of the best productivity sites for your perusal .
Now , you might not like all of these , but there are some real gems here — and many of them are n’t that well known .
I suggest you give them a look , browse their archives , and if you like what you see , try a test subscription ( you can always unsubscribe later ) .
Here ’s the list :

This list is n’t intended to be comprehensive .
Give me your favorites in the comments , and your thoughts on the blogs on this list .

“ He ’s a country boy , just like the rest of us , ” said Mark Plunkett , who played high school basketball with John Lee .
“ You throw a suitcase with a million dollars in front of us , who knows what we would do ? ”
Chris Guin , who considers himself one of Major Cockerham ’s best friends , shook his head .
“ That do n’t sound like John Lee , ” he said .
“ I think he ’s being railroaded . ”
While others from Castor have achieved more than Major Cockerham , few started with his disadvantages .
From outside the family ’s run-down four - room house , it is hard to see where he got the nerve to dream .
Growing up , the boys slept in one room , the girls in another , said his brother Charles .
They lived on grits in the morning and corn bread at night .
For water , he said , the children hauled buckets from a nearby stream .
Charles Cockerham said his father , John Lee Sr. , who worked at the local sawmill , did not finish high school , but encouraged his children to do so .
His mother , Clara , who worked as a teacher until her brood got too big , was even more emphatic about education .
“ He used to come to my house after school and stick his head in my encyclopedias , ” said Verba Egans , who is so close to Major Cockerham that he calls her Mom .
She added , “ It was never easy for him , but he worked hard because he was determined to make something of himself . ”
The Army as a Way Out
Like many poor young people from rural towns across America , John Cockerham saw the Army as the best way to advancement .
He joined right out of high school in 1984 and married a fellow soldier , Melissa Jordan , while stationed at Fort Knox , Ky. Later , he went to Northeastern Louisiana University on an R.O.T.C. scholarship , graduating in 1993 with an Army commission .

Fed policy makers expect ' subpar economic growth ' in 08
With the credit markets still reeling from the mortgage and subprime housing crisis this summer , policy makers at the Federal Reserve are pessimistic about the overall strength of the economy , expecting only subpar economic growth in 2008 .
According to a new and detailed report , forecasts of overall growth in 2008 now range from 1.6 to 2.6 percent , a sharp decline from this June , when estimates hovered around three percent .
Long - term trends are sketchier , but not very optimistic .
 The new report shows that almost all policy makers expect growth to be below trend until 2009 ,  reports the New York Times .
While some analysts have warned of an imminent recession , other policy makers are more guarded with their prognostications .
 They are saying they do not think the economy will slip into a recession ,  writes the Times ,  but admit that they could be wrong . 
Unemployment will rise to as much as five percent as well , but that is only a slight jump from the figure -- 4.7 percent -- the United States stands at today .
In the Washington Post - ABC News Consumer Comfort Index , pessimism about the economy has jumped to its highest peak in 17 years .
" Sixty - eight percent of Americans say the economy is getting worse , a 13 - percentage - point increase since October , and nearly 30 points above the long - term average for the question .

The past three parts of this series discussed national interest electric transmission corridors , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ’s ( FERC ’s ) authority to issue federal construction permits over the objections of state and local regulators , and the use of easements , rights of way , and eminent domain by the utilities to get access to the land needed for the transmission lines themselves .
In the final part of this series , I discuss a means by which states may be able to avoid being overruled by the FERC and close with some concluding remarks .
The Way Out – Regional Transmission Siting Agencies
Up until now , the “ Transmission Infrastructure Modernization ” section of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( the EPAct ) could be construed as a big power grab by the federal government and a usurpation of states ’ rights .
And , in most respects , that ’s an accurate complaint .
But at the same time that Congress gave the Federal Electric Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) the legal authority to overrule local control regarding transmission lines in national interest electric transmission corridors ( NIETCs ) , Congress also gave the states a way to avoid being overruled quite so easily .
The EPAct grants the authority for three or more states to enter into “ regional transmission siting agencies ” ( RTSAs ) .
These agencies would “ facilitate siting of future electric energy transmission facilities within those States and ; carry out the electric energy transmission siting responsibilities of those States . ”
RTSAs have to be approved by Congress since they ’re exercising nominally federal responsibilities , but once approved , the EPAct grants RTSAs the authority to site transmission lines within the states that are part of the regional compact and removes that authority from the federal government ( the FERC , specifically ) .
Only in cases where the RTSA ’s member states disagree with each other on transmission line siting does the FERC get to step back in .
If the states want to retain some amount of local control over where transmission lines are constructed or expanded in their state , then their best bet is to get together with the other states and come up with their own plans instead of relying on the federal government to do it for ( or against ) them .
In the event that they form an RTSA , the RTSA has all the authorities that the FERC would otherwise have and no Administration can remove that authority without an act of Congress .
So , if New York , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Maryland , Delaware , Virginia , West Virginia , and Ohio want to form an RTSA , or if California and Arizona want to bring Nevada or New Mexico into an RTSA , the states can collectively keep the federal government from overruling all their local decisions on energy types , transmission line routing , etc .
Conclusions
The nine pages that make up the Title XII , subtitle B ( “ Transmission Infrastructure Modernization ” ) represent a massive transfer of authority from the state and local level to the federal level .
The broadly defined and vaguely worded powers were probably written with the best of intentions , and I suspect that many of the Representatives and Senators , who voted for the EPAct in 2005 did so with the understanding that they were voting for a bill that would not strip their home states and districts of the authority to decide what happens within their borders .
They expected , as I did when I originally heard about these new provisions back in 2005 , that the EPAct was written in such a way that it would be applied on a case - by - case basis .
Unfortunately , at 551 pages ( in .pdf format ) , the EPAct itself has too much legislation for every Congressperson to spend the week I ’ve spent analyzing just a single section ( 1221 ) , never mind the time it would take to read all 525 sections and anticipate the future ramifications of all of them .
It ’s difficult to know whether Congress voted for a law that was deeply flawed by overly broad and vague language because of inattention and insufficient time to review the legislation or because they wanted to expand federal authority into this arena .
The language that Congressional staffers wrote , phrases like “ national energy policy , ” “ energy independence ” , and “ national defense , ” was chosen specifically in order to give current and future Presidents greatly expanded authority .
After all , it ’s not at all clear what the national energy policy ( NEP ) actually is .
Neither “ Reliable , Affordable , Environmentally - Sound Energy ” nor the EPAct itself really suffices as a NEP , although both produce sound bites and grand language that sounds great to easily distracted voters .
There will be a legal challenge to this aspect of the EPAct eventually .
The first step of that process was the designation of the two new NIETCs .
The next step will be for the FERC to overrule the permitting authority of the state (s ) involved .
And when that happens , the affected state(s ) will sue the FERC and the case will move inexorably through the federal courts until it sits before the Supreme Court .
However , there is no reason to believe that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the state (s ) .
In fact , given the unanimous decision in Berman v. Parker and the 5 - 4 decision in Kelo v. the City of New London ( that was decided by the Court ’s liberals ) , it ’s very likely that the Supreme Court will defer to Congressional authority in this regard as well .
That the federal government has a role in ensuring sufficient redundancy , reliability , and capacity in the power grid cannot reasonably disputed .
The problem is that , when we demanded that Congress act on our behalf with regard to electricity transmission lines , they chose to draw the line to closely to the federal government and too far from the control of state and local governments .
For this reason we should start demanding of our Congressional representative that the EPAct be revisited and the larger abuses of federal power that presently exist removed .
No administration , current or future , should have the ability to declare the entire country a region of national interest where state and local laws are meaningless .
That way lies madness .

The great problem besetting the US Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) is , of course , how on Earth to spend its mountains of federal pork on vaguely security - related stuff .
One approach is to build gear which is only tangentially about security , but which might work - for example cryogenic superconductor power lines for New York .
Another plan is to build something which is silly and unlikely to ever work , but which would be handy for security forces if it did - eg , handheld chunder rayguns .
Arguably the DHS tends to go for the latter type of effort more often than not .
More evidence to back such an assessment appeared this week , as media reports began to circulate regarding the beautifully - named Project Hostile Intent .
This is not a sinister terrorist plan .
It is n't even a double - sinister federal conspiracy to create terrorism where there was none before in order to establish a harsh police state , doubtless as prelude to government by alien invaders ( excuse us while we get our tinfoil on ) .
No , Project Hostile Intent is supposedly all about detecting hostility rather than causing it - although , like many DHS measures , it has the potential for causing a good deal of ire among airline passengers .
DHS Impression of the mindreader tech in action .
The idea is that entrants to the USA would , basically , be mind - probed by amazing new tech to be developed by the Human Factors Division of the DHS Science & Technology directorate .
The S&T boys swear blind that the technology will be " non-invasive " - oh , thank god - and will " identify deception and hostile intent in real time , on the spot ... without ever impeding the flow of travellers " .
This will be amazing stuff , if it works , though there could be a bit of a snag with false positives unless they can narrow it down .
You 'd need some way of detecting only hostility to the United States , rather than - say - hostility towards the DHS , which is common among otherwise righteous and patriotic Americans .
As for " deception " , you do n't want the machinery to start pulling over all the adulterers , advertising copywriters , etc .
The DHS chaps themselves are relatively cagey about exactly how their mind - reader / lie - detector gear would work .
The idea seems to be to employ a battery of technologies .
Cameras would snap pics or video of people 's faces , which could then be automatically analysed for suspicious expressions - perhaps an anticipatory evil leer or vacant mindless drool at the prospect of finally attacking the hated Great Satan .
New Scientist reports that this is already done by specially - trained human screeners , but that 's too manpower - intensive and time consuming for widespread use .
Apart from expression scanning , the computers might check for suspicious eyeball movements - bad guys are well known to shiftily look left and right when worried .
There was no word on plans to seize and interrogate anyone whose eyes were too close together , or all bald men in wheelchairs stroking fluffy white cats .
Other notions might include laser or microwave scans which could measure how sweaty people 's skin was , check for suspicious heartbeat patterns , or detect other signs of exaggerated fear as they entered the security channel - incontinence , perhaps .
If enough of these tests came up negative - suspicious face , heartbeat too fast , overly moist skin or pants - the luckless traveller would be drawn aside for a more thorough probing , though hopefully still " non-invasive " .
It has n't been hard to find sceptical securo - boffins to rubbish the DHS plans .
" There could be all kinds of reasons that might make people behave in certain ways that have nothing to do with terrorism , " according to Anthony Richards , counter - terror egghead at St Andrews University , talking to the Guardian .
" If you have heightened security and there are a lot of police around , it could be possible that you can feel and look guilty even when you have n't done anything wrong , " he added .
Or you might have done the wrong kind of wrongness .
Apparently the pilot DHS human operated shiftiness - spotting programme , Screening Passengers through Observation Techniques ( SPOT ) , has been subject to this problem .
" We have caught a number of individuals , from drug dealers to money launderers , and a double murderer in one case , " the DHS ' Chris White told New Scientist .
But no terrorists .
Even so , Larry Willis , DHS boffinry chief of Project Hostile Intent , said :
" The early test results have us cautiously optimistic . "
Peter McOwan of Queen Mary College in London , a top computer mood - recognition man , dismissed this brusquely .
" It 's just like something from Minority Report , " the testy boffin told New Scientist .
" They have been watching too many Tom Cruise movies . "
We see his point : though just to quibble a little , the Minority Report mind - probes were directed at bald mutant precogs in a swimming pool rather than airline passengers , and the enforcement personnel inflicted disabling vomit attacks on miscreants using club - style gizmos rather than dazzle - beam torches .
It 's important to get these things right . ®
The test looks at levels of key proteins
The test identifies changes in a handful of proteins that cells use to convey messages to one another .
The US researchers found it could indicate who had Alzheimer 's , as well as who was likely to develop the condition , with 90 % accuracy .
The work , led by Stanford University , features in Nature Medicine .
This is exciting research and the results and accuracy levels are very promising

One of the most distressing aspects of Alzheimer 's disease is the difficulty in determining whether mild memory problems are the beginning of an inevitable mental decline .
Currently , Alzheimer 's is effectively diagnosed by ruling out other causes of mental decline .
Even then it can only be categorically confirmed by carrying out a post - mortem .
The latest study pinpointed a connection between changes in the brain accompanying Alzheimer 's , and changes in the way cells communicate with each other .
Lead researcher Dr Tony Wyss - Coray said : " Just as a psychiatrist can conclude a lot of things by listening to the words of a patient , so by ' listening ' to different proteins we are measuring whether something is going wrong in the cells . "
Protein pattern
The researchers measured levels of 120 proteins used by cells to communicate to see if any could give a clue about Alzheimer's .
Samples from five people with Alzheimer 's were compared with samples from five people clear of the disease .
Levels of a number of proteins were strikingly different between the two groups .
Next , the researchers further refined their search by examining blood samples from 129 people with symptoms ranging from mild mental impairment to severe Alzheimer's .
They found that Alzheimer 's was associated with specific levels of 18 key proteins .
They used this tell - tale pattern to assess a further 92 patients who had already been clinically assessed for Alzheimer 's - and the diagnoses matched in nine out of 10 cases .
The test produced a similar level of success when it was used to analyse blood samples which had been taken two to six years earlier from patients , who were then followed up to find out whether their mild mental decline had progressed to something more severe .
Blood cell production
The 18 proteins that indicate Alzheimer 's are also involved in the production of new blood cells , immune processes and the death of cells at the end of their natural life cycle .
Dr Wyss - Coray said : " Our hypothesis is that there is something wrong with the production of certain blood cells , which may be needed to clear that stuff that accumulates in the brain in Alzheimer 's disease . "
The Stanford team stressed more work was needed to confirm their results , but Satoris , a company for which Dr Wyss - Coray works as a consultant , plans to develop a prototype test for use in research labs .
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " This is exciting research and the results and accuracy levels are very promising .
" However , further research is needed with a larger sample group to confirm these findings and determine if a simple , accurate blood test for Alzheimer 's can become a reality . "
Dr Susanne Sorensen , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said a blood test would be a huge breakthrough .
She said : " Early diagnosis is essential if we are ever to develop treatments that can change the course or halt the progression of dementia rather than just treat the symptoms . "
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Nightmarish political realities in Baghdad are prompting American officials to curb their vision for democracy in Iraq .
Instead , the officials now say they are willing to settle for a government that functions and can bring security .
Continuing violence -- like this Baghdad blast from May -- is causing a rethink of U.S. goals , generals say .
A workable democratic and sovereign government in Iraq was one of the Bush administration 's stated goals of the war .
But for the first time , exasperated front - line U.S. generals talk openly of non-democratic governmental alternatives , and while the two top U.S. officials in Iraq still talk about preserving the country 's nascent democratic institutions , they say their ambitions are n't as " lofty " as they once had been .
" Democratic institutions are not necessarily the way ahead in the long - term future , " said Brig .
Gen. John " Mick " Bednarek , part of Task Force Lightning in Diyala province , one of the war 's major battlegrounds .
The comments reflect a practicality common among Western diplomats and officials trying to win hearts and minds in the Middle East and other non-Western countries where democracy is n't a tradition .
The failure of Iraq to emerge from widespread instability is a bitter pill for the United States , which optimistically toppled the Saddam Hussein regime more than four years ago .
Millions of Iraqis went to the polls to cast ballots , something that generated great promise for the establishment of a democratic system .
But Iraqi institutions , from the infrastructure to the national government , are widely regarded as ineffective in the fifth year of the war .
U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus , the top American commander in Iraq , declined to be interviewed for this story , but they issued a joint statement to CNN that reiterated that the country 's " fundamental democratic framework is in place " and that " the development of democratic institutions is being encouraged . "
And , they said , they are helping Iraqi political leaders find ways " to share power and achieve legislative progress . "
But Crocker and Petraeus conceded they are " now engaged in pursuing less lofty and ambitious goals than was the case at the outset . "
Maj . Gen. Benjamin Mixon , commander of Task Force Lightning , also reflected a less lofty American goal for Iraq 's future .
" I would describe it as leaving an effective government behind that can provide services to its people , and security .
It needs to be an effective and functioning government that is really a partner with the United States and the rest of the world in this fight against the terrorists , " said Mixon , who will not be perturbed if such goals are reached without democracy .
" Well , see that all over the Middle East , " he said , stating that democracy is merely an option , that Iraqis are free to choose or reject .
" But that is the $ 50,000 question .
...
What will this government look like ?
Will it be a democracy ?
Will it not ? " he asked .
Soldiers , he said , are fighting for security , a goal Mixon described as " core to my mission . "
But security is far from complete in Iraq , where the government seems dysfunctional and paralyzed .
Seventeen of the 37 Iraqi Cabinet ministers either boycott or do n't attend Cabinet meetings .
Parliament , now on a much - criticized month - long summer break , has yet to pass key legislation in the areas of energy resource sharing and the future roles of former members of Hussein 's Baath Party .
U.S. officials , including President Bush , have said there is frustration with efforts by the government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki to promote political reconciliation .
The government is unable to supply regular electricity and at times running water in the capital .
The health care system is run by one Iranian - backed militia and the national police are dominated by another .
Death squads terrorize Sunni neighborhoods .
Sectarian cleansing is pushing people into segregated enclaves , protected by Shiite or U.S. - backed Sunni militias , and spurring the flight of thousands to neighboring countries .
Thousands of innocents are dying violently every month in cities and villages across the country .
Iraqi government officials concede things are n't working , but they say that 's because the United States does n't allow Iraq to really control its own destiny .
While the Iraqi government commands its own troops , it cannot send them into battle without U.S. agreement .
Iraqi Special Forces answer only to U.S. officers .
" We do n't have full sovereignty , " said Hadi al - Amri , the chairman of parliament 's Defense and Security Committee .
" We do n't have sovereignty over our troops , we do n't have sovereignty over our provinces .
We admit it . "
And because of the very real prospect of Iranian infiltration , the government does n't fund or control its own intelligence service .
It 's paid for and run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency .
Abdul Qarim al - Enzi , director of the parliamentary ethics committee , asks whether it is " reasonable for a country given sovereignty by the international community to have a chief of intelligence appointed by another country . "
One senior U.S. official in Baghdad told CNN that " any country with 160,000 foreigners fighting for it sacrifices some sovereignty . "
The U.S. government has long cautioned that a fully functioning democracy would be slow to emerge in Iraq .
But with key U.S. senators calling for al - Maliki 's removal , some senior U.S. military commanders even suggest privately the entire Iraqi government must be removed by " constitutional or non-constitutional " means and replaced with a stable , secure , but not necessarily democratic entity .

Roll Call editor says CREW did n't give him Craig story Nick Juliano
Published : Friday September 28 , 2007

Print This Email This ' No idea whatsoever ' how DeLay got that idea , editor tells Raw Story The Capitol Hill newsman who first learned of Larry Craig 's arrest for frisky behavior in a Minneapolis restroom says the accusation that an ethics watchdog group leaked him the police report is completely untrue .
Former Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay accused Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington of distributing Craig 's sex-sting arrest report to distract from a scandal swirling around Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
" I can tell you categorically that CREW was not the source for our Larry Craig story , " Josh Kurtz , who was first tipped off about the Idaho senator 's arrest , told RAW STORY .
Kurtz is political editor of Roll Call , the Capitol Hill newspaper that first reported Craig 's arrest .
CREW publishes an annual list of the " most corrupt " members of Congress called " Beyond DeLay , " in honor of the former House majority leader .
The Houston Chronicle reported that DeLay said CREW was acting in concert with Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign to distract attention from an emerging scandal revolving around rogue fundraiser Norman Hsu .
" Clearly Tom DeLay is still obsessed with CREW , " Naomi Seligman Steiner , a spokeswoman for the group told RAW STORY .
" Sure , by writing the ethics complaint against him we were instrumental in his downfall .
But , after all these years , even we 're surprised that he 's resorted to making up conspiratorial theories about us . "
Further undercutting DeLay 's assertion is that reports of Norman Hsu questionable fundraising practices did n't break until a day after Roll Call broke Craig 's story .
The world first learned of Craig 's toe - tapping , hand - waving , wide - stanced bathroom habits from Roll Call 's Web site on Aug. 27 .
The Wall Street Journal first raised questions about Hsu in an Aug. 28 article .
The fundraiser 's fugitive past did not fully emerge for several more days , and it was more than a week before Clinton was forced to return all the donations
Hsu had bundled .
This has n't been DeLay 's first swipe at CREW , which has been harshly critical of the Texas Republican .
Appearing on MSNBC in August , DeLay accused the group of withholding evidence of former Rep. Mark Foley 's e-mails to underage pages .
" A leftist group CREW held onto it [ evidence of Foley 's email communications to House pages ] for over a year before they pulled the trigger on the day of adjournment , " DeLay said , according to MediaMatters , which debunked his claim , noting CREW quickly handed evidence it obtained over to the FBI .
Kurtz , Roll Call 's political editor , would not disclose any information about the newspaper 's source on the Craig story other than to deny CREW 's involvement .
He heard no suggestion until Friday 's Houston Chronicle report that the group was involved .
" No idea whatsoever , " Kurtz said when asked where DeLay would have come up with his claim .
" Other than ( that ) he obviously has a very contentious history with CREW . "

At long last , Warren ’s guest post :
I do n’t know about you , but I moved to New York to see fucked up shit .
And like most mid-westerners who moved here in the Guiliani era , I was immediately and extremely disappointed .
I got over it though , and fell into a normal routine , spending my weekends drinking in the same old bland - ass bars , and , with the not - really - an - exception exception of getting lost in Hasidic Williamsburg once , seeing exactly nothing that you would classify as “ fucked up shit . ”
But every couple of months I would remember my original reason for being here , and with a renewed spirit I ’d drag a friend down to Coney Island or Chinatown , convinced there was something fucked up , something truly , deeply , fucked up to be seen in this city .
Alas , those maze - like shops in Chinatown lead not to Deerhunter - style Russian Roulette matches but only to more paper dragons and fake jade .
And the freak show at Coney Island ?
Fuck the freak show at Coney Island !!!!
After four or five years , I had given up any hope , resigned to the fact that New York had pretty much been enema-ized completely .
That is until the day my girlfriend came home from her summer job at NYU with the news that some woman was going to be sewing her vagina shut and calling it art as part of an NYU festival .
And we had free passes .
Let me say that again : sewing her vagina shut .
The event was labeled a “ Hemispheric ” festival that would be exploring various “ Religiosities . ”
I was n’t entirely clear on how some chick zipping up her nethers was in any way religious — in fact , it seems pretty fucking sacrilegious to me — but that ’s the kind of shit NYU does , and thank god , because that ’s precisely the kind of shit I was looking to see .
Worried that we would n’t be able to stomach this thing sober , Girlfriend and I had a few drinks beforehand , then dutifully and excitedly , well me more than her , made our way over to the school .
We were soon ushered into an empty classroom , where we were instructed to sit on the floor against the wall .
I was by this time figuring the odds of seeing an actual vulvic sewing at about 20 / 80 , as everyone in the audience seemed normal - ish , we were in a classroom , and I mean , c’mon , how could anybody actually do that ?
Surely we had been misinformed !
Lights dim , and in comes a nice enough looking girl from South America .
Music starts , one of those projectors you watched nature movies on in elementary school in the early 80 ’s cast blurry images against the wall , and the girl casually removed all of her clothes .
Okay , naked girl .
Cool enough , but , my mind is n’t blown .
She then laid her white shirt on the ground beneath her , placed a wine glass on top of the shirt , and proceeded to insert a round red ice cube , which we were later told was some of her blood that had been drawn and frozen , into her wee - wee .
Okay , no needles and thread yet , but we ’re definitely getting somewhere !
She then crouches over the wine glass , her body heat melts the ice cube , and she dribbles the blood from her crotch into the glass , AND THEN DRINKS IT !!!
Music stops , she leaves the room , and the lights come back up .
Girlfriend and I stare in silence .
Wow !
Score !
I win !
A woman five feet in front of me just faked her period and sipped it like a pinot .
Fucked !
Up !
Shit !
We are all then led into another classroom down the hall , where we watch a bunch of foul - mouthed marionettes masturbate for 30 minutes while getting crucified .
I guess this fulfilled the festival ’s “ religiosities ” requirement , and like most things exploring “ religiosities , ” — church , Kevin Smith ’s Dogma — it was boring as hell .
Once the puppet sketch ended , the crowd grew noticeably more excited .
Short , squat , 19 - year - old lesbians with pink hair and a penchant for the postmodern started whispering and giggling like the young , normal school girls they were n’t .
A professor type in his mid-fifties remarked to another group of gothy nerds , “ I came here for a revelation . ”
Well , me too , Doc , so bring it on .
The proctor woman led us all down the hallway and into yet another classroom , and it is instantly evident that some crazy - ass shit is about to go down .
Why ?
Because there ’s a hospital bed with stirrups at the front of the room and a video camera pointed about vagina level at the bed and displaying this image on a big TV .
You know , so we would n’t miss anything .
Now as I said , someone was allegedly going to be “ sewing their vagina shut . ”
You might have been asking yourself this whole time why anyone would actually want to watch that .
You , querying reader , do n’t know me , and therefore might assume that I ’m a grade - A voyeuristic nutjob .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
I do n’t have any weird fetishes .
I do n’t have any suicidal or homicidal tendencies , and I ’ve only googled “ pooping grannies ” once and I did n’t click on any of the links .
I ’m a pretty normal dude , I swear .
So I do n’t know if I can really offer a proper explanation .
Maybe it has something to do with growing up and getting a job and kind of hating it and learning that life is n’t really all that magical but kind of ho - hum about two - thirds of the time .
Maybe it ’s because I was in my early twenties and felt like I ’d pretty much seen everything .
I do n’t know .
But if you want to judge me for it , and you do n’t really want me to baby sit your kids , I ’m cool with that .
I understand .
In walks a forty - or - so - year old woman in a hospital gown .
She slowly and methodically sits down in the inclined bed — it looks comfy and posturpedic — and slips her feet into the stirrups .
Up comes the gown , revealing the vulva we had all come to see .
From the looks of it , this vulva has been involved in both performance art and battering rams for many years , and I felt sort of sad for this poor , tired vulva .
The woman then pulls out a statuette of Jesus — religiosities , anyone ?— and cradles it in her arms for a couple of minutes .
Once she ’s given it a little love , she sets the Jesus doll on a side table next to the bed .
I ’m warning you : this is going to get crazy .
She then swabs her left labia with iodine , pierces it with a hollow needle — OUCH — slips a long thread through , and ties it off .
The TV is giving us a very clear and close - up picture of all this .
Then : Wash , rinse , repeat on the right .
She now has a long string tied to and dangling from each side .
I ’m no seamstress , and I do n’t have female genitals , but this does n’t strike me as the best way to accomplish the whole sewing it shut idea .
Could it be she has something else planned ?
I ’m warning you again : this is going to get really fucking crazy .
She turns her attention back to the Jesus doll .
Said doll is about 10 inches long , and its arms and legs are splayed .
She pulls out a condom — hey , I warned you — and rolls it over and around the doll .
She then douses the condomized Jesus with an absurd amount of lube and , you guessed it , spends five very long minutes , um , doing the opposite of giving birth to the statuette .
This woman has ample storage up there I guess , because she is unbelievably able to take in the entire doll , leaving only his little feet hanging out , flanked by the two dangling strings .
She then ties the right string to the right foot and the left string to the left foot , just to make sure the doll ca n’t go anywhere .
Over the course of the next thirty minutes , she pulls out a compact mirror and applies her make - up , brushes her hair , and puts on a big rubber suit .
A crotchless rubber suit , fyi .
A crotchless rubber suit with a huge cartoon - like zipper running up the insides of both legs .
She zips up her legs , slips on some six - inch heels (! ) and a big string of pearls and hops on up out of bed .
We watch her walk around a little , legs zipped up , Jesus statue in her hoo - hoo , make - up meticulously applied .
As if she does n’t have every possible impediment to being able to walk , she breaks the necklace and hundreds of pearls scatter all over the stage .
Oddly , this produced the only audible gasp from the crowd the whole evening , and not , you know , when she was piercing her vulva or crotch - swallowing our lord and savior .
She manages not to slip on the pearls , and she then walks slowly out of the classroom .
And that ’s it .
Lights up , and the NYU kids head over to Dojo ’s to discuss the artistic merits of the evenings festivities .
Girlfriend and I , dumbfounded , disgusted , pretty fucking all around blown away , and oddly sated , head home .
But I was pleased .
After all , I moved to New York to see fucked up shit .
Mission fucking accomplished .

Universal Music Sketches Subscription Concept , Details Emerge
CD sales are dropping at an alarming rate , and that has majors entertaining a number of fresh sales scenarios .
At Universal Music Group , that includes an experimental stab at DRM - free downloads , a move considered unthinkable just one year ago .
Now , several sources to Digital Music News have offered details on a new possibility , one that modifies the subscription - based music concept currently offered by companies like Napster and Rhapsody .
The more comprehensive subscription plan , called TotalMusic , would require buy - in from ISPs and mobile access providers .
According to numerous executives familiar with the plan , it would also force opt - in among existing ISP subscribers , a structure that automatically bumps monthly access charges in exchange for the subscription - based music plan .
Just last week , a Universal Music representative confirmed the initiative , but declined to offer any details .
But one source within the label did offer more information , and noted that TotalMusic is just one of several concepts currently being sketched .
Meanwhile , a source within the mobile industry expressed grave doubts about the future of the initiative , and pointed to a plan that has been circulating unsuccessfully for months .
The forced opt - in may be dealing the most serious blow to the discussions .
One source noted that Universal has faced difficulty rallying ISPs around the concept , largely because of the silent bump in monthly access fees and the lack of billing transparency .
Sources also noted that other labels would have to agree to various terms , pricing , and contract points , a complicated and difficult process .
The ILO 's Key Indicators of the Labour Market indicate that agriculture is no longer the economic sector that employs the most workers worldwide .
Peter S. Magnusson observes :
Worldwide , in 1996 agriculture employed 42 % , industry 21 % , and services 37 % .
In 2006 , the numbers are 36 % , 22 % , and 42 % .
So in the period , services has overtaken farming on a global scale .
Magnusson draws attention to the fact that the number of people working in manufacturing has remained steady .
Workers in growing economies are skipping the manufacturing stage and going straight to services .
In order for people to move out of agriculture and into something else , you need two things :
1 . Some means of making sure that you still get the food 2 .
Something else for these people to do
Improved farming techniques ( technologically improved , that is ) takes care of the first point .
A growing economy takes care of the second .
The familiar pattern throughout history has been one of workers going from farming to producing some other goods .
Services comes later .
However , the world economy does n't seem to need any more people working in manufacturing than it already has , at least on a percentage basis .
So workers are going straight into services .
So worldwide we have more food with fewer people working to produce food , and apparently more wealth overall with fewer people working to produce stuff .
Automation is driving these changes .
It will be very interesting to see where these numbers are in another 10 years .
Will agriculture continue to drop ?
Will industry hold steady at about 21 - 22 % ?
We shall see .
Uproar after Justice Department official says black voters caused their own lines in Ohio 2004 vote John Byrne
Published : Friday October 12 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) rebuked a Justice Department voting official Friday night who said Ohio's African American voters faced long lines in the 2004 presidential election because blacks tend to vote at night .
Justice Department Voting Section Chief John Tanner 's " investigation of the 2004 election in Ohio concluded that long lines and late voting precincts were due to the fact that white voters tend to cast ballots in the morning ( i.e. , before work ) and black voters cast ballots in the afternoon ( i.e. , after work ) , " Conyers said in a release .
Why did African American voters suffer long lines in Ohio ?
Tanner wrote in a letter TPM Muckraker uncovered that " ... the principal cause of the difference appears to be the tendency in Franklin County for white voters to cast ballots in the morning ( i.e. , before work ) , and for black voters to cast ballots in the afternoon ( i.e. , after work ) .
We have established this tendency through local contacts and through both political parties , and it accords with our considerable experience in other parts of the United States .
Morning voters may wait in line several hours , as happened in white precincts , without keeping the polls open after 7:30 am ; this is not the case , however , at sites where voters arrive after 5:30 p.m . "
The comments were reported by TPM Muckraker Friday .
Voters in black counties faced far longer lines than those in the more white Ohio suburbs .
Investigations showed that Ohio officials had deliberately placed fewer voting machines in some areas and in some instances even kept voting machines out of service .
The resulting lines generally resulted in less individuals voting because the lines were so long .
" I am concerned about the extreme lengths Mr. Tanner went to in order to justify the reasons African - Americans were not treated equally in the 2004 Ohio election , " Conyers said .
" The committee needs to consider this matter .
I am aware of no precedent for the Department acting in this capacity in the past .
" The Department of Justice  since the Voting Rights Act of 1965  has a responsibility to thoroughly investigate allegations of voter suppression and discrimination , like those made in Ohio in 2004 , " the Michigan Democrat added .
" I look forward to hearing more from Mr. Tanner in our committee later this month as he testifies about his work as chief of the voting section .
The 2004 election exposed serious deficiencies in this section 's failure to adequately investigate and prosecute voter suppression efforts nationwide and I hope he is prepared to address this issue head on . "
Conyers wrote a detailed report while in the House minority which detailed Ohio 's voting discrepancies , What Went Wrong in Ohio .
" We have found numerous , serious election irregularities in the Ohio presidential election , which resulted in a significant disenfranchisement of voters , " he wrote in the January 2005 report .
" Cumulatively , these irregularities , which affected hundreds of thousand of votes and voters in Ohio , raise grave doubts regarding whether it can be said the Ohio electors selected on December 13 , 2004 , were chosen in a manner that conforms to Ohio law , let alone federal requirements and constitutional standards . "
Among the irregularities in voting , Conyers listed insufficient voting machines in predominately minority and Democrat districts , provisional ballots that disenfranchised thousands , voter registrations that were rejected because of paper weight , efforts by Republicans to engage in " caging " tactics that targeted 35,000 mostly minority voters for intimidation and the use of voting " challengers , " who could challenge voters ' rights to have their vote counted .
The challengers , he said in his report , were " concentrated in minority and Democratic areas likely disenfranchised tens of thousands of legal voters , who were not only intimidated , but became discouraged by the long lines .
Shockingly , these disruptions were publicly predicted and acknowledged by Republican officials : Mark Weaver , a lawyer for the Ohio Republican Party , admitted the challenges ' ca n't help but create chaos , longer lines and frustration . ' "

The Soyuz - U rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome , Kazakhstan , at 13:00 CEST ( 11:00 GMT ) on 14 September 2007 , for the start of the 12 - day Foton - M3 mission .
MOSCOW ( AP ) -- Forgete - mail .
How about space mail ?
In an experiment combining elements of a packagedelivery service , the sport of kite surfing and a REALLY big fishing reel , Russian and European engineers on Tuesday sought to pioneer a technology thatcould be used in the future to retrieve cargo from space .
The experiment involving a 19 - mile , super - strengthtether hit a glitch , however , when the line failed to unwind fully , butRussian Mission Control said it hopes to salvage the test by recalculating thelanding capsule 's orbit .
" Even a fishing linecould get stuck sometimes , " Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin told The Associated Press .
The second Young EngineersSatellite , whose preparation involved nearly 500 university students fromEurope , Japan , North America and Australia , was launchedinto orbit Sept. 14 on a Russian - built Foton - M3 spacecraft , along withother European Space Agency experiments .
The goal of the YES2 experiment was to deliver Fotino -- a 12 - pound reddishspherical capsule the size of a beach ball -- to Earth with the help of along tether made of a substance the European Space Agency described as theworld 's strongest fiber .
In the experiment , the Fotino , held in a metal brace by straps , was to be shot out from the Foton - M3 spacecraft with springs asthe tether gradually unwound , swinging the capsule forward into a lowerorbit about 18 miles below .
About 2 1/ 2 hours later , after gravity takes firm hold and the entire unit swings in a vertical positionbelow the spacecraft , the Fotino is then released from its straps and glidesthrough the atmosphere for about 20 minutes before a parachute deploys and thesphere bumps to a landing in the steppes of the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan .
The capsule has a thermalshield to protect it from the searing heat of re-entry through the Earth ' satmosphere , while the tether and the holding clamps burn up .
The experiment went awrywhen only five miles of the tether were unwound from the spacecraft at about190 miles above the Earth before the capsule was released , Lyndin said .
The reason for the problemwas n't immediately clear , Lyndin said .
" It could be that the tether gotstuck , " he added .
The Fotino is equipped witha radio beacon to allow experts to track it as it glides down through theatmosphere , and Mission Control will try to calculate its current orbit todetermine when and where it will land , Lyndin said .
The Russian Space Agencysought to play down the problem , saying the experiment provided a ``valuableinformation about the tether 's dynamics in space flight . ''
" The results of theexperiment could be considered partly successful , '' it said .
Roger Walker , the projectmanager for ESA 's Education Office , also played down the glitch , saying on theagency 's Web site that it was a ``largely successful demonstration ' ' and thatthe agency was proud of the students ' work , even though full deployment was notreached .
Lyndin said there had beenother experiments involving tethers deployed in space , but they were not thatlong and did not carry parcels .
The tether deployed Tuesdayis .0196 inches thick and is made of Dyneema , which the ESA said is used bykite surfers .

Cheney 's chief of staff rebukes Kerry on VP 's secrecy oversight John Byrne
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , David Addington , issued a letter to Sen .
John Kerry ( D - MA ) today defending the Vice President 's interpretation of his office being outside the executive branch - only this time , he said it was because Cheney 's office is n't an " agency . "
A copy of the letter from David Addington to Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass . , was released to RAW STORY .
Kerry said the " legalistic " response from Addington " raises more questions than it purports to answer . "
" Dear Senator Kerry , " Addington writes .
" The executive order on classified national security information -- Executive Order 12958 as amended in 2003 -- makes clear that the Vice President is treated like the President and distinguishes the two of them from ' agencies . ' "
No longer satisfied with the Vice President 's office 's claim that Cheney is actually an admixture between the legislative and executive branch , Addington now posits that the Vice President 's office is not an " agency . "
" The executive order gives the [ Information Security Oversight Office ] , under the supervision of the Archivist of the United States , responsibility to oversee certain activities of ' agencies , ' but not of the Vice President or the President . "
Kerry said Addington was wrong on that point because the executive order governing the handling of classified material covers " any other entity within the executive branch that comes into the possession of classified information . "
Addington insists that the question of whether Cheney is in the executive branch does not apply to the discussion of classified materials .
" Constitutional issues in government are generally best left for discussion when unavoidable disputes arise in a specific context instead of in theoretical discussions , " Addington adds .
" Given that the executive order treats the Vice President like the President rather than like an " agency , " it is not necessary in these circumstances to address the subject of any alternative reasoning , based on the law and the history of the legislative functions of the vice presidency and the more modern functions of the vice presidency , to reach the same conclusions that the vice president is not an ' agency ' with respect to which ISOO has a role . "
Kerry re-iterated his request that Cheney 's office define its place in government .
If Cheney intends to ignore two centuries of constitutional precedent in declaring himself outside the executive branch , Kerry asks that he at least provide a justification for that decision .

Quote : A Belgian anesthetist has filed a complaint against a Muslim who blocked him from entering the operating theatre where his wife was to undergo emergency surgery .
The woman was operated with the male doctor shouting instructions from a hallway to a female nurse Doctor Philippe Becx from Bree , Belgium , was called to the hospital in the middle of the night because a woman had to undergo an emergeny caesarean section .
However , her husband blocked the door and demanded a female anesthetist .
The latter was unavailable .
After a two - hour discussion proved fruitless , an imam was summoned .
The imam permitted the doctor to apply an epidural injection , but only if the woman was fully covered with only a small area of skin showing .
During the surgery itself , performed by a female gynecologist , the anesthetist was to remain in the hallway .
Through a door that was slightly ajar , he shouted instructions to a nurse who was monitoring the anesthesia .
According the hospital ’s directors , the doctor acted with ‘ admirable understanding . ’
He would have been in his right to have the man removed by police .
The anesthetist has now filed a complaint with an investigate judge , charging that he was hindered in fulfilling his fuctions , and that he was discrimanated against since he was not allowed to do his job merely because he is a man .
The doctor further claims moral damage , since he could not fulfill his medical duties while he would still be liable should any complications have occured .
The Belgian organization of anesthetists says there have been other incidents between Muslims and male doctors .
The organization demands clear guidelines from the government .
“ Tolerance is nice , but it may not jeopardize safety , ” says chairman René Heylen .
The Muslim is also charged with endangering the lives of his wife and child .
The caesarean section was succesful , and mother and child are doing fine .
http://www.religionnewsblog.com/19778/islamic-extremism-13
Next time somebody asks why we do what we do , why we are n't content to let people believe in the insane ramblings of so - called " holy men " , I 'm going to point out that this man would have rather had his wife and child die than for a man see the skin on her back .
If you have to wait two hours and then call an imam to bless a procedure that will save the lives of those that you supposedly hold dear -- you are a sick fuck -- a twisted victim of an institution that should be eradicated from the face of the earth .

Body Language and Flirting

Updated March 21st – 2012 .
New resources , information , books and links added .
Only 7 % of communication is verbal communication .
( see note ) 38 % of it depends on our intonation , or the sound of our voice .
For instance : A shaky , uneven voice may suggest that a person is shy , intimidated , or dishonest .
A clear , loud voice may indicate that a person is confident .
The largest chunk of communication is body language , which takes up the remaining 55 % .
These statistics show that a person who knows how to control their body and voice is considered more appealing than someone who knows only a mouthful of pick - up lines and crowd pleasers .
The impression we make on others starts not when we first open our mouth , but with our posture , breathing , appearance , and movement .
Art and Science of Flirting and Body Language
The art of flirting is expressed with gestures and subtle actions – also known as body language .
Non-verbal communication is often more important than words .
This artful dance makes it possible for strangers to become comfortable with each other , even at their first exchange of words .
People become at ease with others when they find the other person pleasant .
People appear pleasant as a result of showing interest in others via their body language cues .
( I like you , because you appear to like me . )
Some body language ( physical actions expressing inner emotions or thoughts ) is universal among us and other mammals .
Also see : Micro Expressions article here on Blifaloo.com for more information on emotions , evolution and physical responses .
Eye and Triangulation
Body language reflects our emotional interest in various ways .
In general , these actions manifest by instinct when we are facing people that we admire .
For example , in intimate conversation , people usually look at each other ’s eyes .
Sometimes we shift our vision from one eye to the other , and to the bridge of the nose .
This is what is called the triangular formation of vision .
As a person becomes more interested in another , this triangular formation extends downward .
Some say that it ’s rude to look at a stranger ’s body , but when you really think about it , people really can’t help it when they feel attracted .
When people are talking to mere acquaintances , they simply look at their eyes , but when people are interested in someone , they tend to notice a lot more than just the eyes and the nose .
Also … looking at the someone ’s mouth can suggest interest in kissing .
Also see the BBC article on the science of body language for more info on eye contact research .
Mirroring – Gestures , Body Language
We can make others feel comfortable by mirroring or matching their mood and actions .
When two people enjoy similar things , they tend to move in sync with each other .
This does not mean that every single move they make is exactly the same , but rather that their moods are the same .
Flirting Body Language Overview ( for our lazy readers )
Male Flirting Signals :- hands on belt or belt buckle – preening / grooming – stretching ( and other actions that make him seem bigger )
Female Flirting Signals : – actions that make her appear smaller – playing with hair – exposure of neck or inner wrists
General Flirting Signals :
– eye contact – mirroring – triangulation – “ accidental ” touching
When a person finds something in common with another , an instinctive fondness develops between them .
This same effect is replicated by mirroring .
( Editors note : I first read about “ mirroring ” when I was a teenager and into NLP work by Bandler and Grinder .
Now it is a common tool taught by professional pick - up artists and salesman .
There is tons of info out there about mirroring , the author barely touches on it in the paragraph below .
Google search for mirroring and body language for more info .
Also see : eye direction and lying for links to NLP related info and books . )
In mirroring , you need to tune in to the other person ’s movements and imitate them , not mimic them .
Also , these actions should not be done in the same pace as his / hers , otherwise , the person might take it instead as mockery .
Generally , the mirror actions should be done after 10 - 20 seconds , and must be done naturally .
The other purpose of the mirror actions is to show the other person that you accept and respect their views without them noticing it .
In effect , he / she will subconsciously see you as an open - minded person .

Congress approves Internet - tax moratorium
The House unanimously approved a seven - year extension of a moratorium on Internet - access taxes , which the Senate passed last week .
The move cleared the way for President Bush to sign it before the current ban expires Thursday .
For consumers , the legislation largely maintains the status quo :
No Internet - access taxes except in the nine states that were grandfathered when the ban was first put in place in 1998 .
California is not among them .
The legislation applies only to Internet - access taxes , not to sales taxes for online purchases .
For those , if there have been any discrepancies it may be worth contacting Clean Slate Tax to get the records sorted for you .
But it addresses a concern by many lawmakers , technology companies and Internet - service providers that consumers could see the same itemized taxes on their Net - access bills that now appear on their phone and TV cable bills .
A monthly phone bill can include as much as $ 10 in taxes .
“ This legislation will help keep the cost of Internet access down so that all individuals can continue to use the great informational tool that is the Internet , ” Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) said .
He and other lawmakers said the legislation would give telecommunications companies the certainty they needed to continue investing in the infrastructure to extend high - speed Internet access throughout the country .
I suppose it ’s needless to say that I ’m happy about this development .
It seems that the proponents of the moratorium were asking for a permanent ban , but even a 7 year extension is a victory , as the longest extension they ’d previously secured was 4 years .
However , I saw one interesting piece of the puzzle here , that was , to reuse a word , quite puzzling :
For the young technology industry , the lengthy extension is a legislative victory that shows its clout has grown in Washington during the last decade .
Still , the industry continues to have trouble when facing a formidable lobbying opponent .
In this case , it was state and local governments , which were concerned that they could lose the ability to tax phone and TV services as more consumers get them delivered over the Internet .
Governors and local officials , who have strong ties to many members of Congress , successfully derailed the push for a permanent ban and got the definition of Internet access changed to make clear that phone and TV services delivered online are taxable .
Many state and local governments depend on money from taxing those services .
Very interesting .
One can likely make the argument was that the previous taxes on phone service and television lines were related in some way to the government granting monopolies to the providers of those services , and / or related to the infrastructure involved .
I ’m not sure of the whole history of how telephone and television service taxes arose , but I ca n’t see them being sold to the public as if using a telephone or watching television were– by themselves– taxable activities .
But that apparently is the argument that must be made to support such an exemption .
The telephone service and television service , when provided through the internet , is clearly a component of internet access .
To create this exemption , the Governors & states must be arguing that talking on the telephone or watching television– by themselves– are taxable activities regardless of the media over which the signals are delivered .
Paying for the internet can be expensive enough , now having to pay taxes on top is going to be a struggle for some , that ’s why with internet nebraska has many companies such as Allo that offer the best packages to suit your needs and budget whether it be for your TV or phone .
Even with offers as good as these , it is still a big concern for the upcoming tax charges .
Let that sink in for a minute .
I think the initial concern was the loss of an existing revenue stream to state governments .
But in the long term , what are the implications of such an exemption ?
Will it encourage further growth in online content and commerce ?
If so it will become even more important for us to make sure we have a secure browser to protect us from online threats .
Groups such as the National Governors Assn. and the California Assn. of Counties said they knew of no governments planning to tax Internet access , but they argued that a permanent ban would make it difficult to change the definition in the future to avoid exempting other taxable services .
…
In a change pushed by Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - Ore. ) , the legislation also clarifies that services related to Internet access , such as instant messaging , e-mail and personal online storage , are not taxable .
Aha !
Clearly this is the camel ’s nose in the tent , a way to create the precedence for exemption of services and open the door to taxing them in the future .
It may be such that “ internet service ” in the future remains tax - free , but I highly doubt that the services provided over the internet will remain free from taxation .
The internet tax is highly unpopular .
After all , this is a service that we ’ve all been enjoying tax - free for years , and for governments to all of a sudden offer to increase the price of the service through taxation is one that does n’t go over too well in American homes and offices .
But as long as something remains tax - free , politicians can’t sleep at night , and they ’re constantly dreaming up ways to get their claws in .
Call this a success in that the moratorium was extended , but keep a wary eye on where things go from here , or you ’ll soon find that your “ tax - free internet service ” seems to involve sending a lot of money to your state capitol and to Washington DC .
If you ’re interested , recently my friend got a cheaper quote on his broadband .
He saved a bunch of money through Usave .
He is so glad he did because he is getting a better service now and paying less for it !

( Fortune Magazine ) -- A door opens , and a blond man appears in a white jacket with large buttons .
" Good morning , " he says .
" Peter 's in back .
Make yourself comfortable in the dining room .
I 'll be serving breakfast shortly . "
Holy cannoli .
Peter
Thiel has a butler .
The 40 - year - old entrepreneur runs a $ 3 billion hedge fund .
He 's the founder of a new venture capital firm that 's the talk of Silicon Valley .
He 's got an early $ 500,000 stake in Facebook that 's now worth about $ 1 billion on paper .
The man has bankrolled everything from restaurants to movies and is lauded by many as some kind of free - market genius .
He drives a half - million - dollar McLaren supercar .
And now a butler .
Just back from a morning run ,
Thiel emerges into the dining room of his home in the shadow of San Francisco 's Palace of Fine Arts .
Wearing a powder - blue T - shirt wet with sweat , he displays the relaxed self - confidence of Michael Corleone .
Perhaps it comes with the butler .
" I'm Peter , " he says , extending his hand and smiling before thanking me for agreeing to such a late breakfast meeting .
It 's 7:30 A.M. " It was nice to sleep in . "
The doorbell rings , and in walks a scruffy , sleepy - eyed Max Levchin , 32 , who has trekked over from his new $ 5 million - plus home a few blocks away in Pacific Heights .
Every garment on Levchin 's unwashed body is a freebie - University of Illinois zip jacket , mismatching shorts , bright orange T - shirt with some Hebrew lettering .
Levchin runs one of the hottest companies on the web , a photo - sharing site called Slide that draws 134 million users a month .
Making neither eye contact nor conversation , he presses his lips together , nods to indicate that he is , as ever , ready for business , and sits .
It 's been nine years since Thiel and Levchin first dined together at Hobee 's , near Stanford University .
Levchin had an idea for a company , and Thiel wanted to invest .
In short order Thiel joined as a co-founder , and together they set out to " create the new world currency . "
Their brainchild would change the course of the Internet .
They 'd bring on several hundred employees to what would become PayPal .
They 'd sign up more than 20 million users and burn $ 180 million in funding before breaking even and selling out to eBay ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) for $ 1.5 billion .
And then things got interesting .
The eBay deal , remarkable only because it happened in the bleakness of 2002 , was n't so much an exit as an explosion .
Most of PayPal 's key employees left eBay , but they stayed in touch .
They even have a name for themselves : the PayPal mafia .
And the mafiosi have been busy .
During the past five years they 've been furiously building things - investment firms , philanthropies , solar - power companies , an electric - car maker , a firm that aims to colonize Mars , and of course a slew of Internet companies .
It 's amazing how many hot web properties can trace their ancestries to PayPal .
Besides Facebook and Slide , there 's Yelp , Digg , and YouTube .
Thiel and Levchin , the don and consigliere of the mafia , figure that all told , there are dozens of enterprises worth a total of roughly $ 30 billion - and that value is growing rapidly , as evidenced by Thiel 's good fortune with Facebook .
This group of serial entrepreneurs and investors represents a new generation of wealth and power .
In some ways they 're classic characters of Silicon Valley , where success and easy access to capital breed ambition and further success .
It 's the reason people come to the area from all over the world .
But even by that standard , PayPal was a petri dish for entrepreneurs .
The obvious question is , Why ?
Maybe it comes back to the early hires .
After their first breakfast , Thiel and Levchin began recruiting everyone they knew at their alma maters .
" It basically started by hiring all these people in concentric circles , " Thiel remembers .
" I hired friends from Stanford , and Max brought in people from the University of Illinois . "
They were looking for a specific type of candidate .
They wanted competitive , well - read , multilingual individuals who , above all else , had a proficiency in math .
Levchin's original idea for PayPal was to beam money between PalmPilots , but Thiel has a way of seeing the bigger picture .
A staunch libertarian , Thiel figured a web - based currency would undermine government tax structures .
Getting there , however , would mean taking on established industries - commercial banking , for instance - which would require financial acumen and engineering expertise .
Thiel and Levchin also wanted workaholics who were not MBAs , consultants , frat boys , or , God forbid , jocks .
" This guy came in , and I asked what he liked to do for fun , " Levchin recalls .
" He said , ' I really enjoy playing hoops . '
I said , ' We can't hire the guy .
Everyone I knew in college who liked to play hoops was an idiot . ' "
An asteroid discovered three years ago could be a threat in 2029 when it crosses Earth 's orbit , a Russian astronomer said Monday .
Boris Shustov , director of the Institute of Astronomy , said at a forum that the Apophis asteroid could have a bigger impact than an asteroid that hit Siberia in 1908 , the Novosti news agency reported .
The Tunguska astral event affected 830 square miles and blasted 80 million trees .
The force of the impact was about 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima , Japan , at the end of World War II and measured 5.0 on the Richter scale .
Apophis ' predicted track would take it within 17,000 miles of Earth in 2029 , Shustov said .
He said if the asteroid proves to be a threat , the Hollywood scenario of destroying it is likely to be more harmful than helpful .
Instead , a micro-satellite could nudge it into a safer orbit .
" To blast an asteroid , as some hot shots suggest , is quite an unpredictable step , and a more cautious approach is welcomed now , " he said .

Flight 1462 to Edinburgh , Sunday night .
Late boarding , we ’re stuck in the ass of the plane .
There ’s an older chav - like female sitting in the window seat , reading some very pink magazine full of all the important information on world events one should be familiar with such as Britney Spears ’ latest alleged lover ’s name , the latest photos of Julia Someone - or - Other , and tips on how to do a French manicure at home for only £ 3.50 .
Across the aisle were a couple of kids and some older guy on the window .
The 12 - ish girl was engrossed in a magazine as her brother sat fumpily looking over her shoulder , turning away whenever she looked up so as not to be caught reading material that was , for the most part , not much different than that which held the woman 's attention .
Some twenty minutes after scheduled departure and still at the gate , a waitre … sorry , stewardess / air hostess / cabin crew member asked the man in 32 F if he would change seats .
He seemed happy at first until he was directed to 32A .
They then asked the 40 - something Chavette if she ’d please move to 32 F .
Why is BA making them play musical chairs ?
" The children are flying unaccompanied and it ’s company policy not to seat them next to men . "
The man did n’t care too much .
The woman said , " I ’m not bloody child - friendly , " but moved nevertheless .
I , unable to help myself , asked what the hell sort of blatantly and accusatorily sexist company policy that was supposed to be .
" It ’s not sexist sir , it ’s just company policy . "
I could n’t help wondering if she ’d previously worked for Boetha ’s Ministry of Information .
" it 's not racism , it ’s just country policy . "
" It ’s not sexist ? " I asked .
" You ’re insinuating that be deint of the fact that he ’s male , he ’s unsuitable to sit next to children in an open aircraft .
This is n’t some private room , it ’s a well - lit airplane in which everyone is in full view . "
" It ’s our policy , sir . "
That sounded so much better in the original German .
The man sat down and mentioned to me that he ’s not traveling alone .
Over 60 himself , his wife is sitting 18 rows forward because BA could n’t or would n’t sit them together .
Now here ’s where they could ’ve been smart .
Or clever .
Or at least tactful .
They could have asked the woman sitting next to this man ’s wife to move in back next to the kids so that this man could sit with his wife .
That would ’ve been subtle .
But BA does n’t give a damn .
They ’re quite happy to be overtly discriminatory and play along with the insanity that any man is a potential pederast .
Another waitre … sorry , I keep doing that , passenger safety supervisory assistant … backed up the first one and threw in that the parents had asked for that .
I call shenannigans .
I ca n’t think of any parent in the world who would , out of the blue , specifically ask that their kids not be sat next to a male .
Worse , I ca n’t understand why any company in the world would accept such intolerable demands from customers and play along with – much less promote -- such baseless fears .
Not five minutes later , the head wai… ah , to hell with it , waitress came over to me and uttered the magic question , " Is there a problem ? "
" Yes , " I replied , " There is indeed a problem .
By virtue of his sex alone you 've demanded that this man relinquish his seat and you 've forced that woman to sit next to the kids . "
" It 's airline policy , " she interrupted .
" You do n't know if that man won a humanitarian award or if that woman was just released from prison for child endangerment . "
The pink lady looked up .
" Nothing personal , just hypothetically speaking here .
My point is that solely because he possesses testicles you 're assuming that not only is he a child molester but that he'd also be dumb enough to do something on the plane in full view of passengers and crew . "
" Sir , if you do n't wish to be on the flight you can depart the plane . "
" And how would I get to Edinburgh ? "
" That 's not my concern .
My concern is the safety of the passengers . "
" It ca n't be because you have no idea whether that woman could pose a risk to the children .
You 're assuming that because she has no testicles she presents no danger despite the fact that subtle killings such as poisonings are inevitably done by women .
Your supposed policy is outrageous . "
" Sir , I do n't have time to discuss this .
Would you like to leave the plane ? "
And that was that .
Either shut up or lose my flight .
There has never been a conviction on any charge of molestation in an airplane .
There have been accusations , most famously an Indian on Northwest Airlines back in 2001 .
You have to search hard to find the mention of his acquittal .
Not one of the cases was dropped due to a technicality ; in each instance there was not only no evidence , what testinmony was given was found to be unbelievable , and in parts , impossible .
So I did the only thing I could do .
As soon as we were " free to move about the cabin " I grabbed my laptop and wrote this story in Word , expanding the window to fill the wide - screen LCD monitor and making the headline very large .
Every waitress saw it and they were concerned enough about it to get the head waitress who was working up front to come to the back .
Alas , there were no cops waiting for me in Edinburgh when we disembarked .
I was able to get the rental car and after 10 minutes of pissing around in the carpark , I finally found the well - hidden exit .
On the way back to Germany I was pulled aside both in Edinburg and again in London for an extra-super - special " security " check .
Big surprise , that .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 20 — President Bush , bracing for a series of battles with Congress over spending , threatened today to veto a bill expanding a popular children ’s health insurance program , calling it “ a step toward federalization of health care . ”
The program expires Sept. 30 , and Congress is on the verge of renewing it by providing coverage to an additional 4 million children over the 6.6 million already enrolled — at an additional cost of $ 35 billion over five years .
Mr. Bush says the bill would expand a program aimed at helping the poor beyond its original intent .
The veto threat is just one of nearly a dozen the White House has issued recently aimed at a variety of bills including measures on education spending and money for medical research .
With the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 , Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats are headed for a showdown over spending similar to the one that preceded the government shutdown of 1995 .
On Capitol Hill , lawmakers have yet to complete action on any of their 12 major spending bills .
But even if they do , Mr. Bush will not sign them ; he has issued veto threats on 10 of the 11 appropriations measures passed so far by the House .
Specifically , the five - year mandatory minimum threshold quantity for crack cocaine offenses should be adjusted from the current 5 grams trigger to at least 25 grams and the current ten - year threshold quantity from 50 grams to at least 250 grams ( and repeal the mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack cocaine .
The racially disparate effect of the crack penalties is clear :
The overwhelming majority of offenders subject to the heightened crack cocaine penalties are black , about 85 percent in 2000 .
The Sentencing Commission 's 2007 report on the crack penalties is here .
Even Joe Biden agrees the planned reduction does n't go far enough .
In June , 2007 , he called for the elimination of all disparity between coke and powder cocaine .
The current sentencing disparity between the two forms of cocaine is based on false notions and old logic .
The bottom line is that there is no scientific justification for any disparity .
Crack and powder are simply two forms of the same drug , and each form produces identical effects .
I will soon be introducing legislation that eliminates the sentencing disparity completely , fixing this injustice once and for all .
I look forward to working with Senator Hatch and others – Republicans and Democrats – and urge them to support righting this wrong . ”
That 's probably not going to happen anytime soon .
The least we can do is make the change that will happen retroactive .
FAMM says the Commission is accepting letters from everyone on the retroactive issue .
The time to write is now .
Here are some more interesting statistics on crack and powder from the Sentencing Project ( pdf ) :

After receiving over 50,000 views in a few hours and on its way to shoot to the top of the most viewed chart , You Tube brazenly pulled a popular video from their rankings system Friday in an act of wanton censorship .
“ Question Your Reality , ” a stirring and well put together video montage featuring talk show host Alex Jones was rocketing up the charts , already having reached number 2 most viewed on News and Politics and soaring up the general most discussed and most viewed categories .
A moment later , it was nowhere to be seen as You Tube cleared the slate and prevented the clip from going completely viral .
You Tube is owned by Google , who have pulled this trick many times before , but by spreading the video far and wide you can help offset their censorship and wake people up .

Considering the brilliant work that has been done along the US - Mexico border , including the high tech “ virtual fence ” that the great minds of Boeing have sold to taxpayers , despite no sign of its ability to track much beyond stray cows , coyotes and perhaps a few dogs , why does anyone think the US ought to spend any more money in Iraq to build some kind of a fence to stop Iranians ?
Heck , they ca n’t even manage to cover 10 % of the US - Mexico border despite it being right there in the US so how in the world could such a project even be completed in Iraq ?
How much more money does Bush want to throw at the problems that he creates ?
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is lending border patrol and customs officers to help , and some former officers are working here under private contracts .
“ This is a lot tougher than the Mexican border , ” said Army Col .
Mark Mueller , who is in charge of U.S. forces advising Iraq ’s Department of Border Enforcement and the Iraqi army in this region .
“ There are leftover mines and munitions everywhere . ”
I ’m not sure which statement here provides even less confidence between Homeland Security being involved or this project being more difficult than the US - Mexico border .
This team is unable to take on any task , big or small , without screwing it up completely .
The American middle class is not a bottomless pit of funds for Republican experiments that are always massively expensive failures .

type Env = [ ( FuncNo , Label ) ] ... cgFun ( Func f ) n = do e
To call a function we look up its label and generate a call instruction to that label .
Then we pop off the arguments that we pushed before the call , and finally we push EAX ( where the return value is ) .
Simple , huh ?
But where did the environment come from ?
Well , it 's time to be a little inventive and introduce a monad .
Functions are represented by unique integers in the expression type , so we 'll need a state monad to generate them .
module Gen where import Control .
Monad .
State import Harpy .CodeGenMonad import Exp import MExp import CodeGen data GenState = GenState { funcs :: [( FuncNo , CGen ( ) ) ] , nextFunc :: Int } startGenState :: GenState startGenState = GenState { funcs = [ ] , nextFunc = 0 } type G a = State GenState a fun :: MInt2MInt -> G MInt2MInt fun f = do s M $ App ( Func fno ) [ unM x ] runG :: G MInt2MInt -> CGen ( ) runG g = do let ( ret , s ) = runState g startGenState funs = reverse $ funcs s funMap do l l @@ g ) funMap funs
This code actually has some interesting points .
First , the monad , G , keeps a list of defined functions .
The list has the function number and the CodeGen block that will generate code for it .
Second , the fun function is the one that creates a new function number .
It also calls compileFun to get a CodeGen block that will generate code for the function .
Note that no code is generated at this point .
The G monad is just a simple state monad , not the IO based codeGen monad .
Also note how fun returns an expression that is of the same type as the argument , but it now uses an App to call the function .
Finally , the runG function generates all the code .
It uses runState to obtain the list of defined function and the result to return .
Now code generation starts .
For each function we generate a new label .
Pairing up the function number and the label forms our environment , funMap .
With this environment installed we start code generation for the functions , first the return value , then all the defined function ; each with its label attached .
Well , that 's it .
Let 's wrap it all up .
module Compile ( compileIO , disasmIO , module M , module Gen ) where import Convert import Gen import M type MInt = M Int compileIO :: G ( MInt -> MInt ) -> IO ( Int -> Int ) compileIO f = fmap flex $ compileIOW32 f where flex g = fromIntegral . g . fromIntegral compileIOW32 :: G ( MInt -> MInt ) -> IO ( Word32 -> Word32 ) compileIOW32 = conv_Word32ToWord32 [ ] undefined .
runG disasmIO :: G ( MInt -> MInt ) -> IO String disasmIO = disasm [ ] undefined .
runG
And , of course , a test .
Here we hit a snag .
We want recursion , but monadic bindings ( do ) are not recursive .
Luckily , ghc does implement recursive do called mdo ( why that name , I have no idea ) for any monad that is in the class Monad Fix .
And the state monad is , so we are in luck .
{-# OPTIONS_GHC - fglasgow - exts #-} module Main where import Compile main = do let g = mdo fib cond ( n .< 2 ) 1 ( fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) ) return $ fib test
It even runs and produces the right answer , 165580141 .
Running time for this example is about 4.0s on my machine .
Running fib compiled with ' ghc - O ' takes about 3.4s , so we 're in the same ballpark .
Oh , and if anyone wonders what the code looks like for this example , here it is .
This is really , really bad code .

After a slight detour into expression representation I 'm back to generating code again .
To recap , here 's how I 'm going to do my embedded expressions in Haskell .
For now I 'll stick to ugly looking boolean operators .
Fixing that is a whole other story .
So thetype is the internal representation of expressions .
It 's just constants , variables , and some primitive operations .
The ( for machine ) type is the phantom type that the DSL user will see .
The modulecontains all the user visible functions .
Note that it handles booleans by represented the C way , by an int that is 0 or 1 .
There 's a conditional function , , and a corresponding primitive that will serve as our .
So now we need to generate code for these .
This is all very similar to what I did in a previous posting , I have just refactored some of the code generation .
The invariant ( that I arbitrarily decided on ) is that each block of code that implements a primitive operation will may clobber EAX but must leave all other registers intact .
This is mostly just a chunk of rather boring code .
Division is causing problems as usual , since the IA32 instructions do n't allow you to specify a destination register .
One point worth a look is the code generation for .
It has to test a boolean and then select one of two code blocks , but that is just what you 'd expect .
Given all this , we can generate code for a function and call it from Haskell code .
But that 's rather boring since we have only primitive functions and no way to call DSL functions from within the DSL .
So we have no recursion .
And as we all know , recursion is where the fun starts .
So we need to add expressions and code generation for calling functions .
First we extend themodule .
The idea being that our DSL functions will be represented by awhich is an .
Next , we will extend the code generation .
While generating code we will keep an environment that maps function numbers to the corresponding labels to call .
Oh , Alabama .
What has been done to thee ?
The U.S. Supreme Court refused Monday to have anything to do with the infamous Williams v. Alabama case , which has been wending its way through the court system for nine years .
In that case , adult retailer Sherri Williams challenged the constitutionality of a state law banning the sale and distribution of any device intended for the purpose of stimulating the human genitals .
This week a federal judge is expected to lift the injunction that has prevented the law from being enforced since 1998 .
The law was originally intended to shut down certain adult establishments , like strip clubs , so that children would n't have to walk past them on the way to malt shops and sock hops .
The sex - toy thing got thrown in so minors would n't be exposed to adult retail shops either , and that 's the part that got national attention .
No one outside the local community cares if a strip club gets shut down ; start telling women they can't buy vibrators , and the angry murmurs begin .
The law has to specify human genitals , by the way , in order not to infringe on the semen extraction business among breeders of livestock and performance animals .
Otherwise , those stallions and bulls will be pretty damn upset when cold and unfriendly plastic tubes replace their warm , soft collection devices .
Considering that a pissed - off stallion can take a grizzly bear , I can see why lawmakers did n't put horsemen in that kind of position .
It 's easy to scoff .
We can roll our eyes at those weird Southern states and joke that you can marry your teenage sister but not buy a Fleshlight to tide you over until she gets older .
But in all the laughter , we risk missing the implications , such as : 1 ) Women are too fragile to be trusted in retail stores that sell products designed to promote sexual response and pleasure .
2 ) Parents are not to be trusted to keep their underage kids out of such stores .
3 ) Business owners cannot be relied upon to follow the rules about covering up windows to prevent passersby from seeing anything that might offend them .
If that 's not the message of this law , what is ?
The law does not prohibit sales of erection drugs or condoms .
A man can buy Viagra and have safer sex , but a woman can't buy a dildo .
If she wants penetration , she has to go find a man , which severely limits her options if she does n't have one handy ; if she 's lesbian ; or if she 's playing in virtual worlds , chatting on a webcam or watching online porn as part of an enjoyable solo experience .
I suppose she could head to Home Depot and buy brooms , axes or hammers with handles that are about the right size and shape .
Or she could pick up an extra cucumber at the market .
But if she wants a purple one that vibrates and has a cute little otter face , or one that pulses in time to her music playlist or one that her military husband can control from overseas , she 's out of luck if she wants to shop locally .
The sad thing is that this ridiculous law has spawned such a waste of time and money .
Nine years ago , when Alabama retailer Sherri Williams started the fight against the then - new law , the ban would have had a significant impact on consumers .
Online adult retailing was in its infancy , barring a few pioneers like Joel Tucker who started his kink catalog JT's Stockroom by e-mail in the late 1980s .
Shoppers back then were skeptical about giving out credit - card numbers , much less giving their real names to sex-related stores .
Web designers had barely outgrown the blink tag , for chrissakes , despite Webmonkey 's best efforts .
Now the competition online is so hot , adult retailers are going back to brick - and - mortar and setting themselves as community hubs , event venues and education centers in order to stay competitive and turn a profit .
Just about any adult in the country can order marital aids online at a pretty good price , even if they live in Alabama .
The law only forbids the sale , distribution or marketing of intimate devices within the state , not their possession or use .
It also does n't prevent citizens from bringing personal souvenirs in from across state lines .
That means Alabamans still have plenty of resources available to them for sex education and pleasure – like any New Yorker or Californian , they can visit good online retailers for a wealth of helpful articles and contact highly educated staff experts by e-mail or phone .
But it 's a shame that under the guise of Protecting The Children , Alabama residents can't stop by a nice , clean , intimate store after church and try out the merchandize on their hands , check it for intensity and noise , texture and emotional appeal .
That they can't talk in person with an educated staff member about what would work best with their particular preferences and sensitivities .
That the government has claimed some ownership over women 's sexual pleasure , their clitorises and their children .
But I hold out hope that the law wo n't shut down all the retail stores or home parties , even though it changes what 's in stock .
It sounds to me like you can still sell goodies like Blackberries , floggers , prostate massagers , iPods , handcuffs , laptops capable of running virtual environments , Liberator furniture and life - size posters of Viggo Mortensen .
None of these are designed specifically to stimulate the human genitals yet they all have the potential to do so , by way of the brain .
Laws like this cannot stand much longer .
It 's a sign that America 's war on sex is not over , but it 's a weak and ineffective sally .
It will not withstand the tide of female sexual empowerment happening online .
( And male empowerment too , as we bring you right along with us .
You 're welcome . )
Women are communicating and bonding online , demanding and developing new sex - tech designs that work with female sexual response .
We 're also normalizing the whole concept of bringing technology into sex play .
In 10 or 20 years , this law will seem as odd as the one about not playing dominoes on Sundays .
Williams says she will challenge the law again , this time as a First Amendment issue rather than a right - to - privacy issue .
In the meantime , I 'll bet you a Bluetooth - enabled vibrating bullet that Alabama 's local drugstores will start to stock more back massagers .
See you in a fortnight ,

How To Make a Speaker
A homemade speaker using a plastic cup , business card , wire , magnet and some Lego blocks .
I built this speaker from scratch ; I was surprised of the quality of the sound .
Updated !
( 6/14/2007 )
I does n't look like a high - tech speaker but it works well .
I did n't expect a high quality of the sound from this made - from - scratch speaker but it performs very well , better than I expected .
A speaker is just a magnet , a coil , frame and a cone or any material that can make the air vibrate .
Here is the bill of materials that I used to build this speaker :
1 Magnet ( neodymium magnet works great )
1 Business card
Wire 32 or 34 AWG ( you may use 30AWG )
Paper bond
Tape
Glue
Scissors
Ballpoint pen
Lego bricks or wood .
Ruler .
Cut two long pieces of paper vertically , half inch wide .
( 0.5 inches by 11 inches ) .
Roll one strip of paper over the magnet .
Use some tape to keep it but DO NOT put tape on the magnet .
The Cylinder needs to be removed from the magnet , so do not tape the paper to the magnet .
Roll the second strip of paper over the first one .
Do not glue or tape each one with the other .
Roll it individually .
Use tape to keep the paper as cylinder .
Using the ballpoint pen , Draw three lines on each side of the business card .
There is no exact measure but try to draw the lines at least half inch away from the corners ( 0.5 inches )
Fold the business card using the lines as reference .
The lines will help to fold it .
Remove the magnet and glue the paper cylinders at the center of the business card .
Using instant glue or hot glue works ok .
Once the glue is dry , put the magnet back inside the cylinder and start making the coil .
I do not recommend to use wire AWG 30 as it needs a lot of loops .
Using AWG 32 or 34 will need about 40 to 50 loops .
After you finish winding the wire , use some tape to secure it .
Do not try to make the coil without attaching it to the business card , it is an almost impossible task .
Make the frame approximately the size of the business card and not higher than one inch .
I used Lego bricks because I had some handy .
Wood may work better .
Try not to use any metal that can be attracted by the magnet .
Put some glue on the magnet when it is inside the cylinder .
On this step , Hot glue works better than instant glue .
Be sure the glue does n't touch the paper cylinder .
Assemble the speaker and let the magnet to fall and glue itself to the frame .
It will allow to have the magnet exactly on the center of the coil .
Wait until the glue dry .
Once the glue that attach the magnet to the frame is dry , remove the business card and the coil .
Try not to disturb any piece on the frame or the business card .
Now , remove the inner cylinder .
Is ok to break it as it will discarded .
Try not to damage the secondary roll [ or paper cylinder ] .
The last step is to put back the coil to the frame .
The coil should not touch the magnet and should move freely .
I did connect my home - made speaker to my laptop and here is how it sounds like :
I did a modification to my homemade speaker and it improved the volume of the sound .
A simple disposable [ plastic ] cup amplifies the sound mechanically .
The sound is amplified because the resonance of the plastic cup .
Once the " Speaker " is assembled , cut a hole on the business card .
( see next photo )
Glue the coil to the bottom of the cup instead of the business card .
Glue the plastic cup to the business card and that 's it !
Now it looks like a real speaker , a home - made speaker , just built from scratch .
How it works ?
The coil generates a magnetic field when electricity is applied to it .
The magnet attracts or repels the coil and makes it to move .
The vibration generates the sound that we hear thanks to the air .
Most of today speakers have a resistance of 8 ohms .
This homemade speaker may have less than 8 ohms and may not be able to make loud sounds but basically it shows exactly how it works .
I will work on another design to find which one works better .
I will work to make an easy and better design ...
Using different materials , may cause the sound to change , even to make it louder .
... someday .
That day was August 6 , 2007 .
I created a Hi-fidelity Homemade speaker .
Check it out !
The wires should move freely .
The cards should be completely glued to the cup .
The coil have no loose wires .
Try to keep the coil tight enough and secure it with glue or tape .
Loose wire may vibrate and cause distortion .
The coil should not touch the magnet .
Try to make the coil wider .
Also , the coil should not touch the LEGOs .
Be sure the coil have at least 50 turns or , if you have a multi-meter , more than 7 ohms .
Adjust the height of the coil in reference to the magnet .
Use only neodymium magnets .

1. Thug Behram
Estimated Body Count : 931
The Story : Between 1790 and 1830 , Behram was the leader of India 's infamous Thugee Cult .
The death toll attributed to this cult varies from 50,000 to 2,000,000 people .
They were an organization of thieves who would befriend travelers before robbing and killing them .
Cult members believed that every person they killed prevented the coming of the goddess Kali for another millennium .
As the leader of the gang , Thug Behram confessed his involvement in the 900 + murders , and admitted to personally strangling at least 125 people .
Capture : The British Government finally created policies against the Thugee Cult in the 1830s .
The government recruited spies from the inside , who would eventually lead to the cult 's downfall in the 1870s .
Punishment : Thug Behram was never tried for his action , as he became an informer for the government after his capture .

BUSHES THANKFUL FOR STUPID VOTERS
By Bill Gallagher
DETROIT --
Making money from government service and war , and lining the pockets of family and friends is a sacred creed in the Bush family .
The Corleone family in " The Godfather " showed more restraint and was less inclined toward violence than the greedy gangsters the Bush crime family unleashed on the world .
Using public office and influence to make millions is so ingrained in the Bushevik regime that they do n't even think twice when they raid the public treasury to take care of themselves .
Vice President Dick Cheney cashed in on his stint as secretary of defense to rake in millions in government contracts as CEO of Halliburton .
The no bid , cost - plus contracts Halliburton subsequently landed in Iraq are just good business deals , expected spoils for imperial lords .
The fact that Cheney was still getting residual payments from the company should in no way be considered a conflict .
As the Bushes gather this week , they have much to be thankful for .
Their family business thrives and their wealth grows as the rest of the nation worries about having a job , making mortgage payments , having health insurance and paying for college tuition -- concerns unknown and unfelt among the well - stuffed Bush brood .
Neil Bush , the president 's brother , is cashing in on the No Child Left Behind Act .
Neil , you 'll recall , escaped indictment for his role in the collapse of the Silverado Savings and Loan .
The taxpayers picked up the tab for his malfeasance .
Failure in business means nothing when all you have to do is shake down your daddy 's pals for your next entrepreneurial experiment .
Neil 's company Ignite !
Learning is doing quite well .
With his parents and their Saudi pals bankrolling the venture , Neil has been winning contracts all over the country from school districts anxious to buy his software products .
Over the last three years , Ignite ! has brought in $ 20 million , charging $ 30 a student for its signature product , Curriculum on Wheels , known as COW .
But Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) is wondering whether Bush 's family ties , not the quality of the software , may have something to do with the company 's success .
Under pressure from CREW , the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Education has agreed to investigate whether federal money is " appropriately being spent . "
CREW is arguing that the Ignite !
product does not meet the legal requirements detailed in the No Child Left Behind legislation .
But education spending is just chump change for the Busheviks .
They know the real money is in war .
The more war , the more money they make .
Perhaps the most ignominious legacy -- and there are many rivals -- of the Bush era will be the privatization of war and the profiteering that resulted .
Congress ' Joint Economic
Committee now estimates the true cost of Bush 's wars will amount to a staggering $ 3.5 trillion when all the hidden costs are realized .
That includes the costs of treating wounded veterans and the war 's impact on soaring oil prices .
The simple way to end the madness is for the Democrats in the Senate and House to insist that the war be financed on a pay - as - you - go basis .
No more war on the national credit card .
Insist that tax revenues pay for military expenditures .
What fiscally responsible lawmaker could oppose the proposal ?
Do n't saddle our children with unconscionable debt .
If you support the war , then pay for it .
Of course , the Democrats do n't have the nerve to play that card , and the Republicans do n't care about controlling government spending unless it 's for health care .
Blackwater Worldwide , the evangelical Christian - run mercenary company , is the poster child for the gold - lined war firms making fortunes through debt - financed government contracts .
Even after the Nisour Square massacre , where Blackwater Hessians gunned down unarmed Iraqi civilians on Sept. 16 in Baghdad , the company has lost none of its clout with the Bush administration .
The Wall Street Journal reports Blackwater is on the short list of contractors in the running to grab a $ 15 billion contract to wage war on the narcotics trade the Bush administration claims funnels money to fund terrorism .
Blackwater owner Erik Prince has been a major contributor to Bush and other Republican campaign causes .
Prince 's sister Betsy is married to Dick DeVos , the billionaire Amway heir and Republican kingpin .
The Journal reports the company " maintains that its ability to win additional government business has n't been affected by scrutiny from Congress , the State Department and Justice Department .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said , ' Customers have confidence in our ability to perform in a capable professional manner . ' "
Of course the " customers " are George W. Bush , Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Just as the new gravy train for Blackwater was revealed , The New York Times reported an FBI investigation concluded that at least 14 of the shootings in Nisour Square " were unjustified and violated deadly force rules in effect for security contractors in Iraq , according to civilian and military officials briefed in the case . "
But do n't expect any of the Blackwater killers to face justice , in spite of evidence " that the company 's employees recklessly used deadly force . "
L. Paul Bremer , Bush 's former viceroy in Iraq , gave blanket immunity to Blackwater and other contractors .
Blackwater thugs guarded Bremer during his disastrous watch and still provide security services for State Department personnel in Iraq .
The State Department 's inspector general was supposed to be investigating Blackwater 's penchant for bloodshed , but that probe is now entangled in the Buzzy and Cookie affair .
Howard " Cookie " Krongard is the State Department 's inspector general .
His brother Alvin " Buzzy " Krongard is a former executive director -- the No. 3 post at the CIA -- and until last Friday a paid member of Blackwater 's advisory board .
Howard Krongard at first flatly denied his brother 's business relationship when Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , questioned him about it at a hearing last week .
Indignantly claiming his brother had no links with Blackwater , Krongard insisted to Waxman that " when these ugly rumors started recently , I specifically asked him .
I do n't believe it is true that he is a member of the advisory board . "
There was a break in the hearing when Kronberg phoned his older brother .
He came back looking like a kid caught -- I can't resist -- with his hand in the cookie jar .
" I want to state on the record right now , " Kronberg told Waxman , " that I hereby recuse myself from any matters having to do with Blackwater . "
Buzzy Kronberg was , indeed , on the Blackwater advisory board but he abruptly resigned , apparently in an attempt to defuse the controversy .
Buzzy admitted to The New York Times that he helped Blackwater gets its first big contract from the CIA for guards sent to Afghanistan in 2002 .
Friends say Buzzy and Cookie have long been estranged .
Buzzy says he told Cookie he was joining Blackwater 's advisory board , and Cookie told him that was not a good idea .
Cookie testified no such discussion ever occurred .
Henry Waxman will help the Kronberg boys try to get their stories straight under oath .
For Buzzy , the Cheney family , Erik Prince and all the Bushes , war has brought them a good life
They have much money to be thankful for this week , and they 'll repeat a phase that has profound meaning for them : " Please pass the gravy . "
Unix / Linux環境でのsudoは一度使うと手放せないツールだ。rootのパスワードを知る必要もなく、必要な時に管理者権限でプログラムを動作させられる。
WindowsにはRunAs（別なユーザとして実行）という機能があるが、これは「su」に相当する。つまり管理者のパスワードを知っておく必要がある。これに対してsudoに相当するのがこのソフトウェアだ。
今回紹介するオープンソース・ソフトウェアはsuDown、Windows XP向けのsudoソフトウェアだ。
suDownは場合によってはマルウェアとして認識されることがあるようなので、その点自己責任で利用をお願いしたい。
suDownをインストールすると、プログラムを右クリックした際に「# sudo ○○」と表示されるようになる。これを実行すると、自分のパスワードを入力するダイアログが表示される。
パスワードを入力して、問題がなければ管理者権限で実行されるようだ。なお、筆者環境下ではエラーが出てしまった。特徴的なのは、ユーザのプロファイルを切り替えない点にある。また、しばらくの間はパスワードがキャッシュされるので（まさにsudoのようだ）、いちいち入力する必要がないのも便利だ。
Windowsインストーラ形式（MSI）の場合、RunAsが表示されず、ExplorerをRunAsで実行してインストールする、なんてことを昔やっていたが、suDownの場合はそうした手間なく使えるようだ。エラーが解決すれば、ユーザを通常ユーザ権限にして利用するのも簡単になりそうだ。
なお、インストールすると「 sudoers 」「sudoed」というグループが追加される。セキュリティ面にご注意の上、利用していただきたい。

The chronic stress that spouses and children develop while caring for Alzheimer 's disease patients may shorten the caregivers ' lives by as much as four to eight years , a new study suggests .
The research also provides concrete evidence that the effects of chronic stress can be seen both at the genetic and molecular level in chronic caregivers ' bodies .
The findings , reported this month by researchers from Ohio State University and the federal National Institute of Aging , were published in the Journal of Immunology .
These are the latest results from a nearly three - decade - long program at Ohio State investigating the links between psychological stress and a weakened immune status .
Previous studies have examined medical students , newlyweds , divorced spouses , widows , widowers and long - married couples , in each case , looking for physiological effects caused by psychological stress .
In their recent study , Ronald Glaser , a professor of molecular virology , immunology and medical genetics , and Jan Kiecolt - Glaser , a professor of psychology and psychiatry , teamed with Nan-ping Weng and his research group from the National Institute of Aging .
Earlier work by other researchers had shown that mothers caring for chronically ill children developed changes in their chromosomes that effectively amounted to several years of additional aging among those caregivers .
That work , remarkable as it was , looked only at a broad community of immune cells without identifying the specific immune components responsible for the changes .
The Ohio State - NIA team wanted to identify the exact cells involved in the changes , as well as the mechanisms that caused them .
They focused on telomeres , areas of genetic material on the ends of a cell 's chromosomes .
Over time , as a cell divides , those telomeres shorten , losing genetic instructions .
An enzyme – telomerase – normally works to repair that damage to the chromosome , Glaser said .
“ Telomeres are like caps on the chromosome , ” said Glaser , head of Ohio State 's Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research .
“ Think of it as a frayed rope – if the caps were n't there , the rope would unravel .
The telomeres insulate and protect the ends of the chromosomes .
“ As we get older , the telomeres shorten and the activity of the telomerase enzyme lessens , ” he said .
“ It 's part of the aging process . ”
For the study , the researchers turned to a population of Alzheimer 's disease caregivers they had worked with before , and compared them with an equal number of non-caregivers matched for age , gender and other aspects .
They analyzed blood samples from each group , looking for differences in both the telomeres and the enzyme , as well as populations of immune cells .
“ Caregivers showed the same kind of patterns present in the study of mothers of chronically ill kids , ” Glaser said , adding that the changes the Ohio State / NIA team saw amounted to a shortened lifespan of four to eight years .
“ We believe that the changes in these immune cells represent the whole cell population in the body , suggesting that all the body 's cells have aged that same amount . ”
The caregivers also differed dramatically with the control group on psychological surveys intended to measure depression , a clear cause of stress .
“ Those symptoms of depression in caregivers were twice as severe as those apparent among the control group , ” Kiecolt - Glaser said .
“ Caregivers also had fewer lymphocytes , ” Glaser said , “ a very important component of the immune system .
They also showed a higher level of cytokines , molecules key to the inflammation response , than did the control group . ”
Other experiments showed that the actual telomeres in blood cells of caregivers were shorter than those of the controls , and that the level of the telomerase repair enzyme among caregivers was also lower .
Kiecolt - Glaser said that there is ample epidemiological data showing that stressed caregivers die sooner than people not in that role .
“ Now we have a good biological reason for why this is the case , ” she said .
“ We now have a mechanistic progression that shows why , in fact , stress is bad for you , how it gets into the body and how it gets translated into a bad biological outcome . ”
Much of the Ohio State work is now shifting to studies on how to intervene with that stress in hopes of slowing the weakening of the immune system in highly stressed people .

This was once the 4th largest steel mill in the world .
The Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna ( Buffalo ) sits on a sprawling 1,300 acre site and was home to over 100 buildings and employed 20,000 workers .
In the 1960s , it was producing record amounts of steel at a time of great profitability .
This period was short - lived .
During the late 1970s , production was reduced and over 10,000 employees were laid off .
Steelmaking operations were stopped abruptly in 1983 after a record loss of $ 1.5 billion .
Coke oven operations continued but by 2001 , they too were halted .
Blackberry 's makers deny that its system is not secure
Workers in the French president 's and prime minister 's office have been told their e-mails risk falling into foreign hands , Le Monde newspaper reports .
France 's SGDN security service is worried because Blackberries use US - and UK - based servers , the paper says .
But some officials are flouting the ban and using them in secret , it adds .
" They tried to offer us something else to replace our Blackberries but it does n't work , " one unnamed official told the paper .
' Secure solution '
More than seven million people around the world now use the Blackberry , which is made by Canadian firm Research In Motion ( RIM ) .
A member of France 's governing UMP party in the National Assembly , Jacques Myard , said French politicians needed to be aware that Blackberries were not secure devices .
" It 's very good to say ' be careful ' , because we do n't live in an ordinary world in which you can talk on your mobile or private line without any warning , without caution , " he told the BBC's World Today programme .
RIM responded to the allegations by saying that Blackberry 's encryption system was " the most secure wireless data solution available " , pointing out that it had been approved for the transmission of sensitive data by the UK government and by Nato .
The US , Australia , New Zealand , Austria and Canada had also given the system their accreditation , the company added .
RIM said the US National Security Agency did not have the ability to view the content of any data communication sent through Blackberry servers .
" RIM continues to be committed to working with and supporting the needs of both corporate and government customers within France , including protecting data from attack and unauthorised access , " it added .

What makes some JavaScript Evil , and can beginners learn to write Good JavaScript code from day one ?
Cameron Adams and I have set out to write a book that proves that they can , but it ’s not proving to be as easy as I ’d hoped .
Bad JavaScript is worse than no JavaScript at all , because it can prevent some users from accessing your site .
There are at least three groups of people that you should at least think about when adding JavaScript to the mix , and I ’ve listed them here in order of increasing difficulty :
users that do n’t have JavaScript - enabled browsers users that browse without using a mouse users that browse using a screen reader
Perhaps a little idealistically , I ’d consider any JavaScript code that prevents one of these groups of people from accessing your site to be Evil .
At last week ’s meeting of the Web Standards Group in Melbourne , James Edwards ( coincidentally , Cameron Adams ’s co-author on The JavaScript Anthology ) summed it up very neatly :
“ One person ’s preference is another person ’s real need .
It may be that a group of users finds it easier with Ajax , but if another group of users finds it completely impossible then you ’re cutting people out , and you ’re doing it for basically nothing .
“ I think of it as a hierarchy , basically , where accessibility is the most important thing , and usability comes next , and preference and design and aesthetics comes next .
All of those things are important , but if one affects the other then you have to think which is the most important .
“ And to my mind , accessibility is always the most important , because accessibility impacts on what people really need .
Everything else is just preference . ”
James finished his talk with an appeal to Ajax - happy developers to avoid using Ajax if at all possible unless you can do it without impacting on the accessibility of your site .
James was speaking specifically about Ajax , but the same argument can be made about JavaScript in general .
So the question becomes , can we reasonably expect JavaScript beginners to write code that does n’t degrade accessibility ?
I mentioned above the three user groups that present increasing challenges to developers looking to enhance their sites with JavaScript without giving up accessibility .
I want to briefly cover the specific difficulties of supporting these groups , and consider whether beginners should be expected to deal with them :
Users that do n’t have JavaScript - enabled browsers
If you build a site that relies on JavaScript to provide access to certain features , or even for fundamental navigation features , you are effectively shutting out a large number of users that , for one reason or another , do not have a JavaScript - enabled browser .
Thankfully , the way to tackle this issue is relatively straightforward , and is primarily a matter of approach .
If you start by building a site that works without JavaScript , and then apply enhancements using JavaScript , then the problem is solved .
We can definitely teach beginners to think of JavaScript this way , and indeed that ’s what the first chapter of our book is all about .
Users that browse without using a mouse
Due to a wide range of impairments , particularly those that affect fine motor control , certain users are unable to use a mouse when browsing the web .
Instead , they use the keyboard navigation features of browsers to get around on the Web .
In most cases , keyboard navigation is no more complicated to implement than mouse navigation .
All it takes is a little thought , and some extra code to handle this alternative method of interaction .
For example , you need to make sure users can reach every “ active ” element on the page with keyboard focus ( typically with the Tab key ) , and take equivalent actions once there .
Supporting keyboard interaction as a first class citizen is something that you can teach beginners from the moment they begin writing interactive JavaScript .
Users that browse using a screen reader
Here ’s where things get tricky .
Currently , the best available web browsing experience for many visually impaired users is screen reader software .
A screen reader sits on top of a desktop web browser , reads the page aloud , and provides additional ways to navigate within the content and to accomplish tasks like filling out forms .
Unfortunately , there are no accepted standards for how this software interprets the content of the page , and consequently compatibility with younger web technologies like CSS and JavaScript varies greatly from vendor to vendor .
That said , there are some limitations that are pretty much universal .
Two of these are particularly relevant to JavaScript development : Screen readers do not read content that is hidden by setting the CSS display property to none .
Screen readers operate on a static snapshot of the page , which is occasionally refreshed in a process that can neither be initiated or detected by the developer .
Writing scripts that operate under these conditions without interfering with the user ’s ability to understand the content and use the features of the site can be extremely challenging , if not impossible in some cases .
So what do we teach beginners about this issue , and how well can we expect their scripts to work with screen readers ?
At one extreme , we can adopt the attitude that users can always switch off JavaScript if it does n’t work well for them , and simply write scripts that work for sighted users .
At the other end of the spectrum , we can take James Edwards ’s plea to heart and avoid using JavaScript altogether in order to maximize accessibility .
The approach to encourage in beginners , I believe , is somewhere in between .
Make them aware of the issue , demonstrate some easy ways that you can cater for screen reader users in your scripts ( e.g. by using offleft / offscreen positioning to hide elements instead of display : none ) , and enable them to make informed decisions about the accessibility of their own scripts .
So , that ’s the approach we ’re taking with JavaScript and accessibility in our book .
Will every example work perfectly in all screen readers ?
Almost certainly not .
But keyboard users will be catered for , and we ’ll provide an easily - accessed alternative for screen readers whenever it makes sense to .
And you ’ll pardon us for taking a little pride in writing the only beginner ’s JavaScript book that gives accessibility its due from the very first page .
Overdue PSU Grad Students Challenge Intelligent Design
Last year , Portland State University graduate student Barbara Shaw was in Powell 's , browsing the science section , when she saw something odd .
" I noticed that there were a lot of these intelligent design books in the evolution section , " says Shaw , who 's researching the evolution of sloths , anteaters , and armadillos as she works on her Ph.D. " I took one of each , and it was about a three - foot stack .
I thought , this is wrong . "
Books on intelligent design — or , the idea that " certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection , " according to the conservative Christian Discovery Institute think tank , a leading proponent of the notion — should n't be in the science section , Shaw argues .
" They 're not science .
Intelligent design by its very definition is invoking supernatural powers , " she adds .
The problem is , libraries and bookstores use the Dewey Decimal or the Library of Congress ' systems to shelve books , and both systems lump intelligent design books in with science .
A more appropriate Dewey Decimal location would be the " science and religion " section , Shaw argues .
Indeed , the issue of whether intelligent design is science or religion — and , specifically , whether it should be taught in public school science curriculums — has been addressed in the federal courts , with Judge John E. Jones III ruling in December 2005 that intelligent design " cannot uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents . "
After speaking with a friend who 's a Multnomah County librarian — who was also running into confusion over how to shelve books on intelligent design —
Shaw and other graduate students launched a petition calling on the Library of Congress to " to re-classify [ intelligent design ] books into sections other than the science section . "
She plans to present the petition on " Darwin Day " — Charles Darwin 's birthday — in February 2009 .
( In the meantime , Shaw has heard there are " guerilla evolutionists " around the country who sneak around libraries and bookstores , re-shelving books . )
In the past few months , the petition — online at sciencea2z.com — has zipped around scientists ' email lists , and racked up signatures from over 800 scientists , and over 600 " informed citizens . "
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - A U.S. podcaster on Wednesday lost the right to operate a Web site using the name of “ The Simpsons Movie ” to attract fans of the cartoon series to sites related to his own Internet output .
An arbitrator for the United Nations ’ patent agency , WIPO , ruled that New York - based Keith Malley must cede control of the “ thesimpsonsmovie.com ” site to Twentieth Century Fox , the News Corp. unit which owns the Simpsons trademark .
The movie starring the cartoon family premiered July 20 in Springfield , Vermont , ahead of its release on Friday .
The World Intellectual Property Organization ruling found that Malley had registered the domain name to divert business to linked sites promoting and selling merchandise associated with the popular “ Keith and the Girl ” podcast he produces .
The arbitrator said the creation of the Simpsons Movie Web site amounted to “ bad faith registration and use ” of the address -- a practice known as “ cybersquatting . ”
The case , which highlighted the difficulties involved in managing the Internet , was brought by Twentieth Century Fox in May .
WIPO has since 1999 operated a dispute settlement system under which cyberquatters can be challenged and have their sites closed down or transferred to a more legitimate owner .
Malley , a 33 - year - old who operates the podcast with his singer girlfriend Chemda Khalili , offered no defense , WIPO said .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Over the past eight years , the U.N. agency has handled some 10,500 cases of cybersquatting , many involving famous commercial brands from oil firms to hotel chains , prominent film stars and actors , writers and internationally - known sports clubs .
Earlier this year WIPO said the Internet ’s governance was under threat from pirates who have adopted a range of techniques to get hold of domain names and create a free - for - all market in them .
Squatters register variations of top - level domain names , or “ TLDs ” like www.reuters.com, to which they have no genuine claim , by using the proliferating national or type identifiers -- like .au ( Australia ) or .aero ( aviation ) .
In the Simpsons case , WIPO said , Malley at first used the “ movie ” site to link to another “ that featured off - color and in some cases sexually - explicit depictions ” involving characters from the television series .
A lawyer for Malley had indicated the comedian would be prepared to sell the site to Twentieth Century Fox for $ 50,000 , WIPO said .
The offer was refused by the film company .
The CEO & chairman of EMI Music , Alain Levy told an audience at the London Business School on Friday that the CD as we know it is dead .
According to Levy , record companies wo n’t be able to market CDs any longer without including ‘ value added material ’ and will have to make CDs a more attractive purchase to the consumer .
“ We have to be much more innovative in the way we sell physical content , ” he said .
Levy noted that physical media still has a place , but it is n’t going to have it for very long .
“ You ’re not going to offer your mother - in - law iTunes downloads for Christmas , ” he said .
Should we take this with a pinch of salt ?
Sales figures provided by the IFPI ( PDF ) do n’t quite support his claim .
CD sales accounted for more than 70 % of total international music sales in the first half of 2006 , while digital music sales were still at about 11 % .
He also talked about why EMI was the only one of the ‘ Big Four ’ record companies that had n’t jumped on the YouTube bandwagon and signed the contract .
“ The terms they were offering were n’t acceptable , ” Levy was quoted saying .

Ex -White House press secretary says he was misled over Plame – and so was the press and public .
McClellan points finger at Bush , Rove
Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan names names in a caustic passage from a forthcoming memoir that accuses President Bush , Karl Rove and Vice President Cheney of being " involved " in his giving the press false information about the CIA leak case .
McClellan ’s publisher released three paragraphs from the book “ WHAT HAPPENED : Inside the Bush White House and What ’s Wrong With Washington . ”

The excerpts give no details about the alleged involvement of the president or vice president .
But McClellan lists five top officials as having allowed him inadvertently to mislead the public .
“ I stood at the White house briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the seniormost aides in the White House : Karl Rove and Scooter Libby , ” McClellan wrote .
“ There was one problem .
It was not true . ”
McClellan then absolves himself and makes an inflammatory — and potentially lucrative for his publisher — charge .
“ I had unknowingly passed along false information , ” McClellan wrote .
“ And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice president , the president 's chief of staff and the president himself . "
McClellan says he was in that position because he trusted the president : " The most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . ”
Shortly after news of the McClellan excerpt broke , Politico caught up with Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper , two reporters who received information about Valerie Plame ’s identity and were caught up in the subsequent legal proceedings .
“ You ’re only as good as your sources , ” Miller , who was a reporter at the New York Times when the imbroglio broke , said with a mischievous laugh .
Miller , now an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute , spent 85 days in jail by not revealing her source .
“ Nothing surprises me about Washington during this administration anymore , ” she said .
Cooper , who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine and is now the Washington bureau chief of Portfolio magazine , said he “ was always frustrated that Rove and Libby misled McClellan . ”
“ I ’m glad McClellan is , too , ” Cooper said .
McClellan , who is still writing the book , declined to comment further .
In recent conversations and in his many public speaking engagements , McClellan has made it clear he retains great affection for the president .
But White House sources have long said that Rove and I . Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , the vice president ’s chief of staff , allowed McClellan to suggest day after day that they had no involvement in the publication of the name of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
Later testimony showed that they did , although neither was the original source of the leak .
A federal jury found Libby guilty of on perjury and obstruction charges , and Bush later commuted his 30 - month sentence .
In an appearance on CNN ’s “ Larry King Live ” in March , the day Libby was found guilty , McClellan said Bush did not originally know about the involvement by his aides .
McClellan told King : “ I spoke with those individuals , … and those individuals assured me they were not involved in this .
… said what I believed to be true at the time .
It was also what the president believed to be true at the time based on assurances that we were both given .
Knowing what I know today , I would have never said that back then . ”
Friends say McClellan was privately bitter and hurt .
He and Rove had come to Washington from Texas together .
“ Scottie , ” as Bush called him , had worked in the Texas governor ’s office , making him one of the president ’s longest serving aides .
McClellan , an Austin native , was White House press secretary from 2003 to 2006 .
Before that , he was traveling press secretary for the Bush - Cheney campaign of 2000 .
When McClellan announced his resignation in April 2006 , he and the president embraced during a tearful appearance on the South Lawn .
Bush said : “ I thought he handled his assignment with class , integrity .
...
One of these days he and I are going to be rocking on chairs in Texas , talking about the good old days and his time as the press secretary .
And I can assure you I will feel the same way then that I feel now , that I can say to Scott , ' Job well done . ' ”
Now they ’ll have even more to talk about .
The 400 - page hardcover , with a price of $ 27.95 , is set for publication April 21 .
HU JINTAO , China 's Communist Party leader , could hardly have asked for such perfect timing .
Or maybe he did .
Scarcely had the party finished its ritual “ election ” of him for another five years , than a Chinese rocket on October 24th propelled a satellite on China 's — and the developing world 's — first foray to the moon .
AFP
The sky 's no longer the limit
Mr Hu must have watched the launch from Xichang in south - western China with bated breath .
Only last month , Japan became the first Asian nation to send a satellite to orbit the moon .
China had wanted to send its satellite , Chang'e I , up in April but unspecified technical difficulties prevented that .
The delay provided a chance for the launch to coincide with Mr Hu's political triumph ( never in any doubt ) .
Failure this time might even have put China behind India , which is hoping to launch a similar orbiter next year ( as is America ) .
Not since the 1970s has the moon received so much exploratory attention .
Chang'e I still has tricky manoeuvres to perform before China can relax .
After orbiting earth for a few days , its thrusters will be fired to send it to the moon .
The challenge will be getting it into orbit around the moon without it shooting off into space or crashing .
Some of the early Soviet and American attempts to achieve the same feat in the 1950s and 1960s ended in disaster .
Chang'e I is due to enter lunar orbit on November 5th and thereafter begin its year - long task of mapping the moon in 3D , surveying its surface minerals and beaming back patriotic songs .
Back on earth , the party maintained its usual secrecy about the process involved in an extensive shuffle of the 25 - strong Politburo .
The changes were announced on October 22nd at the end of its five - yearly congress .
Mr
Hu briefly paraded the Politburo 's new nine - man Standing Committee , the apex of power , before journalists .
Two of its four new members , Xi Jinping ( party chief of Shanghai ) and Li Keqiang ( party chief of Liaoning province ) , are seen as rival heirs - apparent to Mr Hu , who is likely to step down in 2012 .
They stood stiffly , took no questions and walked out in single file .
Mr
Hu said nothing about those they replaced , including his powerful vice - president , Zeng Qinghong .
China was somewhat more open over the launch of Chang'e I .
Unlike some of its earlier space endeavours , the event on October 24th was broadcast live .
China wants to show that it has emerged as an independent space power .
Chang'e I is intended to be the first in a series of missions that will eventually take a Chinese astronaut to the moon .
These include sending an unmanned rover to the lunar surface as well as sending a probe to collect surface samples and return them to earth .
The big question is when China will send a man there .
Scientists involved have cited various years , usually between 2020 and 2024 .
In September Michael Griffin , the head of America 's space agency , NASA , said he thought the Chinese would get to the moon before America returns .
They have set their own target of 2020 for a manned landing .
“ I think when that happens , Americans will not like it .
But they will just have to not like it , ” he said .
Any immediate prospects for space co-operation between America and China have dimmed since China 's successful test in January of an anti-satellite missile .
In America , this was widely seen as a threat to the country 's dominance of space .
Meanwhile China is forging closer space ties with Russia , which in 2009 is due to send a Chinese satellite to Mars .
But Vincent Sabathier of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , DC , says China is being careful not to rile America by talking of a space race .
Despite Mr Griffin 's remarks , he says NASA still thinks it has a 20 - year lead in space technology .
Jiao Weixin of Peking University says China would not have the technical ability to put a man on the moon for another 20 years , well beyond America 's target return date .
And it would be very expensive .
“ You ca n't just say that because America landed on the moon in the 1960s , we ought to do it too , ” says Mr Jiao .
That , however , is the general idea .
Aaron has tagged me for another writing challenge ( Caring , Compassion , Charity from Alex Shalman ) as well , and this is something that I have been thinking about ** for years , and have actually come up with some plans , though they require far more money than I have currently .
Who knows , perhaps this article will bring me into contact with someone who has the same passion as I do , but has the money to back it .
Alex , in the article linked above , says his passion is for taking care of children … so is mine , but with a different focus .
You see , I believe that a lot of the negative things in the U.S. and in the world come from the fact that children are no longer taught how to be an adult .
One of my passions is to build an alternate school system in the U.S. that actually teaches kids the things they need to know … both as far as academics go , and in regards to how to be an independent adult .
So what are some of the flaws with current school system ?
I ’ll limit this to just a few …
Kids Are No Longer Expected To Earn Their Rewards
Every year the school system in the U.S. marches farther and farther down the path to just giving kids credit for being present , rather than for actually learning and doing the work .
At some schools students have to be unable to learn or apply over half of the material taught in the class before they fail !
What ’s the point of the class if you only require them to learn half of the material ?
The schools here are also trying to eliminate competition in physical education , sports , and the playground .
If there are no winners , if hard work gets you the same result as little to no work , what is that teaching our children ?
One thing it certainly is n’t teaching is a good work ethic .
Punishment Does n’t Fit The Crime
This works both ways … kids are allowed to get away with ridiculous things with little or no punishment for disrupting class , disrespecting the teacher , and sometimes even threatening the teacher or other students .
After the lack of enforcement has its entirely predictable effect , draconian punishments are handed out for minor offenses , like a ten day suspension ( or even expulsion ) for bringing aspirin to school .
If they would just let teachers enforce discipline at the class level , and then back those teachers up at the administrative level , we could prevent the former , and with oversight and accountability we could eliminate the latter .
Teacher Ability Has Nothing To Do With Teacher Reward
Throughout most of the U.S. teachers receive the same compensation whether the percentage of students who pass is 50 % or 100 % .
And , of course , if you are going to use passing percentage to determine teacher quality , then you have to remove the ability for the teacher to give easy grades , and standardize .
It would also let you include other , better ( but not quite as obvious ) criteria , like the improvement in kids from one year to the next .
Here ’s a quick excerpt from my thinking ** on this :
We already have ( at least ) state - wide standards for what needs to be covered in a class .
We just need to expand that a little bit further , and have a panel of non-teachers write questions for testing that knowledge , and then have computers randomly choose from a pool of questions to create a test for a specific student .
If you want to take that one step further , you also submit those tests ( once taken ) to another independent panel to grade them .
You have now taken away all ability for a teacher to play favorites ( or its opposite , giving bad grades to a student they do n’t like ) , as well as to grade easily or harshly .
You have also standardized what is taught to students , so that you can have a good idea what someone who has graduated from a particular grade knows .
It also does n’t take away the freedom of the teacher to teach beyond the tests … but that material is n’t what has been determined is essential to graduating that class , so it is just bonus knowledge for the students .
This method would provide a good way to measure the performance of individual teachers up through schools and even to school districts or an entire state .
Compensation could be based on this performance , encouraging good teachers to stay , average teachers to improve their performance , and bad teachers to leave .
It also provides a very good way to compare the academic performance of individual students from different schools and different teachers … which I ’m certain would interest colleges .
My passion is to change the schools … what ’s yours ?
** I really have been thinking about this for years , and have documented some of my thinking , so if you are seriously interested , you can comment on here .

i Pod touch Screen Problems : Deny Them , Charge Restocking Fees
i Phone Ringtones : Pay Twice for Each Song ; Forget Using Your Own Apple Breaks 2005 - 2007 Video Add - Ons : No Warning , Just Buy New Ones What Happened ?
Almost any “ Made for iPod ” accessory you ’ve purchased with video output no longer outputs photos or videos when connected to the new iPods .
This impacts in - car , home , and airplane accessories alike .
The Details : For the past several years , Apple has actively touted the growing iPod accessory market as one of the family ’s biggest selling points .
Over and over again , the company has trotted out numbers —
1,000 , 2,000 , 3,000 iPod accessories — suggesting that iPod owners do n’t just benefit from great hardware , but the ability to buy add - ons that enhance the hardware ’s performance , and work across the family thanks to their use of a common “ iPod connector ” or “ Dock Connector . ”
It has also created a “ Made for iPod ” program , which is supposed to guarantee iPod compatibility .
That ’s why buyers of the new 2007 iPods were in for a shock when they learned — not from Apple — that the company had broken compatibility of virtually all the video accessories that have been released over the last three years .
Speakers with video outputs , video - specific docks , portable video displays , and wearable video displays — each typically expensive — just do n’t work with the iPods .
The “ TV Out ” menus , which enabled all past photo and video iPods to display pictures and movies on a connected TV , are now locked up , and the only way to unlock them is to buy new , stunningly expensive Apple - authorized video accessories .
Old $ 10 - 20 video cables wo n’t work .
Accessory makers have suggested that Apple is attempting to take control — and extra profits — on third - party video accessories ; companies will have to purchase Apple - developed “ authentication chips ” in order for new video accessories to work .
Besides requiring re-engineering of the products to include these chips , which do little more than serve as a padlock to prevent unauthorized accessories from working , this move will further increase already objectionable accessory prices for consumers , and most importantly require consumers to re-purchase speakers , docks , and portable add - on displays if they want to use them with the new iPods .
Customer Responses : “ Almost Redmondesque in its audacity to lock - in buyers into a newly conceived ecosystem .
Guess ‘ Made for iPod ’ is n’t all that it was made out to be , after all . ”
“ I was considering upgrading my iPod video 5g to the ‘ classic ’ , but not if I have to buy another cable to watch it on my tv …
No thanks , Apple .
This time , you blew it . ”
“ Was seriously considering a Touch … now no way .
I ’ve bought into the Apple products hook line and sinker the last few years – iPod , nano , iMac … but if things go this way , with exclusion of 3rd party , I ’m done . ”
What Apple Can Easily
Do : Issue a software patch to restore compatibility with the majority of Dock Connecting video accessories .
A number of accessories that used the iPod ’s headphone port will still not work , but they ’re a comparative minority , and few users will mind .
iTunes Store iPod Games : Buy Them Again for New iPods What Happened ?
People who purchased any or all of Apple ’s past “ iPod Games ” from the iTunes Store have learned that , unlike music and videos , the games must be re-purchased to work on new iPods .
The Details : Imagine you bought a bunch of music from the iTunes Store , and after Apple released its 2008 iPods , you discovered that you ’d have to re-purchase all the music again because it would n’t play on the new iPods .
“ That ’s technology , ” right ?
Wrong .
Without backwards compatibility , no one would be stupid enough to purchase content from the iTunes Store .
Who wants to buy the same thing twice just to use it on a new iPod ?
This week , Apple decided to find out .
Since 2006 , Apple has been selling $ 4.99 iPod Games , a series of twenty different casual action , puzzle , sports , and quiz titles , releasing the latest one less than a month before new iPods were announced .
As early customers discovered — much to their confusion , and after downloading the games , as shown in numerous comments on the iTunes Store — these “ iPod Games ” could only be played on one iPod , the fifth - generation iPod ( with video ) , and not on the more popular iPod nano .
Apple acknowledged customers ’ concerns on September 5 .
“ People would like to have games on their nanos , ” Jobs told the audience at a Special Event in San Francisco .
“ We listened to everybody ’s concerns , and we think we ’ve nailed it with the new iPod nano . ”
Prior “ iPod Game ” titles would be re-released in the iTunes Store for play on the iPod classic and the iPod nano , with the first three games — Sudoku , Tetris , and Ms. Pac - Man — arriving imminently .
The games would also work on the iPod classic , Apple ’s renamed version of the traditional hard disk - based iPod .
“ Great , ” thought past iPod game buyers , “ now I can use the iPod games I bought last month on the new iPods , just like I can still play the music and videos I bought for my last iPod . ” Nope .
Rather than letting past games work on the new iPods , or letting customers re-download newly compatible versions , Apple told past iPod game owners to buy the games again .
The “ reformatted ” versions for iPod nano and classic are nothing more than version 1.1 of past version 1.0 games , with minor menu tweaks , and do not feature additional levels or other content changes .
Reactions from past iPod game buyers have been profoundly negative : clearly , users believed that iPod games would continue to work on newer Click Wheel iPods .
Customer Responses : “ Who are you and what have you done with the real Steve Jobs ? ” “ Yeah , way to go Apple .
Just when I has going to upgrade my Nano , 5.5 , and switch to a MacBook Pro . I guess success has now ruined Apple .
No longer ‘ hip ’ .
Just another generic faceless corporation .
Trade the jeans and t neck for the PC suit Steve , your transformation to the dark side is now complete . ”
“ Repurchase the games with absolutely NO guarantees that they will function on the next generation of iPods ?
How stupid does Apple think we are ?
I guess plenty , cause we were dumb enough to buy iPods and iPod games to start with .
Great way to destroy a market in it ’s infancy , Apple ! ” What Apple Can Easily Do : Let past iPod game buyers download versions that work on their new iPods , and either plan to use the same game code on future video - capable iPods , or rename “ iPod Games ” to “ Click Wheel iPod Games ” so that people do n’t assume they ’ll work on touch - screened iPods .
iPod touch Screen Problems : Deny Them , Charge Restocking Fees What Happened ?
iPod touch units were shipped with defective screens .
When readers tried to return them to Apple Stores , employees denied any problems and charged the customers $ 30 - 40 restocking fees .
The Details : When quality control dips on Apple products , and problems occur , the company has two ways of responding — take responsibility , or try to pass it off on customers .
Last week ’s release of the iPod touch was marred by significant screen problems , including improper displays of black colors , which have been widely reported and blamed variously on manufacturing mistakes , lower - quality display components , and faulty video display drivers .
Readers have additionally reported the unusual presence of dead pixels on iPod touch screens .
Several readers have noted that similar problems are popping up on recently built iPhones , as well .
Unfortunately , despite thousands of comments on its own and other discussion forums , Apple has not widely acknowledged the issues , and many of its retail stores have been imposing $ 30 - 40 restocking fees on customers who have attempted to return their faulty units .
Though the problems affect even videos purchased from the iTunes Store , including Pixar ’s The Incredibles as shown in our iPod touch review , employees told customers that they improperly encoded their videos , or that the screens are supposed to look like that .
The Wall Street Journal late last night confirmed with Apple that some iPod touch units were defective , but Apple has not offered further public comment or restocking fee refunds to affected users .
Customer Responses : “ I showed them a side by side comparison of the black levels between the iPod touch and the iPhone .
The difference was like night and day .
They said the iPhone has a better screen and that I cannot compare the two because it was a different product .
I was sooooo p—ed !
They said since I opened it they would charge me $ 40.00 !
I tried to talk my way out of paying for the restocking fee .
But in the end I had to pay for it .
Did anyone else have such an awful experience trying to return the iPod Touch ?
Do you think Apple will realize that there is a problem and then I could get my $ 40.00 back ? ”
“ Apple is really getting a black eye on this .
They really need to quit pretending that it ’s not a problem .
They need to admit it and fix it .
I guess I ’d settle for them just fixing it , since I doubt they will ever admit to it . ”
“ I ’m at the Apple store right now , showing the guy side by side comparisons , and he still wont admit and take it back without paying the $ 40 .
This is a… scam . …
I ’m not asking for my money back , I ’m asking for a STORE CREDIT , so I can buy a WORKING one when it comes in I ’m coming back tomorrow to try this again .
Apple may be looking at a Class Action if this does n’t get resolved . ”
What Apple Can Easily
Do : Issue no-questions - asked , no - restocking - fee refunds or replacements to customers with screen problems , and refund amounts charged to those who previously came in with problems .
i Phone Ringtones : Pay Twice for Each Song ; Forget Using Your Own What Happened ?
Rather than letting users play any of their own audio as iPhone ringtones , Apple locked the iPhone ’s ringtone feature and requires users to buy both full songs and 30 - second song snippets from the iTunes Store for $ 1.98 .
The Details : The iPhone has a built - in speaker that can play back literally any audio that ’s coming from inside the device , including iPod music , the sound portions of videos , voices from speakerphones , and web content .
It also plays back pre-programmed ringtones — 25 of which are included by Apple on the device .
What ca n’t it do ?
Play back any piece of audio content in your iTunes library as a ringtone for your phone .
This limitation is entirely artificial : there ’s no technical reason the iPhone can’t ring with , say , your girlfriend or boyfriend ’s recorded voice , a song you composed yourself , a sound effect from your favorite TV show , or a snippet from your favorite band .
Any of all of these items can be played back through your computer , any digital music player , or the iPhone in iPod mode , and they ’re all routinely offered by average people , bands , and even TV networks as ways to remember them by .
People expected that ‘ consumer - focused ’
Apple would find a way to let them play whatever they wanted as an iPhone ringtone , but instead , Apple announced a completely different agenda : you have to buy songs once from iTunes , then pay an additional charge of at least 99 cents ( international prices may vary ) to get 30 or fewer seconds of the song again as a ringtone .
Worse yet , this could n’t be done with most iTunes songs : virtually none of the Store ’s top 10 were eligible for ringtone use during our testing .
Consequently , the ringtone creation feature , rolled out in iTunes 7.4 , was immediately and widely denounced by iPhone owners , and people began to find ways to create their own iPhone - compatible ringtones .
Rather than ignoring the user - created ringtones , Apple has sought to block them , twice patching iTunes 7.4 ( versions 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 ) to prevent users from adding their own legally - created ringtones to the iPhone .
It has also closed discussions on its forums complaining about the restriction , though new topics continue to appear , with user comments such as these : Customer Responses : “ I take this extreme restrictiveness , which is uncharacteristic of Apple , as an offense ; some ploy to get people to buy more songs from the Music Store .
As such , I shall rebel and purchase no more music from the Store until I can be given a satisfactory answer as to why Apple is keeping us users on such a short leash , or until the Ringtone tyranny is lifted . ”
“ There was another thread about this last night called ‘ Do n’t Tread on My Ringtones . ’
It had over 300 hits in the first hour , The thread was pulled by Apple . …
The original post in the ‘ Do n’t Tread ’ thread raised the question , ‘ Why ca n’t someone use their own music or personally - recorded audio ( for example , my wife ’s voice ) as a ringtone ? ’
And : ‘ Why does Apple seem so intent on actively ( by means of ‘ upgrades ’ that ‘ downgrade ’ functionality ) discouraging individuals and third - parties from accomplishing this ? ’
These are fair questions , and ultimately , I think , about getting technical support for a particular feature . ”
What Apple Can Easily
Do : Either unlock the iTunes ringtone creator , or stop blocking users from adding their own 30 - second or shorter audio clips to the iPhone ’s list of ringtones .
Will Apple take the appropriate steps to satisfy its iPod , iPhone , and iTunes Store customers , or will it continue to engage in the same sorts of user - antagonistic practices that eventually earned Microsoft widespread scorn , consumer lawsuits , and international governmental intervention ?
Like you , we ’ll be watching to see what happens , and hoping Apple quickly does right by its biggest supporters .
Rusty Hodge , the GM of SomaFM , has been posting updates from Washington , where he is attempting to help congress understand why we should all save internet radio .
His latest dispatch shows just how idiotic our congresscritters are :
[ California Republican Darryl ]
Issa spoke a lot about HD radio , and the threat it makes to sale of CDs .
He is under the impression that the 64 kb or lower compressed digital audio sounds as good as CD .
HD does not stand for High Definition .
It stands for " Hybrid Digital " .
Unlike HDTV , which improved the signal quality delivered to consumers , HD radio is not a marked improvement .
Signal to noise ratios are improved , but there are audible compression artifacts in the audio .
Issa also talked about a flood of HD radio recording devices that automatically split tracks coming out soon .
( I think he 's extremely wrong on this , there is so little uptake on HD hardware , there are only 2 or 3 HD radios on the market right now , and they 're selling very poorly .
I 've heard a statistic several times that say an American is more likely to be run over by a bus than they are to listen to HD radio in the last year . )
I would like to know why complete idiots like Issa , who clearly have such problems understanding technology , are given the responsibility of crafting legislation that affects technology , and those of us who use it .
Ted Stevens should get his staff to send Issa an Internet and let him know what an ignorant jackass he is .
UPDATE : Rusty has some further thoughts about this - Defending Issa ( and other politicians ) .

TEHRAN - Naoki Tanaka , the president of the Japanese Center for International Public Policy Studies , said here on Monday that Japan is prepared to mediate between Iran and the United States to help resolve Iran ’s nuclear standoff with the West .
In a meeting with Tehran Times and Mehr News Agency Managing Director Parviz Esmaeili , Tanaka said imposing sanctions on Iran runs counter to Japan ’s national interests .
Since Japan enjoys good relations with Iran and the United States , it has the potential to mediate between the two countries to help resolve the remaining differences over the nuclear issue , he added .
He emphasized that Iran has the inalienable right to utilize nuclear technology and expressed regret over certain powers ’ double standards toward Iran ’s nuclear dossier .
Tanaka also proposed the establishment of a neutral international organization tasked with “ eliminating nuclear weapons ” and supporting peaceful nuclear studies of the world ’s scientists , without any political biases .
He said that negotiation is the only way to resolve the dispute over Iran ’s nuclear program .
The leaders of the U.S. , Russia , and other world powers should know that no matter how advanced their military equipment is , they should not give up searching for a diplomatic settlement of the nuclear row , he stated .
“ Power without wisdom is destructive , ” he noted .
Japan is interested in expanding its relations with the Islamic Republic , but UN Security Council resolutions and the United States ’ unilateral sanctions against Iran are the major obstacles blocking efforts to develop bilateral relations , he said .
“ I know that over the course of history , the Iranian nation has repeatedly witnessed the betrayal of European countries , including the 5+1 group , ” he said , adding that Japan can provide Iran with the guarantees necessary to allow it to exercise its inalienable nuclear rights .
Tanaka also predicted a bright future for the two countries ’ scientific advancement through peaceful nuclear cooperation .
Although weapons of mass destruction have proven ineffective , the United States is still continuing efforts to manufacture and stockpile such weapons , and this is a problem countries such as Iran and Japan can resolve through constructive cooperation , he stated .
For his part , Esmaeili called for the expansion of intellectual cooperation between the two countries .
He underlined Iran ’s inalienable right to utilize peaceful nuclear technology and agreed with Tanaka ’s view that weapons of mass destruction are ineffective in the modern world .
“ If a nuclear bomb could provide a country security , the former Soviet Union would not have collapsed , and the 17,000 nuclear warheads in the United States could have prevented events like 9/11 , ” he observed .
Most of the 5+1 group countries ( five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany ) have betrayed the Iranian nation over the course of history and have never been “ loyal to the contracts ” they have signed with the Islamic Republic , and thus the Iranian nation cannot trust their promises and cannot ignore their previous political actions , he added .
Over the past 20 years , the Western powers have imposed many sanctions on the Islamic Republic and have never contributed to the country ’s scientific progress , and their double standards compel countries to conduct clandestine activities , he said .
When certain Western powers support a country like Israel in its efforts to manufacture a nuclear bomb , despite the fact that it does not accept the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency , and the same powers try to deprive Iran of peaceful nuclear technology , although it has allowed IAEA inspectors to perform unprecedented inspections of its nuclear installations , they encourage other countries to escape IAEA supervision and think about conducting clandestine activities , he stated .
Esmaeili added that the United States promotes insecurity in the world .
The Bush administration is creating the “ atmosphere of animosity ” in the international community , he stated .
Tanaka said his country is making efforts to establish an international research center working for the total eradication of weapons of mass destruction .
“ We should rid the whole world of weapons of mass destruction .
The more such weapons are proliferated , the greater the possibility that terrorists will gain access to them , ” the professor noted .
If uranium enrichment is developed with the purpose of making atomic bombs , international security will be threatened , he said .
Esmaeili said atomic weapons are not a threat to politicians but it is the people who will lose their lives if they are used , as happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and the “ destruction of these weapons is a ‘ sacred goal ’ for both of us .
” The Tehran Times managing director also praised Japan , saying that despite the fact that it has had a uranium enrichment program for about forty years , it has never made efforts to produce nuclear weapons .
“ The Japan experience proves that intentions should be controlled in the world , and not the tools and technology .
“ A mechanism can be devised according to which all countries can conduct enrichment activities but never move toward ( the production of ) weapons of mass destruction .
” Emphasizing the importance of clean energy in light of the global warming problem , he stated that the U.S. is seeking to monopolize energy production in order to expand its domination of the world .
Japan ’s political clout not commensurate with its economic powerEsmaeili also criticized Japan for not being actively involved in international developments .
He stated that economic power shapes international relations , but Japan , which is the second largest economy in the world , is not the second most important political player in the world .
“ Japan can move beyond the East Asia region , and it can play the role of the second or even the most important country in the world .
” Muslims ’ positive view of JapanGenerally , Muslim nations have a positive view of Japan and regard the Japanese as a civilized nation that does not seek to dominate the region , Esmaeili noted .
However , Tokyo has not been able to take advantage of this situation and U.S. corporations , whose government is the most hated by Muslim people , have captured Islamic markets , he said .
Nevertheless , Washington is still not happy about the expansion of Japan ’s trade ties with Islamic countries , he added .
Tanaka asked Esmaeili if only certain ( conservative ) officials advise the Supreme Leader on foreign policy issues .
Esmaeili responded , “ Iran ’s foreign policy is independent from local political factions .
“ He has different advisors .
For example , Dr. Ali Akbar Velayati , who served as Iran ’s foreign minister for 16 years , and Dr. Kamal Kharrazi who was foreign minister in the government of Mohammad Khatami and has been appointed chairman of the Strategic Center for Foreign Policy by him ( the Leader ) .
” Tanaka said Tokyo views Iran as a friendly state and making use of Iran ’s energy resources is a priority for Japan
Blackout ( Jive )
Good Lord , Britney Jean Spears .
At what point in the tale of our Cheetos - chomping , baby - losing , vag - flashing , drugged - up anti-heroine do we turn our eyes away and admit our culpability in her undoing ?
From all the forwarded YouTube videos , cheap newspaper headlines , and gossipy Web site updates , the public has n't quite finished watching this 25 - year - old mother - of - two fall to pieces .
It 's easy to laugh and condemn such a colossal fuck - up of a star , especially when you overlook that she was sexualized by sleazy record execs , milked for all the jism - covered cash her teenage haunches could generate , and then left for dead on the side of the pop-cultural highway .
Is it any wonder she 's splaying her legs for us ?
Oh , you want to know about her comeback album , Blackout , do you ?
Well , it 's a perfectly functional pop album : robotic , processed vocals , pre-fab beats , retarded sexuality , and backhanded jabs at the media abound .
There 's some club - worthy tracks , most notably the aptly - titled " Freakshow " , with its great , bouncing beats and girly harmonies .
Star producers and a mega dose of fuck - you from Ms. Spears buoy the album , saving it from being the disaster so many were hoping for .
All in all , Blackout is n't so bad at all , if candy - coated top 40 is your bag .
Of course , in the grand scheme of things , it 's absolute dreck .
But honestly , taking shots at this tragic–albeit loathsome and loaded –woman , or her " music " simply is n't sporting anymore .
Blackout indeed .
Enough already .

About a month ago , the NYT published an op - ed from seven infantrymen and noncommissioned officers with the 82nd Airborne Division .
The piece , “ The War as We Saw It , ” was a sweeping condemnation of everything we ’ve heard from war supporters .
Today , on the fifth anniversary of the congressional authorization of military force in Iraq , the WaPo runs a powerful op - ed of its own from 12 former Army captains who served in Iraq — and who believe it ’s time to leave .
Five years on , the Iraq war is as undermanned and under - resourced as it was from the start .
And , five years on , Iraq is in shambles .
As Army captains who served in Baghdad and beyond , we ’ve seen the corruption and the sectarian division .
We understand what it ’s like to be stretched too thin .
And we know when it ’s time to get out .
And that would be , according to the 12 former Army captains , now .
These “ phony troops ” just keep popping up , do n’t they ?

Guantánamo : where rights are shackled
HAULED before a military tribunal at the American naval base in Guantánamo Bay , the detainee , picked up in Afghanistan , asked why he was being held .
For associating with a member of al - Qaeda , he was told .
Give me his name , the detainee demanded .
The tribunal 's president said he did n't know it .
Nor did any of the tribunal 's other members .
“ How can I respond to this ? ” the detainee cried before being taken back to his cell to continue his detention , perhaps for the rest of his life .
This Kafkaesque story was related this summer by Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , in support of a bill he and Patrick Leahy , the committee 's Democratic chairman , were co-sponsoring to restore habeas corpus rights to Guantánamo 's detainees .
Most have been held for nearly six years without charge , without access to a lawyer or any indication of when , if ever , they might be released .
The Pentagon has said they could be held for the duration of the ( open- ended ) “ global war on terror ” .
Guantánamo has become a byword for the Bush administration 's gung - ho reaction to the terror attacks of September 2001 .
In Britain , too , the government has sought new powers to tackle Islamist terrorism , even if these seemed to offend ancient liberties .
But the story is not over yet .
It could turn into a tale not of liberties being frayed , but of democracy 's underlying strength .
For , in both America and Britain , the doctrine of the balance of powers has passed a test .
The executive branch made a grab for more authority ; but courts and legislators have tried hard to push back .
Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention , coupled with the right to challenge it in an independent court — known as habeas corpus in common - law countries like Britain and America — are among the civilised world 's most sacred and ancient liberties , going back to medieval times .
But these days , there is more talk of pre-emption and “ preventive detention ” , even in democracies .
“ You can't allow somebody to commit the crime before you detain them , ” said Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , when asked about America 's secret “ renditions ” programme for suspected terrorists .
What the public safety requires
Under the American constitution , habeas corpus may not be suspended except when “ in cases of rebellion or invasion , the public safety may require it ” .
And only very rarely has it been suspended .
Abraham Lincoln did so during the civil war , but was rebuked by the courts .
And the internment of 120,000 people of Japanese descent , two - thirds of them American citizens , in the second world war , was lawful but is now viewed as a shameful misdeed .
Britain likewise suspended habeas corpus in the second world war to allow it to detain around 1,000 suspected fascists .
All were released after three years .
During the “ troubles ” in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s , nearly 2,000 suspected extremists were interned .
But the practice was scrapped in 1975 , as it was clearly fuelling support for terrorism — just as Guantánamo is doing now .
George Bush chose the American naval base in Cuba as the detention centre for those picked up in his war on terror because officials believed — falsely as it turned out —
Guantánamo was beyond the reach of domestic and international law .
If the detainees had been held on American soil , they could have claimed the same rights as ordinary American citizens , including a right to due process , to apply for asylum and to sue the American government for any alleged wrongs .
From the outset , the 775 or so men and boys ( some as young as 13 ) sent by Mr Bush to Guantánamo were branded as guilty .
Donald Rumsfeld , the former defence secretary , described them as “ hard - core , well - trained terrorists ” who , if released , would simply “ return to the fight and continue to kill innocent men , women and children ” .
The Pentagon says that all were “ caught in the battlefield ” .
But many were given to the Americans by Afghan bounty - seekers ; others were seized as far away as Bosnia and Zambia .
Mr Bush claims that , under international law , parties to an armed conflict may hold enemy combatants “ for the duration of active hostilities ” .
This is correct .
Nor is “ unlawful enemy combatant ” a term he invented .
In the Geneva Conventions , it describes a foe who is not a member of official armed forces or an organised resistance movement , does not carry arms openly , wears no uniform or other distinctive sign , and refuses to heed the laws of war .
As such , he fails to qualify for the rights of a prisoner of war .
But , contrary to what the administration first claimed , he is entitled to some protections , including humane treatment and , if charged , to a fair trial by a “ regularly constituted court ” .
But is America 's war on terror a real war in the legal sense ?
If not , then the detainees should be treated as ordinary criminal suspects .
This is the path that most European countries have chosen .
Even if it could be deemed a real war , it is clearly unlike an ordinary state conflict : it has neither a definable end nor even an identifiable enemy with whom to sue for peace .
It could last for decades .
Meanwhile , dozens , perhaps hundreds , of detainees are apparently to be left to rot in their cages — if not in Guantánamo , which Mr Bush says he wants to close — then somewhere else .
America has also engaged in so - called “ extraordinary rendition ” — the abduction of suspected terrorists to face not justice , but harsh interrogation , perhaps torture , in a third country .
Up to 100 nameless “ high - value ” suspects are believed to have been seized by CIA agents and then transferred to secret jails , some never to resurface .
Around 15 have recently been transferred to Guantánamo , where they may or may not face trial .
But most of the 330 - odd detainees remaining at the camp may never be charged or tried .
The Pentagon says it hopes eventually to put up to 80 detainees on trial for war crimes by special military commissions .
Even if acquitted , they may still be held as enemy combatants for the rest of the “ war ” .
In Britain , all renditions have been outlawed since a Court of Appeal ruling in 1999 overturned the conviction of an Irish Republican , Peter Mullen , who had been spirited back to Britain from Zimbabwe .
His abduction was described by the court as a “ blatant and extremely serious failure to adhere to the rule of law ” .
Britain has eroded liberties in other ways .
Immediately after the September 11th attacks , the government brought in a law allowing it to hold indefinitely and without charge any foreigner deemed a national security risk — on the simple say - so of the home secretary .
To do this , it had to opt out of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights , as is permitted “ in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation ” .
None of the 45 other signatories has deemed such a step necessary .
Belmarsh prison in London , where most terror suspects were held , was dubbed “ Britain 's Guantánamo ” — a bit unfairly .
Britain never claimed to be in the midst of a war or to be holding “ unlawful enemy combatants ” with no legal rights .
Its foreign detainees , totalling no more than 18 , always had access to a lawyer and could challenge their detention before an independent tribunal , though they were not allowed to see classified evidence against them .
The government said they were not being held indefinitely , just awaiting deportation .
But as they could not be sent to their own countries ( because they might be tortured ) , and no other state wanted them , the effect was the same .
The law lords say no
In December 2004 the House of Lords , Britain 's highest court , judged this system to be incompatible with the European Convention .
For Lord Scott , one of the law lords involved , indefinite detention on undisclosed grounds was “ the stuff of nightmares ” , reminiscent of a Stalinist regime .
The law was duly scrapped .
But it was replaced by new powers allowing the home secretary ( not a judge ) to impose an indefinitely renewable “ control order ” — including electronic tagging , a ban on phone and internet use , and strict curfews amounting at times to virtual house arrest — on any suspected terrorist , British or foreign .
The new system seems as riddled with problems as the old , and almost as unfair .
In its latest report on control orders , in September , the Home Office said three of the 14 people subject to the regime had absconded .
Several people have had their orders quashed by judges who again found the measures incompatible with the European Convention .
The government has appealed to the House of Lords , which is expected to pronounce later this month .
In the final months of Tony Blair 's government , ministers said they were prepared to “ take the nuclear option ” and opt out of the convention again if the law lords ' ruling went against them .
That threat has not been repeated by the new prime minister , Gordon Brown .
But he may yet try similar moves .
He has already announced plans for a new anti-terrorist law — Britain 's fifth since 2000 .
Among his proposals is an extension of the maximum time a suspected terrorist can be held without charge from 28 days , already the longest in the West , to 56 days .
Most democracies allow no more than three days .
France permits four ; Greece six .
But no leader of a Western democracy has obtained a completely free hand in detaining people .
America has seen a tug of war between the government and the courts , with many rounds .
In June 2004 , the Supreme Court ruled that habeas corpus remained available to everyone detained on American soil , unless explicitly suspended .
The case involved Yaser Esam Hamdi , an American citizen being held as an unlawful enemy combatant on a naval brig in Virginia .
Two years later , in a case involving a Guantánamo detainee , Salim Hamdan , the Supreme Court said the basic protections afforded to all wartime detainees under the Geneva Conventions applied to everyone , even to unlawful enemy combatants outside America .
The court also ruled that Mr Bush had exceeded his authority in setting up , without congressional approval , special military commissions to try some of the Guantánamo detainees .
In response , the president pushed through the 2006 Military Commissions Act giving him just such authority .
That law also stripped Guantánamo detainees of any vestige of habeas corpus rights , with retroactive effect .
This seemed to dash the hopes of hundreds of Guantánamo detainees with challenges pending before American civilian courts .
In April , that view appeared to be confirmed when the Supreme Court turned down , without comment , a habeas corpus petition from the above - mentioned Mr Hamdan .
But in June it relented , agreeing to hear an almost identical case from another Guantánamo detainee .
Many hope the Supreme Court will seize this opportunity to give a view on whether Mr Bush 's “ war on terror ” is a real war .
The legislators strike back
Congress , too , is beginning to show its teeth , particularly now it is under Democratic control .
Although Senator Specter 's bipartisan bill to restore habeas corpus rights to Guantánamo detainees fell to a Republican filibuster on September 19th , it got the support of 56 senators , including four Republicans .
Other bills pending before Congress seek the total closure of Guantánamo with the transfer of the detainees either to their home countries , if they do not present too big a threat and if those countries are willing to take them ; or to a military prison in America .
In Britain , too , Parliament has baulked at some of the government 's demands .
In 2005 , when Mr Blair sought to push through a bill raising the time a suspected terrorist could be detained from 14 to 90 days , his backbenchers revolted , eventually settling on the compromise of 28 days , with regular judicial oversight .
Some British officials have been looking with envy at civil - law countries like France , where the criminal - justice system allows detention for months , even years , after a suspect has been formally “ placed under investigation ” , but not yet charged .
Police can also continue to interrogate suspects during that time .
But most legal commentators believe that if the French model were copied in this area , an unbearable blow would be dealt to England 's common - law system .
And despite the fears of civil libertarians , there are still judges and legislators who think that system worth preserving .
Presidential Patterns in Citizenship , Courtship and Age
There ’s been a flurry of misinformation tossed about in the media lately , which attempts to position Dennis and Elizabeth Kucinich outside the parameters of “ presidentiality . ”
These comments have ranged from mentions of the fact that Elizabeth is a British citizen , to their short courtship , to the age difference between her and Dennis .
And , recently , when Hannah Storm interviewed Dennis and Elizabeth on NBC’s The Early Show , she erroneously said to Elizabeth , “ You would be the first , First Lady at such a young age . ”
This is quite simply , not true .
So here are some actual facts that show how “ in step ” Dennis and Elizabeth are with other presidential couples .
Youthful First Ladies
Elizabeth Kucinich , at the time of the January , 2009 , inauguration , will be just 31 years old , but this would certainly not make her the youngest First Lady .
This is exactly the same age that Jacqueline Kennedy ( b. July 28 , 1929 ) was at her husband ’s inauguration on January 20 , 1961 .
But two other First Ladies were younger than Elizabeth and Jacqueline .
Julia Gardiner Tyler ( b. May 4 , 1820 ) became First Lady at age 24 .
She married President John Tyler ( b. March 29 , 1790 ) on June 26 , 1844 .
He was the first president to marry in office .
( His first wife died earlier in his term . )
The Tylers had a 30 - year difference in their ages , just slightly less than Dennis and Elizabeth ’s 31 - year age difference .

A COORDINATED WALL ST .
ASSAULT Who Killed U.S. Nuclear Power ? by Marsha Freeman From the Spring 2001 issue of 21st Century Science & Technology ( full text ) .
Wall Streets high finance rates killed 5,000 megawatts of nuclear power capacity four plants in 1981 , midway in construction in the Washington state WPPSS Project , shown here .
If the four nuclear plants planned by WPPSS had been completed , the Pacific Northwest would not have an energy crisis today .
Washington Public Power Suppy System
The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) made a projection in 1962 , that by the year 1980 , 40 gigawatts of nuclear - generated electric capacity would be on line in this country ( the equivalent of about 40 plants of 1,000 megawatts capacity each ) .
Two years later , amid the optimism generated by President John F. Kennedys Apollo program to land a man on the Moon , the AEC revised its projections upward , to 75 GW of nuclear capacity by 1980 .
By 1967 , through the momentum of the lunar landing program and its high - technology economic expansion , the AEC again upped its projections , this time to 145 GW of nuclear capacity by the year 1980 .
Engineers in the industry , looking farther ahead , expected 2,000 GW nuclear by the year 2000 .
Now , in 2001 , there are only 103 nuclear plants in operation in the United States .
More than that number have been cancelled .
The collapse in orders , and cancellations , have left the U.S. nuclear industry in such a state of contraction , that today it could not even build a new nuclear reactor , were one to be ordered .
The pressure vessel would have to be imported , because there is no U.S. firm capable of fabricating one .
There are many myths about who killed nuclear power in this country .
Blame is put on the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 , which certainly added to the attacks on the industry , but was not a decisive factor .
Blame is put on the American public , which supposedly became anti-nuclear ( although , except for a small vocal minority , this has never been the case ) .
The claim is made that nuclear is inherently just too expensive to use , but , in fact , it was a coordinated assault by Wall Street and its foot soldiers in the environmentalist movement that drove the costs up .
If we do not understand how we got to where we are , we will never be able to change the situation .
Soon after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 , the international financial and oligarchical interests who despised his pro-nuclear , pro-space , and economic growth policies , moved in to bury them .
The Paradigm Shift
The founding of the Club of Rome in 1969 , by co-thinkers of European royal families and their toadies in the United States , helped launch a propaganda campaign to convince policymakers and citizens that the world has too many people .
Volumes of reports from the Club of Rome and affiliated think tanks opined that science and technology could not alleviate the alleged overpopulation ,  and that , in any case , that technology has many negative consequences , such as damaging the environment .
The passage of the National Environmental Policy
Act the same year , 1969 , made the criterion of how economic projects would affect plants , insects , and animals more important than the impact those projects would have on the economic health of human beings .
The 1973 Middle East War , and the ensuing manipulated oil crisis ,  threw energy policy and planning into turmoil .
Overnight , oil prices quadrupled , and coaluntil then the mainstay of electricity generation also rose in price .
Under his Project Independence program , to increase the exploitation of domestic energy supplies , President Richard Nixon called for the building of 1,000 nuclear reactors by the year 2000 .
But soon , Nixon was out of office , and the anti-nuclear moles inside his Administration had already been planning the demise of nuclear energy .
Already in 1971 , within days of becoming the head of the Atomic Energy Commission , James Rodney Schlesinger , who had come to Washington from the RAND Corporation , overturned a critical AEC decision .
He allowed the Natural Resources Defense Council , which had been formed in 1970 by representatives of top Wall Street law firms , to intervene via lawsuits to stop construction of the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant in southern Maryland .
The reason given was that the plant would damage the environment .
This action laid the basis for two decades of legal maneuvering by environmentalists - in - three - piece - suits to keep utilities tied up in court for years , with bogus environmental and safety concerns , making it impossible for many plants to ever be completed .
With the election of Jimmy Carter as President in 1976 , anti-nuclear , pro-environmental policy was brought right into the White House .
In preparation for the new Democratic Administration , the New York Council on Foreign Relations , a spinoff of the Londons Royal Institute of International Affairs , produced its Project 1980s report , which called specifically for the controlled disintegration of the U.S. economy .
The Rockefeller - funded Trilateral Commission , whose membership dominated the Carter Administration , adopted this Project 1980s perspective as its own .
Central to their theme of controlled disintegration was the halt of new energy technologies on the horizon , such as advanced nuclear fission and fusion energy .
In their place , they promoted the institutionalization of  conservation ,  and small - is - beautiful alternative  energy , based on inefficient and expensive wind , solar , and biomass technologies which had virtually disappeared after the Industrial Revolution .
Billions of dollars in federal subsidies were poured into these 19th century throwbacks , to try to make them economically palatable to an otherwise highly skeptical public .
T he new Department of Energy , which replaced the Atomic Energy Commissionan act that in itself demonstrated the shift in policy again came under the control of James Schlesinger .
While Schlesinger was making speeches about how nuclear energy was not cost effective ,  the Department of Energy showed its anti-technology stripes by actively promoting and participating in  Sun Day festivities .
The first step toward deregulating the electric utilities took place , under the Carter Administration , through a 1978 Act that gave small , renewable  energy producers access to the electric grid , and forced utility companies to buy their outrageously priced power .
A march on Washington of 65,000 anti-nuclear demonstrators on May 6 , 1979 , used the March 1979 incident at Three Mile Island to call for the shutdown of the nations then - operating 68 nuclear reactors .
This Jacobin mob was the street - level creature spawned by the Council on Foreign Relations and Wall Streets largest non-profit foundations , in the name of protecting the environment .
The demonstration further fueled the efforts in the White House and Congress to enact rules and regulations to sabotage the completion of nuclear plants .
The machinations of the anti-nukes also increased the pressure on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to institute irrational new rules and regulations , which , on one occasion , resulted in 13 power plants being shut down at the same time , for safety  inspections .
Billions of dollars were spent by nuclear utilities to retrofit plants for increased safety , much of which retrofitting was known by many in the industry to be unnecessary .
At the same time , the nuclear utilities were bending over backwards to listen to and answer the concerns of the anti-nukes , in the hope that this process would instill some rationality into the situation .
It was during the Carter administration , that the predecessor to 21st Century , the Fusion Energy Foundations Fusion magazine , and the associated political movement of Lyndon LaRouche , took the lead in exposing the Trilateral Commission / Council on Foreign Relations / Wall St. role in fostering and funding the environmentalist movement and its terrorist spinoffs .
In the closing days of the Carter Administration , Lyndon LaRouche , preparing to run for President in the 1980 election , released a report titled  America Must Go Nuclear . 
In the introduction , LaRouche stated :  On my first day in office , I shall deliver to the Congress a comprehensive energy policy .
This legislation will repeal the worst features of the Environmental Protection Act , permitting work to be completed on the approximately 120 nuclear energy plants presently stalled in various phases of construction .
It will also provide for the addition of 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2000 A.D. 
President Reagan , who was touted as the first pro-nuclear President in 20 years when elected in 1980 , did not even understand the systemic policy changes that would be required to resurrect the nuclear industry .
Figure 1
OPERATING U.S. NUCLEAR PLANTS
The 103 nuclear power plants operating today in the United States produce the most reliable , and most efficient 20 percent of the electric power grid .
Total capacity is 96.245 GW .
Source : Nuclear Energy Institute Although the 1974 oil crisis led to a renewed interest in nuclear , as evidenced by the number of plants ordered immediately afterwards , a well calculated act by Federal Reserve Chairman , Paul Volcker , one of the many Trilateral Commission agents in the Carter team , dashed the attempts to go nuclear .
Over the Columbus Day weekend in 1979 , Volcker raised interest rates in the United States into the double digits .
This move had an immediate impact on two consumer goods sectors that rely heavily on creditautomobile purchases , and home mortgages but the effect on the electric utility industry was more dramatic , and more far reaching .
The idea that the nation did not have to build more power plants , especially nuclear plants , because the economy and energy consumption had fallen , was a self - fulfilling prophecy .
When energy prices skyrocketed in the mid-1970s , industries and consumers cut back , to buy what energy they could afford .
Traditional 1960s growth rates for electricity demand of 7 percent per year , shrank to 2 to 3 percent per year , and projections for the future decade , based on the forecast of an extended economic recession , were in the 1 to 2 percent range .
Once energy supply is made expensive , it can be expected that consumption will decline .
Historically , inexpensive energy has fueled increased demand , not vice versa .
Suddenly , after the oil shock , with demand falling , the nuclear plants that were in the pipeline were seen as over capacity ,  an unnecessary surplus of power that no one should have to pay for .
It was not the Three Mile Island incident in 1979 that started the rush to cancel nuclear plants .
Between 1973 and 1979 , more than 40 had already been cancelled .
And by 1979 , the projections for nuclear power by the Department of Energy were slashed to 150 GW by the year 2000 .
Orders for new nuclear plants disappeared , as seen in Figure 2 .
Figure 2
THE COLLAPSE OF NUCLEAR REACTOR ORDERS AFTER THE 1973 OIL HOAX
It is a myth that the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 caused the demise of the nuclear industry .
As can be seen here , the number of new nuclear plants ordered reached a high of 35 in 1972 , and then collapsed to zero after the oil crisis of 1973 .

By 1981 , electric utilities , which operate the most capital - intensive industry in the nation , were paying 17 percent interest on loans for the construction of power plants .
This might have been a bearable escalation in cost , were it not for the fact that the construction time for nuclear power plants was being stretched out from eight years to up to twenty thanks to anti-nuclear intervenors  who made a profession out of tying up utilities in court .
No company , no matter how solvent , could pay such interest rates , for two decades , while waiting to recoup the cost from the generation of power .
In March 1981 , Wall Streets Merrill Lynch issued a report recommending the cancellation of 18 nuclear plants , because of the financing costs .
Utility bond sales were cancelled by financial houses .
Six months later , Boston Edisons Pilgrim - 2 plant was cancelled , as the cost had escalated from $ 400 million to $ 4 billion , simply because of the schedule stretch - out and high interest rates .
Figure 3
ENVIRONMENTAL DELAYS AND USURIOUS FINANCE CHARGES SENT THE COST OF NUCLEAR POWER ZOOMING UPWARD Nuclear power is not intrinsically expensive .
What drove nuclear plant costs up were environmentalist delays ( caused by anti-nuclear intervenors  and the high interest financing rates both perpetrated by those who wanted to kill nuclear power , and who now complain that nuclear costs too much .
Shown here , in dollars per kilowatt are the rising costs of financing , environmentalist delays , and construction materials increases for nuclear ( N ) and the rising costs for comparable coal - fired plants ( C ) with sulfur removal .
Source : Electric Power Research Institute In August 1981 , the Washington Public Power Supply System ( WPPSS ) in Washington state , had its credit rating cut by Moodys Investors Service , and bond underwriters demanded that both the interest and principal on the loans had to be repaid before the nuclear plants generated any electricity or revenues .
Of the five planned reactors , two were mothballed and two were cancelled .
As a result of the environmental legal sabotage , the construction time was projected to be 12 to 14 years .
WPPSS estimated that it would cost $ 12.1 billion to finish the two units , and that $ 8 billion of that cost would be interest charges on long - term bonds two thirds of the total cost .
If the four nuclear plants planned by WPPSS had been completed , providing an additional 5,000 MW of electric generating capacity , even this years drought in the Pacific Northwest would not have led to the crisis in energy supply that the region is now suffering .
By the time the last nuclear power plant came on line in the last decade , it was no wonder that its cost of producing electricity was not competitive with other sources .
The actual cost of building plants had been declining for years , as seen in Figure 3 .
But the costs of dragging out construction for decades , and paying a kings ransom to borrow money , as well as the fear any utility would have of starting a project that could put it into bankruptcy court , had driven nuclear power out of the energy picture .

Nuclear power plants that should have cost between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion , had their final costs escalate up to 10 times that amount , over the course of construction , thanks to unreasonable regulations by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , and the stretch - out of schedules over bogus environmental and safety  concerns .
Note that GE and other U.S. firms currently build 1,000 MW and larger nuclear units in Japan , Korea , and Taiwan in 4 to 5 years .

The energy crisis over the past year in California , and public recognition in New York and other states that the failure to build power plants over the last decade means there will be shortages , has resurrected an interest in nuclear energy in the United States .
The Nuclear Energy Institute reports that a group of utility executives approached the organization last year , to set up a task force to examine what would be necessary to deploy a new nuclear plant .
The idea is to form a consortium of companies that would order perhaps 10 or 20 plants , which would be standardized and would benefit from economies of scale of production .
No matter what plans the nuclear industry may put together , however , only a complete reversal of the financial and political policies that have wrecked the development and deployment of nuclear technology over the past 40 years will make a difference .

My name is Moss David Posner .
I have been a physician with the California Department of Corrections for almost five years , before I was forced out .
I ’m putting my burden down now .
I ’m out of the picture , but I want to say a few things to you :
Here ’s the threat : AB 1539 defines permanent incapacitation , which is the logical first step in compassionate release procedure .
If this is diluted down , which appears to be what is happening , virtually no inmate will be able to meet the standard for compassionate release .
AB . 1393 , was to have put teeth into requests for disclosure of public records , has been gutted by eliminating the order for punitive damages for any agency which refuses to cooperate with lawful requests for records ,
If there is --- literally — no way out , then the seriously ill inmates are boxed in between being kept in prison , on one side , and being denied appropriate medical care , on the other .
You have to push back on two fronts : first , the demand for the humane alternative of release of terminally incapacitated , and second , the demand for the needed care for everyone , especially those who are seriously ill .
In order to help you with the medical end of this dilemma , let me tell you why any hope of improving the medical care of the seriously ill is in such a mess as matters now stand .
Here are my credentials : I started out as a contractor , a staff physician at Pelican Bay .
I went to Salinas Valley , where I was subsequently appointed the acting Chief Physician and Surgeon at Salinas Valley State Prison .
From there , I was transferred to the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility in Corcoran as the acting Chief Medical Officer .
From there , I then transferred to Corcoran - 1 and asked by the then - Chief Medical Officer Dr. John Klarich to be the Chief Physician .
When I complained about an anti-Semitic death threat , on paper and as defined by a yard captain , my appointment to the chief physician job was cancelled .
Dr. Klarich told me this to my face .
I have won round one of an action against the Department , and now am waiting on the result of an appellate hearing , which of course the department insisted on .
You see — that was my crime : trying to help inmates .
Let me fill out your picture of what really happens in the medical department .
I ran into brick walls everywhere I went .
I worked 14 - hour days at SATF , arriving early and not leaving until the restaurants in town closed .
I spent hours each night speaking with distressed relatives , and doing whatever I could to make life more bearable for these unfortunate men .
I kept detailed files on my computer so that I could have the information at my fingertips should any attorney called — and call they did .
They deeply appreciated my help .
I even got compliments from the prison law office , and they were upset when I was transferred .
You would think that all this would be appreciated and encouraged .
You would think so --- but you would be wrong .
The California Department of Corrections does n’t want to help their doctors give quality care .
I cannot count the number of times our requests for consults , requests for outside assistance , requests for equipment were ignored , even laughed at .
Our orders were ignored .
Some Correctional officers would just ignore appointments with us and with outside consultants .
Officers would routinely throw out appliances desperately needed by inmates , when they transferred to other facilities .
Orders for important treatments were ignored , and many cases just cancelled .
Here ’s what happens to doctors : I ’ve never been sued in 43 years of practice .
I actually saw a Chief Physician , without my knowledge or permission , take over the care of my patient , changing my orders three times , and then when he realized I was right and he was wrong , changed the orders — again , and then , based upon his care , turned around and reported me to the medical board for what he had done .
Go figure .
A word about the cops ; A wise man once said , “ stuff rolls downhill . ”
I do n’t excuse any form of wrongdoing ; but even so , keep in mind that , like the rest of us , the cops are subject to enormous peer pressure and pressure from those in charge .
That ’s no excuse , but do n’t think for one moment that these guys are all acting on their own .
The one who sets the tone and the way things are done is the warden ; and he is totally responsible for everything that happens in that institution — and I mean , everything , including death threats .
We filed petitions .
We met with officials — all resulting in nothing .
I wrote letters to Judge Henderson , to the Receiver , Robert Sillen .
I got nowhere .
We got nowhere .
Do n’t misunderstand : I ’m not sticking up for bad care ; but I want you to understand what that “ bad care ” actually means .
You are all good people .
You are not responsible for the mistakes made by your children and loved ones .
You do n’t -- and your loved ones in prison do n’t -- deserve the kind of care they ’re getting .
Animals get better care .
At least my cat did .

Court upholds CIA 's power to keep president 's daily briefing secret SAN FRANCISCO UC Davis professor had sought access to '60s documents
The CIA 's top - secret daily briefings for the president on intelligence information must remain secret , even 40 years later , if the agency reasonably concludes that disclosure would compromise national security , a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday .
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a UC Davis political science professor and historian was not entitled to any portion of the CIA 's briefings to President Lyndon Johnson for two days during the Vietnam War , Aug. 6 , 1965 , and April 2 , 1968 .
A lawyer for the professor said those dates were important for his research on the war .
The CIA has briefed presidents daily since the Kennedy administration .
The briefings gained new prominence four years ago during a commission 's inquiry into the Sept. 11 terror attacks , when President Bush disclosed that the CIA had told him in August 2001 that Osama bin Laden was determined to strike within the United States .
Of the more than 13,500 briefs in existence , the court said at least 25 have been made public , either accidentally or with the CIA 's approval .
The UC Davis professor , Larry Berman , argued that those documents showed that historically valuable information could be disclosed safely while sensitive material was blacked out .
The CIA countered that the documents were exempted from public - records laws under a statute that orders the national intelligence director to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure .
The appeals court stopped short of an absolute exemption but said CIA records were entitled to " near - blanket " secrecy under federal law .
In this case , the court said , the agency 's information review officer said every word in the two documents must be withheld because they identified the CIA 's sources and methods .
" Judges are poorly positioned to evaluate the sufficiency of the CIA 's intelligence claims " and must defer to the agency 's judgment , Judge Raymond Fisher said in the 3 - 0 ruling , which upheld a lower court decision .
He also cited the CIA 's assertion that disclosure of confidential sources , even from 40 years ago , would make it harder for the agency to persuade potential new sources that their identities would be protected .
That rationale might become weaker " four or five generations later , " but must be accepted now , Fisher said .
Berman 's lawyer , Thomas Burke , said he was encouraged that the court had n't granted permanent , ironclad secrecy to all such documents .
But he said the CIA declaration on which the appeals court relied was a boiler - plate statement that could have applied to any president 's brief .
Briefings from the 1960s that have been released contain " a substantial amount of information about governments that no longer exist , leaders that are no longer alive and information that would not compromise sources , " Burke said .
" We were n't asking for anything that could compromise national security . "
SABLE - 3 was launched on Saturday , August 11th , 2007 , at 9:31 AM with a payload , consisting of a Nikon Coolpix P2 digital camera set to take 1 image every minute and a Byonics MicroTrak 300 APRS Tracker , that the Kaysam 1200 gram balloon carried to over 117,597 feet .
The last payload camera photo from the ground was just before it was launched , at 9:31 AM , and the last photo before the balloon burst was the photo above , at 12:01 PM , exactly 2 ½ hours or 150 images later .
And what a photo .
The composition could n't have been better or the horizon more level and out of the 196 images taken during the flight , only 1 other image is as good .
What are the chances ?
MP3 music - it 's better than it sounds
Whether you know it or not , that compact disc you just copied to your MP3 player is only partially there .
With the CD on its way out and computer files taking over as the primary means of hearing recorded music , the artificial audio of MP3s is quickly becoming the primary way people listen to music .
Apple already has sold 100 million iPods , and more than a billion MP3 files are traded every month through the Internet .
[ MP3 : Just because it 's digital , does n't mean it sounds good . ]
But the music contained in these computer files represents less than 10 percent of the original music on the CDs .
In its journey from CD to MP3 player , the music has been compressed by eliminating data that computer analysis deems redundant , squeezed down until it fits through the Internet pipeline .
When even the full files on the CDs contain less than half the information stored to studio hard drives during recording , these compressed MP3s represent a minuscule fraction of the actual recording .
For purists , it 's the dark ages of recorded sound .
" You can get used to awful , " says record producer Phil Ramone .
" You can appreciate nothing .
We 've done it with fast food . "
Ramone , who has recorded everyone from Frank Sinatra to the Rolling Stones , was a musical prodigy who graduated from Juilliard at 16 .
He won the first of his nine Grammys in 1965 for the classic album " Getz / Gilberto . "
He is not alone in the upper ranks of his profession in decrying the state of audio , even though millions of dollars have been spent building high - tech digital recording studios .
" We 're pretty happy with what we send out , " says engineer Al Schmitt , winner of 15 Grammys for records by artists from Henry Mancini to Diana Krall .
" What happens after that , we have no control over that anymore . "
These studio professionals bring their experience and expensive , modern technology to bear on their work ; they 're scrupulous and fastidious .
Then they hear their work played back on an iPod through a pair of plastic earbuds .
Ask Ramone how it feels to hear his work on MP3s , and he does n't mince words .
" It 's painful , " he says .
MP3s have won the war of the formats because of technology , not because of their audio quality .
" It 's like hearing through a screen door , " says neuroscientist Daniel Levitin of McGill University , author of " This Is Your Brain on Music . "
" There are lines between me and what I want to see . "
But what is the price of inferior audio quality ?
Can poor audio touch the heart as deeply as better sound ?
John Meyer , who designs and builds some of the world 's best speakers at his Meyer Sound Labs in Berkeley , does n't think so .
" It turns you into an observer , " Meyer says .
" It forces the brain to work harder to solve it all the time .
Any compression system is based on the idea you can throw data away , and that 's proved tricky because we do n't know how the brain works . "
It could be that MP3s actually reach the receptors in our brains in entirely different ways than analog phonograph records .
The difference could be as fundamental as which brain hemisphere the music engages .
" Poorer - fidelity music stimulates the brain in different ways , " says Dr. Robert Sweetow , head of UCSF audiology department .
" With different neurons , perhaps lesser neurons , stimulated , there are fewer cortical neurons connected back to the limbic system , where the emotions are stored . "
But Sweetow also notes that music with lyrics may act entirely differently on a cerebral level than instrumental music .
" The words trigger the emotion , " he says .
" But those words are n't necessarily affected by fidelity . "
Certainly '50s and '60s teens got the message of the old rock ' n ' roll records through cheap plastic transistor radios .
Levitin remembers hearing Sly and the Family Stone 's " Hot Fun in the Summertime " on just such a portable radio , an ancient ancestor of the iPod .
" It was crap , but it sounded great , " he says .
" All the essential stuff comes through that inch - and - a - half speaker . "
Levitin also says that Enrico Caruso and Billie Holiday can probably move him more than Michael Bolton or Mariah Carey under any fidelity .
" If the power of the narrative of the movie is n't there , " he says metaphorically , " there 's only so far cinematography can take you . "
Most of today 's pop records are already compressed before they leave the studio in the first place , so the process may matter less to artists like Maroon 5 or Justin Timberlake .
Other kinds of music , in which subtlety , detail and shaded tonalities are important , may suffer more harm at the hands of the algorithms .
" When you listen to a world - class symphony or a good jazz record , " says Schmitt , " and you hear all the nuance in the voices , the fingers touching the string on the bass , the key striking the string on the piano , that 's just a wonderful sensation . "
How much the audio quality is affected by the MP3 process depends on the compression strategy , the encoder used , the playback equipment , computer speed and many other steps along the way .
Experts agree , however , that the audio quality of most MP3s is somewhere around FM radio .
The best digital audio , even with increased sampling rates and higher bit rates , still falls short of the natural quality of now - obsolete analog tape recording .
EMI Records announced earlier this year the introduction of higher - priced downloads at a slightly higher bit rate , although the difference will be difficult to detect .
" It 's probably indistinguishable to even a great set of ears , " says Levitin .
How good MP3s sound obviously also depends greatly on the playback system .
But most MP3s are heard through cheap computer speakers , plastic iPod docking stations or , worse yet , those audio abominations called earbuds .
The ease of distribution means that MP3s are turning up everywhere , even places where they probably should n't .
Schmitt , who has won the award more times than anyone else , is incredulous that the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences posts MP3s of nominees for the best engineering Grammy .
" As if you could tell anything from that , " he sneers .
For digital audio to substantially improve , several major technological hurdles will have to be cleared .
The files will have to be stored at higher sampling rates and higher bit rates .
Computing power will have to grow .
New playback machines will have to be introduced ( Ramone thinks high - definition television is the model for something that could be " HD audio " ) .
If the Internet is going to be the main delivery system for music in the future , as appears to be the case , Internet bandwidth will also be a factor .
" The Internet is in charge now , " says Ramone , " and it has all kinds of wobbles .
You have wires hanging out of windows and things like that .
That 's just the way things have to be because the Internet is in transition . "
Meanwhile , most music listeners do n't know what they 're missing .
They listen to MP3s on shiny chrome machines and plastic earpieces , and what they hear is what they get .
But what 's being lost is not replaced by the convenience .
In effect , sound reproduction is caught in a technological wrinkle that may take years to straighten out .
" This is a transition phase , " says McGill 's Levitin .
" It 's having an effect on the culture , no question , but it 's temporary .
... ( But ) it may be around for a while . "
A glossary of digital audio terms
A glossary of terms that describe different types of digital audio :
MP3 : What has become a generic name for compressed audio files was originally taken from a set of video and audio compression standards known as MPEG ( Moving Pictures Experts Group ) . .
There are many codecs , or compression programs ( Apple converts CDs to an AAC file on iPods ) , but most reduce the file to about 6 percent of its original size .
WAV : The standard computer audio file stores data at 44,100 samples per second , 16 bits per sample ( although recording studios are commonly equipped with 24 - bit technology ) .
WAV files are uncompressed and written to compact discs in Red Book audio , which adapts the file for compact disc players .
AIFF : Most professional audio is saved in these large files that use about 10 megabytes for every minute of stereo audio .
FLAC : This codec , favored by Grateful Dead tape traders , stands for Free Lossless Audio Code .
It reduces storage space by 30 to 50 percent , but without compression .
A full audio CD can be burned from the file , unlike from MP3s .

PERHAPS THE ONLY issue in which there is near - total bipartisan unity in Washington is opposition to the draft .
Those who oppose continuing the war in Iraq object to the draft for obvious reasons .
But supporters of the president ’s Iraq policy should not get off so easily .
By vetoing the initial Iraq war supplemental spending bill because it contained a timetable for withdrawal , President Bush clearly believes that a substantial number of U.S. troops will be needed in Iraq for an indefinite period of time .
But how are we going to sustain operations in Iraq beyond 12 to 18 months ?
The president insists that setting a withdrawal timetable will tie the hands of commanders on the ground , but it is not the timetable that will tie their hands .
It is the breaking of the U.S. Army .
Currently , our ground forces , specifically the Army , are stretched to their limits .
Our soldiers and Marines have been fighting in Iraq for more than four years and in Afghanistan for almost six .
To meet the demands of the president ’s surge , the Army is scrambling to find enough troops .
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates has already been forced to extend tours for soldiers serving in Iraq from 12 to 15 months .
Soldiers are being sent back to Iraq for their second and third deployments ; some have not even been home a year before being sent back .
Many new recruits are being sent into intense combat in Baghdad without proper training .
And in some cases , the Army has been so desperate that , as Mark Benjamin of Salon magazine first reported , it is even forcing injured soldiers back into combat before they have adequately recovered .
Retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey recently remarked that “ the ground combat capability of the U.S. armed forces is shot . ”
Meanwhile , the National Guard is in even worse shape .
The head of the National Guard has said that 90 % of the Army National Guard is poorly equipped , raising real questions about the Guard ’s ability to respond to disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the tornado that wiped out Greensburg , Kan .
Yet more than 13,000 Guardsmen have been notified that they likely will be sent back to Iraq in 2008 .
The Army was simply not built to fight protracted ground wars like the one in Iraq .
After the draft was ended in 1973 , the current all - volunteer system was created out of the mind - set of “ no more Vietnams . ”
The Army was intended to be a small , highly trained fighting force that would act in an initial - response capacity to repel and counter the Soviets or other aggressors .
In the event of a major conflict , the active - duty Army would be supported in the short and medium term by the National Guard and Reserves .
But if a conflict were to grow in length or intensity , the Army would revert to the draft .
The all - volunteer force was not put in place to be an alternative to conscription but was intended to be a bridge to it .
This is why we require young men to register with the Selective Service System when they turn 18 .
Although the president and his administration have insisted that operations in Iraq will be difficult and will take a long time , Bush has done nothing to seriously prepare for such a long - term commitment .
Considering the current state of the Army , if the president wants to sustain a substantial number of U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the next 18 months , he should call for reinstating the draft .
That would be the responsible path .
Yet the president will never call for the draft .
He knows the country would never support the level of sacrifice for this war that implementing a draft would demand .
But this is one of the very reasons why the all - volunteer Army was designed the way it was — to prevent a commander in chief from fighting a war that lacks the support of the public .
Instead , the president will lean even more heavily on those who have already served .
As a result , troops will be sent back for their third , fourth and fifth deployments ; through “ stop - loss ” orders , soldiers will be prevented from leaving the service even though they have fulfilled their term of duty ; deployments will be extended even longer ; and the National Guard and Reserves will stay on duty in Iraq , further depleting our already thin domestic response capability .
In the end , the president will not only be unable to stabilize Iraq , he will have destroyed the finest army the world has known .
If the president is committed to fighting the war in Iraq over the long term , instead of simply running out the clock on his presidency , he should have the courage of his convictions and call for reinstating the draft .
If not , the only responsible course is to set a timetable to bring the troops home .
Warning !
There are many , many plot spoilers about BlackSite : Area 51 in this column .
In most respects , BlackSite : Area 51 is a totally run -of - the - mill first - person shooter .
You 're a soldier !
You 're fighting alongside gruff teammates , and infiltrating military bases that have been overrun by insectoid aliens !
You 've got big nasty machine guns and kooky , hijacked alien weapons !
It 's all so rote and derivative that I could almost squint and imagine I was playing Halo , Half - Life or even Quake .
Until the characters start talking about Abu Ghraib .
One of your teammates is a military doctor who describes how she mistreated some prisoners in a government prison .
" I think we all started to lose our minds a little bit , " she says .
" We were isolated , no oversight – no one to tell us it was torture . "
" Chickenshit politicians and doctors , " replies an angry soldier .
" They try to cover it all up . "
And this , my friends , makes BlackSite a weirdly unusual game .
Many videogames include fantasy and sci-fi politics – but BlackSite directly tackles the most divisive political issues of our real - life world .
Onscreen soldiers gripe about the wisdom of the Iraq war , the ethics of torture , the hypocrisy of politicians and , perhaps most incendiary , the way Pentagon and White House cover - ups leave rank - and - file fighters to be imprisoned or die for mistakes made by guys in suits and ties .
It 's rather amazing to watch a game designer – specifically Harvey Smith , studio creative director for Midway Games – run into this minefield .
In his game , the soldiers are persistently cynical about their commanding officers , and wearily accept the grim ironies of modern statecraft .
They learn , for example , that the gibbering alien enemies we 're fighting in the game were armed , trained and basically created by the United States – a straightforward allusion to how America , by sponsoring Afghan mujahedeen to fight the Soviets in the ' 80s , essentially trained the same people who attack us today .
At one point , after finishing off an opponent , one of my teammates cocks his gun and shouts , " Kick - ass American engineering , baby ! " – at which point another soldier replies , " I hate to break it to you , but those are mass - produced in China . "
Then we 're sent into a U.S. town to quell an uprising of insurgents , but run into aliens instead .
" Anyone mention this creepy - crawly shit to you ? " asks my squad member .
" Nah , " replies another sardonically .
" Army never knows what 's going on . "
( Later , we plead for a departing helicopter to come back and save us , only to be told , " Negative – I have ranking political staff onboard . " )
I realize this sounds pretty heavy - handed ( and if you disagree with the game 's political point of view , you 'll probably hate it ) .
Yet BlackSite does n't really come at you with a bludgeon :
The designers for the most part weave in the political commentary quite deftly and organically .
They 're aided by truly superb voice acting :
It 's by turns dry , funny and serious , and almost never descends into the sort of hysterical overacting that plagues most sci- fi shooters .
At the point in the game where the U.S. government 's duplicity is revealed , the soldiers get into an argument about military duty and everyday ethics that reads like a superb snippet of Broadway theater .
Videogames , of course , have often employed conspiracies , corrupt governments and sleeper cells .
But normally they take place in fantasy realms , where some repressive " one world government " runs the globe .
Allegorically , the evil overlords are usually re-skinned Soviets , Nazis , Arabs – or , in a nod to the fever dreams of the canned - tuna - hoarding far right , the United Nations .
When you play these games , you 're essentially playing as a warrior for the American dream – fighting for freedom against an oppressive elite .
What 's so thoroughly remarkable about BlackSite is that the corrupt authority is n't a far - off futuristic one .
It 's the present - day U.S. government – under the helm of folks like President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
( They 're not explicitly named , but the game takes place in the present , and the names of the episodes in the game – " Misunderestimated , " " Stay the Course , " " Last Throes , " " The Surge " – are taken directly from these leaders ' utterances . )
This makes BlackSite one of the few genuinely subversive games I 've ever played .
By reframing who 's fighting – and why – it upends all the blasé tropes of its genre .
Indeed , it forces you to think again about the politics of most other shooters , which are so slavishly devoted to an us-versus - them worldview that you 'd swear they were designed by the Project for the New American Century .
Not in BlackSite .
There , the world is messy and complex – and you 're left with the Pogo - like sense that the enemy might , in the end , be you .
At one point , I get into a fierce firefight with some heavily armed guards at an Iraqi refinery .
" Who gives assault weapons to refinery workers ? " wonders one of my bewildered squad mates .
" Um , " says another , " I think they bought this shit from us . "
Ouch .

Publisher : McClellan is n't alleging Bush took part in ' conspiracy to mislead ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

This A bombshell excerpt from a new book by former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan was not an allegation that President Bush helped to mislead the public about the outing of ex-CIA agent Valerie Plame , the book 's publisher told CNN .
" I just got off the phone with the publisher of McClellan 's new book , and he tells me that McClellan does not charge in the book that the president himself was involved in any kind of conspiracy to mislead the public , " reported CNN correspondent Jessica Yellin .
" But of course , in the publisher 's words , ' Scott did go out to take bullets without the proper flak jacket on . ' "
In a series of 2003 press conferences , the former top White House spokesman had maintained that neither then - advisor Karl Rove nor Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , Scooter Libby , had been involved in the leaking of Plame 's identity as a CIA agent .
Yellin pointed to a previous interview with Larry King Live , in which McClellan suggested that both he and the president had been mislead about the Plame affair .
" It was also what the president believed at the time based on assurances we were both given , " McClellan had told King .
" Knowing what I know today , I would have never said that back then ... I said that those individuals assured me they were not involved in this .
I did speak directly with them and I was careful about the way I phrased it at them time -- even though I believed what they had told me to be the truth . "
In one September press conference in 2003 , McClellan said that Rove , Libby and another senior administration staffer had all denied being connected to Plame 's outing .
" I spoke with those individuals , as I pointed out , " said McClellan , " and those individuals assured me they were not involved in this .
And that 's where it stands . "
McClellan 's book , called What Happened , contains an excerpt on the Plame affair -- which was revealed Tuesday on the website of the book 's publisher .
" The most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , " writes McClellan .
" So I stood at the White house briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the senior - most aides in the White House : Karl Rove and Scooter Libby . "
The next portion of the released blurb aroused speculation that McClellan was charging the president of intentionally pushing false information to the media .
" There was one problem .
It was not true , " McClellan continues , describing his statements before the White House press corps .
" I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice President , the President 's chief of staff , and the president himself . "

On this morning 's Fox News Sunday , Chris Wallace interviewed former President George H.W. Bush at his Presidential Library in Texas .
Bush defends his son's disastrous presidency , but later in the interview as he and Wallace stood in a mock up of a tent used by U.S. soldiers during the first Gulf War , he vehemently defended his decision not to march on to Baghdad in 1991 .
While watching footage of news clips from the conflict , Poppy becomes emotional when he describes what he believes to be the most lasting images from the conflict -- the humane way in which the U.S. treated Iraqi prisoners .
Wallace : " The President remembered the courage and humanity of American soldiers and he grew emotional . "
Bush : " My favorite picture is a picture of American soldiers surrounding a guy whose been in a foxhole , Iraqi soldier , and the American guy says , we 're not going to harm you , we 're American soldiers . " ( fights back tears ) Bush : " ... See , that side of the war never got -- the fact that we treated those people with respect in spite of the fact they were the enemy , it 's really good .
Sadly , Mr. Bush would now be considered a coward and a terrorist sympathizer by his own party for these views .
Go ahead and let it out , sir -- the nation weeps with you for what your son has done in our name .

A quarter of Germans believe Nazi rule had its good points , a poll suggested yesterday .
They were asked whether they agreed that National Socialism had positive aspects such as ' the highway system , elimination of unemployment , low criminality rate and the encouragement of the family ' .
While 70 per cent said No , 25 per cent said Yes .
The survey was commissioned by Stern magazine after a talk show hostess was fired for praising the Nazis ' attitude toward motherhood .
Eva Herman , 48 , said at a book launch that while there was ' much that was very bad , for example Adolf Hitler , ' there were good things , ' for example the high regard for the mother ' under the Nazis .
She later explained : " What I wanted to express was that values which also existed before the Third Reich , such as family , children and motherhood , which were supported in the Third Reich , were subsequently done away with . "
Praising the 1933 - 45 Nazi dictatorship is taboo in Germany .
The poll suggested that those aged 60 or older had the highest regard for aspects of the era , with 37 per cent answering Yes .
Those who grew up directly after the war , now aged 45 to 59 , were the least enthusiastic , with only 15 per cent responding Yes .
Appearances can be deceptive , the researchers say
A Queen's University , Ontario , team examined volunteers ' walks and the levels of sex hormones in their saliva .
They found those with alluring walks were the furthest away from ovulation .
A British expert said the research , featured by New Scientist magazine , supported the idea women disguise their fertility to deter unsuitable partners .
' Surprising results '
Women give a wide variety of subtle signals to men to advertise the fact that they are ready to conceive and Meghan Provost , the lead researcher , had expected a " sexy " , hip - swinging walk to be one of those .
If women are trying to protect themselves from sexual assault at times of peak fertility , it would make sense for them to advertise attractiveness ... when they are not fertile
Meghan Provost , lead researcher
She analysed the gait of female volunteers , showed video clips to 40 men , asking them to rate the attractiveness of the way the women walked , and then matched the results to the hormone tests .
She said the results , published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior , were so surprising that she had repeated the experiment again with another group of male viewers .
The women who were most fertile at the time of the experiment walked with fewer hip movements and with their knees closer together .
She now thinks the findings tally with other research suggesting that women want to conceal their ovulation from males other than their chosen partner .
Monogamy
A sexy walk would be too obvious , so women are thought to use changes in smell and facial expressions that can be experienced only at close range .
Ms Provost said : " If women are trying to protect themselves from sexual assault at times of peak fertility , it would make sense for them to advertise attractiveness on a broad scale when they are not fertile . "
Dr John Manning , from the University of Central Lancashire , agreed with this theory .
He said it was in a woman 's best interests to form a closer attachment to one man to help raise children , rather than to advertise her fertile time and be approached by a larger number of competing males .
He said : " I think that the subtle signs of ovulation are used , in a sense , to promote monogamy .
" If you want to pick up on these , you have to be already living with , or close to , the woman , so this constrains the man into daily attendance on a woman . "
The Libby Motion
Perhaps inadvertently , Mr. Bush ’s decision to grant a commutation rather than an outright pardon has started a national conversation about sentencing generally .
“ By saying that the sentence was excessive , I wonder if he understood the ramifications of saying that , ” said Ellen S. Podgor , who teaches criminal law at Stetson University in St. Petersburg , Fla .
“ This is opening up a can of worms about federal sentencing . ”
The Libby clemency will be the basis for many legal arguments , said Susan James , an Alabama lawyer representing Don E. Siegelman , the state ’s former governor , who is appealing a sentence he received last week of 88 months for obstruction of justice and other offenses .
“ It ’s far more important than if he ’d just pardoned Libby , ” Ms. James said , as forgiving a given offense as an act of executive grace would have had only political repercussions .
“ What you ’re going to see is people like me quoting President Bush in every pleading that comes across every federal judge ’s desk . ”
Indeed , Mr. Bush ’s decision may have given birth to a new sort of legal document .
“ I anticipate that we ’re going to get a new motion called ‘ the Libby motion , ’ ” Professor Podgor said .
“ It will basically say , ‘ My client should have got what Libby got , and here ’s why . ’ ”
Chinese firm Lenovo insists it is not a state - owned enterprise
Assistant Secretary of State Richard Griffin said the department would also alter its procurement process to ensure US information security was guaranteed .
His comments came after Rep Frank Wolf expressed national security concerns .
The company Lenovo insisted such concerns were unwarranted and said the computers posed no security risk .
Last year , Lenovo - the world 's number three PC maker - bought the IBM PC Division and moved its executive headquarters from China to the US .
A Chinese government agency owns 28 percent of Lenovo , while IBM still has about a 13 percent stake in the company .
' Classified network '
In a letter to Mr Wolf , Mr Griffin said government security experts had recommended the computers " be utilised on unclassified systems only " .
He said the government was committed to ensuring the purchase would not " compromise our information and communication channels " .
And he said the state department would change the way it buys its technology " in light of the changing ownership of IT equipment providers . "
His letter did not refer to Mr Wolf 's specific concern that at least 900 of the computers were to be used " as part of the classified network deployed in the United States and around the world in embassies and consulates " .
Mr Wolf , Republican chairman of the committee that oversees the department 's funds , told reporters that China 's spying efforts were " frightening " .
It was " no secret that the US is a principal target of Chinese intelligence services " , he said , adding : " No American government agency should want to purchase from them " .
' No security risk '
But Lenovo insisted the state department computers , which were made at former IBM facilities in North Carolina and Mexico , posed no security threat .
" We are absolutely confident in the security of our manufacturing process , " Jeff Carlisle , the firm 's vice - president of government relations , said .
" These computers do not present a risk to US security . "
He said the Chinese Academy of Sciences , an arm of the Chinese government , had a " minority interest " in the company and was not involved in its day - to - day operations .
" We 're not a state - owned enterprise , " Mr Carlisle added .

Here ’s Why Yankees Fans Are n’t the Only Ones Rooting Against the Red Sox
Earlier this year , Massachusetts furniture chain Jordan ’s Furniture announced a marketing gimmick that would delight any diehard Red Sox fan : if the Sox went on to win the 2007 World Series , all furniture sales made between March 7 and April 16 of this year would be refunded .
The chain , which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , sensibly bought an insurance policy to cover the possibility of a Sox victory .
While Jordan ’s declined recently to comment to Freakonomics.com on any details , the chain ’s CEO earlier told TheRedSoxTimes.com that he had “ bought insurance that is going to cover the whole thing .
I would never have done it if I was going to be rooting against the Red Sox , let ’s put it that way . ”
The full cost of the promotion reportedly amounted to the “ license fee paid to the Red Sox to use their name , advertising spots , and a little bit of insurance . ”
Meanwhile Jordan ’s executives reportedly estimated that the promotion ’s total sales might top $ 20 million .
In Chicago , meanwhile , Cubs fans got a similar chance when Park Avenue Home Furnishings in Libertyville , Ill. announced it was offering a full refund for all goods bought between March 30 and April 29 if the Cubs went all the way .
Andy Alexson , the store ’s owner , told Freakonomics.com that he purchased a Lloyds of London policy for 2 percent of the promotion ’s total sales .
“ It was nothing , ” he said , “ it was like [ buying ] an ad in the paper . ”
The policy stated that “ if the Cubs win , we rebate everything including tax , delivery , everything . ”
It also stipulated that Alexson had to regularly report sales figures , which he hoped would total between $ 500,000 and $ 700,000 during the promotion .
“ But the sale did n’t go anywhere near as well as I ’d hoped because the Cubs sucked in April , ” he said , “ and then a competitor complained to the state attorney general that my offer was a gambling offer , so I had to debate it .
We fought the attorney general over it , and argued you ’re getting value for your purchase . ”
A month later , Alexson looked into doing another promotion , this time for the White Sox , and was told that Lloyds now wanted 18 percent of total sales , since the team had played so well two years earlier .
The Boston promotion caused a stir with Massachusetts authorities after locals raised charges of illegal gambling , according to the Boston Globe .
Because of the high ticket items available for rebate , along with the substantial risk involved , debate arose over whether the sales were lotteries , classified as illegal gambling in both states .
Ultimately , the Massachusetts Attorney General ruled that the sale showed “ no evidence of consumer harm , ” and let Jordan ’s alone .
Still , there ’s at least one party outside of New York and Cleveland rooting firmly against the Sox this year : whoever holds the Jordan ’s insurance policy .
Update : The Sox have indeed won the series , sweeping the Cleveland Indians , and claims are pouring in at Jordan ’s Headquarters .
Eliot Tatelman , president and CEO of Jordans , is reportedly refusing to release the total value of qualifying rebates , as well as the total cost of the insurance policy that will cover them .

REYKJAVIK , Iceland ( CNN ) --
Iceland may be best known for world - famous musical export Bjork but there 's a new star quickly gaining this island nation worldwide acclaim -- clean energy .
This hydrogen fuel cell car is leading an energy revolution in Iceland .
more photos »
For more than 50 years Iceland has been decreasing its dependence on fossil fuels by tapping the natural power all around this rainy , windswept rock of fire .
Waterfalls , volcanoes , geysers and hot springs provide Icelanders with abundant electricity and hot water .
Virtually all of the country 's electricity and heating comes from domestic renewable energy sources -- hydroelectric power and geothermal springs .
It 's pollution - free and cheap .
Yet these energy pioneers are still dependent on imported oil to operate their vehicles and thriving fishing industry .
Iceland 's geographic isolation in the North Atlantic makes it expensive to ship in gasoline -- it costs almost $ 8 a gallon ( around $ 2 a liter ) .
Iceland ranks 53rd in the world in greenhouse gas emissions per capita , according to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center -- the primary climate - change data and information analysis center of the U.S. Department of Energy .
Retired University of Iceland Professor Bragi Arnason has come up with a solution : Use hydrogen to power transportation .
Hydrogen is produced with water and electricity , and Iceland has lots of both .
" Iceland is the ideal country to create the world 's first hydrogen economy , " Arnason explains .
His big idea has earned him the nickname " Professor Hydrogen . "
Arnason has caught the attention of General Motors , Toyota and DaimlerChrysler , who are using the island - nation as a test market for their hydrogen fuel cell prototypes .
One car getting put through its paces is the Mercedes Benz A - class F- cell -- an electric car powered by a DaimlerChrysler fuel cell .
Fuel cells generate electricity by converting hydrogen and oxygen into water .
And fuel cell technology is clean -- the only by - product is water .
Watch the F - cell navigate through Reykjavik »
" It 's just like a normal car , " says Asdis Kritinsdottir , project manager for Reykjavik Energy .
Except the only pollution coming out of the exhaust pipe is water vapor .
It can go about 100 miles on a full tank .
When it runs out of fuel the electric battery kicks in , giving the driver another 18 miles -- hopefully enough time to get to a refueling station .
Filling the tank is similar to today 's cars -- attach a hose to the car 's fueling port , hit " start " on the pump and stand back .
The process takes about five to six minutes .

In 2003 , Reykjavik opened a hydrogen fueling station to test three hydrogen fuel cell buses .
The station was integrated into an existing gasoline and diesel station .
The hydrogen gas is produced by electrolysis -- sending a current through water to split it into hydrogen and oxygen .
The public buses could run all day before needing refueling .
The bus project lasted three years and cost around $ 10 million .
The city will need five refueling stations in addition to the one the city already has to support its busy ring road , according to Arnason .
The entire nation could get by on 15 refueling stations -- a minimum requirement .
Within the year , 30 - 40 hydrogen fuel - cell cars will hit Reykjavik streets .
Local energy company employees will do most of the test - driving but three cars will be made available to The Hertz Corp. , giving Icelanders a chance to get behind the wheel .

" I need a car , " says Petra Svenisdottir , an intern at Reykjavik Energy .
Svenisdottir , 28 , commutes to work from her home in Hafnarfjorour to Reykjavik .
The journey takes her about 15 minutes if she can beat traffic .
" If I did n't have a car I would have to take two or three buses and wait at each bus stop to arrive at work more than an hour later , cold and wet ! "
Most Icelanders drive cars , says Arnason .
Around 300,000 people live in a place about the size of the U.S. state of Kentucky .
Transportation is limited to cars , buses and boats .
" Everyone has a car here , " Arnason says .
And it 's very typical for an Icelandic family to own two cars .
Arnason drives a small SUV .
Fuel cell cars are expected to go on sale to the public in 2010 .
Carmakers have promised Arnason they will keep costs down and the government has said it will offer citizens tax breaks .
He figures it will take an additional 4 percent of power to produce the hydrogen Iceland would need to meet its transportation requirements .
Once Iceland 's vehicles are converted over to hydrogen , the fishing fleet will follow .
It wo n't be easy because of current technological limits and the high cost of storing large amounts of hydrogen , but Arnason feels confident it can happen .
He predicts Iceland will be fossil fuel free by 2050 .
" We are a very small country but we have all the same infrastructure of big nations , " he said .
" We will be the prototype for the rest of the world . "

All About Alternative Fuel Vehicles • Alternative Energy Technology
In a series of recent studies , a team of researchers led by Peter H. Kim of the University of Southern California and Donald L. Ferrin of the University of Buffalo , now at Singapore Management University , had groups of business students rate the trustworthiness of a job applicant after learning that the person had committed an infraction at a previous job .
Participants watched a film of a job interview in which the applicant was confronted with the problem and either denied or apologized for it .
If the infraction was described as a mistake and the applicant apologized , viewers gave him the benefit of the doubt and said they would trust him with job responsibilities .
But if the infraction was described as fraud and the person apologized , viewers ’ trust evaporated — and even having evidence that he had been cleared of misconduct did not entirely restore that trust .
“ We concluded there is this skewed incentive system , ” Dr. Kim said .
“ If you are guilty of an integrity - based violation and you apologize , that hurts you more than if you are dishonest and deny it . ”
The system is skewed precisely because the people we rely on and value are imperfect , like everyone else , and not nearly as moral or trustworthy as they expect others to be .
If evidence of this were n’t abundant enough in everyday life , it came through sharply in a recent study led by Dan Ariely , a behavioral economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Dr. Ariely and two colleagues , Nina Mazar and On Amir , had 326 students take a multiple - choice general knowledge test , promising them payment for every correct answer .
The students were instructed to transfer their answers , for the official tally , onto a form with color - in bubbles for each numbered question .
But some of the students had the opportunity to cheat : they received bubble sheets with the correct answers seemingly inadvertently shaded in gray .
Compared with the others , they changed about 20 percent of their answers , and a follow - up study demonstrated that they were unaware of the magnitude of their dishonesty .
“ What we concluded is that good people can be dishonest up to the level where conscience kicks in , ” said Dr. Ariely , author of the book “ Predictably Irrational : The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions , ” due out next year .
“ That essentially you can fool the conscience a little bit and make small transgressions without waking it up .
It all goes under the radar because you are not paying that much attention . ”
It is a mistake to underestimate the power of simple attention .
People can be acutely aware of what they pay attention to and remarkably blind to what they do not , psychologists have found .
In real life , to be sure , casual denials of bad behavior require more than simple mental gymnastics , but inattention is a basic first ingredient .
Editors Weblog at the World Association of Newspapers notes that the Guardian now has a bigger audience online than the vaunted New York Times :
With 18.4 million users in October , the Guardian was ahead of nytimes.com , which registered 17.5 million users in the same period , according to Nielsen / NetRatings .
This was a record for both sites , as The New York Times ’ user pool grew due to the shutting down of TimesSelect , and the Guardian launched Guardian America .
Considering these recent results , the Guardian seems to be winning its bid to become the referential international news site .
Guardian Unlimited ’s US readership was already very strong before the launch of Guardian America .
And US readers are reportedly drawn to the British online editions .
Here I speculated on the impact on products and operations of once local or national news brands going international .
This also raises questions about business strategy — it ’s not easy selling advertising around the world .
But the race is indeed on : Who will lead at least the English - speaking universe ?
( Disclosure : I write and consult for the Guardian .
So I ’m rooting for them . )
Also : I found this clip via the still - in - beta journalists ’ bookmarking service , Publish2.com from Scott Karp ( and disclosure : I ’m on the board there so I ’m rooting for him , too .
You ’ll soon be there , too . )
LATER : Guardian writer Bobbie Johnson in the comments and another Guardian colleague in the email say that the Editors Weblog is comparing apples and kumquats here ; the stats are not equivalent .
It ’s still great growth and impressive size for both and the international question is still fascinating .
But the sun still does set on the British empire .
For now .
On the last weekend of August 2007 , tens of thousands of gamers descended upon downtown Seattle to attend the annual Penny Arcade Exposition ( PAX ) , simultaneously making it one of the most influential consumer - facing game conventions in the world .
Running PAX is a daunting task , reserved for a handful of full - time Penny Arcade ( PA ) staffers and supported by 300 high - powered volunteers .
Sporting long - sleeved black shirts with " Enforcer " emblazoned prominently on the back , they are the lifeblood that makes the PAX machine function .
They are visible and invisible , simultaneously omnipresent and scrambling behind the scenes to make sure everything runs according to schedule .
Enforcers come from all over the world .
Some live in downtown Seattle just blocks from the Washington State Convention and Trade Center ( WSCTC ) ; others come from California , Canada or even Australia .
" We have people who work in the medical field , lawyers , programmers , graphic and game designers , photographers , retail managers , people in the armed forces , writers , musicians , scientists , and a very awesome masseuse , " says one Enforcer , " Chiparoo . "
( Everyone goes by his online handle ; it makes thing less confusing over walkie - talkie . )
" There are lots of different shapes , sizes , styles , opinions and backgrounds , but we 're all connected simply because we are all some level of nerd . "
They 're a hardworking crew .
Even back in 2004 , when PAX was a round - the - clock affair , the Enforcers kept things organized .
" I was one of the first five people on the scene [ in ] ' 04 , worked 22 hours straight , slept for two hours with my head under a table , and then I returned to my regularly scheduled shift , " says " Heels , " an original Enforcer .
In 2004 , " Princess RedDot " ( better known as PRD ) , the PAX Chief of Staff , asked Penny Arcade fans for assistance and ended up with an initial group of 40 volunteers .
" There was never a doubt that we would need volunteers .
We had some pretty ambitious ideas for how many things we wanted to stage in one weekend , and it was going to take a lot more people than we had in the office . "
Since then , the Enforcer ranks have grown steadily .
In recent years , the number of applicants has skyrocketed .
For almost half of the current Enforcers , 2007 is their first PAX as part of " the Black . "
For them , life as an Enforcer actually starts sometime in late January when the call goes out for volunteers .
Some of them have prior experience staffing other conventions , but becoming part of an established community can be overwhelming for newcomers .
Being accepted as an Enforcer includes access to the private Enforcer forum and IRC channel .
" Once you sign up , you find you have about a hundred good friends you just do n't know yet , " says " MomGamer . "
The first official PAX activity takes place almost two weeks before the doors open to the public .
Preparation takes time , and over 100 volunteers show up to SAX , the pre-conference bag - stuffing session .
Volunteers slowly trickle into the building through a non-descript side entrance .
They are cheerfully greeted by " mygiantrobot , " who ushers them into an otherwise empty convention hall where volunteers are busy assembling over 20,000 gift bags .

LONDON — Shares of Carlyle Capital plunged on Thursday , losing most of their value , after the company said it expected its lenders to promptly take over all its assets after discussions with banks to refinance the fund failed .
Carlyle Capital , an Amsterdam - listed affiliate of the Carlyle Group , the private equity fund , said it “ has not been able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement to stabilize its financing . ”
Its shares fell more than 70 percent Thursday .
They have fallen more than 90 percent since the company ’s problems became public last week .
“ It has become apparent to the company that the basis on which lenders are willing to provide financing against the company ’s collateral has changed so substantially that a successful refinancing is not possible , ” Carlyle Capital said in a statement late Wednesday .
Carlyle Capital invested in triple - A rated mortgage debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and like other investment vehicles it had leveraged its capital aggressively , borrowing $ 31 for every dollar of equity .
As of February , it had $ 21.7 billion worth of assets in its investment portfolio .
But as those investments lost value , creditors demanded that it put up more and more money in margin calls .
A $ 150 million line of credit from its parent , the Carlyle Group , was not enough to keep it out of trouble as lenders demanded more collateral to back up their loans .
By Wednesday , it had already defaulted on about $ 16.6 billion of debt and some lenders started to liquidate assets .
Talks to halt liquidations and revive the fund ’s finances failed Wednesday night after the value of collateral declined further , prompting additional margin calls worth $ 97.5 million .

The advent of digital photography has opened up a new world of image editing possibilities including the ability to fill - in blanks or replace unwanted parts of an image .
A new algorithm devised by James Hayes and Alexei A. Efros of Carnegie Mellon University facilitates this process by drawing on a huge database of more than a million images from the World Wide Web in order to seamlessly fill in the missing areas of incomplete photographs .
There could be many reasons for an image to feature an undesirable blank area - a patch of bright light that needed to be cropped out or perhaps a shadow , a person or an object ruined an otherwise perfect shot .
The algorithm tackles this problem by completing a given image in a number of different ways leaving the user to select the one which is deemed most suitable .
This can be achieved without the user having to label the image fragments being used , or for that matter , offer any direction at all .
‘ Holes ’ in images are ‘ patched ’ as suitable image fragments are found and re-arranged to complete the image in a manner that is claimed to be semantically valid .
That is , the patched area is consistent with the rest of the image .
Hays and Efros claim that their algorithm is a means to restore data missing from an image that ‘ should have been there ’ .
Existing methods of filling such blank areas have largely involved drawing image fragments from other parts of the same picture .
This algorithm is quite unique in that it draws from an exterior database and also in the means by which it achieves this .

Participants relied on gossip about others , even when it contradicted their own direct observations .
People are influenced by gossip about others , even when it contradicts what they see with their own eyes , suggests a new study .
Past research has found that gossip — those juicy tidbits of supposed fact we share about a third party — serves many purposes , including strengthening social ties , spreading social norms and helping others avoid double - crossers and other risky partners .
Hearsay can be the most reliable source of information about situations with which you have no experience .
But when you hear gossip that 's incongruent with a person or incident you are familiar with , you'd be smart to throw that chitchat out the window in favor of your own direct knowledge , right ?
The new study , published this week online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , reveals individuals sometimes place so much stock in gossip that they accept it as true even if their own observations and experiences suggest otherwise .
" Gossip has a strong manipulative potential that could be used by cheaters to change the reputation of others or even change their own , " lead author Ralf Sommerfeld of the Max - Planck - Institute for Evolutionary Biology and his colleagues write .
" This finding suggests that humans are used to basing their decisions on gossip , rumors or other spoken information . "
Gossip game
Sommerfeld and his colleagues examined how gossip transmitted information and how it affected another person 's behavior .
In the study , 126 undergraduate biology students played a computer - based game in which each student was paired up with another student ( via their computers ) and had to decide whether to give a certain amount of their starting money to the partner .
By dishing out 1.25 Euros , the receiver got 2 Euros , so being on the receiving end was a must .
The assumption was that in later rounds , your generosity would be rewarded with generosity toward you .
Over a series of rounds , students switched their partners and received that partner 's track record — how many times the person had given money and not given money .
Students were more likely to give money to cooperative partners who had previously given money to others .
Then , they had to write a snippet of gossip about the other players they had virtually - interacted with .
Sommerfeld noted some gossip examples : " He 's a generous player " or " He 's a Scrooge , watch out . "
No surprise : Players who read a positive comment about another individual , having no knowledge of that person 's past generosity record , were more likely to hand over cash to that individual .
The opposite was true for negative gossip , where players held tight to their money .
Golden gossip
In another set of rounds , it got more interesting : Players received information on each partner 's track record ( how often they said " yes " and " no " to doling out money ) as well as the gossip blurb .
Without any added gossip information , students cooperated 62 percent of the time .
That number increased to 75 percent when students had positive gossip in addition to the partner 's track record .
Even in instances where the partner had a track record of no giving , positive gossip won out and the other individual handed over money to their partner .
The weirder outcome is that negative gossip decreased cooperation to just 50 percent , regardless of the players ' track records .
" If people would act rationally , they would only base their decisions on what they really see because they know exactly the past behavior of these people , " Sommerfeld told LiveScience .
" But they were still influenced by this gossip . "
Gossip also showed this persuasive power in light of any information marring the reputation of the actual gossip monger .
For instance , participants acted on gossip even when a blurb ( also considered gossip ) described the actual source as a " nasty miser " or other uncooperative description .
The scientists suggest the added information might be an overload for participants , or perhaps people do n't link cooperative behavior with gossip honesty .

The Dutch unambiguously rejected the constitution in 2005
Voters in the Netherlands and France rejected the treaty 's predecessor - a proposed European constitution - two years ago , plunging the EU into crisis .
Reports had indicated the Dutch public would vote against the new treaty too .
The decision on a referendum now goes before the Dutch parliament , where many MPs are said to favour a public vote .
The 2005 referendum , effectively scuppering the proposed constitution , was held at the initiative of parliament , rather than the government .
The lower house of parliament is believed to have a majority that favours a referendum , while the upper house is against the idea .
Labour split
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende , of the Christian Democrat party , said the new treaty did not propose constitutional changes and therefore did not require a referendum .
There are rumours that after a decent interval we 'll find out that some policies the Dutch Labour Party did n't like have been dropped
BBC Europe editor Mark Mardell
Mark Mardell 's Euroblog Q&A : Dutch referendum
" This is a normal change of treaty and only needs a normal procedure to approve it , " he said .
He said on Friday that the entire cabinet had backed the decision against holding a referendum .
Two of the three parties in the Dutch governing coalition had opposed a referendum on the new treaty , but a third , the Labour Party , was split over the issue .
Although the Labour party supports the EU Reform Treaty , a faction within it has argued that the views of the public must be taken into account before the document is adopted .
BBC Europe editor Mark Mardell says it is expected that some policies unpopular with the Labour Party will soon be dropped , in return for Labour ministers having given their consent to the decision against holding a referendum .
A Dutch decision in favour of holding a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty would have put fresh pressure on the British and Danish governments to do the same in their countries .
Both London and Copenhagen have been eager to avoid plebiscites on the new EU Reform Treaty .
Jon Stewart on Crossfire : " You guys are partisian hacks ! " Posted by Pile ( 11085 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Television ]
[ Video ]
Jon Stewart appeared live on CNN's " Crossfire " .
Tucker Carlson and company apparently expected Jon to come on and do his " Schtick " .
What they did n't expect was Jon switching roles and bitch - slapping the show 's hosts , calling Crossfire " bad for America " and telling them in no uncertain terms , unlike his show which is comedy , CNN has failed the public and is providing " theater " instead of useful news to the community .

Salon had this to say :
I 've heard people talk about " The Daily Show " as an oasis of sanity , a public service .
I could n't agree more .
Stewart 's appearance on " Crossfire " was another public service .
He went on and acted as if the show 's purpose really was to confront tough issues , instead of being the political equivalent of pro wrestling .
Given a chance to say absolutely what he thought , Stewart took it .
He accomplished what almost never happens on television anymore :

That was absolutely one of the finest moments I 've ever seen in television news , and once again we owe it to Jon Stewart .
As I 've said before , it 's sad when the most trusted figure in news is the one who does the comedy news show .
But he 's earned the honor , and the " real " news shows gave up their right to be trusted a while back .

TUCKER CARLSON , CO - HOST : Welcome to CROSSFIRE .
Less than three weeks before the election , we 're going to take a break from campaign politics , sort of .
Joining us will be Jon Stewart , host of " The Daily Show " on Comedy Central and co-author of a new best - seller entitled " America ( The Book ) . "
PAUL BEGALA , CO - HOST :
We will spend the next half - hour with the most trusted man in fake news .
And he has got pictures of all nine Supreme Court justices naked .
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : Worth staying tuned for .
First , though , we will begin , as we always do , with the best little political briefing in television , the CROSSFIRE " Political Alert . "
When he wants to look moderate , Dick Cheney invokes his lesbian daughter , Mary , on the campaign trail .
When Republican Senate candidate Alan Keyes viciously attacked their daughter , Dick and Lynne Cheney said nothing .
When John Edwards praised their evident love for their daughter , Vice President Cheney said this .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
DICK CHENEY , VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
Let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter .
I appreciate that very much .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BEGALA : But now , suddenly , after four debate losses and 18 days until the election , the Cheneys are shocked , shocked , that John Kerry mentioned their daughter in a debate .
There is an important lesson here .
If you 're gay and you want your rights protected by the Republicans , it helps to have a daddy who wants to distract the country from the millions he made from Halliburton , the billions he ran up in debt , and the war he lied us into .
( CROSSTALK )
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE )
CARLSON : I have to say , it takes -- it takes -- I admire your stones for defending the indefensible .
Even you know that it 's wrong , at the very least it 's unseemly , to bring up this guy 's daughter in two separate debates .
And the fact they did n't get into an argument with lunatic Alan Keyes when he attacked their daughter proves nothing , other than they have good manners .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : And the fact -- I 'm serious .
BEGALA : No , they have very good manners , Dick Cheney , sure .
Really ?
CARLSON : What is he supposed to say when John Edwards says , hey , how 's your lesbian daughter ?
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : He said thank you very much .
( BELL RINGING )
BEGALA : Cheney has raised the issue in the context of campaign appearances .
CARLSON : He has never a single time volunteered anything about his daughter 's sexuality .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : And you know that that is true .
BEGALA : August 24 , 2004 .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : In response to a question .
He never a single time ...
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : He brought her up on the campaign trail .
CARLSON : Yes , I 'm sure he did .
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : That 's just the one that I -- yes , he did .
Check it out on Google .
CARLSON : Yes , my lesbian daughter .
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : August 24 , 2001 .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : All right .
Well , there are legitimate , even powerful arguments , to be made against the Bush administration 's foreign policy .
But those arguments are complicated , hard to explain , and , in the end , not all that sensational .
It 's a lot easier just to make things up .
And so John Kerry has decided to do just that .
In an interview with " The Des Moines Register " yesterday , Kerry warned that there is -- quote -- " a great potential that Americans will be drafted into the armed forces if Bush is reelected president . "
This is a total crock , as Kerry himself knows well .
Virtually no one favors returning to the draft .
Bush is against it .
Congress is against it .
The Pentagon is completely against it .
It is not happening now or anywhere in the near future .
Again , John Kerry knows this very well , and yet he pretends otherwise in order to scare college students into voting for him .
And they probably will vote for him , but it 's still pretty dishonorable .
BEGALA : Well , first off , what is Bush 's plan for helping out the Guard and Reserve ?
CARLSON : That 's a separate ...
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : Kerry has a proposal to add 40,000 troops to the Army ...
CARLSON : You 're making a separate argument .
BEGALA : ... Bush stretched past the limit .
What is Bush going to do ?
What 's he going to do ?
CARLSON : Well , you 're making a separate argument .
You 're attacking Bush 's policy towards the National Guard and Reserves , which I think is completely fair and deserves to be attacked , frankly .
But there are no plans to reinstate draft because the Pentagon says that an all - volunteer Army is more effective .
It 's not going to happen , as you know .
BEGALA : Help me out , though .
The guy who says we 're not going to have a draft is the same guy who said there were weapons of mass destruction and there was a huge threat from Saddam Hussein .
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE )
CARLSON : You know what ?
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : Bush has no credibility , Tucker .
CARLSON : It 's not simply the decision of one man , OK ?
( BELL RINGING )
CARLSON : It 's a decision that , in the end , Congress will make .
And there is no possibility it will make that decision , as you know .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : Be see .
BEGALA : We 'll see .
Terrorists exploded two bombs in the heart of heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad yesterday .
Another bombing killed another American soldier in eastern Baghdad .
Meanwhile , on the home front , the price of oil is hovering around $ 55 a barrel .
The Bush administration has hit the debt limit of $ 7.4 trillion .
They are using accounting tricks to keep the United States of America from going into default like a degenerate gambler with a bookie named Knuckles .
We are critically short of the flu vaccine .
Health and Human Services says not to expect any vaccine from Canada , despite what President Bush said in the debate .
And yet our president thinks he deserves reelection .
In fact , he told reporters -- and I 'm quoting here -- " I feel great about where we are . "
Well , Newt Gingrich has a different take .
" If you do n't have some anxiety , " the former speaker said , " you 're not in touch with reality . "
Well , Newt , I could n't have said it better myself .
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE )
CARLSON : Well , of course , everyone has some anxiety , but that 's not the point Bush is making , as you know .
I found it actually really interesting .
There was a poll released today .
I 'm not exactly sure what it proves , but it does say something interesting ; 69 percent of members of the armed services right now support Bush , as compared to less than 30 for Kerry , and that overall they were far more hopeful about the direction the country is moving than the average person .
These are people , as you know , who are risking their lives in Iraq .
It 's not a defense of the Iraq policy , but it does say ...
( BELL RINGING )
CARLSON : It says something interesting about perspectives .
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : It says that people in military are overwhelmingly Republican .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : Which is an interesting question .
Why ?
Why is that ?
BEGALA : Because the military has always attracted a disproportionate number of Republicans .
CARLSON : I wonder why , though .
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : Well , first off , because they tend to poll the officer corps a lot more than the enlisted corps .
Look at Michael Moore 's new book , " Letters From the Front : Will They Ever Trust Us Again ? "
Those are enlisted people who have a very different view than the elite officer corps do .
CARLSON : I 'll get right on Michael Moore 's new book .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : Yes , definitely .
I 'll take it out of my local library .
BEGALA : You should .
CARLSON : Well , Winona LaDuke , remember that name ?
Even to students of presidential politics , it might not immediately ring a bell , so here is a refresher .
LaDuke is the two - time Green Party candidate for vice president .
Four years ago , she ran with Ralph Nader on the party 's stridently pro-hemp ticket .
A longtime Indian rights activist , LaDuke rarely joined Nader on the campaign trail , owing in part to legal difficulties she had with her common law husband .
He was head of the police at the time .
On one of the few occasions LaDuke did speak to the national press , she offered at least one policy proposal .
If elected , LaDuke promised to remove pictures of white people from the White House and replace them with portraits of famous minorities .
Down with George Washington .
Up with Grover Washington .
This year , LaDuke is working on a wind power project and will not be running for office again .
But in statement released this week , she declared that she 's no longer supporting Ralph Nader .
She 's supporting John Kerry .
Keep that in mind Election Day .
John Kerry , if he 's good enough for Winona LaDuke , he 's good enough for you .
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE )
BEGALA : Come on .
I mean , that 's ...
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : Someone has got to keep track of the celebrity endorsements here , OK ?
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : That would be like me saying David Duke endorses George W. Bush .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : You 're missing it .
You 're missing it .
You 're missing it , Paul .
BEGALA : The Duke family is all over the ...
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : Day after day , you make the argument , look , Barbra Streisand is voting for John Kerry .
You should , too .
And I 'm just saying , there are other people who are voting for John Kerry .
It 's not just Barbra Streisand .
It 's also Winona LaDuke .
BEGALA : You know , David Lesar , the CEO of Halliburton , I believe is for George W. Bush .
CARLSON : I hope so .
BEGALA : So , you can go to Halliburton or you can go with David and Winona LaDuke , whoever they are .
CARLSON : Winona LaDuke .
BEGALA : I suspect they 're not related , actually .
( BELL RINGING )
CARLSON : Well , he 's been called the most trusted name in fake news .
Next , we 're joined by Jon Stewart for his one - of - a - kind take on politics , the press and America .
We 'll be right back .
( APPLAUSE )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP , " THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART " )
STEWART : Meanwhile , the president 's challenger was also in New York , also facing some difficult questions .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : How to you stay in shape ?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE :
Do you eat something ?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
Do you have a routine ?
Do you ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : It 's like Nerf CROSSFIRE .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( APPLAUSE )
BEGALA : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE .
As both of our loyal viewers , of course , know , our show is about all left vs. white , black vs. white , paper vs. plastic , Red Sox against the Yankees .
That 's why every day , we have two guests with their own unique perspective on the news .
But today , CROSSFIRE is very difficult .
We have just one guest .
He 's either the funniest smart guy on TV or the smartest funnyman .
We 'll find out which in a minute .
But he 's certainly an Emmy Award winner , the host of Comedy Central 's " Daily Show " and the co-author of the new mega best - seller " America ( The Book ) : A Citizen 's Guide to Democracy Inaction , " at your bookstores everywhere .
Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the CROSSFIRE Jon Stewart .
STEWART : Thank you .
CARLSON : Thank you for joining us .
STEWART : Thank you very much .
That was very kind of you to say .
Can I say something very quickly ?
Why do we have to fight ?
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : The two of you ?
Ca n't we just -- say something nice about John Kerry right now .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : I like John .
I care about John Kerry .
STEWART : And something about President Bush .
BEGALA : He 'll be unemployed soon ?
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : I failed the test .
I 'm sorry .
CARLSON : See , I made the effort anyway .
BEGALA : No , actually , I knew Bush in Texas a little bit .
And the truth is , he 's actually a great guy .
He 's not a very good president .
But he 's actually a very good person .
I do n't think you should have to hate to oppose somebody , but it makes it easier .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : Why do you argue , the two of you ?
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : I hate to see it .
CARLSON : We enjoy it .
STEWART : Let me ask you a question .
CARLSON : Well , let me ask you a question first .
STEWART : All right .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : Is John Kerry -- is John Kerry really the best ?
I mean , John Kerry has ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : Is he the best ?
I thought Lincoln was good .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : Is he the best the Democrats can do ?
STEWART : Is he the best the Democrats can do ?
CARLSON : Yes , this year of the whole field .
STEWART : I had always thought , in a democracy -- and , again , I do n't know -- I 've only lived in this country -- that there 's a process .
They call them primaries .
CARLSON : Right .
STEWART : And they do n't always go with the best , but they go with whoever won .
So is he the best ?
According to the process .
CARLSON : Right .
But of the nine guys running , who do you think was best .
Do you think he was the best , the most impressive ?
STEWART : The most impressive ?
CARLSON : Yes .
STEWART : I thought Al Sharpton was very impressive .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : I enjoyed his way of speaking .
I think , oftentimes , the person that knows they can't win is allowed to speak the most freely , because , otherwise , shows with titles , such as CROSSFIRE .
BEGALA : CROSSFIRE .
STEWART : Or " HARDBALL " or " I'm Going to Kick Your Ass " or ...
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : Will jump on it .
In many ways , it 's funny .
And I made a special effort to come on the show today , because I have privately , amongst my friends and also in occasional newspapers and television shows , mentioned this show as being bad .
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : We have noticed .
STEWART : And I wanted to -- I felt that that was n't fair and I should come here and tell you that I do n't -- it 's not so much that it 's bad , as it 's hurting America .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : But in its defense ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : So I wanted to come here today and say ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : Here 's just what I wanted to tell you guys .
CARLSON : Yes .
STEWART : Stop .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : Stop , stop , stop , stop hurting America .
BEGALA : OK .
Now
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : And come work for us , because we , as the people ...
CARLSON : How do you pay ?
STEWART : The people -- not well .
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : Better than CNN , I 'm sure .
STEWART : But you can sleep at night .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : See , the thing is , we need your help .
Right now , you 're helping the politicians and the corporations .
And we 're left out there to mow our lawns .
BEGALA : By beating up on them ?
You just said we 're too rough on them when they make mistakes .
STEWART : No , no , no , you 're not too rough on them .
You 're part of their strategies .
You are partisan , what do you call it , hacks .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : Wait , Jon , let me tell you something valuable that I think we do that I 'd like to see you ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : Something valuable ?
CARLSON : Yes .
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : I would like to hear it .
CARLSON : And I 'll tell you .
When politicians come on ...
STEWART : Yes .
CARLSON : It 's nice to get them to try and answer the question .
And in order to do that , we try and ask them pointed questions .
I want to contrast our questions with some questions you asked John Kerry recently .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : ... up on the screen .
STEWART : If you want to compare your show to a comedy show , you 're more than welcome to .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : No , no , no , here 's the point .
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : If that 's your goal .
CARLSON : It 's not .
STEWART : I would n't aim for us .
I 'd aim for " Seinfeld . "
That 's a very good show .
CARLSON : Kerry wo n't come on this show .
He will come on your show .
STEWART : Right .
CARLSON : Let me suggest why he wants to come on your show .
STEWART : Well , we have civilized discourse .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : Well , here 's an example of the civilized discourse .
Here are three of the questions you asked John Kerry .
STEWART : Yes .
CARLSON : You have a chance to interview the Democratic nominee .
You asked him questions such as -- quote -- " How are you holding up ?
Is it hard not to take the attacks personally ? "
STEWART : Yes .
CARLSON : " Have you ever flip - flopped ? " et cetera , et cetera .
STEWART : Yes .
CARLSON : Did n't you feel like -- you got the chance to interview the guy .
Why not ask him a real question , instead of just suck up to him ?
STEWART : Yes .
" How are you holding up ? " is a real suck - up .
And I actually giving him a hot stone massage as we were doing it .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : It sounded that way .
It did .
STEWART : You know , it 's interesting to hear you talk about my responsibility .
CARLSON : I felt the sparks between you .
STEWART : I did n't realize that -- and maybe this explains quite a bit .
CARLSON : No , the opportunity to ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : ... is that the news organizations look to Comedy Central for their cues on integrity .
( LAUGHTER )
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : So what I would suggest is , when you talk about you 're holding politicians ' feet to fire , I think that 's disingenuous .
I think you 're ...
CARLSON : " How are you holding up ? " I mean , come on .
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : No , no , no .
But my role is n't , I do n't think ...
CARLSON : But you can ask him a real question , do n't you think , instead of saying ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : I do n't think I have to .
By the way , I also asked him , " Were you in Cambodia ? "
But I did n't really care .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : Because I do n't care , because I think it 's stupid .
CARLSON : I can tell .
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : But my point is this .
If your idea of confronting me is that I do n't ask hard - hitting enough news questions , we 're in bad shape , fellows .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : We 're here to love you , not confront you .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : We 're here to be nice .
STEWART : No , no , no , but what I 'm saying is this .
I 'm not .
I 'm here to confront you , because we need help from the media and they 're hurting us .
And it's -- the idea is ...
( APPLAUSE )
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : Let me get this straight .
If the indictment is -- if the indictment is -- and I have seen you say this -- that ...
STEWART : Yes .
BEGALA : And that CROSSFIRE reduces everything , as I said in the intro , to left , right , black , white .
STEWART : Yes .
BEGALA : Well , it 's because , see , we 're a debate show .
STEWART : No , no , no , no , that would be great .
BEGALA : It 's like saying The Weather Channel reduces everything to a storm front .
STEWART : I would love to see a debate show .
BEGALA : We 're 30 minutes in a 24 - hour day where we have each side on , as best we can get them , and have them fight it out .
STEWART : No , no , no , no , that would be great .
To do a debate would be great .
But that 's like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : Jon , Jon , Jon , I 'm sorry .
I think you 're a good comedian .
I think your lectures are boring .
STEWART : Yes .
CARLSON : Let me ask you a question on the news .
STEWART : Now , this is theater .
It 's obvious .
How old are you ?
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : Thirty - five .
STEWART : And you wear a bow tie .
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
CARLSON : Yes , I do .
I do .
STEWART : So this is ...
CARLSON : I know .
I know .
I know .
You 're a ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : So this is theater .
CARLSON : Now , let me just ...
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : Now , come on .
STEWART : Now , listen , I 'm not suggesting that you 're not a smart guy , because those are not easy to tie .
CARLSON : They 're difficult .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : But the thing is that this -- you 're doing theater , when you should be doing debate , which would be great .
BEGALA : We do , do ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : It 's not honest .
What you do is not honest .
What you do is partisan hackery .
And I will tell you why I know it .
CARLSON : You had John Kerry on your show and you sniff his throne and you 're accusing us of partisan hackery ?
STEWART : Absolutely .
CARLSON : You 've got to be kidding me .
He comes on and you ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : You 're on CNN .
The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : What is wrong with you ?
( APPLAUSE ) CARLSON :
Well , I 'm just saying , there 's no reason for you -- when you have this marvelous opportunity not to be the guy 's butt boy , to go ahead and be his butt boy .
Come on .
It 's embarrassing .
STEWART : I was absolutely his butt boy .
I was so far -- you would not believe what he ate two weeks ago .
( LAUGHTER )
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : You know , the interesting thing I have is , you have a responsibility to the public discourse , and you fail miserably .
CARLSON : You need to get a job at a journalism school , I think .
STEWART : You need to go to one .
The thing that I want to say is , when you have people on for just knee - jerk , reactionary talk ...
CARLSON : Wait .
I thought you were going to be funny .
Come on .
Be funny .
STEWART : No . No . I 'm not going to be your monkey .
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : Go ahead .
Go ahead .
STEWART : I watch your show every day .
And it kills me .
CARLSON : I can tell you love it .
STEWART : It 's so -- oh , it 's so painful to watch .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : You know , because we need what you do .
This is such a great opportunity you have here to actually get politicians off of their marketing and strategy .
CARLSON : Is this really Jon Stewart ?
What is this , anyway ?
STEWART : Yes , it 's someone who watches your show and cannot take it anymore .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : I just can't .
CARLSON : What 's it like to have dinner with you ?
It must be excruciating .
Do you like lecture people like this or do you come over to their house and sit and lecture them ; they 're not doing the right thing , that they 're missing their opportunities , evading their responsibilities ?
STEWART : If I think they are .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : I would n't want to eat with you , man .
That 's horrible .
STEWART : I know .
And you wo n't .
But the thing I want to get to ...
BEGALA : We did promise naked pictures of the Supreme Court justices .
CARLSON : Yes , we did .
Let 's get to those .
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : They 're in this book , which is a very funny book .
STEWART : Why ca n't we just talk -- please , I beg of you guys , please .
CARLSON : I think you watch too much CROSSFIRE .
We 're going to take a quick break .
STEWART : No , no , no , please .
CARLSON : No , no , hold on .
We 've got commercials .
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : Please .
Please stop .
CARLSON : Next , Jon Stewart in the " Rapid Fire . "
STEWART : Please stop .
CARLSON : Hopefully , he 'll be here , we hope , we think .
( APPLAUSE )
CARLSON : And then , did U.S. soldiers refuse an order in Iraq .
Wolf Blitzer has the latest on this investigation right after the break .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : I 'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington .
Coming up at the top of the hour , the Pentagon investigator a report that U.S. soldiers refused to go on a dangerous mission in Iraq .
We 'll have details .
In medical news , the FDA prescribes a strongly worded label on antidepressant drugs .
And why some experts think the flu vaccine shortage is a grim warning about U.S. vulnerability to bioterrorism .
All those stories , much more , only minutes away on " WOLF BLITZER REPORTS . "
Now back to CROSSFIRE .
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE )
CARLSON : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE .
We 're talking to Jon Stewart , who was just lecturing us on our moral inferiority .
Jon , you 're bumming us out .
Tell us , what do you think about the Bill O'Reilly vibrator story ?
STEWART : I 'm sorry .
I do n't .
CARLSON : Oh , OK .
STEWART : What do you think ?
BEGALA : Let me change the subject .
STEWART : Where 's your moral outrage on this ?
CARLSON : I do n't have any .
STEWART : I know .
BEGALA : Which candidate do you suppose would provide you better material ?
STEWART : I 'm sorry ?
BEGALA : Which candidate do you suppose would provide you better material if he won ?
STEWART : Mr. T. I think he'd be the funniest .
I do n't ...
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : Do n't you have a stake in it that way , as not just a citizen , but as a professional comic ?
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : Right , which I hold to be much more important than as a citizen .
BEGALA : Well , there you go .
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : But who would you provide you better material , do you suppose ?
STEWART : I do n't really know .
That 's kind of not how we look at it .
We look at , the absurdity of the system provides us the most material .
And that is best served by sort of the theater of it all , you know , which , by the way , thank you both , because it 's been helpful .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : But , if Kerry gets elected , is it going to -- you have said you 're voting for him .
You obviously support him .
It 's clear .
Will it be harder for you to mock his administration if he becomes president ?
STEWART : No .
Why would it be harder ?
CARLSON : Because you support ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : The only way it would be harder is if his administration is less absurd than this one .
So , in that case , if it 's less absurd , then , yes , I think it would be harder .
But , I mean , it would be hard to top this group , quite frankly .
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE )
STEWART : In terms of absurdity and their world matching up to the one that -- you know , it was interesting .
President Bush was saying , John Kerry 's rhetoric does n't match his record .
But I 've heard President Bush describe his record .
His record does n't match his record .
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : So I do n't worry about it in that respect .
But let me ask you guys , again , a question , because we talked a little bit about , you 're actually doing honest debate and all that .
But , after the debates , where do you guys head to right afterwards ?
CARLSON : The men's room .
STEWART : Right after that ?
BEGALA : Home .
STEWART : Spin alley .
BEGALA : Home .
STEWART : No , spin alley .
BEGALA : What are you talking about ?
You mean at these debates ?
STEWART : Yes .
You go to spin alley , the place called spin alley .
Now , do n't you think that , for people watching at home , that 's kind of a drag , that you 're literally walking to a place called deception lane ?
( LAUGHTER )
STEWART : Like , it 's spin alley .
It 's -- do n't you see , that 's the issue I 'm trying to talk to you guys ...
BEGALA : No , I actually believe -- I have a lot of friends who work for President Bush .
I went to college with some of them .
CARLSON : Neither of us was ever in the spin room , actually .
( BELL RINGING )
BEGALA : No , I did -- I went to do the Larry King show .
They actually believe what they 're saying .
They want to persuade you .
That 's what they 're trying to do by spinning .
But I do n't doubt for a minute these people who work for President Bush , who I disagree with on everything , they believe that stuff , Jon .
This is not a lie or a deception at all .
They believe in him , just like I believe in my guy .
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : I think they believe President Bush would do a better job .
And I believe the Kerry guys believe President Kerry would do a better job .
But what I believe is , they 're not making honest arguments .
So what they 're doing is , in their mind , the ends justify the means .
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : I do n't think so at all .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : I do think you 're more fun on your show .
Just my opinion .
( CROSSTALK )
CARLSON : OK , up next , Jon Stewart goes one on one with his fans ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : You know what 's interesting , though ?
You 're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show .
( LAUGHTER )
CARLSON : Now , you 're getting into it .
I like that .
STEWART : Yes .
CARLSON : OK .
We 'll be right back .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BEGALA : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE .
We are joined by Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart , host of " The Daily Show " and author of No. 1 bestseller , " America ( The Book ) : A Citizen 's Guide to Democracy Inaction . "
CARLSON : And a ton of fun , I like that too .
BEGALA : Some questions from our audience .
Yes sir , what 's your name , what 's your name ?
QUESTION : Hi , my name 's David .
I 'm from Boston .
STEWART : Hi , David .
QUESTION : My question is , what do you think the hump on G.W. 's back during the debate was ?
STEWART : Say it again ?
QUESTION : What do you think the hump on George 's back during the debate was ?
STEWART : The hump on his back ?
BEGALA : Oh , you 're familiar ?
This is ( INAUDIBLE ) conspiracy theory .
Can I take this one ?
STEWART : Yes , please .
BEGALA : It was nothing , his suit was puckering .
A lot of people believe he had one of these in his ear .
If he was being fed lines by Karl Rove , he would not have been so inarticulate , guys .
It 's a myth .
( LAUGHTER )
BEGALA : It 's not true .
There 's this huge myth out on the left .
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : Yes , ma'am .
QUESTION : Renee ( ph ) from Texas .
Why do you think it 's hard or difficult or impossible for politicians to answer a straight , simple question ?
STEWART : I do n't think it 's hard .
I just think that nobody holds their feet to the fire to do it .
So they do n't have to .
They get to come on shows that do n't ...
BEGALA : They 're too easy on them .
CARLSON : Yes .
Ask them how you hold ...
STEWART : Not easy on them ...
( CROSSTALK )
BEGALA : ... saying we were too hard on people and too ( INAUDIBLE ) .
( CROSSTALK )
STEWART : I think you 're - yes .
CARLSON : All right .
Jon Stewart , come back soon .
BEGALA : Jon Stewart , good of you to join us .
Thank you very much .

Watson was anything but happy , however .
Indeed , according to most people at the event , he looked completely shattered .
The scientist who , with Francis Crick , had discovered the structure of DNA and revolutionised modern biology , and who is revered as one of the greatest scientists of his day , was shaking badly .
He rambled , paused and then rambled again as he talked to friends .
Finally he produced a prepared statement and began reading it out to the assembled journalists .
He could only apologise ' unreservedly ' , the statement said , for his assertion , published last Sunday , that he thought black people were less intelligent than white .
' This is not what I meant . '
Then Watson hesitated , returned to his script and finally wandered off his topic completely to end up , bizarrely , describing the behaviour of the San bushmen of Botswana .
' It was a tragic sight , ' said one guest .
It is not hard to understand why Watson was so distraught , of course .
His remarks , which by Wednesday had made front - page headlines across Britain , had attracted a fusillade of abuse from scientists , politicians and equality campaigners .
' It is a shame that a man with a record of scientific distinction should see his work overshadowed by his own irrational prejudices , ' said David Lammy , the Skills Minister .
London mayor Ken Livingstone fulminated in a similar manner : ' Such ignorant comments ... are utterly offensive and give succour to the most backward in our society . '
Worse was to follow .
The Science Museum cancelled a sell - out meeting it had planned to hold to honour 79 - year - old Watson on the grounds that his remarks had gone ' beyond the point of acceptable debate ' .
Several other centres scheduled to host his talks followed suit .
After the Royal Society meeting , Watson and his wife returned to their hotel , Claridge's , where they learned that the scientist 's employers , the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island , had just disowned his remarks .
The next morning , it emerged the laboratory had also suspended Watson as its chancellor .
Enough was enough , the scientist announced .
' I am going home to try to save my job . '
By Friday afternoon he was back in New York and was heading for Cold Spring Harbor .
His chances of remaining chancellor there look slim .
It is , by any standards , a depressing story .
One of the world 's most distinguished scientists has fled from the country , his reputation and his academic future left in tatters .
As a tale of intellectual hubris , it is hard to beat .
But the fall of Jim Watson goes beyond mere personal tragedy .
It also raises key issues of immediate concern .
The first is simple : is there any evidence there are major differences in the intellectual potential of races ?
The second is more complex : how should we react when a scientist of Watson 's standing makes such provocative remarks ?
In the first case , most scientists have quickly jumped into the furore to dismantle the idea that significant intellectual differences exist between Africans and others .
' Defining intelligence is complex and there are many forms of intelligence , not all of which are captured by IQ tests , ' said the Oxford neurologist Colin Blakemore .
' In any case , it would be as unethical to organise society around some numerical indicator of difference as it would to do so on the basis of skin colour . '
Other scientists point out that our species is so young - Homo sapiens emerged from its African homeland only 100,000 years ago - that it simply has not had time to evolve any significant differences in intellectual capacity as its various groups of people have spread round the globe and settled in different regions .
Only the most superficial differences - notably skin colour - separate the world 's different population groupings .
Underneath that skin , people are remarkably alike .
This argument does not reject the idea that notable variations in intellect exist between individuals , but it stresses that these differences exist within racial groups , not between them .
Judging a man or woman by the colour of their skin will get you nowhere , in other words .
As Craig Venter , who pioneered much of America 's work in decoding the human genome , put it : ' There is no basis in scientific fact or in the human gene code for the notion that skin colour will be predictive of intelligence . '
The second issue raised by his claims is far more vexed .
How should we react to claims such as those made by Watson ?
Lammy , Livingstone and other politicians urged he should be silenced on the grounds that his views would only give succour to Britain 's racist fringe - as indeed they have .
By Thursday , as Watson was making his mumbled Royal Society apology , he was being hailed as the New Galileo by the BNP .
Those who objected so virulently to the science behind racism were ' simply denying the facts of science and stand in the same position as those Catholic theologians who offered Galileo the choice of recantation or the stake ' , claimed a BNP website article .
Certainly Watson was extraordinarily naive .
But was it right to cancel public meetings at which he could be called to account for his views ?
Senior staff at the Science Museum in London clearly thought so , as they did at the Bristol Cultural Development Department Partnership , which was set to host a public meeting with Watson this week .
They , too , decided not to hold their meeting on the grounds that the scientist 's views were ' unacceptably provocative ' .
Not every centre scheduled to host public meetings with Watson took this view , however .
The Centre for Life in Newcastle said it would go ahead with its meeting , scheduled to have been held today , on the grounds that it would provide the public with the chance to question the scientist and then make up its own mind about his claims .
' We had some calls expressing misgivings about our decision to welcome Watson , but most people supported us .
We were going to give him a robust but fair hearing and let people decide for themselves , ' said a spokesman .
In the end , Watson 's decided to return home , so no meetings occurred , a move that has dismayed many scientists who believed that it was vital Watson confront his critics and his public .
' What is ethically wrong is the hounding , by what can only be described as an illiberal and intolerant " thought police " , of one of the most distinguished scientists of our time , out of the Science Museum , and maybe out of the laboratory that he has devoted much of his life to , building up a world - class reputation , ' said Richard Dawkins , who been due to conduct a public interview with Watson this week in Oxford .
Dawkins 's stance was supported by Blakemore .
' Jim Watson is well known for being provocative and politically incorrect .
But it would be a sad world if such a distinguished scientist was silenced because of his more unpalatable views . '
This last remark goes to the heart of the issue .
Watson is renowned for his controversial views .
He sees himself as a free - thinker , though it must be admitted his ideas often simply seem eccentric .
In 1997 , he suggested it would be acceptable to terminate a foetus if it carried a gene that might mean the adult that grows from it was gay .
He has also suggested a link between sunlight and libido .
' That is why you have Latin lovers .
You 've never heard of an English lover , ' he said .
And Watson has also proposed that a foetus destined to be ' stupid ' should be aborted .
Such maverick remarks led the journal Science to conclude , in 1990 , that ' to many in the scientific community , Watson has long been something of a wild man , and his colleagues tend to hold their collective breath whenever he veers from the script ' .
This track record explains one intriguing feature of the Watson affair .
Although the Sunday Times carried the interview in which the scientist outlined his disparaging views about black people , the paper kept his remarks buried in its colour magazine .
A story was offered to the Sunday Times newsdesk by magazine staff , but was declined on the grounds that Watson had said such things in the past , as indeed he had .
Thus it was left to Simon Kelner , editor of the Independent , to take Watson 's claims and to run them as its lead story on Wednesday , under the banner : ' Africans are less intelligent that Westerners , says DNA pioneer ' .
In this way , Watson 's fate was sealed .
But while it is obvious that the scientist holds some fairly illiberal views on certain issues , it is also clear he has acted in a courageous , progressive manner on other issues .
When he was director of America 's human genome project , he fought bitterly to prevent the US government from adopting a policy that would allow it to patent human genetic material discovered by project scientists in order to exploit them as sources of new drugs and medicines .
The idea was ' lunacy ' , said Watson , the equivalent of applying for ownership of the laws of nature .
When he realised he was losing the battle , he simply handed in his resignation .
Nor is it at all clear that Watson is a racist , a point stressed last week by the Pulitzer - winning biologist E O Wilson , of Harvard University .
In his autobiography , Naturalist , Wilson originally described Watson , fresh from his Nobel success , arriving at Harvard 's biology department and ' radiating contempt ' for the rest of the staff .
He was ' the most unpleasant human being I had ever met , ' Wilson recalled .
' Having risen to fame at an early age , [ he ] became the Caligula of biology .
He was given licence to say anything that came into his mind and expected to be taken seriously .
And unfortunately he did so , with casual and brutal offhandedness . '
That is a fairly grim description , to say the least .
However , there is a twist .
There has been a rapprochement .
' We have become firm friends , ' Wilson told The Observer last week .
' Today we are the two grand old men of biology in America and get on really well .
I certainly do n't see him as a Caligula figure any more .
I have come to see him as a very intelligent , straight , honest individual .
Of course , he would never get a job as a diplomat in the State Department .
He is just too outspoken .
But one thing I am absolutely sure of is that he is not a racist .
I am shocked at what has happened to him . '
As to Watson 's own prospects today , those can only be described as unpromising .
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 's campus is set in rolling wooded hills on the north shore of Long Island , dotted with buildings set amid the trees turning bright orange and red as autumn sets in .
Executives there have already revealed just how seriously they are taking the Watson case and on Friday triggered a compete PR lockdown at the campus : students and staff were warned not to talk to journalists , security guards were on the lookout for unannounced reporters and interlopers were picked up and taken to the campus PR department .
However , some students and staff did speak and expressed surprise at Watson 's remarks .
' It is all a bit of a shock .
I suppose it is possible that he was misquoted , but it is still shocking .
The whole thing is just amazing that anyone would say something like that , ' said Louis Nguyen , a graduate student taking courses on the campus and whose college is affiliated with Cold Spring .
Some members of staff were also upset at the furore surrounding Watson .
' I agree with what the college has done so far in suspending Watson .
They acted well .
It may be that he has to lose his job .
That is a really serious thing to say , ' said Jean Wang , a science technician at the college .
Responsibility for dealing with the PR crisis fell to Jim Bono .
On Friday , the director of the college 's public affairs unit acknowledged there had been a massive interest in the incident .
' We are getting phone calls from all over the planet , ' he said .
Given the nature of Watson 's comments , that was not surprising .
However , Bono would not be drawn on a timetable for further action or the outcome of the board 's deliberations on Watson 's future .
' The leadership [ of Cold Spring ] continues [ its ] debates .
The leadership has been working around the clock and has been deeply involved in dealing with this situation , ' he said .
It sounds ominous .
Nevertheless , the laboratory 's behaviour has been supported in the local Long Island press .
America is facing a spate of nooses being left in public places - including in Long Island : the noose is a symbol of anti-black feeling and intended to rouse memories of lynching .
The prospects of a return to such extremism alarms authorities and commentators alike .
Hence a thundering editorial in Newsday , Long Island 's main newspaper : ' The lab condemned its chancellor and key fundraiser , but that statement and Watson 's apology yesterday will probably not be enough .
He has to go . '
Thus Watson - who today should have been accepting a warm welcome from his public at Newcastle 's Centre for Life - now finds himself at home , alone and in trouble .
His reputation as a brilliant , radical thinker has been transformed in a few days into that of an unstable maverick .
The stain on his career is unlikely ever to be washed clean .
James Dewey Watson - The CV
Born in Chicago , Illinois , on 6 April 1928 , Watson was a precocious child who gained a place at Chicago University aged just 15 .
He graduated with a zoology degree in 1947 .
In October 1951 he arrived at the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge , to carry out genetics research and met Francis Crick .
They struck up a friendship that became one of the most famous partnerships in science and led them , in 1953 , to the discovery that DNA , from which human genes are made , has a double helix structure .
In 1962 , the pair - with Maurice Wilkins , of King 's College London - were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for this work .
Six years later Watson published his racy account of the DNA story in The Double Helix .
Dropped by its original publisher amid objections by Crick , Wilkins and others , its opening sentence was : ' I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood . '
It became a bestseller and the basis of the 1987 TV film Life Story , in which Jeff Goldblum played Watson and Tim Pigott - Smith Crick .
In 1988 Watson was made head of the US Human Genome Project , America 's arm of the international programme for sequencing human DNA .
Four years later he resigned over US plans to try to take out patents on gene sequences discovered by US scientists , saying ' the human genome belongs to the world 's people ' .
He was suspended last week as Chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Long Island .
The week that ruined Watson 's reputation
14 October The Sunday Times Magazine publishes an interview with Dr James Watson .
He says he is ' inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa ' because ' all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really ' .
His hope is that everyone is equal but says that ' people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true ' .
17 October
The front page of the Independent runs a story on Watson 's theory with the headline ' Africans are less intelligent than Westerners says DNA pioneer ' .
It creates a furore .
18 October The Science Museum cancels Watson 's talk planned for 19 October .
In a statement , the museum says ' James Watson 's recent comments have gone beyond the point of acceptable debate ' .
At a launch for his book at the Royal Society in London , Watson withdraws the words attributed to him :
' To all those who have drawn the inference from my words that Africa , as a continent , is somehow genetically inferior , I can only apologise unreservedly . '
19 October Watson seeks to justify his theory that there is a genetic basis behind differences in IQ in an interview with the Independent .
20 October Watson is forced to return to New York after his employers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Long Island , suspend him from his duties because of his apparent views .

The fastest - growing group of illegal immigrants in the United States does n’t speak Spanish .
They typically are n’t found at day labor sites or streaming across the Southwest border into the U.S .
Instead , they ’re here in America working in tech companies , small businesses , as engineers or other highly skilled jobs .
And they ’re coming from India .
The profile of the illegal immigrant may need to take on a slightly more South Asian persona since a recent federal report revealed that India had the greatest percentage increase in unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. since 2000 .
Illegal immigrants from India grew to 270,000 in 2006 from 120,000 in 2000 , a 125 percent increase , according to a report late last month from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
Undocumented Indians , however , remain a small segment of the total estimated population of 11.6 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Mexico tops the list with 6.6 million — up from 4.7 million in 2000 — followed by El Salvador and Guatemala , according to the Homeland Security report .
{snip}
Experts say illegal Indian immigrants are coming here legally on visas but are overextending their stays and subsequently slipping under the radar screen of authorities .
{snip}
The most recent government data showed that in fiscal year 2005 , Indians received 194,611 temporary work visas to come to the U.S. , the most of any nation .
India eclipsed Mexico , which had 169,786 of its workers admitted , and the United Kingdom with 156,635 .
{snip}
More than half of Indian immigrants who came to the U.S. in fiscal year 2005 — about 102,000 — arrived on the H - 1B visa for the highly skilled .
So , typically , they are n’t going to be busted by immigration agents during raids at meat - processing plants such as those owned by Swift & Co. , the site of high - profile investigations last year .
{snip}
Faisal Amin , board member of the South Asian Chamber of Commerce in Houston , said lax oversight of the federal guest workers program is one reason many Indians stay here when their visas expire .
“ We see an increase simply because a lot of those workers are coming in on H1 - B visas , ” Amin said .
“ And , we do n’t have a good way to track that these workers are , indeed , going back to their countries when they ’re finished . ”
One U.S. Department of Homeland Security official , who asked not be be identified , agreed there is n’t a method to keep tabs on guest workers .
“ Once they get in , there ’s no exit program in place yet — they ’re talking about it , ” the official said .

[ 2008 GOP Presidential Candidate ]
John McCain was not on the campus of Jerry Falwell ’s Liberty University last year for very long — the senator , who once referred to Mr. Falwell and Pat Robertson as “ agents of intolerance , ” was there to receive an honorary degree — but he seems to have picked up some theology along with his academic hood .
In an interview with Beliefnet.com last weekend , Mr. McCain repeated what is an article of faith among many American evangelicals : “ the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation . ”
According to Scripture , however , believers are to be wary of all mortal powers .
Their home is the kingdom of God , which transcends all earthly things , not any particular nation - state .
The Psalmist advises believers to “ put not your trust in princes . ”
The author of Job says that the Lord “ shows no partiality to princes nor regards the rich above the poor , for they are all the work of his hands . ”
Before Pilate , Jesus says , “ My kingdom is not of this world . ”
And if , as Paul writes in Galatians , “ there is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free man , there is neither male nor female : for you are all one in Christ Jesus , ” then it is difficult to see how there could be a distinction in God ’s eyes between , say , an American and an Australian .
In fact , there is no distinction if you believe Peter ’s words in the Acts of the Apostles : “ I most certainly believe now that God is not one to show partiality , but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him . ”
The kingdom Jesus preached was radical .
Not only are nations irrelevant , but families are , too : he instructs those who would be his disciples to give up all they have and all those they know to follow him .
The only acknowledgment of religion in the original Constitution is a utilitarian one : the document is dated “ in the year of our Lord 1787 . ”
Even the religion clause of the First Amendment is framed dryly and without reference to any particular faith .
The Connecticut ratifying convention debated rewriting the preamble to take note of God ’s authority , but the effort failed .
A pseudonymous opponent of the Connecticut proposal had some fun with the notion of a deity who would , in a sense , be checking the index for his name : “ A low mind may imagine that God , like a foolish old man , will think himself slighted and dishonored if he is not complimented with a seat or a prologue of recognition in the Constitution . ”
Instead , the framers , the opponent wrote in The American Mercury , “ come to us in the plain language of common sense and propose to our understanding a system of government as the invention of mere human wisdom ; no deity comes down to dictate it , not a God appears in a dream to propose any part of it . ”
While many states maintained established churches and religious tests for office — Massachusetts was the last to disestablish , in 1833 — the federal framers , in their refusal to link civil rights to religious observance or adherence , helped create a culture of religious liberty that ultimately carried the day .
Thomas Jefferson said that his bill for religious liberty in Virginia was “ meant to comprehend , within the mantle of its protection , the Jew and the Gentile , the Christian and the Mahometan , the Hindu , and infidel of every denomination . ”
When George Washington was inaugurated in New York in April 1789 , Gershom Seixas , the hazan of Shearith Israel , was listed among the city ’s clergymen ( there were 14 in New York at the time ) — a sign of acceptance and respect .
The next year , Washington wrote the Hebrew Congregation of Newport , R.I. , saying , “ happily the government of the United States ... gives to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance .
...
Everyone shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree , and there shall be none to make him afraid . ”
Andrew Jackson resisted bids in the 1820s to form a “ Christian party in politics . ”
Abraham Lincoln buried a proposed “ Christian amendment ” to the Constitution to declare the nation ’s fealty to Jesus .
Theodore Roosevelt defended William Howard Taft , a Unitarian , from religious attacks by supporters of William Jennings Bryan .
The founders were not anti-religion .
Many of them were faithful in their personal lives , and in their public language they evoked God .
They grounded the founding principle of the nation — that all men are created equal — in the divine .
But they wanted faith to be one thread in the country ’s tapestry , not the whole tapestry .
In the 1790s , in the waters off Tripoli , pirates were making sport of American shipping near the Barbary Coast .
Toward the end of his second term , Washington sent Joel Barlow , the diplomat - poet , to Tripoli to settle matters , and the resulting treaty , finished after Washington left office , bought a few years of peace .
Article 11 of this long - ago document says that “ as the government of the United States is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian religion , ” there should be no cause for conflict over differences of “ religious opinion ” between countries .

Some 130 countries have outlawed capital punishment
A total of 99 countries voted for a suspension of capital punishment worldwide , while 52 voted against and 33 abstained .
Although the vote is not legally binding , human rights groups say it is a significant demonstration of worldwide opinion .
Some 130 countries have already outlawed the practice .
After two days of fractious and sometimes bad - tempered debate , 99 countries voted for a worldwide pause in the use of the death penalty , with a view to ending the practice .
Italy was the driving force behind the vote .
How else can this behaviour be described , other than as sanctimonious , hypocritical and intolerant ?
Vanu Gopala Menon
Singapore 's UN ambassador
A series of what are called wrecking amendments were tabled by the opponents of the measure , but they were all rejected .
Britain's ambassador to the UN , Sir John Sawers , said the vote showed international opinion was changing .
" When we tried this eight years ago , it was mainly Europeans who voted in favour of such a moratorium , " he said .
" We now have a global coalition and I think it 's an important sign that the death penalty is increasingly unpopular and is seen as unreliable . "
The US was among the countries to vote against .
Influential vote
Singapore led the opposition , arguing that capital punishment is a criminal law issue which should be left to countries to decide on .
Singapore 's ambassador to the UN , Vanu Gopala Menon , said the European Union was trying to impose its values on the rest of the world .
" They claim to support freedom of expression , but vote to deny it to others , " he said .
" They claim that they do not seek to impose their views , but now they intend to force through a resolution that a significant number of other countries do not agree with .
" How else can this behaviour be described , other than as sanctimonious , hypocritical and intolerant ? "
Now the entire UN General Assembly will vote on whether to adopt this call for a worldwide moratorium .
That is expected to go through .
Campaigners say even though that will not be a legally binding vote , it will still be influential .
The universe has an odd tendency to absorb certain objects into the oblivion of un-existence .
Television remotes , single socks , car keys , lighters , external hard drives containing 100,000 employee records , pen caps ; they all come and go like tiny dimensional travelers .
And such is the order of things that missing socks and lighter go largely unreported in the media — bees in our bonnet though they may be .
But the minute the Transportation Security Administration loses a hard drive containing the names , Social Security numbers , dates of birth , payroll information , bank account and routing information of 100,000 people employed at the agency between January 2002 and August 2005 , there 's suddenly a big fuss .
On May 3 , the TSA discovered the drive was missing from a controlled area at the Headquarters Office of Human Capital .
The agency immediately reported the incident to law enforcement officials , the Department of Homeland Security and launched into an investigation .
Did it fall behind the desk ?
No .
Did Jim take it home to transfer his Phil Collins music collection to his desktop ?
No .
Maybe check behind the desk again ?
The investigation hit a brick wall .
By Friday night , it was time to fess up with a statement .
The TSA does n't know whether the device is still within headquarters or was stolen .
It has found no evidence an unauthorized individual is using the personal information .
TSA is a division of the Homeland Security Department , responsible for the safety of the US transportation system , including airports and train stations .
They are unsure whether the data was encrypted or not .
The TSA is investigating to see if proper data security procedures were followed .
The agency pledges disciplinary action against individuals found to be in violation of security procedures .
This is far from the first case of government hard drives phasing out of three dimensional time - space .
In a similar case in January , the external hard drive of a Department of Veterans Affairs employee that contained personal data of approximately 48,000 employees went missing .
A year ago this month , a VA laptop with personal details of 26.5 m veterans was stolen ; it was eventually turned in by a member of the public who bought it at a market .
TSA has begun to notify all affected individuals in the incident .
They have also begun the process of selecting a contractor to provide one year of free credit monitoring for those with personal information in the drive . ®
One day in high school , Elyn Saks was walking home when she realized that the houses lining the street were sending her messages .
“ Look closely , ” they said , “ You are special … especially bad . ”
During her freshman year at Vanderbilt University , she began to wonder if showers were really necessary ; and by her first year in graduate school , she was hospitalized after she became convinced that she was on the verge of killing hundreds of thousands of people with her thoughts .
This is schizophrenia , as recounted in Saks ’s memoir , The Center Cannot Hold .
A genetically influenced disease , schizophrenia presents itself differently in everyone it attacks , but it is invariably terrifying , and often totally debilitating .
Unlike depression , it offers little hope of resolution .
And unlike bipolar disorder , which brings periods of euphoria , it appears to have no discernible upside .
Which is why scientists find the disease so mystifying .
One of the key tenets of Darwinism is that adaptations that work against the survival of a species are destined to disappear .
So why does schizophrenia continue to linger on ?
Could it be that it confers some advantage ?
For years , scientists struggled to identify an adaptive advantage that might explain schizophrenia ’s persistence .
Researchers from various disciplines volleyed ideas back and forth .
Some argued that the genes implicated in the disease promoted creativity ; others believed that schizophrenics were frustrated cult leaders — unorthodox thinkers constitutionally “ engineered ” to lead segments of humanity to break off from the herd , but who lacked the charisma to effect much change .
None of the theories gained much traction .
New research is pointing to a different possibility :
There may be no adaptive advantage provided by schizophrenia in and of itself , but rather from some genes that contribute to the disease .
According to a study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , there is evidence that some of the gene variants associated with schizophrenia — especially a mutation in a gene called disrupted - in - schizophrenia1 ( DISC1 ) — have been selected for by evolution .
This supports the idea that the disease may be a maladaptive combination of mutations that individually have the potential to enhance fitness .
It could be a more complicated version of the familiar case of sickle cell anemia : having two mutant copies of a certain gene causes the disease , whereas having only one mutant copy provides protection against malaria .
A recent study , headed up by Johns Hopkins University neuroscientists may have found what kind of process goes awry in schizophrenic brains .
Researchers found that DISC1 regulates the migration of new neurons in the adult brain .
When the levels of DISC1 were reduced in mice during adult neurogenesis , the newborn neurons sped up and overshot their intended targets within the hippocampus , says Xin Duan , a study collaborator .
When the neurons finally reached their destinations , they forged an unusual number of connections with neighboring cells , a series of events that might give rise to the abnormal — and quite crippling — brain functions associated with schizophrenia , according to Hongjun Song , a Johns Hopkins neurologist who also worked on the study .
It is possible , Song says , that further research will lead to a drug that treats schizophrenia by restoring normal neurogenesis .
So what evolutionary advantage could schizophrenia - related genes bring to people who have some of the genes but not the disease ?
For now , this remains one of the many open questions about this puzzling condition .
Some models of a plunging dollar look like this .
Others , perhaps more interesting , look like this .
Two University of Chicago psychologists , Louise Hawkley and John Cacioppo , have been trying to disentangle social isolation , loneliness , and the physical deterioration and diseases of aging , right down to the cellular level .
The researchers suspected that while the toll of loneliness may be mild and unremarkable in early life , it accumulates with time .
To test this idea , the scientists studied a group of college - age individuals and continued an annual study of a group of people who joined when they were between 50 and 68 years old .
Their findings , reported in the August issue of Current Directions in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , are revealing .
Consider stress , for example .
The more years you live , the more stressful experiences you are going to have : new jobs , marriage and divorce , parenting , financial worries , illness .
It ’s inevitable .
However , when the psychologists looked at the lives of the middle - aged and old people in their study , they found that although the lonely ones reported the same number of stressful life events , they identified more sources of chronic stress and recalled more childhood adversity .
Moreover , they differed in how they perceived their life experiences .
Even when faced with similar challenges , the lonelier people appeared more helpless and threatened .
And ironically , they were less apt to actively seek help when they are stressed out .
Hawkley and Cacioppo then took urine samples from both the lonely and the more contented volunteers , and found that the lonely ones had more of the hormone epinephrine flowing in their bodies .
Epinephrine is one of the body ’s “ fight or flight ” chemicals , and high levels indicate that lonely people go through life in a heightened state of arousal .
As with blood pressure , this physiological toll likely becomes more apparent with aging .
Since the body ’s stress hormones are intricately involved in fighting inflammation and infection , it appears that loneliness contributes to the wear and tear of aging through this pathway as well .
There is more bad news .
When we experience the depletion caused by stress , our bodies normally rely on restorative processes like sleep to shore us up .
But when the researchers monitored the younger volunteers ’ sleep , they found that the lonely nights were disturbed by many “ micro awakenings . ”
That is , they appeared to sleep as much as the normal volunteers , but their sleep was of poorer quality .
Not surprisingly , the lonelier people reported more daytime dysfunction .
Since sleep tends to deteriorate with age anyway , the added hit from loneliness is probably compromising this natural restoration process even more .
Loneliness is not the same as solitude .
Some people are just fine with being alone , and some even see solitude as an important path to spiritual growth .
But for many , social isolation and physical aging make for a toxic cocktail .
outpost where rogue spaceships go for parts , Norton Sales has some amazingly advanced junk .
Its location in North Hollywood , however , is as mundane as its wares are exotic .
While Norton mostly serves private space companies , it also does a fair amount of business with movie studios and car modders due to its inventory of cool - looking tech and powerful hydraulics .

Tali Fahima , 30 , said she had no regrets and insisted that she had done nothing to harm the state of Israel as she left prison to the cheers of a hundred supporters .
Ms Fahima , a legal secretary , was arrested in August 2004 after the last of a series of visits to Jenin , which were publicised in the media .
She was detained without trial after the defence minister said she " took part in planning a terrorist attack in Israel " .
She was attacked in the Israeli press as a " terrorist 's whore " after journalists were briefed that she had an affair with a Palestinian militant , Zakaria Zubeidi , who is often described as Israel 's most wanted man .
Ms Fahima said there was no truth in any of the allegations and said she was only arrested after she declined to work for Shin Bet , Israel 's secret service .
When she was tried no evidence was presented of her involvement in a terrorist attack , although she admitted reading an Israeli army document that soldiers lost on patrol .
Ms Fahima pleaded guilty to meeting enemy agents and passing information to them as part of a plea bargain in December 2005 .
The charges could have led to a life sentence but Ms Fahima was offered the opportunity to serve only a further 10 months in return for a guilty plea .
As part of the condition of her release she is " banned from leaving the country in the coming year , contacting a foreign agent or entering unauthorised territories " , the Israeli prison service said in a statement .
She said she had no plans to visit Jenin and Zubeidi but said she wanted to continue to fight Israel 's occupation of the territories .
Restricting energy use is the only way to tackle climate change , according to new research by a historian at the University of East Anglia .
Dr Paul Warde argues that policies focused on energy efficiency are unlikely to produce the cuts in consumption needed to control carbon emissions .
His paper Facing the challenge of climate change : energy efficiency and energy consumption is published in the journal History and Policy .
Politicians have hailed energy - saving technology as a solution to climate change and current EU environmental policy aims to cut energy use by 20 per cent by improving energy efficiency .
Dr Warde ’s research shows that energy efficiency improvements of this order are easily achievable , having occurred in the 1920s , 1950s , and again in the 1980s , but on their own have had little impact on climate change .
He argues that even if energy efficiency is improved it will not offset the overall dynamic of economic growth ; carbon emissions will still increase .
Increasing energy efficiency will only make energy - intensive development even more attractive .
Dr Warde said : “ Since the late 19th century Britain ’s energy efficiency has improved considerably .
We are more energy efficient now than we were in Shakespeare 's time , and far more efficient than during the industrial revolution .
Although we are over three times more energy efficient than we were in the 1880s , we each consume about a third more energy , so carbon emissions keep rising .
“ History suggests that we cannot rely on the transition to biofuels and renewable energy sources to cut our carbon footprint .
To return to an ‘ organic economy ’ and supply our total energy needs from biofuels , each hectare of European land would have to be 30 times more productive than it was 200 years ago .
While the history of our transition from coal to oil - dependency suggests that a significant shift to renewable energy sources would require an extraordinary and unprecedented growth in their use , driven by huge incentives and political willpower .
“ The bottom line is that technology ca n’t contend with the realities of climate change .
The only effective solution is to curb consumption .
To stand a chance of meeting emissions targets , politicians need to switch their attention from energy efficiency to controls on consumption . ”
Dr Warde ’s analysis of four centuries of energy consumption and economic growth in England and Wales reveals :
Per capita energy consumption in Europe is about 10 times higher than it was under the wood - fuelled ‘ organic economy ’ , although the population is only three times larger than it was 200 years ago .
This suggests that a return to an organic economy through the widespread use of biofuels is not feasible .
From the early 17th century , coal began replacing wood as the primary source of fuel , but even at this early stage pamphleteers warned that coal could not be relied upon in the long - term because , unlike wood , it was non-renewable .
By 1700 coal was providing the majority of England and Wales ’ energy .
This led to periodic fears about its exhaustion and , in the early 1870s , a Royal Commission , which reported there were centuries of stocks remaining – a considerable under-estimate .
From the 1890s , economic growth was driven by the use of electricity , but oil did not begin to take up a significant share of national consumption until the 1960s .
Since the late 19th century , there have been frequent and significant energy efficiency improvements , but with growing prosperity and an increasingly energy - reliant economy , consumption has consistently outstripped any efficiency savings .
Most historic efficiency gains have been in industry , but well over half of final energy consumption is now in homes and transport , where efficiency gains have been minimal and outpaced by the expansion of travel and the increasing number of households .
There would have to be an extraordinary and unprecedented growth in the use of renewable energy sources to keep up with the continued expansion of energy use – even the transition from coal to oil took more than 50 years , shifting from 2 per cent of total energy supply in 1920 to 50 per cent in 1972 .

Today marks the fourth anniversary of a phrase that will go down in infamy .
On July 2 , 2003 , George W. Bush was asked about the rising casualty rates in Iraq .
His response ?
... anybody who wants to harm American troops will be found and brought to justice .
There are some who feel like that if they attack us that we may decide to leave prematurely .
They do n't understand what they 're talking about , if that 's the case .
Let me finish .
There are some who feel like -- that the conditions are such that they can attack us there .
My answer is , bring them on .
Rudy Giuliani ’s latest comments to the Weekly Standard might help underscore what a ridiculous candidate he is .
A liberal who had penned columns in his college paper extolling John Kennedy ’s virtues , Giuliani opposed the Vietnam war and voted for George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election .
“ I had traditionally been a Democrat , ” Giuliani told me in a recent interview in Las Vegas .
“ It was almost like a reflex mode .
I actually remember saying to myself , ‘ If I was a person really deciding who should be president right now , I ’d probably vote for Nixon , because I think the country would be safer with Nixon . ’
My concern was the Soviets , foreign policy , strong military . ”
Whatever his concern , it was not enough to make Giuliani pull the lever for a Republican .
Now , by any reasonable measure , Giuliani sounds ridiculous .
Giuliani could have said , “ Yes , I was a liberal Democrat in 1972 , but soon after saw the error of my ways .
Like Ronald Reagan , I made the transition from Democrat to Republican and I ’m glad I did . ”
That would have been a perfectly satisfactory answer , and very few voters would lift an eyebrow over how a candidate voted in an election 35 years ago .
But Giuliani chose a very different direction .
He told the Weekly Standard that he voted for McGovern but he really thought Nixon was the better candidate .
He knew Nixon would keep the nation “ safer , ” but he voted for McGovern anyway .
Giuliani was in “ reflex mode , ” whatever the hell that means .
This is both amusing and pathetic at the same time .
NEW YORK - Civil libertarians are worried that a little - known anti-terrorism bill now making its way through the U.S. Congress with virtually no debate could be planting the seeds of another USA Patriot Act , which was hurriedly enacted into law after the al Qaeda attacks of Sep. 11 , 2001 .
The Violent Radicalisation and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , co-authored by the former chair of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , Jane Harmon , a California Democrat , passed the House by an overwhelming 400 - 6 vote last month , and will soon be considered by the Senate .
The bill 's co-author is Republican Congressman David Reichert of Washington State .
The Senate version is being drafted by Susan Collins of Maine , the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , which is chaired by the hawkish Connecticut independent , Sen. Joe Lieberman .
Harmon is chair of the House Homeland Security Intelligence Subcommittee .
Civil liberties groups , including the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , say the measure could herald a new government crackdown on dissident activity and infiltration of universities under the guise of fighting terrorism .
The CCR's Kamau Franklin , a Racial Justice Fellow , told IPS , ' This measure looks benign enough , but we should be concerned about where it will lead .
It may well result in recommendations for new laws that criminalise radical thought and peaceful dissent , posing as academic study . '
Franklin added , ' Crimes such as conspiracy or incitement to violence are already covered by both state and federal statute .
There is no need for additional criminal laws . '
He speculated that Congress ' may want to get this measure passed and signed into law to head off peaceful demonstrations ' at the upcoming Republican and Democratic Party conventions .
' And no Congressperson of either political party wants to vote against this bill and get labeled as being soft on terrorism . '
Harman 's bill would convene a 10 - member national commission to study ' violent radicalisation ' ( defined as ' the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically - based violence to advance political , religious , or social change ' ) and ' homegrown terrorism ' ( defined as ' the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born , raised , or based and operating primarily within the United States [...] to intimidate or coerce the United States government , the civilian population of the United States , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives ' ) .
The bill also directs the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to designate a university - based research ' centre of excellence ' where academics , policy - makers , members of the private sector and other stakeholders can collaborate to better understand and prevent radicalisation and homegrown terrorism .
Some experts are concerned that politics will unduly influence which institution DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff will designate .
In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , Chertoff was head of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , and played a key role in implementing the department 's roundup of hundreds of Muslims who were detained without charge , frequently abused , and denied access to legal counsel .
Critics of Harmon 's bill point out that commission members would all be appointed by a high - ranking elected official .
Those making these appointments would include the president , the secretary of Homeland Security , the speaker and ranking member of the House , the majority and minority leaders of the Senate , and senior members of the House and Senate committees overseeing homeland security .
Critics also fear that the bill 's definitions of ' extremism ' and ' terrorism ' are too vague and its mandate too broad , and that government - appointed commissions could be used as ideological cover to push through harsher laws .
Congressional sponsors of the bill claim it is limited in scope .
' Though not a silver bullet , the legislation will help the nation develop a better understanding of the forces that lead to homegrown terrorism , and the steps we can take to stop it , ' Harman told Congress .

But the bill 's purpose goes beyond academic inquiry .
In a Nov. 7 press release , Harman said , ' the National Commission [ will ] propose to both Congress and Chertoff initiatives to intercede before radicalised individuals turn violent . '
According to the Centre for Constitutional Rights , the commission ' will focus in on passing additional federal criminal penalties that are sweeping and inclusive in criminalising dissent and protest work more surveillance on thought rather than on actions .
Further , this bi-partisan attempt can set the ground for an even more acquiescent Congress to presidential power , never wanting to look weak on terrorism . '
The commission would be tasked with compiling information about what leads up to violent radicalisation , and how to prevent or combat it with the intent to issue a final report with recommendations for both preventative and countermeasures .
Implementing the bill would likely cost some 22 million dollars over the 2008 - 2012 period , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
But critics point out that the bill would duplicate work already being done in and out of government .
For example , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) already has a domestic terrorism unit ; the U.S. intelligence community monitors the homegrown terrorists and overseas networks that might be reaching out to U.S. residents ; and many universities and think - tanks are already specialising in studying the subject .
But Harman argues that a national commission on homegrown terrorism could benefit the country in much the same way as the 9/11 Commission , the Silberman / Robb Commission or other high - profile national security inquiries .
But groups like the CCR are wondering what exactly is meant by ' an extremist belief system ' .
' The term is left undefined and open to many interpretations -- socialism , anarchism , communism , nationalism , liberalism , etc. -- that would serve to undermine expressions that do n't fit within the allowable areas of debate .
A direct action led by any group that blocks traffic can be looked upon as being coercive , ' CCR says .
The bill says the Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalisation , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the U.S. by providing access to ' broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to U.S. citizens . '
While civil liberties groups agree that focus on the Internet is crucial , they fear it could set up far more intrusive surveillance techniques , without warrants , and the potential to criminalise ideas and not actions could mean penalties for a stance rather than a criminal act .
The bill also uses the term ' ideologically - based violence , meaning the use , planned use , or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individual 's political , religious , or social beliefs . '
But the CCR and other groups ask , ' What is force ?
Is civil disobedience covered under that , if arrested at a protest rally and charged with disorderly conduct , obstructing governmental administration , or even assault , does that now open you up to possible terrorist charges in the future ?'
Some of the most egregious terrorist attacks in U.S. history have been carried out by U.S. citizens , including the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 .

One of the more tedious things one is faced with while writing web applications is input forms .
Forms suck because they 're boring and repetitive .
Building them manually is the same thing over and over , but they 're often just different enough that fully automating them is rather difficult .
I can't say I 've ever seen a perfect solution , but I 've come to consider Magritte a pretty good solution if your forms do n't need to be too highly customized .
For an in depth look at the design of Magritte you should read Lukas '
Master 's thesis , however , it 's a bit much if you 're just trying to get something done and just want to understand how to get going with the basics .
Magritte 's capable of more than you 'll likely use if you 're just wanting to build forms with Seaside .
I 'm going to ignore those other abilities because frankly , I do n't use them and do n't plan to .
The basic design of Magritte involves a few classes that you 'll need to be familiar with and often subclass to extend and customize .
MADescription
With Magritte you describe your objects with subclasses of MADescription , this is where you 'll always start , just describing the fields of your domain objects that you 'll want generated forms for .
Descriptions contain the extra metadata necessary to create user interfaces , and which component will be used to render it .
A simple description looks like this ...
descriptionIsClosed ^ ( MABooleanDescription new ) selectorAccessor : #isClosed ; label : ' Is Closed ' ; priority : 1000 ; yourself
Generally speaking you 'll keep these descriptions on the class side of your domain object .
On occasion , you 'll want some property of the description to be dynamic and depend on the actual value of an instance side value , so you 'll move the description to the instance side .
Strictly speaking , it does n't matter where you put them , sometimes you 'll use them to build forms when you do n't even have a domain object , but this is n't the normal case .
There are two basic ways to create a form dynamically , one is simple and includes all descriptions found on an object ...
buildComponentFor : aModel ^aModel asComponent addValidatedForm
The other , a little more complex , but much more useful because you 'll find that rarely do you want " every " described field in a form .
Often you 'll have multiple UI representations of a domain object within an app .
Descriptions are composable using a comma so you can build a form any subset of the fields ...
buildComponentFor : aModel ^(( ModelClass descriptionFieldOne , ModelClass descriptionFieldTwo , ModelClass descriptionFieldThree ) asComponentOn : a Model ) addValidatedForm ; yourself
A Magritte form is generally wrapped with a form decoration via #addValidateForm , which by default gives you a #save and # cancel button .
Magritte forms do n't directly work on your domain objects .
They work on a memento of the values pulled from your object using the descriptions .
When you call #save , the values are validated using the descriptions , and only after passing all validation rules are the values committed to your domain object by the momentos via the accessors , which I 'll describe shortly .
For those interested , this is a good place to plug in a custom container component and integrate the #commit with Glorp , but that 's another post .
Conditions
Descriptions can have predicates associated with them to validate the input data which it calls conditions .
There are two basic kinds of conditions ( there are actually more , but the block forms are what I use ) , both are simply blocks that returns true or false to validate the data .
One is the single field condition which is passed the pending value directly and attached directly to your descriptions .
It 's as simple as ...
addCondition : [ : value | value withBlanks Trimmed size > 3 ]
The other is the multi field validation which works on the memento which I 'll describe below .
addCondition : [ : memento | ( memento cache at : CAUser descriptionPassword ) isNil or : [ ( memento cache at : CAUser descriptionPassword ) = ( memento cache at : CAUser descriptionConfirmedPassword ) ] ] labelled : ' Passwords must match ' ;
I 've posted about these previously .
They are attached to your containers description which has access to all the fields .
Conditions are one of the few things about Magritte that I 'm still iffy on .
There are advantages to having your rules outside your domain objects , especially if you 're taking advantage of Magritte as an Adaptive Object Model where users can build rules from the UI .
It also allows the mementos to easily test data for validity outside the domain object and gives you a nice place to hook into the validation system in the components .
It bothers me a little because it weakens the domain model , I 'm still trying to find my balance here and decide just how much I 'll allow as conditions .
Magritte is very pluggable , should I decide I want all my rules in my domain objects , I could plug in my own memento subclass to handle that , but I have n't felt the need just yet .
MAMemento
When components read and write to domain objects , they do it using mementos rather than working on the objects directly .
The default memento is MAChecked Memento , a subclass of MACachedMemento .
The mementos give Magritte a place to store invalid form data prior to allowing the data to be committed to the object .
It also allows Magritte to detect concurrency conflicts for shared in image objects .
By never committing invalid data to domain objects , there 's never a need to roll anything back .
Should you feel the need , just override #mementoClass on your domain object to provide your own .
MAAccessor
When a memento writes valid data to its model , it does so through accessors which are also defined by the descriptions .
MAAccessor subclasses allow you to define how a value gets written to your class .
For example , while I have a read selector for my collections like #users , I prefer to encapsulate #add and #remove on the domain object itself rather than having a writable selector for #users : .
When creating a description for that collection , I can specify my custom #accessor : rather than using the default # selectorAccessor : which then writes to my domain object with #addUser : and #removeUser : .
Another valuable use for accessors can be found when you want to flatten several domain objects into a single form .
Say you have a User object with an Address object , and a CreditCard object but you want to edit them all as a single form .
You can create your form and dynamically wire up some MAChainAccessors like so ...
userTemplate ^(((( CAUser descriptionEmail , CAUser descriptionPassword , CAUser descriptionConfirmedPassword ) addAll : ( CAAddress description collect : [ : each | each copy accessor : ( MAChain Accessor accessor : ( MASelectorAccessor selector : #address ) next : each accessor ) ] ) ; addAll : ( CACreditCard description collect : [ : each | each copy accessor : ( MAChain Accessor accessor : ( MASelectorAccessor selector : # creditCard ) next : each accessor ) ] ) ) yourself ) asComponentOn : self session user ) addValidatedForm : { ( #save -> ' Update Profile ' ) } ; yourself .
Which basically just composes the users descriptions with the addresses and credit cards descriptions while chaining the accessors together to allow the addresses fields to be written to the address object rather than directly to the customer object .
Any non trivial UI will contain many such forms and this is the ability I 'm the most grateful for in Magritte .
Also notice in the example above how I changed the label for the save button to " Update Profile " , also something you 'll need to do often that is n't immediately obvious how to do .
MADescriptionComponent
Components control how your objects display .
Magritte widgets are subclasses of this component .
Some descriptions have an obvious one to one relationship with a UI component while others could easily be shown by several different components .
For example , an MAMemoDescription would be represented by a text area , but a MABooleanDescription could be a checkbox , or a drop down with true and false , or a radio group with true and false .
Each description defaults to a component , but allows you to override and specify any component you choose , including any custom one you may write .
For example , suppose I built a special component to render checkboxes as fancy graphics rather than ordinary html checkboxes .
I could plug it in by changing the description as follows .
descriptionIsClosed ^ ( MABooleanDescription new ) selectorAccessor : #isClosed ; label : ' Is Closed ' ; priority : 1000 ; componentClass : CAFancyCheckbox ; yourself
These are essentially meta components written in standard Seaside .
They work on mementos and have access to your descriptions .
This is where all that meta data comes in handy .
If you 're building a dropdown list , it 'll get its option list from the description .
When you render an element 's label , that 's also read from the description .
When you build your own descriptions , you 'll add fields to them for custom data that you 'll want available in your custom components .
At first , you 'll mostly use built in descriptions and components , but as you grow comfortable with Magritte you 'll start wanting to build your own descriptions and components because you 'll want to do things beyond the basic framework like Ajax .
Magritte provides a solid foundation for extension .
MAComponentRenderer
By default , Magritte forms are rendered using MATableRenderer which renders the fields in a table with errors at the top and labels to the left of input fields .
This is the default because it 's the easiest thing to do automatically that looks halfway decent .
This can be overridden like so ...
buildComponentFor : aModel ^(( ModelClass descriptionFieldOne , ModelClass descriptionFieldTwo , ModelClass descriptionFieldThree ) componentRenderer : MACssRenderer ; asComponentOn : a Model ) addValidatedForm ; yourself
This hook allows you to render the form as you please , should you want to display errors differently , or change how elements are wrapped , or how the outer container itself is wrapped .
It 's handy to control how container classes are tagged with css classes to have the form dynamically change its appearance for various phases like valid / invalid .
If you do n't want your forms to look like auto - generated forms , you will use this .
For each of the classes I just described , you 'll want to pull up a hierarchy browser and explore all the subclasses to see examples of how they are specialized .
Find some example projects in SqueakSource that use Magritte to see how others create custom descriptions and components .
As with any framework , successful use depends on understanding it , and understanding how the pieces fit together .
Magritte will not doing everything you want out of the box , it is n't meant to , but it 's an excellent foundation to base your application on .
It will save you many hours of tedious work building forms by hand .
It will also give your objects extra metadata that you may find handy for purposes other than building forms .
Along with Seaside , Magritte is also an excellent example of extremely well written object oriented code that is worth reading to see exactly what it takes to make a truly flexible and pluggable framework .
Because it was originally a masters thesis , it 's also far better commented than you 'd likely find in a similar " real " world framework .

A third trial will be held for a former New Zealand man found guilty of the first - degree murder of his Canadian wife while the pair vacationed in B.C. ’s Southern Interior 10 years ago .
British Columbia ’s highest court says a new trial should be held for Peter Beckett because the trial judge was wrong to admit certain evidence and the Crown ’s submissions to the jury were improper .

As if emotional campaign messages were n’t enough , politicians now have another way to try to win over the electorate .
A study in Israel shows that voters can be manipulated into changing their attitudes by being shown subliminal images of their national flag .
A team led by psychologist Ran Hassin at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem divided volunteers into two groups : those who strongly identified with Israeli nationalism and those who identified with it only weakly .
They then quizzed them about their attitude to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict after showing them a brief image of an Israeli flag or a control image . …
The Ontario government has given approval for a California company to construct a massive solar " farm " near Sarnia that will blanket an area larger than all three Toronto islands with hundreds of thousands of sun-soaking panels .
It will be the largest solar power station in North America and among the most expansive in the world to use photovoltaic cells that produce electricity when exposed to sunlight .
Once complete , the 40 - megawatt Sarnia project will be able to supply enough emission - free electricity to power between 10,000 and 15,000 homes on sunny days .
" This is certainly the most exciting thing I 've ever worked on , " said Peter Carrie of OptiSolar Farms Canada Inc. , a subsidiary of Hayward , Calif . - based OptiSolar Inc .
" We want to take solar mainstream . "
The Ontario Power Authority has agreed to purchase the electricity under a 20 - year contract that will see the clean power go into the provincial grid .
An official announcement is expected today from the energy ministry .
The current world record - holder is the 12 - megawatt Erlasee solar park in Germany , though another 40 - megawatt park is under construction in the same region .
On Monday , the largest U.S. project was announced : A 15 - megawatt solar PV system to be built at an air force base in Nevada .
The Sarnia solar farm will be enormous by comparison , stretching across nearly 365 hectares , the equivalent of 419 Canadian football fields .
An army of panels will be erected as high as seven metres off the ground , all tilted south to soak up sunlight .
In a Canadian context , the magnitude is even more impressive .
The 100 - kilowatt solar installation atop Exhibition Place 's historic Horse Palace , now the largest in Canada , is 400 times smaller than OptiSolar 's proposed farm .
The company would not reveal the cost of the project for proprietary reasons , but Carrie said a typical 10 - megawatt system runs between $ 70 million and $ 80 million .
This means the cost of the Sarnia project , to be built in four 10 - megawatt phases , could carry a price tag of around $ 300 million .
" Forty megawatts is huge , " said John Stanton , vice - president of government affairs at the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association in Washington , D.C .
Stanton said solar panel systems , once relegated to the rooftops of homes , farms and commercial buildings , are growing in size as technology costs fall and government incentives increase .
" There 's also an increasing recognition of the public benefits associated with solar energy production , " he said .
" Solar power is carbon - free , it 's pollution - free , it does n't need water , does n't make noise .
Solar also produces power during peak business hours , so it displaces natural gas , " he said .
But compared to coal , nuclear power , even wind , solar 's squeaky - clean image comes at a high price .
OptiSolar is selling the electricity to the province under its new standard offer program , which pays a premium for electricity that comes from small - scale renewable projects .
In the case of wind , it 's 11 cents per kilowatt - hour .
Solar fetches 42 cents per kilowatt hour , nearly four times as much .
Deborah Doncaster , executive director of the Ontario Sustainable Energy Association , said the premium may seem high but is justified given the environmental benefits .
She said it 's often forgotten that solar - generated electricity tends to offset natural gas during peak periods when air conditioners are blasting and electricity rates are at their highest .
" Forty - two cents compared against 6.4 cents for nuclear is comparing apples to oranges , " she said , adding that the publicly touted costs of nuclear power and fossil fuels never reflect environmental costs , health impacts , and industry subsidies .
" I think the issue around 42 cents has to be looked at in the proper context of hidden costs , " Doncaster said .
And while large on a solar scale , the Sarnia project is a lightweight compared to nuclear or coal plants .
Peak electricity consumption in Ontario yesterday was 18,055 megawatts .
OptiSolar 's farm could at most supply . 2 per cent of that power .
Carrie said OptiSolar chose Ontario over its home base of California , because of the 42 - cent offer , which is n't available anywhere else in North America .
Only European countries have taken such an approach , explaining why world solar leader Germany installed seven times more solar panels than the United States in 2006 .
OptiSolar hopes the premium offered through the Ontario program will give it a return on its investment over the life of its 20 - year contract with the province , said Carrie .
The company hopes to break ground in 2008 after getting the necessary municipal zoning approvals and building permits .
It has already purchased the real estate it needs , mostly low - value farm and industrial land , and has full backing of the local community .
Carrie said the Sarnia area was chosen because it has the right mix of land and good access to the electrical distribution network .
It 's also in the most southerly region of Ontario , meaning it offers the best " sun hours . "
Solar tends to be a low - maintenance technology , but several local contractors will be hired to help install and connect thousands of solar panels .
" There will also be ongoing contracts for property maintenance , grounds maintenance , security and equipment cleaning , " said Carrie , a Canadian and former employee of the energy ministry .
He most recently ran his own solar installation business in California .
If all goes according to schedule , the Sarnia solar farm will be fully functional in 2010 and will continue supplying clean electricity to the grid for the next 30 to 50 years .
Not much is known about OptiSolar , though many of its private investors are Canadian .
It was co-founded by Randy Goldstein and Phil Rettger , who previously founded the Calgary - based oil sands technology and project developer Opti Canada Inc .
The company says it has developed a way of mass - producing solar cells in a way that dramatically lowers the cost of the technology , making it competitive with conventional forms of electricity generation .
Carrie said the goal in Ontario is to showcase OptiSolar 's technology and demonstrate its performance , while at the same time generating revenues from electricity production .
IN January 2006 I stepped off a C - 130 in Tal Afar , Iraq .

But since returning home , I have seen that America has changed the channel .
Young investment bankers spend their impressive bonuses on clubs in Manhattan and many seem uninterested in the soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As a Princeton graduate and a former financial analyst , I was once a part of this world , and I like returning to it , putting the Spartan life of Tal Afar and Anbar Province behind me .
But even as I enjoy time with the friends who have welcomed me home , my thoughts wander back to other friends who continue to fight as the city parties on .
Serious problems with the war in Iraq are well chronicled , but I am struck by one that does not seem to trouble the country ’s leadership , even though it is profoundly corrosive to our common good : the disparity between the lives of the few who are fighting and being killed , and the many who have been asked for nothing more than to continue shopping .
Those who rationalize this disconnect have argued that our soldiers are volunteers , happy doing what they signed up to do .
While it is true that most soldiers are devoted to country and comrades , and are focused on their mission , the assertion that soldiers are cheerfully returning for multiple combat tours is grounded in statistics and arguments that are misleading .
All the models are said to have served in the Israeli Defence Force
The pictures are part of a public relations drive to improve the image of the country within the US .
Maxim said it was " pleased " with the result of its collaboration with the Israeli consulate in New York , which came up with the idea .
But some in Israel have said that the images were not appropriate .
" We definitely have public relations problems , and I 'm all for creative solutions , " Israeli lawmaker Colette Avital said .
" But there are enough beautiful and interesting things we can use to tap into this demographic than to show a half - naked woman in a magazine of this kind , considered pornographic . "
According to AP , the photo spread will include pictures of Israeli model Nivit Bash - who served in Israeli military intelligence - and former Miss Israel , Gal Gadot .
The Israeli consulate defended its decision , taken after research indicated that Israel meant very little to young US men .
" Males that age have no feeling toward Israel one way or another , and we view that as a problem , so we came up with an idea that would be appealing to them , " said David Dorfman , a media adviser at the consulate .
The photo feature , entitled " Women of the Israeli Defense Forces " , will be published in the July issue of the magazine .
The government must prevent police from storing the profiles of innocent people on the national DNA database , an influential group of experts has said .
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics also recommended that ministers drop plans to extend police powers that would see DNA samples being taken from people suspected of minor offences such as littering or speeding .
" Innocent people are concerned about how their DNA might be used in future if it is kept on the national DNA database without their consent , " said Sir Bob Hepple QC , chair of the council , which convened a group of lawyers , ethicists , geneticists and sociologists a year ago to study the ethical issues behind the use of biological information in police investigations .
The national DNA database has details of almost 4 million people and almost 400,000 profiles of biological samples ( such as blood , semen , saliva or hair ) left at crime scenes .
It is updated every day and automatically compares the DNA profiles it receives with those from crime scenes .
A Home Office report in 2006 said the database provided police with about 3,000 matches every month .
Under present laws , police can take DNA samples from anyone who has been arrested for recordable offences without asking permission .
The profiles are permanently stored on the database , even if the person is later acquitted of all charges
" We 're recommending that the police should only be permitted to keep the DNA of people who are convicted of a recordable offence , " said Carole McCartney , director of the centre for criminal justice studies at the University of Leeds and one of the authors of the report , published today .
She said exceptions could be made for people charged with violent or sexual offences .
But the Home Office said that maintaining records of people who were innocent at the time had helped solve crimes years later .
" It is estimated that there are about 200,000 profiles on the database which would have been removed prior to a change in legislation in 2001 , " a spokesperson said .
" From these , about 8,500 individuals have been matched with DNA taken from crime scenes , involving some 14,000 offences that include 114 murders , 55 attempted murders , 116 rapes , 68 other sexual offences , and a number of other serious crimes . "
In March , the government asked for feedback on proposals to expand police powers to take DNA samples from people arrested of non-recordable offences .
Dr McCartney said : " There 's no actual evidence that 's been provided that an increase in police powers would significantly improve the effectiveness of the DNA database . "
The report also advised against a DNA database containing records of everyone , which some say would remove issues of discrimination which have seen some ethnic minorities over - represented .
" This would be hugely expensive and would have only a small impact on public safety , " it said .
Rep. Conyers predicts
Bush cooperation as impeachment support grows RAW STORY
Published : Sunday July 8 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. John Conyers , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , appeared Sunday on This Week with George Stephanopoulos to discuss his promise to hold hearings next week on President Bush 's commutation of Scooter Libby 's jail sentence .
He also responded to questions on his committee 's outstanding subpoenas in the matter of the US Attorney firings , offering the striking suggestion that growing public support for impeachment of the president might make the White House more inclined to cooperate .
Conyers began by explaining why hearings into the Scooter Libby commutation are appropriate , even though the president 's pardon power is absolute .
" What separates this from President Clinton 's pardons , and anybody else 's , " said Conyers , " is that ... the president is not supposed to intervene until there has been an exhaustion of the appeal process .
And here the president did n't wait .
...
The suspicion was that if Mr. Libby went to prison , he might further implicate other people in the White House , and that there was some kind of relationship here that does not exist in any of President Clinton 's pardons . "
" You seem to be suggesting that President Bush commuted Mr. Libby 's sentence in order to keep him quiet , " said a surprised - sounding Stephanopoulos .
" That 's what the general impression is , " responded Conyers .
However , he insisted that his committee was simply asking Bush to do what Clinton had done and release his lawyers from executive privilege so they could explain the commutation and and " put this kind of feeling , that is fairly general , to rest . "
Stephanopoulos next asked Conyers what he intended to do in light of a Washington Post report that the White House plans to deny his request for documents on the US Attorney firings .
Conyers refused to be drawn into speculation , replying that " we do n't have any other choice " but to press ahead with the subpoenas .
Conyers emphasized that his committee is continuing to negotiate with the White House , and told Stephanopoulos , " We 're hoping that as the cries for Cheney and Bush now reach 46 % and 58 % , respectively , for impeachment , that we could begin to become a little bit more cooperative , if not even amicable in trying to get to the truth of these matters . "
" We 're seeking cooperation , " insisted Convers .
This is not partisan in any way . "
He also told Stephanopoulos , " I did n't put impeachment on the table .
I was just telling you that 46 % of the American people polled want Bush impeached . "
The following video is from ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos , broadcast on July 8 .
For more than two years , Rosenfeld , an ultrasound technologist , has been fighting to get a get .
Until she does , she will remain in limbo - unable to date , marry or have children .
The implications , if she were to move on without a get , are real .
She'd be ostracized in her community , considered an adulteress , and her offspring would be deemed mamzerim , bastards only fit to marry other bastards .
She says her husband has vowed to deny the get until he knows she 's too old to bear children .

Austin ( TX ) American - Statesman :
The state 's director of science curriculum has resigned after being accused of creating the appearance of bias against teaching intelligent design .
Comer was put on 30 days paid administrative leave shortly after she forwarded an e-mail in late October announcing a presentation being given by Barbara Forrest , author of " Inside Creationism 's Trojan Horse , " a book that says creationist politics are behind the movement to get intelligent design theory taught in public schools .
Forrest was also a key witness in the Kitzmiller v. Dover case concerning the introduction of intelligent design in a Pennsylvania school district .
Comer sent the e-mail to several individuals and a few online communities , saying , " FYI . "
Eugenie Scott , executive director of the National Center for Science Education , which sent the original e-mail to Comer announcing the event , said Comer 's situation seems to be a warning to agency employees .
" This just underscores the politicization of science education in Texas , " Scott said .
" In most states , the department of education takes a leadership role in fostering sound science education .
Apparently TEA employees are supposed to be kept in the closet and only let out to do the bidding of the board . "
Needless to say this is taking the science blogs by storm ... more at two of my favorites , Bad Astronomy ( thanks for the tip , Phil ) and Pharyngula .
Update : Some commenters are taking offense that this post is anti-Christian .
I wrote it .
I 'm a Christian ( believing Quaker ) .
A great many members of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State believe as I do that intelligent design is a specific attempt by Fundamentalists to inject religion into the public schools , and some of us also believe that if the State teaches the Bible they will misinterpret it for our children .
Religious freedom requires freedom from anyone 's individual religious beliefs being force taught in the public schools as scientific fact .

Text messaging is an increasingly popular tool in American politics and an established one abroad .
In his statement , Mr. Nelson acknowledged that the technology is “ being harnessed by organizations and individuals communicating their diverse opinions about issues and topics . ”
He said Verizon has “ great respect for this free flow of ideas . ”
But the company did not retreat from its position that it is entitled to decide what messages to transmit .
Legal experts said Verizon ’s position is probably correct under current law , although some called for regulations that would require wireless carriers of text messages to act like common carriers , making their services available to all speakers on all topics .
“ This incident , more than ever , shows the need for an open , nondiscriminatory , neutral Internet and telecommunications system that Americans once enjoyed and took for granted , ” said Gigi B. Sohn , the president of Public Knowledge , a consumer advocacy group .
Some of Verizon ’s customers said they were outraged by the company ’s initial stance .
Gary Mitchell , a lawyer in New Jersey , said he called a Verizon customer sales representative on this morning to cancel his wireless service in protest .
After spending a few minutes on hold , he said , the representative read him an e-mail message that she said all the customer service representatives had just received .
The message instructed representatives to tell callers that the policy had been reversed .
Verizon kept Mr. Mitchell ’s business but lost some of his respect .
“ It was an incredibly foolish corporate decision , ” he said .
Wyn Hoag , a photographer in California , said he was still considering whether to cancel his Verizon service .
“ I ’m a supporter of abortion rights , but I could be a Christian right person and still be in favor of free speech , ” Mr. Hoag said .
“ If they think they can censor what ’s on my phone , they ’ve got another thing coming . ”
Ex-drugs official Zheng Xiaoyu was executed in July
An order on its website said execution should be reserved for " an extremely small number of serious offenders " .
It said the death penalty should be withheld in certain cases of crimes of passion or economic crimes .
Amnesty International says China carried out two - thirds of the world 's executions last year , but China says it expects a 10 - year low this year .
Amendment
The Supreme Court said murders triggered by family disputes should not always result in the death penalty .
Crimes of passion should take into account the offender 's payment of compensation , it said .
CHINA'S DEATH PENALTY
China is believed to execute more people than rest of the world combined Non-violent crimes such as tax fraud and embezzlement carry death penalty
Other crimes include murder , rape , robbery and drug offences China does not publish official figures on executions
Many cases are based on confessions and trials often take less than a day , observers say
Similarly , those convicted of economic crimes should be treated more leniently if they help to recoup money that was defrauded .
The court suggested greater use of two - year suspensions on death penalties - allowing them to be converted to imprisonment .
However , it continued to back capital punishment as a deterrent .
" We must hand down and carry out immediate capital punishment in regard to heinous cases , with iron - clad evidence that result in serious social damage , " its statement said .
The most high - profile execution this year was of the former head of the State Food and Drug Administration , Zheng Xiaoyu , for taking 6.5 m yuan ( $ 860,000 ; £ 430,000 ) in bribes and for dereliction of duty .
In 2005 , an estimated 1,770 executions were carried out and nearly 4,000 people were sentenced to death , human rights group Amnesty International says .
But China says the number has fallen since an amendment came into force this January requiring the Supreme People 's Court to approve all death sentences .
Nope , kids — hold your horses , it 's not the new GT - R , that 's still being revealed in Tokyo later this month .
Almost like a tease , Nissan 's just revealed the new 2008 Skyline coupe in Japan — it 's the Nissan version of the Infiniti G37 coupe we saw revealed at the New York Auto Show earlier this year .
That means this new - for - 2008 model gets the same engine as the G37 — the powerful 3.7 - liter V6 engine that delivers 330 horses in the Infiniti .
The new Skyline somehow adds an extra three horses , with Nissan pegging the 2008 model at 333 HP and 270 lb- ft of torque in all four of the variants of the new Nissan two - door hardtop .
Also available will be the full complement of toys found in the G37 including backup camera , " HDD CARWINGS " nav system and even real wood trim .
Full press release after the jump .
We were n't lucky enough to get a first - hand drive of the new G37 coupe yet , but now that buff …
Nissan Announces All - New Skyline Coupe
TOKYO ( Oct. 2 , 2007 ) - Nissan Motor Co. , Ltd. today introduced the all - new Skyline coupe in Japan , a grand touring coupe designed to set new benchmarks for dynamic styling and outstanding driving performance .
It is available now at Nissan dealers nationwide .
SHIFT_passion : A Skyline Coupe Created to Make the Heart Pound
The new Skyline coupe builds on the strengths and attributes of the current Skyline sedan - attraction , sophistication and high - performance - and takes them to an even higher level .
It combines dramatic styling and a refined , driver - oriented interior with the advanced performance made possible by a newly developed , innovative VVEL ( Variable Valve Event and Lift ) 3.7 - liter V6 engine and a high - performance platform to create a vehicle that will appeal the discerning coupe buyer .
A Glamorous , Dynamic Exterior
The new Skyline coupe 's seductive exterior design starts with its powerful , elegant front fender curvature , flowing silhouette and glamorous front and rear fenders .
The expressive front fascia features characteristic Skyline fender lines and a low , rhythmic , wave - like hood .
The sculpted , bright - finished grille and L - shaped Bi-Xenon headlights add to its commanding presence .
Large wheel wells , Skyline - signature LED combination taillights and dual exhaust enhance the new Skyline coupe 's high - performance appearance .
A unique front bumper with matching side sill spoilers is available with Skyline 370GT Type SP and S models .
Seven exterior colors are offered , including Nissan 's two new colors : Vibrant Red and Luna Mare Silver .
A Highly Refined Interior , Innovative Technology
The new Skyline coupe 's interior is designed with one overriding goal : to make driving a joy .
The comfortable , embracing driver 's position and supportive seats combine with a parallel hand - stitched , genuine leather - wrapped steering wheel and light , sturdy magnesium paddle shifters to set the stage for driving exhilaration .
The stylish curves of the front seat and door trim help create a sporty elegance .
Two interior color schemes are available - Fauve , with real wood trim ( manufacturer option ) , or Cool Black , featuring real aluminum trim .
The Skyline coupe interior also offers an array of advanced technology systems , including an Intelligent Key system that electronically locks the steering , immobilizes the engine and handles other jobs according to the key ID for enhanced theft prevention .
Also available is a Blind - Side Monitor system that assists the driver when pulling to a curb or parallel parking , by displaying a view of the blind areas around the front left of the vehicle .
The Blind - Side Monitor is offered together ( as a manufacturer option ) with a RearView Monitor system , which displays images behind the vehicle through the use of a compact CCD camera .
The HDD CARWINGS navigation system ( manufacturer option ) now includes a touch panel for greater convenience .
Besides the navigation function , it is packed with entertainment features , including the Music Box recorder / player and playback of DVDs , audio and video media , as well as Bluetooth Hands - Free features .
The Skyline coupe also offers a premium Bose audio system , which turns the cabin into a very special listening environment .
The advanced Bose system , available as a manufacturer option , features top playback quality in an onboard system and includes a pair of three - way integrated speakers in the doors and four woofers in the doors and rear shelf .
Exhilarating , Exciting Performance From a New Engine and Advanced Platform
The new Skyline coupe continues to offer exceptional levels of driving performance , ride comfort , roominess and utility through use of the advanced FM ( Front Mid- ship ) package and FR - L platform .
First utilized in the V35 Skyline , the newly enhanced FR - L platform combines a sturdy , low - vibration body structure that makes the driver feel one with the car with high performance and stability - while also satisfying safety and environmental requirements .
At the heart of the Skyline coupe 's dynamic performance is the newly developed VQ37VHR engine , which responds briskly , accelerates smoothly , is fuel efficient and attains high emissions standards .
The VQ37VHR represents a new generation of high - performance engines and , at 333 horsepower , is the most powerful V6 in its class .
Generating 90 % of maximum torque between 2,400 and 7,000 rpm , the engine power is light , smooth and easy to handle right up to the 7,500 rpm redline .
The VQ37VHR 's new , advanced Variable Valve Event and Lift ( VVEL ) system continuously changes the angle and lift of the intake valves , depending on the degree of acceleration and speed of the engine .
The fully symmetrical air intakes on right and left increase the volume of intake air and reduce pumping loss , significantly increasing responsiveness .
The result is the simultaneous achievement of seemingly conflicting needs : quick acceleration response , high power , low fuel - consumption and cleaner exhaust .
The new powerplant is mated to a choice of manual or automatic transmissions .
The close - ratio 6 - speed manual transmission allows for quick shifting and sporty touring using a short - stroke design and triple - cone synchros for the first three gears .
For ease of operation , the Skyline coupe 's available full - range electronic 5 - speed automatic transmission includes a standard automatic shifter plus a driver - side manual shifter .
The normal " D " mode provides smooth driving , while shifting to the " DS " mode provides a sportier feel .
The transmission 's ASC ( adaptive shift control ) adds comfort by automatically selecting the best gear for cornering , downhill driving and other critical situations to suit both the driver 's style and environment .
Nissan engineers maximized sturdiness and lightness in the Skyline coupe 's double - wishbone front suspension and multi-link rear suspension designs to enhance stability and responsiveness , as well as driver control .
The dual - flow pass shock absorbers were developed through extensive review of damping force and rebound spring criteria , helping create the Skyline coupe 's smooth , refreshing ride feel while maintaining high levels of maneuvering stability .
To match braking capability to the increased engine performance , the Skyline coupe employs four - wheel aluminum - caliper opposed - piston brakes ( standard on both the SP and S versions of the 370GT ) - which are designed to optimize the stroke at low speed and provide secure stopping power at higher speeds .
The standard 4 - wheel Anti-lock Braking System ( ABS ) also includes Electronic Braking Distribution ( EBD ) and Brake Assist ( BA ) , while Intelligent Brake Assist is available as a manufacturer option .
The Skyline coupe also features standard Vehicle Dynamic Control ( VDC ) and a speed - sensitive hydraulic power steering system .
Another advanced performance feature available with the new Skyline coupe is Nissan 's four - wheel active steering ( 4WAS ) system , which adjusts the steering - linked angles of front and rear wheels according to speed , making the vehicle more responsive to the driver at low and medium speeds , and stable and smooth at higher speeds .
4WAS is standard on both the SP and S versions of the 370GT .
Leading - Edge Safety and Environmental Technologies
The Skyline coupe also offers a long list of convenience , safety and environmental features , including Bi-Xenon headlights with Active AFS ( Adaptive Front lighting System ) , door mirror with heater , flat - blade wipers , fuel efficiency gauge and reduced levels of volatile organic compound used in the cabin , which helps create better interior air quality .
Standard safety equipment includes rigid , safe Zone Body construction , driver and front passenger SRS Air Bag System , driver and front passenger SRS Side Air Bag System , SRS Curtain Air Bag System , Active Front Head Restraints and three - point ELR rear seat belts .
Emergency Brake Operated Pre-crash Front Seat Belts are optionally available .
The Skyline coupe body has been designed to offer greater pedestrian protection , including the application of Nissan 's new " pop - up engine hood " technology .
When sensors embedded in the front bumper detect an impact with a pedestrian , the system 's control unit determines if the hood needs to be instantly raised .
If deemed necessary , the control unit activates a pyrotechnic actuator that raises the rear edge of the hood , creating a larger , protective buffer space between the hood and hard engine components underneath .
This helps cushion the impact to the pedestrian 's head if it collides with the hood .
From an environmental standpoint , all Skyline coupe models are certified as SU - LEVs , meeting 2005 standards to cut emissions by 75 % .
In addition , over 95 % of the vehicle is recyclable ( based on definitions of recyclables for new cars and calculation guidelines by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association , 1998 ) .
Models and Sales Target
The new Skyline coupe is available in four models , each equipped with the new 3.7 - liter VVEL V6 : 370GT , 370GT Type P , 370GT Type S and 370GT Type SP .
Target sales are 200 units per month .
Many like to tilt one back now and again — or again and again .
And the price of alcohol , in its various guises , ranges from free jailhouse hooch to holy shit !
For the budget - conscious boozer there ’s a certain cost - benefit analysis to purchasing your tipple of choice .
For the uber - rich , getting lit never cost so much .
Is it worth the price , or a case of fools and their money ?
So we ’re talking wine , Bourbon , Scotch , beer , Cognac , you name it .
Some in the list are artifacts of history , some are still being made , and some are just plain kitsch .
Ten different permutations of ethyl alcohol ; the high cost of getting high :
10 . $ 100 Market Price — $ 7,686 for One Bottle of Beer
It stands to reason that the working man ’s Champagne is the only product on this list that the working man can afford .
But at $ 100 a bottle , Sam Adams ’s “ Utopias ” is too rich for my blood alcohol level .
It does come bottled in a cute , brewing - kettle shaped bottle , and with an alcohol content of 25 % by volume ( strongest beer in the world ) , it gives a bit of bang for the buck .
However , $ 7,686 was paid at auction for the first bottle of Tutankhamun Ale .
It was developed by Cambridge University scientists who gleaned the recipe from hieroglyphics and brewing dregs from the catacombs of one of Tut ’s in - laws .
The remaining lot of beer was sold for about $ 76 per bottle .
9. $ 350 Bourbon
Evan Williams 23 year old Bourbon tops the bourbon elite with a price tag of $ 350 .
It is available only at the distillery .
8. $ 10,000 Cognac
The big Cognac houses always seem to one - up each other for the distinction of super - duper - ultra - deluxe - mega - killer - kick - A Cognac .
The latest entry is Remy Martin ’s venerable Louis XIII ’s upscale “ Black Pearl , ” selling for over $ 10,000 a bottle .
Unlike the regular Louis XIII bottling ( about $ 1500 ) , Black Pearl is blended from 1200 different eau - de - vie raging in age from 40 to 100 years .
It ’s so exclusive that it ’s sold by invitation only .
Lowlifes can’t even look at the product at their website without a password .
( Oo la la ! )
7. $ 14,730 Bottle of Champagne
Yes , I know Champagne is wine and I already have a wine category , but it deserves a special category because it ’s … well its Champagne !
In 2005 , a Methuselah of 1990 Louis Roederer Cristal , fetched $ 14,730 at auction .
A Methuselah ( explanation ) is a giant bottle of Champagne equal to eight regular sized ( 750 ml ) bottles .
So , really it was only like $ 1,841.25 a bottle .
What a deal !
6. $ 54,000 Rum
Irie irie , mon !
Jamaican rum for $ 54,000 ?
Four bottles of this rum bottled in the 1940 ’s were discovered recently .
Why it ’s believed to be so valuable , I do not know .
I did n’t think rum was trendy enough to fetch this price .
Maybe Bob Marley pickled something in it .
5. $ 75,000 Scotch Whisky
With a release price of $ 38,000 , a bottle of The Macallan “ Fine and Rare Collection , ” 1926 , was sold to a South Korean businessman in 2005 for $ 75,000 .
Unlike many other products on this list , this bottle is not a collectable for collection ’s sake , nor an excuse for a lavish bottle .
The money paid for this Scotch is money paid for the stuff in the bottle , and it ‘s meant to be drunk .
For these reasons , I elect The Macallan as the most expensive social lubricant on Earth .
If you ’d care to try it without investing in a whole bottle , an Atlantic City casino sells a 2 oz .
pour for only $ 3,300 !
4. $ 160,000 Bottle of Wine
At a 1985 Sotheby ’s auction , a bottle of 1787 Chateau Lafite was purchased for $ 160,000 .
Even without adjusting for inflation , this still stands as the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold ( or bought even ) .
Why so much for an undrinkable bottle of rotted vinegar ?
This relic was in the proud possession of Thomas Jefferson , whose initials are etched into the bottle .
3. $ 200,000 Bottle of Irish Whisky
Found in 2005 , this century - old bottle is from Ireland ’s Nun ’s Island distillery ( defunct since 1908 ) .
Attempts to locate a sample came to naught until a lady , unsolicited , walked into a liquor store with a bottle in hand .
She thought it “ might be worth something ” and wanted to see if the proprietor knew what it might be worth .
It ’s worth something , but priced at over $ 200,000 it has yet to sell in over 2 years .
When it sells , it will be by far the most expensive bottle of whisky or whiskey .
Any takers ?
2. $ 1,000,000 + Bottle of Vodka ?
How crazy will the trendy , high - end vodka craze get ?
I ’ve always been fairly certain vodka is all about a cool bottle and a hip name .
Now I ’m certain .
“ Diva ” vodka seeks to trump all - comers — game , set , and burp .
This triple distilled vodka , like many other vodkas , is also charcoal filtered .
The charcoal in Diva ’s case comes from a different array of carbon bonds ; the vodka is filtered through crushed diamonds .
But what really ups the price is the custom - made bottle .
Inside each bottle is an array of real gemstones , the quantity and quality of which depend on how much you ’re willing to pay .
A high - end bottle of Diva ( “ low - end ” being $ 3,700 ) will cost you more than a million dollars .
Wanna do shots ?
1. $ 1,500,000 Bottle of Tequila ?
Tequila Ley .925 sells a 6 year old 100 % Blue Agave Tequila in a pure platinum bottle for $ 225,000 .
Yes , some sucker actually bought one .
If you ’re on a budget , you can get the half - gold , half - platinum version for $ 150,000 .
The company now produces a one million Euro bottle ( $ 1.5 million USD ) which is platinum encrusted with diamonds .
They must be a bit hard - pressed to sell it , since they offer a one hundred thousand Euro finder ’s fee if you can find a buyer .
If the bottle sells , it ’ll be the most expensive bottle of any alcohol .
Curiously , the company is not too discriminating as to what goes in the bottle ; they ’ll fill it with some Cognac if you prefer .
BONUS : Most Expensive Bottle of Wine Never Sold ?
In 1989 , another of Thomas Jefferson ’s Bordeaux ’s ( this time a 1787 Chateau Margaux ) was taken to the Four Seasons restaurant in New York to show it off .
Near the end of the evening , a waiter bumped the dinner table and upended the wine , resulting in a total loss .
A total insured loss of $ 225,000 .
Cheers !

The most common way of fighting diseases like malaria , dengue fever , and West Nile today is to try to wipe out the mosquitoes carrying them and treat those who have been infected .
Now there 's an alternative on the horizon that promises to be safer and cheaper by zapping the germs while sparing the mosquitoes .
The technology is hidden in an artificial flower designed to attract mosquitoes and treat them with pathogen - killing drugs that allow the insects to live and continue to perform important functions such as pollinating flowers and serving as food for animals and other insects .
MIT Holding , Inc. , a Savannah , Ga. , pharmaceuticals distributor , says its PROVECTOR " flower " reduced the number of viruses that cause dengue and parasites that cause malaria in mosquitoes in lab settings .
Although company is still considering what type of flower the PROVECTOR will resemble , the product is designed to use visual , olfactory and chemical signals to entice mosquitoes to ingest antimalarial and antiviral treatments that inhibit the development of the pathogens .
This is a vastly different approach to current methods of fighting insect - borne diseases that involve treating populations with expensive preventive medications ( which can have serious side effects and may not work ) , the wholesale killing of the insects using toxic pesticides and / or treating the infected bite victims .
A major problem with current treatments for malaria — a long - lasting , potentially fatal blood disease that kills more than 2.7 million people a year , according to the World Health Organization — is that the parasites may become drug - resistant ; in such cases , they are spread along with the disease .
A group of researchers led by Pennsylvania State University biology professor Andrew Read recently published findings on the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA
Web site that indicate " the more drugs you use , the worse you make the situation in terms of the evolution of drug resistance . "
Lest you worry about the faux flower 's impact on humans and other living things : the flower portion of the PROVECTOR is covered by a membrane that protects people , bees and other animals that touch it but is thin enough to be penetrated by a mosquito 's long , pointy proboscis .
Tests have shown that the chemicals inside the PROVECTOR not only kill pathogens but also suppress the development of Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria if a mosquito encounters them after being treated .
" There appears to be a strong prophylactic action in the mosquito , " says Dr. Thomas Kollars , MIT Holding 's chief scientific advisor and director of the Biodefense and Infectious Disease Laboratory at Georgia Southern University 's Jiann - Ping Hsu College of Public Health in Statesboro .
Kollars says PROVECTOR'S drug — which is still being developed — will function similar to doxycycline , an antibiotic that slows or kills parasites in the blood that cause malaria and is taken to prevent the disease before traveling to ( and while in ) areas where malaria has been reported .
The impetus for Kollars 's work began about a decade ago when he was working as a disease outbreak investigator in Thailand .
" We were testing antimalarial drugs for the army and their effects on mosquitoes , " he says .
There are antimalarial drugs available to prevent people from contracting the disease and treatments for those who actually get it , but few people in the most vulnerable regions — such as parts of Africa and Asia — can afford the tab .
" We needed to find a treatment that was in the $ 5 - to - $ 10 range , " he says , adding that the goal is to offer the PROVECTOR for less than $ 5 a flower .
The PROVECTOR will be designed to last about a year before its artificial petals need to be replaced .
The product 's lifespan will depend upon the mosquito population in a particular area and the amount of chemicals that they ingest .
Another dangerous mosquito - borne disease that Kollars hopes to stop is dengue fever , a disease in tropical areas that can cause headache , rash , achy joints and , in some cases — mostly in very young children — can be fatal if the victim goes into shock .
" Our goal is also to develop the technology , " Kollars says , " and then transfer that knowledge to help developing countries so they can produce them . "

Holding says it will cost about $ 3.7 million to conduct the next round of product development and testing , which will include trying out PROVECTOR on mosquitoes in rural Georgia come spring and in the Florida Everglades next summer .
" We hope to have received some funding by next fall for overseas trials , " Kollars adds .
He says his team is testing four different prototypes of PROVECTOR to come up with the most effective mix of color and chemicals — not to mention , disposable petals that are biodegradable .
" PROVECTOR alone is n't the answer , " Kollars acknowledges , " but it will interdict at a different stage than other treatments for malaria and other diseases .
I 've seen kids dying of malaria ; it behooves those of us who can do something to do something . "
The simmering controversy over anti-game crusader Jack Thompson 's controversial $ 10,000 donation offer took an ugly turn this morning .
The Miami attorney has tried to enlist the efforts of the Seattle Police Department in a dust - up with gamer website Penny Arcade .
In a letter faxed to Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske ( left ) , Thompson says , in part , " A Seattle business by the name of Penny Arcade ... employs certain personnel who have decided to commence and orchestrate criminal harassment of me by various means ...
This company has done this because I dared to go on CBS 's 60 Minutes in March and again in July to explain a wrongful death lawsuit I have brought on behalf of two police officers and a police dispatcher in Fayette , Alabama , who were shot in the head and killed by Devin Moore who obsessively trained on Grand Theft Auto : Vice City to kill them . "
" As you may know , this incredibly violent Rockstar Games product is actually a ' cop - killing ' murder simulator .
There are a bunch of computer geeks out there who think that the video game industry has a constitutional right to paint a bullseye on your back and on your officers ' backs ...
That is what this criminal harassment of me by Penny Arcade is all about .
They 're even selling an ' I Hate Jack Thompson ' t- shirt , but that is just the tip of the iceberg .
These idiots have been so careless as to post on their www.pennyarcade.com web site what they are doing regarding the harassment of me . "
" I look forward to working with your fine Police Department to shut this little extortion factory down and / or arrest some of its employees . "
This latest controversy is part and parcel to a complicated dispute over Thompson 's bizarre offer to donate $ 10 K to charity provided that a developer create and distribute a violent game of Thompson 's specification in which the victims were industry executives and their families .
GP is seeking comment from the folks at Penny Arcade , but given the East Coast - West Coast time differential , it 's likely they have n't even rolled into Starbucks yet .
We 'll add anything we hear from them .
We 'll also add any comment we are able to get from SPD , although Thompson 's complaint would n't seem likely to be high on their priority list .
And anyway , their investigation will surely be hindered by the fact that Thompson 's letter provides the wrong URL for Penny Arcade .
By the way , the Penny Arcade case is not the first time the volatile attorney has tried to sic the gendarmes on a game site .
Can you say " chilling effect ? "

basil seggos leans against the rail of the 36 - foot harbor patrol boat as it chugs along Newtown Creek into an industrial wasteland of sewer pipes and flotsam , past a huge conveyor belt carrying skeletal cars to the scrap heap and a natural gas facility belching plumes of orange flame .
A gentle headwind conveys the odors one at a time : salt , sewage , sulfur , and then the powerful stench of petroleum .
“ You can really smell it before you can see it , ” Seggos , the chief investigator for the environmental watchdog Riverkeeper , says , pointing to a black metal bulkhead along the south bank .
The boat draws closer , and a purple sheen appears on the surface .
“ That ’s all oil , ” he says .
It ’s the bleeding edge of an environmental disaster , one of the largest oil spills in the world .
The discharge floating on this inland waterway , which divides the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens , is just a hint at what lies beneath — anywhere between 17 million and 30 million gallons ’ worth , a spill more than 50 percent larger than the Exxon Valdez .
But unlike the Exxon Valdez , this one has been allowed to grow and fester for half a century , directly below a residential area .
Even in the neighborhood — an old - time blue - collar community pocked with hipster enclaves — many people do n’t know why the air smells like gasoline on rainy days .
“ This is a working - class community with a dirty creek in a part of Brooklyn no one really cares about , ” Seggos says .
“ It would have perhaps been a better thing if these were river otters covered with oil .
You ’d have had immediate action . ”
No one ’s really sure how long the oil has been there , but most people point to a massive explosion that ripped through the city ’s sewer system in 1950 , raining manhole covers down on the populace .
City officials blamed gasoline leaking from what was then Mobil ’s Brooklyn refinery .
Mobil denied it .
That was pretty much the extent of the investigation , and for a couple of decades the oil quietly continued to drip into the soil and groundwater under the refinery , spreading beneath the neighborhood and oozing — a tenth of an inch every hour — toward the bank of Newtown Creek .
In 1978 , a Coast Guard helicopter spotted an oil slick on the creek .
Investigating further , the Guard discovered the 55 - acre monster that had by then massed beneath the city .
Chemical analysis fingered Mobil as the source , and again the company said it was n’t at fault .
By now , Mobil had sold part of the refinery to Amoco and was using the rest for storage tanks .
A few blocks away , a Texaco subsidiary also had a storage facility .
The companies ( now known as ExxonMobil , BP , and Chevron , respectively ) pointed fingers at each other ; government agencies , sensing that this was not a rumble they wanted to be involved in , did the same .
The Coast Guard , having spent half a million dollars investigating the spill , decided it had done enough ; the case was turned over to the state of New York , which wanted no part of it either .
Believing that the spill , while regrettable , posed no immediate hazard ( no one drank the groundwater anymore , and the manhole - launching explosions had long ago subsided ) , officials decided not to apply their recently established oil spill fund to what was by far the state ’s largest oil spill , on the grounds that the spill predated the fund .
So the buck was handed down to New York City — which , still reeling from its financial near - meltdown in the 1970s , chose not to do battle with a brace of oil company lawyers .
For a decade , nothing happened .
And the oil lake quietly grew .
“ you become something of a stink connoisseur when you live in Greenpoint , ” says Teresa Toro , who lives two blocks from Newtown Creek .
The neighborhood features rows of meticulously kept houses , manicured parks , and cafés catering to an influx of ex-Manhattanites , but it also remains the location of choice for projects that would never be placed along Fifth Avenue : sewage treatment , waste transfer , natural gas storage .
For Toro , the oil fumes are the worst .
“ When the wind is just right , I can smell it blowing off the creek .
Sometimes we can’t open our windows .
“ The [ sewage treatment ] plant people get very defensive when you call up and complain about the smell , ” Toro laughs .
“ They say , ‘ That ’s not us !
It ’s the spill ! ' ”
But then she turns serious .
“ Every time I go to the creek , I just get so angry , ” she says .
“ I feel like I ’m watching a crime in progress . ”
Local lore holds that it was the Valdez crash that finally shamed the state into action in 1990 .
“ Not at all , ” says Joseph Lentol , the neighborhood ’s state assemblyman since 1972 .
The truth , he says , is worse :
In 1988 , Mobil had another leak — 35,000 gallons — and felt the need to notify the city that , by the way , there happened to be 17 million gallons more underneath .
The state ’s Department of Environmental Conservation began negotiating a consent order forcing Mobil to clean up its mess .
The deal , in the end , required no monetary damages , set no firm benchmarks for progress , and demanded removal of the oil floating on top of the groundwater but not of the contaminated soil .
It also gave Mobil a powerful tool for staving off litigation — the company was , after all , complying with a government - mandated cleanup .
“ A consent decree is nothing more than another word for a plea bargain , ” says Lentol .
“ It was a slap on the wrist . ”
As time wore on , the people of Greenpoint would come to revile the environment department as much as , if not more than , the oil company itself .
At least they were n’t paying Mobil executives ’ salaries .
A spokeswoman for the department , Maureen Wren , says the consent decree should be viewed in light of “ the information available at that time ” and that the state has always been committed to holding the company responsible .
But by the time another decade had gone by , ExxonMobil and the other oil companies had removed less than 8 million gallons .
There was no reason for them to pick up the pace .
Until Riverkeeper showed up .
“ We found out about it by stumbling across it , literally , ” Seggos says , recalling how he noticed the sheen on the water one day in 2002 , while floating along Newtown Creek to educate immigrants about the dangers of fishing there .
He assigned an intern to look into it and was soon presented with a fantastic - sounding story about a 17 - million - gallon - plus underground lake of oil .
“ I said , ‘ You idiot !
What the hell are you talking about ?
Go back and do more research ! ' ”
After almost another year of investigation , Seggos approached the state to see if Riverkeeper — a small , 41 - year - old environmental group whose top attorney is Robert Kennedy Jr.— could help apply pressure on ExxonMobil .
“ They totally blew us off , ” he says .
In 2004 , Riverkeeper notified the environment department that it planned to sue ExxonMobil , BP , and Chevron on behalf of a half - dozen local residents ( including Teresa Toro ) .
The suit sought no damages , only a proper cleanup .
But behind the scenes , Seggos had begun laying the groundwork for a major toxic tort suit , facilitating a series of sometimes - awkward meetings between out - of - town trial lawyers and reticent locals .
“ It ’s a very difficult community to penetrate , ” he says .
That got a lot easier in the summer of 2005 , when results of vapor tests Seggos had commissioned came back showing dangerous levels of explosive methane gas and benzene , a carcinogen .
The neighborhood erupted as if the oil itself had been set ablaze .
People who had long believed the spill to be merely a foul - smelling nuisance now began tallying the community ’s sick and its dead .
“ It ’s up to 35 or 36 people that I know that have had cancer just on this block , ” says Tom Stagg , a retired detective who ’s lived near the spill his whole life .
Sitting at his kitchen table , he rattles off the list : his mother , father , stepfather , his neighbor ’s wife , a friend of his daughter ’s , his pal Joey , a nine - year - old kid a couple streets over .
“ It ’s too many , ” he says .
“ Too many people . ”
Jane Pedota lives directly above the spill .
A couple of her neighbors , she says , have exactly the same pancreatic problems ; another neighbor has died of a brain tumor , and his wife died of myelofibrosis , a cancer linked to benzene .
“ I ’m telling you , you ’re seeing odd things , ” Pedota says .
“ Too coincidental for me . ”
By the end of the year , the lawyers Seggos had brought in , Girardi & Keese — of Erin Brockovich fame — filed suit against the oil companies .
Stagg and Pedota signed on .
Brockovich herself showed up to rally the residents .
By the time the environment department convened a public meeting last year , the neighborhood had built up a full head of steam .
Hundreds packed the Princess Manor banquet hall to hear presentations by ExxonMobil , BP , and Chevron , hectoring company representatives with catcalls of “ liar ! ” and “ shame on you people ! ”
A health department spokesman tried to reassure the crowd , saying the state was unaware of any health threat but acknowledging that no studies had been done and none were planned .
When state officials announced the cleanup would last another 20 years or more , the room fell silent .
That April , Riverkeeper obtained internal ExxonMobil documents showing that the company had known of high levels of benzene and other chemicals a decade earlier , when the substances were detected in a commercial property just 1,000 feet from the Pedota household .
( ExxonMobil spokesman Brian Dunphy told Mother Jones that the tests , which were not conducted by the company , are n’t proof of a health threat . )
The pressure continued to build until June 2006 , when the talks between the environment department and ExxonMobil imploded ( neither side will say why ) , whereupon the state finally referred the case to then - Attorney General Eliot Spitzer .
Days later , Congress approved funding for a full epa study of the spill , the federal government ’s first involvement in the case since the Coast Guard sailed away in 1979 .
In February , Spitzer ’s successor , Andrew Cuomo , announced that his office intended to sue ExxonMobil ( he filed the suit in July ) to force a speedy cleanup .
But the threat of litigation seemed to have the opposite effect .
ExxonMobil shut down its groundwater pumps , which had been sucking up oil at a rate of 1,110 gallons per day , slowing the cleanup to a near halt .
At the direction of the environment department , the company restarted the pumps this summer ; the various lawsuits facing ExxonMobil remain ongoing .
“ I told my kids , ‘ This wo n’t be settled until I ’m dead and gone , ' ” says Pedota — who , like everyone else on her block , flies the Stars and Stripes in front of her house all year long .
“ But it would be nice to see that you could raise your children here . ”
As she spoke , the oil beneath her home continued to creep , a tenth of an inch per hour , toward the creek .
As Jobs proudly reported this Tuesday , the Mac is doing well .
Quibbling over exact numbers aside , the iPhone launch was also a success .
Despite stagnating for a bit , design - wise , the iPod continues to be a mass - market monster .
Yep , Apple looks like quite the industry giant these days .
But there 's one segment that these products essentially ignore : the so - called " enterprise " market .
Sure , Apple makes periodic overtures in to big business .
It even redirects apple.com / enterprise to someplace sensible .
But nearly every Apple product or service ostensibly aimed at enterprise customers can also be seen as a natural part of some other , " non-enterprise " market where Apple is strong ( e.g. , creative professionals ) .
If you need further reinforcement of this point , just ask your local IT guy at work how much Apple is on his radar for future purchases .
He 'll likely know a lot about Apple , and may even be a Mac user himself , but his next purchase order for 200 desktop computers will probably be from Dell .
You can rattle off a list of things that Apple does not do that makes its products and services a poor fit for corporate IT , and this list has not changed for years .
To the extent that Apple products have actually infiltrated big businesses , it 's been through small groups of enthusiasts — the canonical example being the art department that somehow manages to get themselves Macs , despite a company - wide standardization on Windows .
We 're seeing some of the same phenomenon today with the iPhone : employees purchasing iPhones because they 're cool , despite corporate IT 's prohibition against them .
Some see this as the seeds of an uprising .
Here 's Gruber 's take :
Self - important IT experts will continue to insist that the iPhone " must " or " needs to " support " business software systems " , but in the meantime , their employees will be buying iPhones on their own . [...]
Like many successful revolutions , this one might come from the bottom .
This " revolution " certainly did n't take place with the Mac , but Apple today is quite different than the Apple of the 1990s .
Maybe things will work out differently this time .
But to me , the more interesting question is why Apple has chosen to ( mostly ) ignore the enterprise market for so long .
Consider the sticker guy from Tuesday 's Apple event .
( Macworld has the audio . )
Okay , hold that thought .
Now think about what defines the enterprise market , and what makes it different from the home market .
Sure , home users are more willing to pay extra for fashion and reputation , and even the wallets of creative professionals fall open a bit wider in service of style .
But the biggest difference is more fundamental .
In the enterprise market , you must sell to the business as an entity , usually through an IT department whose job it is to manage technology products and services that are actually used by everyone else in the company .
In the home market , you sell to the end user .
Small businesses are similar ; the people making the purchasing decisions and managing the products are more likely to be the same people using them .
The further removed these two groups become — the users and the purchasers — the more " enterprise - y " the market , and the less Apple is interested in serving it .
Unfailingly , Apple markets only to the end user these days .
Even with its few enterprise products , Apple sells to the primary " users " of the hardware : the IT guys that set up and manage the Xserves and RAID arrays .
What Apple does not do is sell products to corporate IT that are meant for direct use by non-IT employees .
That is , desktop PCs , and more recently , cellular phones .
This gets back around to one of my favorite dumb questions from the iPhone launch : " Why has n't anyone made a phone like this before ? "
The answer is that every other phone manufacturer is tied up in the enterprise market in one way or another .
The " dream phone " for the enterprise looks quite different than the iPhone .
It works with the corporate VPN .
It does Exchange .
It supports device - wide encryption and remote deletion of data on lost devices .
It 's available in several compatible forms from multiple manufacturers .
It has a well - defined public roadmap for hardware and software .
It can be backed up and restored en masse , preferably over the network .
If it has a camera , it can be disabled .
The battery can be removed and replaced .
And on and on .
Maybe around item two hundred in this list there might be a bit about the people who will actually use these enterprise dream phones tolerating the things .
Really , as long as they do n't openly revolt , it 's fine .
The people you have to please in the enterprise market are the ones purchasing and supporting the products , not the poor schmucks who actually have to use them .
Still holding that thought about the Intel stickers ?
Listen again to Steve 's final words on the subject .
" We put ourselves in the customer 's shoes and say , what do we want ? "
This is why Apple does not compete in the enterprise market in the traditional sense .
This is why no other company created the iPhone .
This is why most desktop PCs are pieces of crap .
When you do n't focus on the user , the user gets shafted .
Want more ?
Here 's Jobs 's response to a question about Apple 's neglect of the low - end of the market ( e.g. , $ 500 PCs , $ 100 phones , etc. ) :
There 's some stuff in our industry that we would n't be proud to ship .
And we just can't do it .
We can't ship junk .
There are thresholds we can't cross because of who we are .
This can all sound pretty smug .
For a more grounded interpretation , you can try to look at it from a business perspective — profit margins , avoiding commoditization , the potential for growth and so on — but there 's no getting around the results .
And no matter how you slice it , the decision to ignore markets where you must sell to someone other than the end user is pretty high - minded ( for a corporation ) .
It 's also perhaps the only way to ever create great products , products that customers actually love .
Think about this the next time you 're peeling stickers off your new laptop at work .
Asus is preparing to launch its new Linux - based Eee PC laptop later this month and plans to release another new model in April 2008 .
The Eee PC , which has a 7 " display and a 900MHz Celeron M processor , is designed for budget - minded mobile consumers .
The second - generation Eee PC will use Intel 's Merom processor and offer longer battery life .
According to DigiTimes , Asus wants to become one of the top five laptop producers within the next three years .
The company currently plans to ship over 200,000 Eee PCs by the end of the year and expects to sell between three and five million by 2009 .
The Eee PC is included in Intel 's " world ahead " initiative , and the chipmaker worked closely with Asus during the design phase of the product .
Eee PC pricing is competitive with other budget mobile computers designed for the education market , including the OLPC Project 's XO laptop , and Intel 's Classmate PC .
Eee PC models are expected to sell for between $ 199 and $ 349 .
Asus claims that the Eee PC boots in under 15 seconds .
The device will be shipped with a heavily customized Xandros Linux distribution that uses a tab - based interface instead of a conventional desktop environment .
Software bundled with the system includes OpenOffice.org , Firefox , and Skype .
Although Asus will not be shipping Windows XP with the Eee PC , the company claims that Microsoft 's operating system has been tested extensively with the device .
Although the Eee PC has a lot to like , the exact specifications and launch price are n't known yet .
There are rumors that the final model will not include the 0.3MP video camera currently listed in the specifications and that the price of the low - end model has crept up from $ 199 to $ 249 .
We 'll know for sure when it officially launches .
The strong support for Linux could make the Eee PC a compelling choice for some open - source software enthusiasts , and the low price makes it a strong contender in the education market .
At $ 199 , the Eee PC could compete directly with the OLPC in certain regions .

A Muslim extremist who took part in a campaign to recruit and train " jihadists " has been jailed for six years today after becoming a recruiting sergeant for Muslim extremists .
Pakistani - born Abdul Rahman , 25 , arrived in the UK on a student visa , but spent just one day at university before dropping out .
He is the first person in Britain to be convicted of a charge of disseminating terrorist information after he was arrested with a " call to arms " letter from a Muslim fighter .
Scroll down for more ...
On arriving in the UK , Rahman joined up with a gang of radical young Muslims who aimed to scout , recruit and encourage others to take up arms in a holy war .
Disturbing video footage showed the group taking part in an arduous ' Al Qaeda training camp ' in the Lake District in preparation for the jihad .
He admitted handing the suspect , who was subject to a Government control order , around £ 500 to help him buy plane tickets to flee the UK .
The court heard that after the suspect got away , police raided Rahman 's house , where they found video footage of him taking part in the Lake District training camp .
The film referred to one as a suicide bomber whilst two others were seen crawling , commando - style , through the snow and undergrowth near Langdale , Cumbria , praising Allah and the Chechen Mujahideen .
In Rahman 's house , police found hunting knives , two - way radios , GPS equipment and propaganda - including a document referring to terrorist finishing schools called How Can I Train Myself for Jihad ?
Yesterday Rahman admitted two offences under the 2006 Terrorism Act and pleaded guilty to a further charge of helping a terror suspect defy a control order .
The case illustrated the weaknesses of control orders , said one senior police source outside court .
He added : ' There is real concern these orders are not worth the paper they are written on and do nothing in real terms to protect the public .
" Despite these orders , suspected terrorists are able to move around the UK and even leave the country to go and fight jihad elsewhere . "

Manchester Crown Court heard that Rahman started a pharmacology degree in 2000 at a university in Pakistan close to the Afghanistan border , but dropped out after a year .
He moved to the UK in 2004 on a student visa and registered to begin a biotechnology degree at Abertay University in Dundee .
After his first day , he left for Manchester telling tutors he had financial difficulties .
Parmjit Cheema , prosecuting , said Rahman took a job in a mobile phone shop and mixed with radical Muslims , sharing a house with some of them .
She said : " Their particular interest , it would appear , was the perceived assault on Islam in Afghanistan and the need as they saw it to provide resources and fighters for that conflict . "
She said Rahman played a vital role supporting jihadists in Pakistan and acting as a " pipeline " to the UK .
In January this year he met up with a 22 - year - old man , known only as AK for legal reasons , who had just been served with a control order .
Rahman gave him £ 480 to flee the country .
Before taking a flight to Lahore via Tehran , CCTV filmed AK at Birmingham Airport after he had ditched his usual traditional Muslim attire for Westernised clothing .
Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Porter , of Greater Manchester Police Counter - Terrorism Unit , said : " This man provided support to people determined to carry out terrorist acts .
" He was clearly intent on drawing others into his network . "
Rahman will be sentenced today .
Lisp is a deep language with many unusual and powerful features .
The goal of this tutorial is not to teach you many of those powerful features : rather it's to teach you just enough of Lisp that you can get up and coding quickly if you have a previous background in a procedural language such as C or Java .
Notably this tutorial does not teach macros , CLOS , the condition system , much about packages and symbols , or very much I /O .
If the cell is divided by a line , as is shown at right , then this indicates two different examples .
Just like in a debugger , at any break or error condition , you have a bunch of options ( like examining the stack , changing what the return value should be , etc . )
You can even continue the infinite loop we just broke out of .
But you probably just want to escape .
The easiest option is to escape out of all of your error conditions , right back up to the top .
These conditions can be stacked : if you keep working while in a condition , and then get in another condition and so on , you 're piling up conditions on a stack .
After you press Control - C , the command line changes to a " subsidiary " command line to reflect that you are in a break or error condition .
Kinda like pressing Control - C in a debugger .
On zeus , you start lisp by typing clisp at the command line .
This fires up an implementation of lisp called CLISP .
On osf1 or mason2 , you start lisp by typing lisp at the command line .
This fires up an implementation of lisp called LispWorks .
From now on , we will only use examples in clisp .
But it works basicallly the same on all Lisp systems .
Every other expression but nil is considered to be " true " .
However , Lisp also provides an " official " constant which represents " true " , for your convenience .
This is t ( also case - insensitive ) .
t also evaluates to itself .
In Lisp , the special constant nil ( case insensitive ) all by itself represents " false " .
nil evaluates to itself .
Unlike C++ , you do not normally add returns and tabs to strings using an escape sequence .
Instead , you just type the tab or the return right in the string itself .
Like C++ and Java , Lisp strings have an escape sequence to put special characters in the string .
The escape sequence begins with the backslash \ .
To put a double - quote in the middle of a string , the sequence is \ "
To put a backslash in the middle of a string , the sequence is \\ Lisp tries to return values in a format that could be typed right back in again .
Thus , it will also print return values with the escape sequences shown .
A Lisp string is a sequence of characters .
Lisp strings begin and end with double - quotes .
Unlike in C++ ( but like Java ) a Lisp string does not terminate with a \0 .
Strings are expressions .
Just like a numbers and characters , the value of a string is itself .
A fraction is straightforwardly represented with the form x/y Note that here the / does not mean " divide " .
Numbers are expressions .
The value of a number is itself .
Lisp can represent a great many kind of numbers : integers , floating - point expressions , fractions , giant numbers , complex numbers , etc .
One nice use of print is to stick it in the middle of an expression , where it will print elements without effecting the final return value of the whole expression .
As can be seen at right , if you just use print all by itself , the screen will appear to print the element twice .
Why is that ?
It 's because print printed its argument , then returned it , and Lisp always prints [ again ] the final return value of the expression .
Now you see how easy it is to get lost in the parentheses !
When a list contains another list among its expressions , the evaluation procedure is recursive .
The example at left thus does the following things :
Lisp has a special name for functions which return " true " ( usually t ) or " false " ( nil ) .
These functions are called predicates .
Traditionally , many Lisp predicate names end with a p .
Here are some predicates .
If two numbers i and j are provided , then subseq returns the substring starting a position i in the string and ending at position j .
For example , subseq takes a string followed by one or two numbers .
If only one number i is provided , then subseq returns the substring starting a position i in the string and ending at the end of the string .
In C++ and in Java , there are operators like + , << , && , etc .
But in Lisp , there are no operators : instead , there are only functions .
For example , + is a function .
Guess what function is associated with each of these symbols .
The values of these expressions are then passed in as parameters to the function , and the function is called .
The list 's return value is then the value returned by the function .
Then each expression in the list ( except the beginning symbol ) is evaluated exactly once , usually ( but not necessarily ) left - to - right .
When Lisp evaluates a list , it first examines ( but does not evaluate ) the symbol at the beginning of the list .
Usually this symbol is associated with a function .
Lisp looks up this function .
An atom is every expression that is not a list .
Among other things , strings and numbers and boolean values are atoms .
We 'll discuss the format of symbols further down .
In the examples at right , + and * are symbols , and denote the addition and multiplication functions respectively .
You do n't need to declare the dotimes variable in an enclosing let -- dotimes declares the variable locally for you .
The dotimes variable is local only to the dotimes scope -- when dotimes exits , the variable 's value resumes its previous setting ( or none at all ) .
Here , dotimes first evaluates the expression high - val , which should return a positive integer .
Then it sets the variable var ( which is a symbol , and is not evaluated ) to 0 .
Then it evaluates the zero or more expressions one by one .
Then it increments var by 1 and reevaluates the expressions one by one .
It does this until var reaches high - val .
At this time , optional - return - val is evaluated and returned , or nil is returned if optional - return - val is missing .
You can use setf to change the value of a local variable inside a let statement .
You can also nest let statements within other let statements .
Locally declared variables may shadow outer local and global variables with the same name , just as is the case in C++ and in Java .
let declares local variables with each declaration .
Then it evaluates the expressions in order ( as a block ) .
These expressions are evaluated in the context of these local variables ( the expressions can see them ) .
let then gets rid of the local variables and returns the value of the last expression .
Thus the local variables are only declared within the scope of the let expression .
Be careful with setf .
Lisp does n't need to declare variables before they are used .
Therefore , unless variables are declared to be local ( discussed later ) , setf will make global variables .
And setf is the first operation we 've seen with side effects -- so the order of operations will matter !
See the example at right .
If a symbol is evaluated before anything has been stored in its variable , it will generate an error .
setf is a macro and not a function because it does not evaluate variable - symbol .
Instead , it just evaluates expression , and stores its value in the variable associated with variable - symbol .
Then it returns the value of expression .
Variables are set with the macro setf .
For now , as far as you 're concerned , this macro looks like this : ( setf variable - symbol expression )
The value of a symbol 's variable has nothing to do with the function , special form , or macro associated with the symbol .
You can thus have variables called print , if , etc .
progn can take any number of expressions , and evaluates each of its expressions in order .
progn then returns the value of the last expression .
Why can't if be a function ?
Because it may not necessarily evaluate the then - expression , or if it does , it will not evaluate the optional - else - expression .
Thus it violates the function rule .
Because if is an expression , unlike most languages it 's quite common to see it embedded inside other expressions ( like the last expression at right ) .
This is roughly equivalent to C's i ? j : k expression form .
if evaluates test - expression .
If this returns true , then if evaluates and returns then - expression , else it evaluates and returns optional - else - expression ( or if optional - else - expression is missing , returns nil ) .
Macros and special forms are mostly used as control structures .
For example , the control structure if is a special form .
if takes the form : ( if test - expression then - expression optional - else - expression )
Though it 's possible to have both keyword parameters and optional parameters in the same function , do n't do it .
Gets confusing .
You pass a keyword parameter whose name is foo into a function by using the term : foo followed by the value to set foo to .
Keyword parameters can be passed in in any order , but must appear at the end of the parameter list .
Keyword parameters may appear only at the end of the parameter list .
Keyword parameters appear at the end of a parameter list , after the term &key .
Similarly to optional arguments , each keyword parameter is either a parameter name ( whose value defaults to nil if not passed in when the function is called ) or is a list of the form ( param - name default - value )
Lisp can also have keyword parameters .
These are parameters which can appear or not appear , or be in any order , because they 're given names .
Keyword parameters are very much like the < foo arg1=val arg2=val ... > arguments in the " foo " html tag .
Alternatively you can provide the default value to set the parameter to when it's not provided when the function is called .
You can do this by following &optional not by a parameter name but by a list of the form ( param - name default - value )
If the optional parameter is n't provided when the function is called , then the parameter is set to nil .
You can make functions with an optional argument using the special term &optional , followed by the optional parameter name , at the end of your parameter list .
You 'll find that functional style and recursion together result in a need for very few local variables .
Like Java , Lisp is pass - by - value .
The parameters of a function are considered to be local variables to that function , and can be set with setf .
This does not change the values of things passed in .
Actually , it is surprisingly rare in Lisp to have more than one expression in a function .
Instead , expressions tend to get nested together .
Lisp functions tend to take on functional form rather than declarative form .
In C++ or Java , usually you set local variables a lot .
In Lisp you do n't -- you nest functions .
Lisp functions can have local variables , control structures , whatnot .
Try to use local variables rather than global variables !
Declare local variables with let .
Here are some examples with several expressions in the function Remember , the function returns the value of the last expression .
Here are some examples with one , two , and three arguments but just one expression .
At right is a really simple example : a function of no arguments which simply returns the string " Hello , World ! " .
defun builds a function of zero or more arguments of the local - variable names given by the parameter symbols , then evaluates the expressions one by one , then returns the value of the last expression .
The name of the function is the function - name - symbol .
defun defines the function , sets it to this symbol , then returns the symbol -- you rarely use the return value of defun .
There are a great many sequence functions .
All sequence functions work on any kind of sequence ( including strings and lists ) .
Here are two sequence functions we 've seen so far .
dolist evaluates the list - to - iterate - over , then one by one sets var to each element in the list , and evaluates the expressions .
dolist then returns the optional return value , else nil if none is provided .
Lists have a common control structure , dolist , which iterates over a list .
The format of dolist is very similar to dotimes : ( dolist ( var list - to - iterate - over optional - return - val ) expr1 expr2 ... )
In data form , the first item of a list can be anything -- it 's not restricted to be just a symbol .
quote is so common that there is a special abbreviation for it ... a single quote at the beginning of the item :
cons takes an item and a list , and returns a new list consisting of the old list with the item tacked on the front .
rest returns a list consisting of everything but the first item .
It does not damage the original list .
The old name of rest is cdr .
first returns the first item in a list .
The old name of first is car .
What is a list when used in data form ?
A list is a singly - linked list .
It is a data type like any other .
You can set variables to it .
There are a great many functions which operate on lists as well .
What is a symbol when used in data form ?
It 's just itself .
The symbol foo is just a thing that looks like foo ( case insensitive of course ) .
It is a data type like any other .
You can set variables to it .
The special form quote can be used to bypass the evaluation of its argument .
quote takes a single argument , and instead of evaluating that argument , it simply returns the argument as you had typed it ... as data !
Lists are normally evaluated as function or macro calls .
Symbols are normally evaluated as variable references .
But they do n't have to be .
Lists and symbols are data as well !
In our file we had declared a global variable ( foo ) .
Look at the warnings when we compile !
When the compiler compiles the file , one common thing it will complain of is special variables .
For all intents and purposes , a special variable is a global variable .
With very few exceptions , you should never use global variables when you can use local variables instead .
You can omit the extension ( " .lisp " , " .afasl " , etc. ) from the filename , but what happens as a result is implementation - dependent .
Some systems load the most recent version ( either the source or the .afasl file ) ; others may load the .afasl file always but warn you if there 's a more recent .lisp file , etc .
In general , to be safe , always load the full name of the file including the extension .
When a file is compiled , the object file created has a .fas or .fsl or . fasl or .afasl extension .
Depends on the Lisp compiler .
By default , load is fairly silent -- it does n't print out all the return values to the screen like you 'd get if you typed the code in at the command line .
If you 'd like to see these return values printed out , you can add the : print t keyword parameter .
load works exactly as if you had typed in the code directly at the command line .
You do n't have to type all your code in on the command line .
Instead , put it in a file named " myfile.lisp " ( or whatever , so long as it ends in " .lisp " ) .
Then load it with the load command .
You can time the speed of any expression , and its garbage collection , with the time function .
You can compile a function by passing its symbol name ( quoted ! ) to the compile function .
If you type in code at the command line , it is ( on most Lisp systems ) interpreted .
As you can see , Lisp can get quite confusing because of the parentheses .
How tedious it is reading code based on parentheses !
That 's why Lisp programmers do n't do it .
Lisp programmers do n't rely much on the parentheses when reading code .
Instead , they rely heavily on breaking expressions into multiple lines and indenting them in a very peculiar way .
There is a " cannonical " indent format and style for Lisp .
Code which adheres to the standard format can be read very rapidly by Lisp programmers who have developed a " batting eye " for this format .
Important formatting rules :
Put a single space between each item in a list .
Do NOT put space between the opening parenthesis and the first item in a list .
Similarly , do NOT put space between the closing parenthesis and the last item .
Never put parentheses all by themselves on lines like a C++/ Java brace .
Do not be afraid to pile up parentheses at the end of a line .
Do NOT use simplistic editors like pico or Windows Notepad .
You will regret it .
Deeply .
Use an editor designed for Lisp .
Integrated Lisp systems ( the big three are Franz Allegro Common Lisp , Xanalys Harlequin Common Lisp , and Macintosh Common Lisp ) with graphical interfaces have built - in editors which will automatically indent text for you in the official style , will colorize your text , will tell you whether your syntax is right or not , and will match parentheses for you .
Another good choice , indeed the classic option in Lisp systems , is the editor emacs .
It is written in its own version of Lisp , and is very good at editing Lisp code and working with Lisp systems , especially with an add - on Lisp - editing plug - in called slime .
emacs is the program whose auto - indent facilities established the " cannonical " style of Lisp formatting .
If you can't find an editor which can do the cannonical style , there are still plenty of choices which do a reasonable job .
Any professional - grade code editor will do in a pinch .
Without a good editor , writing large Lisp programs is painful .
GET A CODE EDITOR .
You are an adult now , and will soon be a professional .
Use real tools to get your job done .

Comments in Lisp are of three forms .
Winged comments ( the equivalent of /* and */ in C++ or Java ) begin with a # | and end with a |#
They are not commonly used in Lisp except to temporarily eliminate chunks of code , because it 's hard to tell they exist by examining your code .
Inline comments ( the equivalent of // in C++ or Java ) begin with a semicolon ; and end with a return .
Many Lisp structures have built - in documentation comments .
For example , if the first expression in a defun statement is a string , that string is not part of the code but instead is considered to be the " documentation " for the function .
You can access the documentation for an object with the documentation function .
It is common in Lisp to pile up several semicolons ;; or ; ; ; to make the comment more visible .
Here is a common approach : Use one semicolon for inline code .
Use two semicolons to comment the head of a function .
Use three semicolons to comment the head of a file or other big region .
Use winged comments only to comment - out a region temporarily .

Lisp has important style rules about symbols , used for both variables and function names .
Although Lisp symbols are case - insensitive , ALWAYS use lower - case .
There is a good reason for this .
Keep in mind that Lisp is an interactive system : both you and the system are producing text on the screen .
Lisp systems spit out symbols in UPPER - CASE .
By sticking with lower - case yourself , you can distinguish between the text you typed and the text the Lisp system generated .

Lisp is a functional language .
Learn to use functional style .
One way you can tell you 're using functional style is if you have very few ( or even no ) local variables , and rarely if ever use a global variable .

1 Alfred Nobel , a Swede who invented dynamite , so regretted his contribution to warfare that he decided to offer five prizes annually " to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind . "
The winners are announced this month .
2 Nobel may have been inspired by a premature obituary in a French newspaper that dubbed him a " merchant of death . "
3 King Oscar of Sweden tried to persuade Alfred 's nephew Emanuel to change the philanthropist 's will , saying , " It is your duty to your sisters and brothers . . . to see to it that their interests are not neglected in favor of some fantastic ideas of your uncle . "
4 Nobel nominees are never announced , and all records are sealed for 50 years .
5 Do n't even think about it : Self - nominations are automatically disqualified .
6 Only 11 women have won science Nobels out of the 508 awarded in the fields of physics , chemistry , and physiology or medicine .
One of the 11 — Marie Curie — won it twice , for physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911 .
Her daughter Irène Joliot - Curie earned the chemistry prize in 1935 .
7 Adding insult to injury : A bare - breasted woman adorns the reverse side of the physics and chemistry medals .
8 Aside from Curie , one other person has nabbed a Nobel in two separate categories : Linus Pauling , who won the 1954 chemistry award and the 1962 peace prize for his fight against nuclear weapons testing .
9 You can't win 'em all : Pauling missed out on a trifecta by erroneously proposing that DNA is a triple helix .
The Nobel for deducing the correct structure , a double helix , went to James Watson , Francis Crick , and Maurice Wilkins in 1962 .
10 One big blooper that did garner a Nobel ( Medicine , 1926 ) was the dubious " discovery " by Johannes Fibiger that rats could develop cancer by feasting on cockroaches infested with parasitic worms .
11 A 1949 prize in medicine went to António Egas Moniz for another debatable breakthrough , the lobotomy .
Moniz was shot and paralyzed by a disgruntled patient , and his operation fell into disrepute .
12 What were they thinking ?
Physicist Lise Meitner , who made the calculations that led to the discovery of nuclear fission , was reportedly nominated for the Nobel Prize 13 times but never won it .
13 Her collaborator , Otto Hahn , received the lone chemistry prize in 1944 for that work ; he stayed in Nazi Germany while Meitner , a Jewish woman , fled to Sweden in 1938 .
14 But Meitner received an accolade denied Hahn :
In 1992 , element 109 was named meitnerium in her honor by its discoverers , who deemed her " the most significant woman scientist of this century . "
15 Another notable who never received a Nobel was Gandhi .
He was being considered for the peace prize when he was assassinated .
16 A modern Renaissance man : Paul Greengard not only won the 2000 medicine Nobel for discoveries in nerve - cell communication but also came in first in a potato - sack race at a New York Boy Scout jamboree .
17 How far would you go for science ?
To prove his hypothesis that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes stomach ulcers — a theory for which he was initially ridiculed — physician Barry Marshall drank a culture filled with the spiral microbes .
18 Who 's laughing now ?
Marshall and his colleague Robin Warren later won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of " the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease . "
19 If you can't win a Nobel , try for an Ig Nobel , offered since 1991 by the Annals of Improbable Research for scientific work " that can not or should not be reproduced . "
20 Last year 's winners include Claire Rind and Peter Simmons of the University of Newcastle in England , who won the peace prize for monitoring the brain of a locust while it watched scenes from Star Wars .
GREENPORT , N.Y. —
It was still dark the morning of Sept. 27 when armed federal immigration agents , guided by local police officers , swept into this village on the East End of Long Island .
Within hours , as the team rousted sleeping families , 11 men were added to a running government tally of arrests made in Operation Community Shield , a two - year - old national program singling out violent gang members for deportation .
“ Violent foreign - born gang members and their associates have more than worn out their welcome , ” Julie L. Myers , assistant secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said at an October news conference announcing the arrests of 1,313 people in the operation over the summer and fall nationwide .
“ And to them I have one message : Good riddance . ”
But , to the dismay of many of Greenport ’s 2,500 residents , the raid here did not match her words .
Only one of the 11 men taken away that morning was suspected of a gang affiliation , according to the Southold Town police , who patrol Greenport and played the crucial role of identifying targets for the operation .
The 10 others , while accused of immigration violations , were not gang associates and had no criminal records .
Had the dubious task of running in the new engine before it goes on the rolling road .
This is normally a boring task but when the vehicle is geared for 6000 rpm at 70 mph and does less than 10 mpg it becomes a real pain .
Kept to country roads so I could at leat have a little bit of fun on the bends , however the car does not handle on part throttle you need to give it max attack before it will go around corners .
Did most of the mileage on a nice sunny day and gave it a bit more welly towards the end , nowt below 4500 then it really lifts off , have n’t took it over 6000 yet , thought I heard the sound of detonation coming out of one hairpin so I settled down until the carbs and ignition are set up .
Need to get it down to Bogg Brothers now .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The FBI has taped conversations between Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska and an oil company executive who has pleaded guilty to bribery , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation .
Sen .
Ted Stevens , who has represented Alaska since 1968 , walks past a photographer on Capitol Hill in July .
The calls were between Stevens , who is up for re-election in 2008 , and Bill Allen , then CEO of oilfield services firm VECO Corp. , the source said Thursday .
In May , Allen and another VECO executive pleaded guilty to paying more than $ 400,000 in bribes to Alaska public officials .
The source would provide no further details , and the FBI declined comment on the matter Thursday night .
The existence of the tapes was first reported by The Associated Press .
Federal agents searched Stevens ' home outside Anchorage in July in connection with a wide - ranging Alaska corruption probe , which also has snared a state lobbyist and led to bribery and conspiracy charges against three current and former state legislators .
Stevens ' office had no comment beyond a statement previously issued to reporters in which the GOP 's longest - serving senator urged constituents " not to form conclusions based upon incomplete and sometimes incorrect reports in the media . "
Stevens , 83 , was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee until Democrats won control of Congress last year .
He has represented Alaska in Washington since 1968 and is renowned for his prowess in steering federal funds to his vast , sparsely populated state .
In May , the Anchorage Daily News reported that federal agents were asking contractors who carried out an extensive renovation of Stevens ' home to turn over their records from the job .
One contractor told the newspaper that he was asked to appear before a grand jury in December .
FBI agents also raided the office of Stevens ' son , then - state Senate President Ben Stevens , in September 2006 .
The younger Stevens has not been charged in connection with the probe .

The evolution of our earliest human ancestors was driven by wild swings in eastern Africa 's ancient climate , scientists claim today .
The rapidly changing climate reshaped the landscape , leaving once plentiful food and water resources in scarce supply and placing enormous pressure on early humans to adapt .
The sustained upheaval drove some species to the brink of extinction , while other better - suited relatives emerged and flourished , the scientists believe .
Researchers identified several extreme shifts in climate dating back millions of years to when humans were first emerging on the continent .
Three of the greatest periods of climatic change took place around 2.5 m , 1.5 m and 1 m years ago .
These roughly coincide with the appearance of Homo habilis , the first human species ; Australopithecus afarensis , a sturdy primitive ape , and the later human species , Homo erectus , which became adept at stone tool use and hunting .
Researchers led by Mark Maslin , director of the Environment Institute at University College London , conducted geological surveys of ancient lakes throughout eastern Africa .
They found evidence that over the past 3 m years , giant lakes up to 300 metres deep formed and then vanished with the changing climate .
The disappearances of the lakes were followed by periods of extreme drought .
" At one extreme , the landscape would have been a true Garden of Eden , with beautiful freshwater lakes , beautiful shorelines and forests along the rivers .
There would have been open spaces allowing early humans to exist easily , with water and lots of resources , " said Maslin .
" But occasionally , these quickly flipped into bone dry periods , where it 's 45C in the middle of the day and no natural water resources . "
Early humans and other primate species , collectively known as hominids , were forced to adapt to the new environment .
Humans developed larger brains , evident in Homo habilis and Homo erectus , enabling them to fashion simple stone cutting tools and form effective hunting groups .
Other ancient primates , such as the squat Australopithecus afarensis , emerged with powerful jaws that allowed them to chew and get nutrition from tough roots and vegetables .
" If you look at the new species of hominid that evolved , 80 % of those , or 13 out of 15 , appeared during these pulsed climate periods .
It suggests new human species evolved when the climate was highly variable .
We do n't know if it 's the wet period , the dry period or the transition that triggers this , but we can say that when the climate is highly variable , you get a big change in species . "
The research , conducted with scientists at Adelphi University in New York , was published today in the Journal of Human Evolution .

The embryonic internet of connected computers on Arpanet .
Enlarge Image
Imagine a history of World War 2 that failed to cover the events in 1930s Germany .
Conventional histories of the internet are that incomplete , according to a researcher .
It is difficult to conceive of a world without the internet - today more than a billion users worldwide are connected - but just 25 years ago global network connections were vanishingly rare .
During the 1980s , small research networks linking a few hundred universities were gradually replaced by a commercial network with 300,000 users .
But history has failed to document this transitional period in any detail .
Dr Doug Gale , president of Information Technology Associates , in Montana , is devoting his spare time to filling in the gaps .
TIMELINE
Take a tour through the history of the net
In the early 1980s , Dr Gale worked as a network administrator at the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , a US government agency that promotes research and education .
He says that at the time , there was just one research network , called Arpanet .
It was run by the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency within the US Department of Defense .
Computer networking
But access to Arpanet was limited to universities with connections to the Department of Defense .
As the advantages of computer networking became apparent , other universities began developing their own networks .
Ultimately , the NSF launched NSFNET , the immediate forerunner of the modern internet , to link all the networks together .
But there are so few historical records from that time that Dr Gale describes the period as the internet 's Dark Age .
" The Arpanet period is somewhat well documented because the corporation in charge - BBN - left a physical record , " says Dr Gale .
" Moving into the NSFNET era , it became an extraordinarily decentralised process .
The record exists in people 's basements , in closets . "
Dr Gale has a simple explanation for the decentralised nature of the NSFNET era .
It was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved
Doug Gale on the development of NFSNET
" It was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved , " he says .
There were collaborations between universities , governments , corporations and individuals in the private sector , Dr Gale explains .
Although that led to rapid progress in the development of the internet , it has left a poor historical record .
" So much of what happened was done verbally and on the basis of individual trust , " says Dr Gale .
" If something needed to be done , there was never a formal contract ; it was just done on the basis of a telephone call . "
He says the more he explores the missing history , the more complicated the picture becomes .
" I thought I had some sense of what was going on .
But it 's a much richer history than I ever dreamed , " he says .
" A number of individuals were making important contributions in multiple areas . "
Standard language
One of the most important of those individuals was Dr Dennis Jennings , now director of Computing Services at University College Dublin .
In the early 1980s , Dr Jennings made the key decisions at the NSF that would shape the modern internet .
One of those decisions was to insist on a standard language , or set of protocols , to allow easy communication between networks .
Dr Jennings settled on the TCP / IP protocols , which had been developed by Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf at Arpanet in the 1970s .
Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn were given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005
" I became known as ' Mr TCP / IP ' because I was going around saying it has to be based around these protocols , " Dr Jennings says .
" The decision to go with TCP was radical , " he continues .
" It was a great decision technically , but implementation of the software was poor and the initial performance was dreadful .
But at the time we envisioned a few hundred users , not ten thousand . "
Gradually , the software improved and more networks switched to TCP / IP .
But having a number of isolated networks speaking the same language was n't enough .
There needed to be a central backbone to connect the networks together .
Moves began to form a network of networks , the first internet .
" That was the last piece of the jigsaw , " says Dr Jennings .
The impetus for an internet came from the academic research community and a feeling that resources needed to be more evenly distributed , according to Dr Jennings .
' Concern '
" There was concern that some US researchers were not getting enough access to supercomputers , " he says .
The NSF thought about a network to connect a handful of supercomputers , but Dr Jennings pressed for a more radical solution .
In September 1985 , he suggested creating a general purpose ' backbone ' to connect any network user with any other user .
The internet today encompasses the globe and one billion people
" The supercomputer centres thought it was an appalling idea , " he says .
" But then they caught on to the idea that if there was a backbone , everyone would be able to access their network . "
The thought of all that extra traffic and revenue was enough to persuade the supercomputer centres to support Dr Jennings ' calls for a general purpose network .
The NSF launched NSFNET in July 1986 .
That was a crucial turning point , says Dr Gale .
" There was an understanding that , although NFSNET was billed as a supercomputer network , that would soon become a less important component , " he says .
Central backbone
" And within months , if not weeks , supercomputers did become just a small part of NSFNET .
The rest was - well , you know the internet - everything else . "
In Europe too , there were calls for a central backbone to connect existing networks .
But the picture was more complex , says Dr Kees Neggers , managing director of Dutch research network SURFnet .
Public networks in Europe were running a set of protocols called X.25 rather than TCP / IP , he says .
Soon the networks could no longer handle the demand and consensus emerged among users to start a TCP / IP backbone in Europe .
In 1991 , Dr Neggers chaired a meeting in Amsterdam which helped establish a TCP / IP network called Ebone , which would become the European equivalent of NSFNET .
In both Europe and the US , TCP / IP was viewed as an interim communication solution , to be replaced with superior protocols in time , says Dr Neggers .
But by the mid 1990s , TCP / IP had become so ubiquitous that it was never replaced .
The internet had become commercial by this time , according to Dr Gale .
The turning point came in 1987 when the NSFNET backbone was upgraded to 1.544 Megabits per second ( Mbps ) .
Although slow by today 's standards - broadband connections of 24 M bps are now available to UK users - it was fast enough to encourage commercial organisations to take a more active role in running the emerging internet .
By 1990 , the Internet boasted 300,000 users and numbers have been growing ever since .
" It did n't hit home at a gut level the changes it would have for culture and society .
I saw it as a scientist ; I did n't see it as a human , " says Dr Gale .
Dr Gale has barely scratched the surface of internet history , but in the future he intends to extend the focus of his studies .
Once he has a good record of internet history in the USA , he will look at the history in Europe and elsewhere in the world .
He will also extend the record further into the past .
" When I started the history project the initial focus was that Dark Age in the 1980s and early ' 90s , " he says .
" But the archive is not going to focus on a particular era .
There 's more to human history than the Dark Ages . "
Like many European languages , German offers its users a choice of two singular forms of " you " -- the formal Sie or the informal du .
Yet unlike some of its European neighbors whose languages also have two forms of the second person forms of address , like Denmark or the Netherlands , Germany has not fallen into the habit of ignoring the formal in the name of keeping pace with the unceremonious nature of the modern age .
As with many things German , there are some hard - and - fast rules in place to govern when one should use which form of address .
Rules , which Susanne Hellbach - Grosser , a communication trainer , says are fairly straightforward .
“ In a private situation , it ’s age that counts , ” she said .
At a social event for example , it would be considered impertinent for a 30 - year - old to address somebody 20 years senior using du .
Rank before age at work
In a professional context , however , the adage of respecting one ’s elders does n’t necessarily stand .
“ At work , rank trumps age and gender , ” Hellbach - Grosser said , adding that if two people share a rank , they would be expected to address one another formally until the one who had served the company longest suggested otherwise .
Defining relationships
The fact that the use of formal address is still so widespread across Germany is testimony to a belief that it is a good way of showing respect and defining barriers and relationships .
And that , says Lis Droste , who teaches etiquette , can be particularly beneficial in the work place .
Formality equals customers at German banks
“ If bankers refer to one another as du , they start to feel more relaxed and their general level of language become sloppy , ” she said .
“ That does n't make a good impression on the customers . ”
But why , as long as the staff are doing their job and being friendly , should the customers care how bank staff address one another ?
Hellbach - Grosser says the buddy - buddy approach simply goes against the grain for many Germans .
“ We grow up saying ‘ Sie ’ , ” she said , " it 's what people feel comfortable with . "
Warmth in the formal approach
Fact is , a Sie relationship , be it private or personal , offers those in it the security of clear boundaries .
But that does n't mean they can't be just as fulfilling and warm as more informal friendships .
“ Take the example of my children ’s friends , ” Hellbach - Grosser said .
“ I ca n’t say du to them forever while they say Sie to me . ”
So , once they ’ve graduated from high school , she switches to formal address , but insists that nothing changes in the relationships besides the variety of " you " she uses .
Filmsets are notoriously informal places to be
But not everyone takes the same approach with the younger generation anymore , and many would agree that the lines between du and Sie are beginning to blur .
Trendier companies in fields such as film production , Internet and advertising often view the formal form of address as an anachronism which has no place in their offices .
Yet by the same token , informality does n’t always wash either .
Stefan Beyer , who works in the film business , says some people use du as a way to force an intimacy which does n’t exist .
“ It can be like hugging someone you do n’t want to hug , ” he said .
When Beyer finds himself in this situation , he simply rolls out a cut - throat Sie and the seduction game is over .
Could Germany live without Sie ?
For the likes of Beyer , the Sie form is an invaluable little gem which can speak volumes in just three letters , but for others it 's just a nuisance to have to weigh up when to use which ' you ' .
Hugging plays second fiddle to ' Sie '
The Internet is littered with du versus Sie forums and many of the young people who contribute to them would be happy to see the total abolition of formality in the German language .
But Droste does n't think it 's a change that the wider population will have to embrace any time in the near future .
" Polite address is so deeply engrained in our language , that I just can't imagine Sie ceasing to exist . "
For thousands of years , besieging armies sought to cut the water supplies to walled cities to break down their resistance .
No matter how brave , a warrior could not fight without water , and the women and children he defended could not live long without it .
The 21st - century - warfare version of depriving a city of water will be to deny entire states the ability to process , protect , and communicate information .
The astonishing thing about last spring 's alleged Russian cyberattack was n't the crippling effect it had on Estonian 's government and the lives of its citizens but the lack of serious reaction elsewhere .
The European Union raised but one scolding finger , NATO sent a few experts to the Baltic nation , and the US protested mildly and briefly — then President Bush welcomed Putin to the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport , Maine .
In fact , as the world witnessed the trial run of a new mode of warfare , pundits at The New York Times and other publications dismissed the digital assault on the tiny nation as much ado about nothing .
Those what - me - worry voices miss three critical points :
First , Estonia 's advanced state as an e-society makes it appear uniquely vulnerable , but a full - scale cyber attack on the US could be far more devastating .
Beyond the at - risk civilian sector , our armed forces rely on digitized information and communications to fuel their high tech hardware .
If petroleum was the indispensable asset that decided campaigns in World War II , today the key is a military 's ability to collect , compute , communicate , and shoot .
If the computers do n't work , the bombs do n't strike their targets .
Insiders acknowledge that the Department of Defense is worried about the vulnerability of its networks and weapons systems , and defensive security is being tightened .
At the same time , officials are developing offensive methods , though these black programs are classified .
Still , the Pentagon does n't seem to fully grasp the dangerous potential of this new domain of warfare .
If you follow defense - budget dollars , funding still goes overwhelmingly to cold war era legacy systems meant to defeat Soviet tank armies , not Russian e-brigades .
Second , in an all - out conflict , digital attacks would not occur in a vacuum .
A basic military law is that all weapons are most effective when used in incisive combinations with others .
In a major war , Beijing would also attempt to physically destroy the satellites our forces rely on to communicate , find the enemy , and guide precision weapons .
Whether attacking military targets or civilian systems , the Chinese would combine virtual destruction with actual destruction .
A decade ago , Chinese military theorists like the infamous colonels Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui were already hinting at the importance of simultaneously striking multiple infrastructure layers in a confrontation with the US .
In theory , the breakdown of one system would compound the effects on another , and the crippling of energy , government services , communications , the media , and health care and finance systems would interact in a downward spiral .
Finally , informational dependencies and e-attack methodologies are advancing exponentially ; the more complex our society becomes , the greater its inherent vulnerabilities ( a law that software writers certainly understand ) .
A digital assault today would outrage and inconvenience Americans , but we 'd pull through .
Tomorrow could be different .
Military technologies and techniques can develop with distressing speed :
In 1918 , those rickety World War I airplanes were little more than romantic irritants ; by 1943 , a mere quarter - century later , long - range bombers were flattening entire cities .
And the pace of technological change today is considerably greater than it was in the 1920s and 1930s .
The military maxim that applies is that , while you may hope for the best , you had best prepare for the worst ( a principle violated , fatally , in Iraq ) .
If the US vigorously pursues offensive and defensive e-war capabilities but the skeptics turn out to be right , we will have wasted only time and money .
But if the US does n't prepare and those who dismiss the digital - warfare threat are wrong , we might face a devastating surprise attack .
To borrow a line from Frank Zappa , Pearl Harbor might look like " strictly a pup- tent affair . "
A well - prepared , resourceful opponent could create an atmosphere of collapse , as America 's most - advanced military systems failed , citizens panicked , and the economy froze .
The enemy 's goal would be to pressure Washington into an early settlement that amounted to a de facto surrender .
But Americans are far tougher than commonly perceived — after all , history 's greatest losers are those who bet against the US .
Still , the current asymmetry between the no-holds - barred approach to cyberwar embraced by potential enemies and our own insistence on confining all forms of warfare within antiquated laws would put us at a painful disadvantage in a conflict 's opening phase .
The rest of the war would be longer , more destructive and far more vicious than it would have been had the US been prepared .

CHRONIC diseases accounted for 35 m of the world 's 58 m deaths in 2005 , with heart disease alone killing 17.5 m people .
By contrast , HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria together claimed 5.1 m lives .
Chronic , non-communicable illnesses are often considered rich - world maladies , the result of a Western lifestyle of high - fat diets and too little exercise .
But people in poorer countries are increasingly dying from chronic diseases .
Only a fifth of deaths attributable to “ illnesses of affluence ” were actually in the most affluent nations .
Three - quarters happened in poor or lower - middle income countries .

Mr. Feldman --
I think it would be very helpful
to this discussion , if we looked to the origins of the nickname " Betrayus " .
Many people are falsely assuming that " Betrayus " was a clever rhyme made up by Moveon.org for the New York Times ad .
Which I think is a key assumption for this ad controversy to work for the republicans .
And that assumption is false .
The nickname did not originate with Moveon.org .
I clearly remember reading Petraeus 's nickname on various military forums / comment threads over two years ago .
I remember it so because I thought it was very clever and suitable nickname .
In the past couple of months , I have also started seeing the nickname used on progressive blogs and comments .
So when this " controversy " happened yesterday , I did a google search ( i swear google really is a blogger 's friend ! ) to see if I could find an old posting or comment that used the nickname .
Here 's a comment from 2005 :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush headed toward a showdown with the Senate over his domestic spying program on Thursday after lawmakers approved subpoenas for documents the White House declared off - limits .

“ The information the committee is requesting is highly classified and not information we can make available , ” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in signaling a possible court fight .
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the subpoenas in a 13 - 3 vote following 18 months of futile efforts to obtain documents related to Bush ’s contested justification for warrantless surveillance begun after the September 11 attacks .
Three Republicans joined 10 Democrats in voting to authorize the subpoenas , which may be issued within days .
“ We are asking not for intimate operational details but for the legal justifications , ” said Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat .
“ We have been in the dark too long . ”
Authorization of the subpoenas set up another possible courtroom showdown between the White House and the Democratic - led Congress , which has vowed to unveil how the tight - lipped Republican administration operates .
Last week , congressional committees subpoenaed two of Bush ’s former aides in a separate investigation into the firing last year of nine of the 93 U.S. attorneys .
Bush could challenge the subpoenas , citing a right of executive privilege his predecessors have invoked with mixed success to keep certain materials private and prevent aides from testifying .
Bush authorized warrantless surveillance of people inside the United States with suspected ties to terrorists shortly after the September 11 attacks .
The program , conducted by the National Security Agency , became public in 2005 .
WARTIME POWERS
Critics charge the program violated the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires warrants .
Bush said he could act without warrants under wartime powers .
In January , the administration abandoned the program and agreed to get approval of the FISA court for its electronic surveillance .
Bush and Democrats still are at odds over revisions he wants in the FISA law .
“ The White House ... stubbornly refuses to let us know how it interprets the current law and the perceived flaws that led it to operate a program outside the process established by FISA for more than five years , ” Leahy said .
Interest in the legal justification of the program soared last month after former Deputy Attorney General James Comey testified about a March 2004 hospital - room meeting where then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales tried to pressure a critically ill John Ashcroft , then the attorney general , to set aside concerns and sign a presidential order reauthorizing the program .
With top Justice Department officials threatening to resign , Bush quietly quelled the uprising by directing the department to take steps to bring the program in line with the law , Comey said .
Leahy noted that when Gonzales , now attorney general , appeared before the panel on February 6 , he was asked if senior department officials had voiced reservations about the program .
“ I do not believe that these DoJ ( department ) officials ... had concerns about this program , ” Leahy quoted Gonzales as saying .
Leahy added , “ The committee and the American people deserve better . ”
The new issue of The Atlantic ( the 150th Anniversary issue ) has reached me in Stockholm .
If you do n’t subscribe , pick it up at newstands .
It ’s a terrific issue , with nearly 50 of American ’s great minds and writers speculating on the “ future of the American idea ” .
Since
The Atlantic wo n’t let ANYONE read their articles without being paid subscribers , I ’ll republish just one of the 50 essays here and see if they get all worked up about it .
This was the article that had the greatest impact on my thinking , giving me new perspective and providing clear delineation where I was otherwise a little fuzzy .
The Future of the American Idea
November 2007
Atlantic Monthly
by David Foster Wallace
Just Asking
Are some things still worth dying for ?
Is the American idea * one such thing ?
Are you up for a thought experiment ?
What if we chose to regard the 2,973 innocents killed in the atrocities of 9/11 not as victims but as democratic martyrs , “ sacrifices on the altar of freedom ” ?*
In other words , what if we decided that a certain baseline vulnerability to terrorism is part of the price of the American idea ?
And , thus , that ours is a generation of Americans called to make great sacrifices in order to preserve our democratic way of life — sacrifices not just of our soldiers and money but of our personal safety and comfort ?
In still other words , what if we chose to accept the fact that every few years , despite all reasonable precautions , some hundreds or thousands of us may die in the sort of ghastly terrorist attack that a democratic republic cannot 100 - percent protect itself from without subverting the very principles that make it worth protecting ?
Is this thought experiment monstrous ?
Would it be monstrous to refer to the 40,000 - plus domestic highway deaths we accept each year because the mobility and autonomy of the car are evidently worth that high price ?
Is monstrousness why no serious public figure now will speak of the delusory trade - off of liberty for safety that Ben Franklin warned about more than 200 years ago ?
What exactly has changed between Franklin ’s time and ours ?
Why now can we not have a serious national conversation about sacrifice , the inevitability of sacrifice — either of ( a ) some portion of safety or ( b ) some portion of the rights and protections that make the American idea so incalculably precious ?
In the absence of such a conversation , can we trust our elected leaders to value and protect the American idea as they act to secure the homeland ?
What are the effects on the American idea of Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , Patriot Acts I and II , warrantless surveillance , Executive Order 13233 , corporate contractors performing military functions , the Military Commissions Act , NSPD 51 , etc. , etc . ?
Assume for a moment that some of these measures really have helped make our persons and property safer — are they worth it ?
Where and when was the public debate on whether they ’re worth it ?
Was there no such debate because we ’re not capable of having or demanding one ?
Why not ?
Have we actually become so selfish and scared that we do n’t even want to consider whether some things trump safety ?
What kind of future does that augur ?

The problems that we face in this country are not just problems caused by the Bush administration .
They are not caused by a corrupt and ineffective media .
They are not caused by politicians that use their office for personal power and wealth .
They are not just caused by a central bank that charges this country for the right to use its own money .
They are not caused by the terrorists that according to our government , number in the millions and are behind every crime and evil deed done on the planet .
So who is responsible ?
Why is this country falling apart morally and fiscally , not to mention that the nation ’s infrastructure that is coming apart at the seams ?
Why now , and why is every facet of our society either crumbling or under attack from one side or another ?
I have thinking about all of these questions , and everyday I find myself so preoccupied with the questions ; I find little time to research the answers .
It would be so easy to blame everything on the vacant mind that occupies the oval office .
While Bush and his cronies have much to do with the sorry state of affairs we find ourselves in , he is n’t responsible for everything .
There is nobody that is responsible for everything .
Replacing George W. Bush with a new face , no matter whose face it is , wo n’t solve all of our problems .
The truth as I see it , no matter who becomes President , providing that he does n’t follow in the steps of the Pakistani President and cancels the elections by declaring martial law , is that the entire system is corrupt , from top to bottom .
The Republicans can blame it on the Democrats and vice - versa … and they do .
The truth is that every nasty thing they say about each other is part of the show .
The political infighting and bickering is all part of the arrangement designed for public consumption .
In reality , most of the people holding elective positions in this 21st century America , except for a few principled people that have n’t gotten themselves neck deep in filth by returning political favors and keeping secrets , have many reasons for holding office ; least of which is representing their constituents .
That seems to be the only part of our Republic that remains truly transparent and can be readily understood by anyone that takes the time to think independently from the media .
I bring the media into this for a very good reason .
It seems as if a substantial portion of Americans have decided that they are much too busy to think for themselves on issues that are not personally important to them .
This , in and of itself , is one reason why we find ourselves in this situation .
The American people seem to have put way to much trust in a media that is deathly afraid to speak out on anything that might be controversial , lest they offend anyone .
A case in point was during the selection of the new Pope after Pope Paul died .
I was in a hospital room after an operation and my wife and I were watching TV .
I forget how many days they had been deliberating but the point was that if they selected a new Pope , the smoke coming from the Vatican was supposed to be white or black or if the College of Cardinals could not reach a consensus .
I saw the smoke and I said to my wife that it was white , she agreed .
The newsperson on TV could n’t make that assumption , even though the smoke was obviously white .
I flipped through the remote and it seemed as if every newsperson on television that day could n’t tell black from white .
It took almost fifteen minutes until one daring reporter ventured an opinion that the smoke was white .
Once that was said , I flipped through the channels and at that particular point in time , the networks finally decided that they could tell black from white .
I could n’t make something like that up .
This illustrates my point exactly .
News is n’t based on fact anymore , it ’s based on consensus .
The media is n’t completely censored by its corporate sponsors or the government ; it is also under a form of self - censorship .
The American people not only do n’t demand coverage of political wrongdoing and corporate crime , they seem to fear and despise coverage of it .
There are many Americans that would rather see coverage of celebrities and sports than deal with the war in Iraq and corporate scandal .
The reason for this I believe is that they can talk around the water cooler at work about sports and celebrities .
Talking about the war is a delicate subject with no clear solution , and thus makes it hard to discuss .
The idea of bringing up the subject of a corporate controlled America in which our entire political system and the media are taken out of the control of the population and placed in the hands of corporations is another conversation killer .
We were raised to believe that capitalism is the life - blood of this country .
To suggest that this very same capitalism is killing our right to be informed citizen ’s with the right to choose our own leaders sounds too much like a Marxist diatribe , even if it is the truth .
We seem to have fallen into a mind - set that there is nothing that we can accomplish even if we all agreed that this situation is bringing us to an Orwellian type of society where our rights and responsibilities are taken by a kind of corporate oligarchy .
Our news will be filtered so that we become docile and undisturbed .
Our leaders will be financed by those that see it in their best interests to spend heavily on those that will not impede the agenda of business .
No longer will we see bright upstarts on the political scene .
The only ones that will be nominated to run for office from the two corporate and special interest controlled political parties are the ones that can prove that they can be trusted to do the right thing by the people that finance their campaigns .
This is already happening in this country .
If things continue to go as planned , this nation will have had a President with the name of Bush or Clinton since 1989 and could well continue until 2016 .
Is this just a coincidence in a nation of 330,000,000 people ?
We were led into a war with Iraq on the premise that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
We found no such weapons so the rationale behind the war became “ To bring Democracy to Iraq ” .
The media reported this without blinking its eyes .
We are now told that Iran is a “ State Sponsor of Terrorism ” .
The media is reporting this also with a straight face while we continue to give billions in military aid to a nation that has declared martial law on its citizens after they built nuclear weapons and put these weapons on - line without so much as a whimper from the American government .
While we continue to ratchet up the rhetoric about Iran being a supplier of weapons to anti-American forces , we continue to be the world ’s largest arms dealer .
We continue to speculate on a decision to attack Iran even though Iraq ’s WMD ’s never existed .
Since they were n’t to be found in Iraq , we brought along our own in the form of depleted uranium .
Now along with the “ democracy ” we brought to Iraq , they can also deal with the radiation poisoning of their people .
The media has n’t yet informed America that this radiation also gets into the atmosphere by pulverized DU shells and missiles .
Radiation has been found as far away as Great Britain with a radiation count over 5 times the normal amount .
While we export radiation sickness to the Iraqi people , we make sure that the media does n’t report on this less the American people get too “ disturbed ” over it so that the defense contractors can continue to reap record profits .
The oil companies that claim on their TV ads that they are bringing you a cleaner , less toxic biosphere push the Iraqi Parliament to pass the “ Revenue Sharing Law ” that would give 25 % of Iraq ’s only real natural resource to the people of that shattered nation while the multi-national oil companies get the other 75 % .
The media did n’t report on that either , and if it did , I never saw it .

Claims in a controversial Channel 4 programme that recent rises in global temperatures have been caused by the sun have been disproved by scientists .
The programme , the Great Global Warming Swindle , claimed that instead of greenhouse gases from human activity being to blame for a recent surge in temperatures , a change in solar activity was responsible because it influenced the number of cosmic rays that strike the Earth .
The film presented such changes in the sun as a viable alternative explanation for rising temperatures , and was widely cited in discussions of a recent poll that showed 56 % of the UK public doubted the scientific cause of climate change .
But the new analysis , to be published in a Royal Society journal on Tuesday , shows that global warming since 1985 cannot have been caused by an increase in solar radiation or by a decrease in cosmic rays .
Mike Lockwood , a physicist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK , said : " It is absolutely clear that the sun is nothing to do with the recent warming .
" This does n't rely on models , it uses real data and it shows that all the solar trends have been going in the opposite direction for the last 20 years . "
Professor Lockwood carried out the new study to directly challenge the claims made in the Channel 4 programme , which was criticised as misleading by scientists .
With Claus Frohlich of the World Radiation Centre in Davos , Switzerland , he compared temperature and solar data for the past 100 years .
The records show that solar activity peaked between 1985 and 1987 .
Since then , trends in sunshine , sunspot number and cosmic rays have all been in the opposite direction to that required to explain global warming - while temperatures at the Earth 's surface rose steadily by more than 0.3C .
The two scientists conclude : " Our results show that the observed rapid rise in global mean temperatures seen after 1985 cannot be ascribed to solar variability , whichever mechanism is invoked . "
In pre-industrial times , Prof Lockwood said , there was considerable evidence that the sun played a significant role in driving global climate , but he was concerned this genuine area of study had been done a " great disservice " by climate sceptics who were trying to confuse people about recent global warming .
He said : " I know we 're attacking a bit of a strawman here because there is no serious scientific debate about recent warming , but those who disagree are very vocal .
We wrote this up specifically to show they are wrong , and wrong in a dangerous way . "
Mr Hatzius warned of a " substantial recession " risk
The estimate by Goldman 's chief economist Jan Hatzius is higher than that of the Federal Reserve but in line with some recent independent forecasts .
Mr Hatzius predicts leveraged investors may have to reduce their lending by $ 2 trillion as a result .
" The macroeconomic consequences could be quite dramatic , " Mr Hatzius said .
He said the development could lead to a " substantial recession " if it happened over a year , or to a prolonged period of weak economic growth if it occurred over up to four years .
' Wrong analogy '
The associated downward pressure on lending raises the risk of significant weakness in economic activity
Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs
" The likely mortgage credit losses pose a significantly bigger macroeconomic risk than generally recognised , " he said .
" While the uncertainty is large , the associated downward pressure on lending raises the risk of significant weakness in economic activity . "
Mr Hatzius said the analogy that a $ 400 bn loss " is just an equivalent to one bad day in the stock market " is wrong as most equities are held by the type of investors who " do not adjust their portfolios in response to a capital loss " .
Compensation for the risk
Meanwhile , for the first time in several years the bond 's yield - considered to be a measure of the company 's default risk - for the largest financial institutions exceeded the yield of the average company 's bond .
Usually , the higher the risk , the higher the yield would be , as the bond 's issuer has to offer investors a certain compensation for the risk .
It means that now banks , insurance companies and brokerages must pay more for borrowings in the corporate bond market than the average company .
In Europe , though , genetically modified crops are taboo .
Cloning human embryos for research has been legally supported in England and several other countries , but it is banned in more than a dozen others , including France and Germany .
In North and South America , genetically altered crops are widely used .
But embryo cloning for research has been banned in most countries , including Brazil , Canada and Mexico .
It has not been banned nationally in the United States , but the research is ineligible for federal financing , and some states have outlawed it .
Dr. Silver explains these patterns by dividing spiritual believers into three broad categories .
The first , traditional Christians , predominate in the Western Hemisphere and some European countries .
The second , which he calls post - Christians , are concentrated in other European countries and parts of North America , especially along the coasts .
The third group are followers of Eastern religions .
“ Most people in Hindu and Buddhist countries , ” Dr. Silver says , “ have a root tradition in which there is no single creator God .
Instead , there may be no gods or many gods , and there is no master plan for the universe .
Instead , spirits are eternal and individual virtue — karma — determines what happens to your spirit in your next life .
With some exceptions , this view generally allows the acceptance of both embryo research to support life and genetically modified crops . ”
By contrast , in the Judeo - Christian tradition , God is the master creator who gives out new souls to each individual human being and gives humans “ dominion ” over soul - less plants and animals .
To traditional Christians who consider an embryo to be a human being with a soul , it is wrong for scientists to use cloning to create human embryos or to destroy embryos in the course of research .
But there is no such taboo against humans ’ applying cloning and genetic engineering to “ lower ” animals and plants .
As a result , Dr. Silver says , cloned animals and genetically modified crops have not become a source of major controversy for traditional Christians .
Post - Christians are more worried about the flora and fauna .
“ Many Europeans , as well as leftists in America , ” Dr. Silver says , “ have rejected the traditional Christian God and replaced it with a post - Christian goddess of Mother Nature and a modified Christian eschatology .
It is n’t a coherent belief system .
It might or might not incorporate New Age thinking .
But deep down , there ’s a view that humans should n’t be tampering with the natural world . ”
Winter has come early to Tampere and a freezing mist of particles is slowly settling upon the inch or so of snow already underfoot .
Despite being told to expect temperatures of - 13C , I 'm ill - prepared , a fact immediate to all who watch me stomp by , arms clapping about my body in protest .
If Tuomo and Leo are sympathetic , they do n't show it .
Both in their 60s , the two men are perfectly kitted out for such extremes and are making final preparations before heading off for maybe 20 km of cross-country skiing around the city 's park .
The course loops and dips between frosted trees and , from the start , there are dozens of brightly coloured figures out there plodding through the snow during their lunchtimes .
There is nothing particular about Tampere that brings the skiers here or , for that matter , the cyclists , pedestrians and nordic walkers who pick their way along the paths and pavements , skiers robbed of their skis .
Apart from a preponderance of red brick and factories that earned it the guidebook moniker , " the Manchester of Finland " , Tampere is typical , the country 's third largest city , wedged between two lakes and a two - hour train ride north of Helsinki .
If Tampere is typical for Finland , Finland is anything but typical of the world .
According to sports and health experts , it is one of only two countries to have halted the downward spiral towards terminal couch potatoism , or sedentary inactivity to use the official parlance .
Only Canada , though New Zealand may be a contender , can claim to have done as much to get people off their sofas and exercising .
Tuomo and Leo are ready for the off and cast an eye down the gentle slope and across the rest of the course .
In the distance , a group of six or more figures is struggling up a lengthy incline but they eventually reach the top before plodding around as one and skiing back down like a human rollercoaster .
" It 's a good feeling .
It keeps me in shape so I can do the things I want to do , " says Tuomo , adding there is no point coming to the park to do less than 10km .
" We come here with our wives , " adds Leo .
" It 's one of the few things we can do together .
What else would we do with them ? "
Finland 's success story is all the more impressive for where it has pulled itself up from .
" In the 1970s , we held the world record for heart disease , " says Pekka Puska , director of the National Institute of Public Health in Helsinki .
The dubious honour was the inevitable consequence of a Finnish culture that embraced just about every risk factor for heart disease there is .
" The idea then was that a good life was a sedentary life .
Everybody was smoking and eating a lot of fat .
Finnish men used to say vegetables were for rabbits , not real men , so people simply did not eat vegetables .
The staples were butter on bread , full - fat milk and fatty meat , " he says .
Present - day Finland is a very different place .
Topping the league of death shocked the government into a full - blown campaign to dramatically improve peoples ' health .
And it seems to have worked .
The number of men dying from cardiovascular heart disease has dropped by at least 65 % , with deaths from lung cancer being slashed by a similar margin .
Physical activity has risen and now , Finnish men can expect to live seven years longer and women six years longer than before measures were brought in .
Having come so far , Finland now finds itself in the spotlight from health officials across the world who are desperate to find out what it was the Finns got so right .
The story begins in the sparsely populated frontier region of North Karelia in eastern Finland .
The only part of the entire province to remain Finnish after the Soviet occupation in the Second World War , North Karelia was the least healthy region of a desperately sick country .
In 1972 , it became the focus of what was to become the country 's path to recovery .
" The biggest innovation was massive community - based intervention .
We tried to change entire communities , " says Puska .
Instead of a mass campaign telling people what not to do , officials blitzed the population with positive incentives .
Villages held " quit and win" competitions for smokers , where those who did n't spark up for a month won prizes .
Entire towns were set against each other in cholesterol - cutting showdowns .
" We would go in , measure everyone 's cholesterol , then go back two months later , " says Puska .
The towns that cut cholesterol the most would win a collective prize .
" We did n't tell people how to cut cholesterol , they knew that .
It was n't education they needed , it was motivation .
They needed to do it for themselves . "
Local competitions were combined with sweeping nationwide changes in legislation .
All forms of tobacco advertising were banned outright .
Farmers were all but forced to produce low - fat milk or grow a new variety of oilseed rape bred just for the region that would make domestic vegetable oil widely available for the first time .
Previously , farmers had been paid for meat and dairy on the basis of the product 's fat content .
The changes recognised the flaw and linked payment instead to how much protein the produce contained .
Often , moves were attacked for being unpatriotic .
Finland was a dairy - rich country and marginalising dairy farmers was viewed with disdain by many .
But there were ways around the protests .
When officials said the population must start eating fruit , protests poured in that fruit would have to be imported .
To placate the farmers , the scheme was revised to encourage the growing of berries that thrive in a Baltic climate .
Now Finland has a healthy industry producing all manner of berries , from redcurrants to blackberries .
In time , the Finnish authorities succeeded in forcing down salt intake , a crucial move for cutting blood pressure , and blood cholesterol has fallen along with fat intake and smoking .
In 1972 , more than half the middle - aged men of North Karelia smoked .
Now around 30 % do and the country boasts one of the lowest smoking rates in the world , despite having not yet fully imposed its stringent anti-smoking laws .
The early push in North Karelia was largely successful in weaning the population away from its staple diet of fat and fags , but there remained the problem of inactivity .
As the measures trialled in North Karelia were duplicated across the country , a new effort to get people moving was kick - started .
After diet and smoking , physical activity is arguably the most important contributor to health , with inactive people more likely to suffer from heart disease and various cancers , and have higher risks of developing diabetes and hypertension .
What is striking about the Finnish scheme to get people more physically active is the depth and breadth of its reach and the duration for which it has been sustained .
It also hit the right tack from the off , first by selling enjoyable activities to people that happened to require physical activity , and second ensuring exercise was the cheap and easy choice to make .
From the start , the Finnish plans benefited by shifting money away from Helsinki to local authorities and making them responsible for exercise promotion .
Obvious outcomes were cheap , clean swimming pools , ball parks , and well - maintained snow parks such as the one in Tampere .
But less obvious were what medics might refer to as " unusual interventions " .
" There were towns where the pubs were full of middle - aged men who seemed to do little other than drink , " says Ilkka Vuori , a fitness expert at Tampere University and ex-director of the UKK Institute Centre for Health Promotion in Tampere .
" They were a difficult group to reach , so teams went to the pubs , spoke to them and negotiated what they might be interested in doing as exercise .
" Nearly 2 , 000 men in one region were either lent bikes and taken on tours , tempted into a swimming pool , or had a shot at ball games or cross-country skiing .
" It was about getting ideas that would work at that kind of local level , " says Vuori .
" Success relied upon it . "
The closest thing to a British equivalent was tried out two years ago .
Dubbed " Fat men in pubs " by Len Almond , the founding director of the National Centre for Physical Activity and Health at Loughborough University , the scheme was less ambitious than its Finnish counterpart - merely designed to find out what kinds of exercise middle - aged drinking men might consider .
" We got them together and promised them beer the whole time they talked .
They were very frank .
Every one of them thought exercise was fine .
Fine for everyone else that is , " says Almond .
" There was absolutely no chance of even getting them to use their cars less and walk more . "
In Finland , the persistent renewal and creation of schemes has ensured that fitness remains in the public consciousness and that any gains in fitness do not slide away once the ball is back in the shed or the skis hung up for the season .
Recently , " Young Finland " was set up to get even the most unsporting kids into sport .
" What we saw happening was that the weakest , the least skilled and the most overweight were the ones dropping out of sports early and they are precisely the ones who need it most , " says Vuori .
To tackle the problem , the scheme sought to dampen the competitive nature of sports .
Goals went uncounted , victories uncelebrated and winning teams unpromoted .
Though it may take some of the dread out of games afternoon for some , it 's a strategy that has n't been met with universal support .
" Some people doubt how far we can take that , but it functions on some scale at least , " says Vuori .
Over the past 10 years or so , hundreds of local schemes have been set up across Finland , drawing previously inactive people into cycling , Nordic walking , cross-country skiing and ball games , all of which were either free or substantially subsidised to ensure no one was excluded .
But while one branch of the effort focused on getting people to exercise in their leisure time , another sought ways of weaving more exercise into people 's daily routines - a kind of exercise by stealth .
In a time when people often give the excuse of not having enough time to exercise , it was seen as the only way of reaching some groups .
Commuting became an obvious target , and campaigns were set up to encourage people to walk and cycle more .
The public health messages being sent out were backed up by action on the ground with hundreds of kilometres of new walking and cycle paths laid down to form networks into towns and cities , and money was provided to keep them well maintained and lit at night .
Persuading people to walk and cycle more can be a delicate decision in a country such as Finland where , for more than a few months of the year , temperatures can plunge enough to make the ground icy .
" It 's a tremendous problem for older people , because they wo n't go out if they 're going to find it too slippery , " says Vuori .
But it 's a problem that is being dealt with .
A revision to state legislation meant that in many places , the houses lining a street now take responsibility for keeping the pavements in front of their homes safe and clear of snow and ice .
It does n't sound like a law many would adhere to , but Vuori says it is taken very seriously .
" If they do n't do it , they 're fined , and if someone falls , they can sue , " he says .
" It seems like quite a small thing , but these kinds of measures make a big difference . "
To cut the chances of people coming a cropper all for the sake of a brisk walk , the government encouraged shoe companies to come up with non-slip soles .
As if that were n't enough to hope for , in many cities elderly people can claim free sets of spikes to clamp to their shoes .
" The hope is it stops them falling so much because they can easily break their hips , " says Vuori .
The latest practical measure being brought in is the Movement Prescription Project .
Based on an idea cooked up in New Zealand , it encourages GPs to prescribe physical activity to their patients along the same lines as medication .
Preliminary outcomes suggest that on the advice of a GP , the elderly especially benefited , becoming five to six times more active .
Observers of the Finnish success story are now working on how they can bring such drastic improvements to their own countries .
Privately , some claim that Finland had it easier than many because its citizens are happy to live in a nanny state .
Vuori believes nanny state is too strong a term , but concedes that Finland had advantages other countries might not .
" There may be a greater proportion of people in Britain who believe it is not for the state to say what we can drink and eat , or whether we can smoke .
In Finland , regardless of your political views , we are quite obedient , we are trustful of the state and the media .
But people are also well - educated , they hear the messages we put out and they know they are sensible , " says Vuori .
Among exercise experts in Britain , there is a widespread acknowledgment that , regardless of how the Finnish people view their officials , what was done there worked beyond what many could hope for .
" They were in it for the long term , they sustained promotion to make physical activity important and keep it important .
They capitalised on their strength , which was a love of outdoor sports , and gave out grants for local - level projects .
That 's what happened there and frankly , it has n't happened anywhere else , " says Fiona Bull , co-director of the National Centre for Physical Activity and Health .
Other countries have adapted the Finnish strategy to their own cultures in an attempt to emulate their success .
In Brazil , communities have been promoting activities based around dancing .
The challenge in Britain is identifying the activity that people love to do .
" The problem is we 're from an era where we 've been locked into the idea of doing specific activities at set places and at certain times , " says Bull .
" It 's hard to describe a sporting scenario that appeals to the mass population .
People think , 'Gyms are full of sweaty men and skinny women ...
Swim - ming pools are manky ... I could cycle , , but some cycle paths are awful ...'
We need to tap into making activity accessible , fun and sociable . "
Len Almond says the government should bring together disparate interest groups , including the Countryside Agency , that promotes walking , and Sustrans , that encourages cycling , to develop a nationwide , but locally focused strategy to encourage more physical activity .
Next year , rural communities may get to hear of " green movement " , a scheme designed to encourage gardening and conservation work as a form of exercise .
" When you can get people to realise that a whole variety of things are forms of exercise , we might be able to get them to do more of it , " says Almond .
Though Finland is widely held up as an example of how to get it right , it is by no means a land of utopian fitness where managers high five their employees on the morning jog and no one zones out in front of the TV for hours on end munching pizza .
With the big improvements taken care of , Finland is now facing new challenges .
A huge influx of cars in the 1980s means fewer people now walk or cycle to work .
An upturn in obesity is nothing compared to that Britain is experiencing , but significant nonetheless .
And data from the army - national service is compulsory - show that fitness on entry , , as measured by a running exercise , has dropped steadily since the 1970s .
Mikael Fogelholm , director of the UKK Institute in Tampere , says that surveys show some 40 % of men and 35 % of women in Finland are still not active enough .
" It 's good that 60 % are doing well , but we could still do much better .
Total physical inactivity is a big risk for health , " he says .
What is adequate depends on what you are doing .
Fogelholm recommends active exercise - essentially sport or gym work every other day - amounting to two to three hours a week , , or daily " lifestyle activity " , including walking to work or to the shops , gardening or vigorous cleaning for three to four hours a week .
" People always talk about not having enough time .
I think that 's rubbish .
If life is so busy you really can't squeeze in a brisk walk , your life is a mess , " says Fogelholm .
" If people took the amount of time they spent watching TV on one day and made it their whole week 's exercise , we 'd have no problem . "
With the publication last November of the government 's public health white paper , Britain is now , albeit some decades after Finland , poised to make a concerted effort to improve physical fitness .
The problem for everyone concerned is that improvements in transport , the rise of sedentary jobs , and developments in technology all conspire to make life less active .
Persuading us to use our bodies more when we do n't need to is strongly against the flow of change .
" The challenge we have is how do we get to the point where the question is why are n't you doing exercise rather than the opposite , " says Almond .
How the rest of the world is getting fit
The only way to get a nation of couch potatoes fit is to kick - start projects to attack the problem from different angles , says Tim Armstrong at the World Health Organisation .
At a government level , that means involving not just the health and sports departments , but town planners and those running the transport networks too .
" It 's no good just telling people to be physically active , " he says . .
In the Colombian capital of Bogotá , profits from a publicly owned electricity company were used to clean up the streets and build new cycleways .
" Masses of people came out to use them and it actually made the place much safer too , " says Armstrong . .
In Sweden , various schemes to get people cycling have been started up .
In Helsingborg , locals received free pocket - sized maps of cycle routes , while in Gothenburg , a grander scheme set teams of up to 40 people from local companies the target of cycling 30 times in five months , with each trip being more than 2 km .
Each team member received a free waterproof poncho and those teams that succeeded went through to a prize draw .
The prize ?
A cruise to Newcastle .
The Netherlands and Belgium have set up pro- cycling schemes for the elderly after studies showed that not only were they the most likely to be knocked off in the road , but that they often gave up cycling because the traffic was too dense .
Participants were sent on an assertive cycling course which gave tips on how to set off on a bike , how to stop suddenly and how to cycle one - handed .
The bike push has also geared up in the UK where the group Sustrans has been educating school children about the benefits of cycling after a National Travel Survey showed that more than a third of primary school children and more than a fifth of secondary school children were driven to school .
Survey results suggest cycling went up by more than 50 % in some schools where the scheme was piloted .
Many countries have focused on promoting walking .
In Udine , Italy , parent - teacher groups have got together to research the safest routes to walk to school .
In Israel , a much larger push to get people walking was set up with the recruitment throughout the country of volunteers over 60 years old who liked walking .
The volunteers then led walking groups around local neighbourhoods .
To make sure they were noticed - 40 % of pedestrians hit on Israeli roads are elderly - each walker was issued with a hat and reflectors .
Meanwhile , in the Finnish town of Jyväskylä , local authorities were concerned that the elderly were staying in , especially during winter , because it was dark and the pavements were slippery .
To make it easier for them to exercise , they persuaded the bus companies to stop by day centres and old peoples ' homes and then at the local swimming pool .
With the swimming pool paying for the bus fares , pensioners were brought in from 17 suburban regions , mostly for aqua -aerobics .
Two regions of the brain linked to optimism have been discovered by researchers .
The identification of the sites that signal positive thinking could shed light on the causes of depression , they say .
The US team says that the act of imagining a positive future event – such as winning an award or receiving a large sum of cash – activates two brain areas known as the amygdala and the rostral anterior cingulated cortex ( rACC ) .
The finding lends weight to earlier studies that suggested these brain regions malfunction in depression and hint at new ways of diagnosing the disorder .
Elizabeth Phelps at the New York University , US , and colleagues measured how optimistic 15 volunteers were using a standard questionnaire .
The researchers then asked these subjects to lie in a brain scanner and reflect on one of a number of potential scenarios .
For example , in one part of the trial , subjects followed specific instructions to recall a negative event in the past , such a funeral attended in the past five years .
In another part of the experiment they had to imagine what it would be like to be involved in a car crash in the near future .
At other points in the study subjects had to reflect on positive events such as winning an award in the past or receiving a large sum of cash in the future .

Happy events
Brain scans obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) revealed that reflecting on both past and future events activated the amygdala and the ( rACC ) areas , both of which sit deep in the middle of the brain .
However , positive events – and particularly those imagined in the future – elicited a significantly bigger brain response in these regions than reflecting on negative events .
Tali Sharot , a co-author of the new study now based at the University College London , UK , notes that the more pessimistic subjects in the trial had less activation of these brain areas than their optimistic counterparts when imagining happy events .
All this has led the researchers to suspect that the amygdala and rACC play an important role in signalling cheerful thoughts .
Wayne Drevets , a scientist at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda , Maryland , US , says that the results represent a departure from “ a long - term fad where people would only talk about the amgydala [ and rACC ] in terms of negative emotions ” .
“ What ’s striking is that these appear to be the same areas implicated in depression , ” says Phelps .
Previous research has suggested that patients with depression have decreased nerve signalling in the rACC and amygdala .
Drevets notes that autopsies performed on severely depressed patients found fewer cells than normal in the rACC and amygdala .
He says the new findings from Phelps ’s study could perhaps explain why people with depression often have an absence of positive thoughts .
Phelps adds , however , that her new research focuses on optimism and does not shed light on whether decreased signalling and cell count in these areas “ is one of the consequences or causes of depression . ”
“ You ca n’t know from this study what leads to what , ” she says .
If future studies of depressed patients confirm a link between this mood disorder and abnormal activity in the amygdala and rACC , then doctors might one day use brain scans to diagnose this illness and alter therapy to act more directly on these brain regions , the researchers speculate .

CIA Manual : Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare
by " Tayán "
Guerrilla warfare is essentially a political war .
Therefore , its area of operations exceeds the territorial limits of conventional warfare , to penetrate the political entity itself : the " political animal " that Aristotle defined .
In effect , the human being should be considered the priority objective in a political war .
And conceived as the military target of guerrilla war , the human being has his most critical point in his mind .
Once his mind has been reached , the " political animal " has been defeated , without necessarily receiving bullets .
Guerrilla warfare is born and grows in the political environment ; in the constant combat to dominate that area of political mentality that is inherent to all human beings and which collectively constitutes the " environment " in which guerrilla warfare moves , and which is where precisely its victory or failure is defined .
This conception of guerrilla warfare as political war turns Psychological Operations into the decisive factor of the results .
The target , then , is the minds of the population , all the population : our troops , the enemy troops and the civilian population .
This book is a manual for the training of guerrillas in psychological operations , and its application to the concrete case of the Christian and democratic crusade being waged in Nicaragua by the Freedom Commandos .
Welcome !
GENERALITIES
The purpose of this book is to introduce the guerrilla student to the psychological operations techniques that will be of immediate and practical value to him in guerrilla warfare .
This section is introductory and general ; subsequent sections will cover each point set forth here in more detail .
The nature of the environment of guerrilla warfare does not permit sophisticated psychological operations , and it becomes necessary for the chiefs of groups , chiefs of detachments and squadron leaders to have the ability to carry out , with minimal instructions from the higher levels , psychological action operations with the contacts that are thoroughly aware of the situation , i.e. the foundations .
Combatant , Propagandist Guerrillas
In order to obtain the maximum results from the psychological operations in guerrilla warfare , every combatant should be as highly motivated to carry out propaganda face to face as he is as a combatant .
This means that the individual political awareness of the guerrilla of the reason for his struggle will be as acute as his ability to fight .
Such a political awareness and motivation is obtained through the dynamic of groups and self - criticism , as a standard method of instruction for the guerrilla training and operations .
Group discussions raise the spirit and improve the unity of thought of the guerrilla squads and exercise social pressure on the weak members to carry out a better role in future training or in combative action .
Self - criticism is in terms of one 's contribution or defects in his contribution to the cause , to the movement , the struggle , etc. ; and gives a positive individual commitment to the mission of the group .
The desired result is a guerrilla who can persuasively justify his actions when he comes into contact with any member of the People of Nicaragua , and especially with himself and his fellow guerrillas in dealing with the vicissitudes of guerrilla warfare .
This means that every guerrilla will be persuasive in his face - to - face communication - propagandist - combatant - in his contact with the people ; he should be able to give 5 or 10 logical reasons why , for example , a peasant should give him cloth , needle and thread to mend his clothes .
When the guerrilla behaves in this manner , enemy propaganda will never succeed in making him an enemy in the eyes of the people .
It also means that hunger , cold , fatigue and insecurity will have a meaning , psychologically , in the cause of the struggle due to his constant orientation .
Armed Propaganda
Armed propaganda includes every act carried out , and the good impression that this armed force causes will result in positive attitudes in the population toward that force ; and it does not include forced indoctrination .
Armed propaganda improves the behavior of the population toward them , and it is not achieved by force .
This means that a guerrilla armed unit in a rural town will not give the impression that arms are their strength over the peasants , but rather that they are the strength of the peasants against the Sandinista government of repression .
This is achieved through a close identification with the people , as follows : hanging up weapons and working together with them on their crops , in construction , in the harvesting of grains , in fishing , etc. ; explanations to young men about basic weapons , e.g. giving them an unloaded weapon and letting them touch it , see it , etc. ; describing in a rudimentary manner its operation ; describing with simple slogans how weapons will serve the people to win their freedom ; demanding the requests by the people for hospitals and education , reducing taxes , etc .
All these acts have as their goal the creation of an identification of the people with the weapons and the guerrillas who carry them , so that the population feels that the weapons are , indirectly , their weapon to protect them and help them in the struggle against a regime of oppression .
Implicit terror always accompanies weapons , since the people are internally " aware " that they can be used against them , but as long as explicit coercion is avoided , positive attitudes can be achieved with respect to the presence of armed guerrillas within the population .
Armed Propaganda Teams
Armed Propaganda Teams ( EPA ) are formed through a careful selection of persuasive and highly motivated guerrillas who move about within the population , encouraging the people to support the guerrillas and put up resistance against the enemy .
It combines a high degree of political awareness and the " armed " propaganda ability of the guerrillas toward a planned , programmed , and controlled effort .
The careful selection of the staff , based on their persuasiveness in informal discussions and their ability in combat , is more important than their degree of education or the training program .
The tactics of the Armed Propaganda Teams are carried out covertly , and should be parallel to the tactical effort in guerrilla warfare .
The knowledge of the psychology of the population is primary for the Armed Propaganda Teams , but much more intelligence data will be obtained from an EPA program in the area of operations .
Development and Control of the ' Front ' Organizations
The development and control of " front " ( or facade ) organizations is carried out through subjective internal control at group meetings of " inside cadres , " and the calculations of the time for the fusion of these combined efforts to be applied to the masses .
Established citizens -- doctors , lawyers , businessmen , teachers , etc. , -- will be recruited initially as " Social Crusaders " in typically " innocuous " movements in the area of operations .
When their " involvement " with the clandestine organization is revealed to them , this supplies the psychological pressure to use them as " inside cadres " in groups to which they already belong or of which they can be members .
Then they will receive instruction in techniques of persuasion over control of target groups to support our democratic revolution , through a gradual and skillful process .
A cell control system isolates individuals from one another , and at the appropriate moment , their influence is used for the fusion of groups in a united national front .
Control of Meetings and Mass Assemblies
The control of mass meetings in support of guerrilla warfare is carried out internally through a covert commando element , bodyguards , messengers , shock forces ( initiators of incidents ) , placard carriers ( also used for making signals ) , shouters of slogans , everything under the control of the outside commando element .
When the cadres are placed or recruited in organizations such as labor unions , youth groups , agrarian organizations or professional associations , they will begin to manipulate the objectives of the groups .
The psychological apparatus of our movement through inside cadres prepares a mental attitude which at the crucial moment can be turned into a fury of justified violence .
Through a small group of guerrillas infiltrated within the masses this can be carried out ; they will have the mission of agitating by giving the impression that there are many of them and that they have a large popular backing .
Using the tactics of a force of 200-300 agitators , a demonstration can be created in which 10,000 - 20,000 persons take part .
Support of Contacts with Their Roots in Reality
The support of local contacts who are familiar with the deep reality is achieved through the exploitation of the social and political weaknesses of the target society , with propagandist - combatant guerrillas , armed propaganda , armed propaganda teams , cover organizations and mass meetings .
The combatant - propagandist guerrilla is the result of a continuous program of indoctrination and motivation .
They will have the mission of showing the people how great and fair our movement is in the eyes of all Nicaraguans and the world .
Identifying themselves with our people , they will increase the sympathy towards our movement , which will result in greater support of the population for the freedom commandos , taking away support for the regime in power .
Armed propaganda will extend this identification process of the people with the Christian guerrillas , providing converging points against the Sandinista regime .
The Armed Propaganda Teams provide a several - stage program of persuasive planning in guerrilla warfare in all areas of the country .
Also , these teams are the " eyes and ears " of our movement .
The development and control of the cover organizations in guerrilla warfare will give our movement the ability to create a " whiplash " effect within the population when the order for fusion is given .
When the infiltration and internal subjective control have been developed in a manner parallel to other guerrilla activities , a comandante of ours will literally be able to shake up the Sandinista structure , and replace it .
The mass assemblies and meetings are the culmination of a wide base support among the population , and it comes about in the later phases of the operation .
This is the moment in which the overthrow can be achieved and our revolution can become an open one , requiring the close collaboration of the entire population of the country , and of contacts with their roots in reality .
The tactical effort in guerrilla warfare is directed at the weaknesses of the enemy and at destroying their military resistance capacity , and should be parallel to a psychological effort to weaken and destroy their socio-political capacity at the same time .
In guerrilla warfare , more than in any other type of military effort , the psychological activities should be simultaneous with the military ones , in order to achieve the objectives desired .
ARMED PROPAGANDA
Implicit and Explicit Terror
A guerrilla armed force always involves implicit terror because the population , without saying it aloud , feels terror that the weapons may be used against them .
However , if the terror does not become explicit , positive results can be expected .
In a revolution , the individual lives under a constant threat of physical damage .
If the government police cannot put an end to the guerrilla activities , the population will lose confidence in the government , which has the inherent mission of guaranteeing the safety of citizens .
However , the guerrillas should be careful not to become an explicit terror , because this would result in a loss of popular support .
In the words of a leader of the HUK guerrilla movement of the Philippine Islands :
" The population is always impressed by weapons , not by the terror that they cause , but rather by a sensation of strength / force .
We must appear before the people , giving them support with our weapons ; that will give them the message of the struggle . "
This is then , in a few words , the essence of armed propaganda .
An armed guerrilla force can occupy an entire town or small city that is neutral or relatively passive in the conflict .
In order to conduct the armed propaganda in an effective manner , the following should be carried out simultaneously :
Destroy the military or police installations and remove the survivors to a " public place . "
Cut all the outside lines of communication : cables , radio , messengers .
Set up ambushes , in order to delay the reinforcements in all the possible entry routes .
Kidnap all officials or agents of the Sandinista government and replace them in " public places " with military or civilian persons of trust to our movement ; in addition , carry out the following :
Establish a public tribunal that depends on the guerrillas , and cover the town or city in order to gather the population for this event .
Shame , ridicule and humiliate the " personal symbols " of the government of repression in the presence of the people and foster popular participation through guerrillas within the multitude , shouting slogans and jeers .
Reduce the influence of individuals in tune with the regime , pointing out their weaknesses and taking them out of the town , without damaging them publicly .
Mix the guerrillas within the population and show very good conduct by all members of the column , practicing the following :
Any article taken will be paid for with cash .
The hospitality offered by the people will be accepted and this opportunity will be exploited in order to carry out face - to - face persuasion about the struggle .
Courtesy visits should be made to the prominent persons and those with prestige in the place , such as doctors , priests , teachers , etc .
The guerrillas should instruct the population that with the end of the operative , and when the Sandinista repressive forces interrogate them , they may reveal EVERYTHING about the military operation carried out .
For example , the type of weapons they use , how many men arrived , from what direction they came and in what direction they left , in short , EVERYTHING .
In addition , indicate to the population that at meetings or in private discussions they can give the names of the Sandinista informants , who will be removed together with the other officials of the government of repression .
When a meeting is held , conclude it with a speech by one of the leaders of guerrilla political cadres ( the most dynamic ) , which includes explicit references to :
The fact that the " enemies of the people " - the officials or Sandinista agents , must not be mistreated in spite of their criminal acts , although the guerrilla force may have suffered casualties , and that this is done due to the generosity of the Christian guerrillas .
Give a declaration of gratitude for the " hospitality " of the population , as well as let them know that the risks that they will run when the Sandinistas return are greatly appreciated .
The fact that the Sandinista regime , although it exploits the people with taxes , control of money , grains and all aspects of public life through associations , which they are forced to become part of , will not be able to resist the attacks of our guerrilla forces .
Make the promise to the people that you will return to ensure that the " leeches " of the Sandinista regime of repression will not be able to hinder our guerrillas from integrating with the population .
A statement repeated to the population to the effect that they can reveal everything about this visit of our commandos , because we are not afraid of anything or anyone , neither the Soviets nor the Cubans .
Emphasize that we are Nicaraguans , that we are fighting for the freedom of Nicaragua and to establish a very Nicaraguan government .
Guerrilla Weapons are the Strength of the People over an Illegal Government
The armed propaganda in populated areas does not give the impression that weapons are the power of the guerrillas over the people , but rather that the weapons are the strength of the people against a regime of repression .
Whenever it is necessary to use armed force in an occupation or visit to a town or village , guerrillas should emphasize making sure that they :
Explain to the population that in the first place this is being done to protect them , the people , and not themselves .
Admit frankly and publicly that this is an " act of the democratic guerrilla movement , " with appropriate explanations .
That this action , although it is not desirable , is necessary because the final objective of the insurrection is a free and democratic society , where acts of force are not necessary .
The force of weapons is a necessity caused by the oppressive system , and will cease to exist when the " forces of justice " of our movement assume control .
If , for example , it should be necessary for one of the advanced posts to have to fire on a citizen who was trying to leave the town or city in which the guerrillas are carrying out armed propaganda or political proselytism , the following is recommended :
Explain that if that citizen had managed to escape , he would have alerted the enemy that is near the town or city , and they would carry out acts of reprisal such as rapes , pillage , destruction , captures , etc. , in this way terrorizing the inhabitants of the place for having given attention and hospitalities to the guerrillas of the town .
If a guerrilla fires at an individual , make the town see that he was an enemy of the people , and that they shot him because the guerrillas recognized as their first duty the protection of citizens .
The commando tried to detain the informant without firing because he , like all Christian guerrillas , espouses nonviolence .
Having fired at the Sandinista informant , although it is against his own will , was necessary to prevent the repression of the Sandinista government against innocent people .
Make the population see that it was the repressive system of the regime that was the cause of this situation , what really killed the informer , and that the weapon fired was one recovered in combat against the Sandinista regime .
Make the population see that if the Sandinista regime had ended the repression , the corruption backed by foreign powers , etc. , the freedom commandos would not have had to brandish arms against brother Nicaraguans , which goes against our Christian sentiments .
If the informant had n't tried to escape he would be enjoying life together with the rest of the population , because he would not have tried to inform the enemy .
This death would have been avoided if justice and freedom existed in Nicaragua , which is exactly the objective of the democratic guerrilla .
Selective Use of Violence for Propagandistic Effects
It is possible to neutralize carefully selected and planned targets , such as court judges , mesta judges , police and State Security officials , CDS chiefs , etc .
For psychological purposes it is necessary to take extreme precautions , and it is absolutely necessary to gather together the population affected , so that they will be present , take part in the act , and formulate accusations against the oppressor .
The target or person should be chosen on the basis of :
The spontaneous hostility that the majority of the population feels toward the target .
Use rejection of potential hatred by the majority of the population affected toward the target , stirring up the population and making them see all the negative and hostile actions of the individual against the people .
If the majority of the people give their support or backing to the target or subject , do not try to change these sentiments through provocation .
Relative difficulty of controlling the person who will replace the target .
The person who will replace the target should be chosen carefully , based on :
Degree of violence necessary to carry out the change .
Degree of violence acceptable to the population affected .
Degree of violence possible without causing damage or danger to other individuals in the area of the target .
Degree of reprisal predictable by the enemy on the population affected or other individuals in the area of the target .
The mission to replace the individual should be followed by :
On Thursday we read that women footballers were paid £ 40 per day for the five weeks they spent in China representing their country and reaching the quarter finals of the 2007 Women ’s World Cup .
That ’s £ 1400 for 5 weeks , £ 280 per week or to roughly convert that into dollars , around $ 3 k / month .
To give you a better idea , Nemanja Vidic ’s 1 - week ’s worth of wages ( under his new contract ) are more than the entire amount paid to the England women ’s team for their China trip .
The BBC talks about ‘ minimum wage ’ , the hardship suffered by the players who have to support themselves and their families by working overtime to cover for lost wages ( setup an online business ladies , let me know if you need help ) , and the English FA ’s stance that they ’re pumping more money than ever and that standards will improve soon .
All that is well and good .
However , read this ( Alex Stone , representing the FA on women ’s football ) :
“ We ’ve been actually conducting a strategic review of the women ’s league since June this year and the findings will be presented to FA board in early 2008 .
And one of the key issues to work on for the FA is to find out how we can make that product more attractive to sponsors , broadcasters and people who want to come in and watch the game .
Clearly we hope that the finances we might generate filter through to the players .
Women ’s football has made a breakthrough but clearly there ’s a long way to go and we know that which is why we ’re working incredibly hard to try and change that status quo . ”
Once you wade your way past the PR schlitz you read that the money for the players will come through sponsorships .
This might seem reasonable until you read this ( by the same person ) :
“ The money that goes into women ’s football each year from the FA is currently at an all - time high – it ’s £ 4.5 m . ”
I think out of that money , they could have spent £ 3000 per person instead of £ 1400 per person during the World Cup .
Double the money , in other words .
Is that too difficult to manage ?
Channeling the funds so that your most precious resources – the current crop of players who are role models and flagbearers for the future generations – can earn decent wages is not rocket science , it ’s efficient management .
The Beeb has tried to stay somewhat ‘ impartial ’ but they ’ve picked the wrong time to do so – seeing the numbers , I do n’t see how they cannot afford to at least immediately double wages ( and why it was n’t done before ) .
Matching the Americans will take time , but right now the FA are n’t doing enough , and while it ’s understandable that money is tight it ’s not being used correctly just the same .
Let ’s put it this way –
If you offered me these wages for the high - intensity work that footballers must do , I ’d piss on your grave .
The fact that these players are willing to sacrifice personal well - being for the sake of their country says a lot – maybe it ’s time that they were compensated for it ?
By 2010 – the year Dubai ’s known oil reserves will most likely be tapped out– , prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum is expecting to attract 15 million tourists .
Here ’s how .
1 Burj Dubai : world ’s tallest building
The Burj Dubai will be the world ’s tallest building when it opens in 2009 .
The building is part of a 2 km2 ( 0.8 sq mi ) development called ‘ Downtown Dubai ’ and is located at the “ First Interchange ” along Sheikh Zayed Road at Doha Street .
The building was designed by Adrian Smith before he left Skidmore , Owings and Merrill LLP ( SOM ) of Chicago to start his own independent practice , Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture in October 2006 .[ 3 ]
SOM continues to lead the architectural , structural engineering and mechanical engineering of the Burj Dubai .
The total budget for the Burj Dubai project is about $ 4 billion US dollars and for the entire new ‘ Downtown Dubai ’ , $ 20 billion US Dollars .
Its shape is inspired by the indigenous desert flowers that often appear as decorative patterns in Islamic architecture , but it also has an engineering purpose :
The swirl shape ensures that the mass of the structure lessens as it reaches the top , making the structure steadier .
A mixed - use building developed by Dubai ’s Emaar Properties , the Burj Dubai will house shops , offices , residences , and entertainment venues .
2 Palm Islands : palm - shaped man-made island
The Palm Islands in Dubai are the three largest artificial islands in the world .
They are being constructed by Nakheel Properties , a property developer in the United Arab Emirates , who hired the Dutch dredging and marine contractor Van Oord , one of the world ’s specialists in land reclamation .
The islands are The Palm Jumeirah , The Palm Jebel Ali and The Palm Deira .
The Islands are located off the coast of The United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and will add 520 km of beaches to the city of Dubai .
The first two islands will comprise approximately 100 million cubic meters of rock and sand .
Palm Deira will be composed of approximately 1 billion cubic meters of rock and sand .
All materials will be quarried in the UAE .
Between the three islands there will be over 100 luxury hotels , exclusive residential beach side villas and apartments , marinas , water theme parks , restaurants , shopping malls , sports facilities and health spas .
The creation of The Palm Jumeirah began in June 2001 .
Shortly after , The Palm Jebel Ali was announced and reclamation work began .
In 2004 , The Palm Deira , which will be almost as large in size as Paris , was announced .
Palm Jumeirah is currently open for development .
Construction will be completed over the next 10 - 15 years .

5 The World Islands : man -made islands in the form of a world map
Ever wish the world was smaller ?
The World is a man-made archipelago of 300 islands in the shape of a world map .
The World is being built primarily using sand dredged from the sea .
Each island ranges from 23,000 m2 to 84,000 m2 ( 250,000 – 900,000 square feet or 5.7 –21 acres ) in size , with 50 – 100 m of water between each island .
The development will cover an area of 9 km in length and 6 km in width , surrounded by an oval breakwater .
The only means of transport between the islands will be by boat and helicopter .
Prices for the islands will range from $ 15 - 45 million ( USD ) .
The average price for an island will be around $ 25 million ( USD ) .
Dredging started in 2004 and as of March of 2007 The World is around 90 % complete .
According to the National Geographic Channel ( The Best of Megastructures ) the overall price for the World is $ 14 Billion US Dollars .
6 Dubai Mall : largest mall in the world
The Dubai Mall claims to be the largest mall in the world when completed .

An extremely efficient insulation system is the key to maintain the temperature of - 1 degrees Celsius during the day and - 6 degrees during the night when the snow is produced .
Mosul Dam has been a problem for engineers since it was built in 1984
In May , the US told Iraqi authorities to make Mosul Dam a national priority , as a catastrophic failure would result in a " significant loss of life " .
However , a $ 27 m ( £ 13 m ) US - funded reconstruction project to help shore up the dam has made little or no progress .
Iraq says it is reducing the risk and insists there is no cause for alarm .

However , a US watchdog said reconstruction of the dam had been plagued by mismanagement and potential fraud .
In a report published on Tuesday , the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( SIGIR ) said US - funded " short - term solutions " had yet to significantly solve the dam 's problems .
SIGIR found multiple failures in several of the 21 contracts awarded to repair the dam .
Among the faults were faulty construction and delivery of improper parts , as well as projects which were not completed despite full payments having been made .
' Fundamentally flawed '
The dam has been a problem for Iraqi engineers since it was constructed in 1984 .
It was built on water - soluble gypsum , which caused seepage within months of its completion and led investigators to describe the site as " fundamentally flawed " .
In September 2006 , the US Army Corps of Engineers determined that the dam , 45 miles upstream of Mosul on the River Tigris , presented an unacceptable risk .
" In terms of internal erosion potential of the foundation , Mosul Dam is the most dangerous dam in the world , " the corps warned , according to the SIGIR report .
" If a small problem [ at ] Mosul Dam occurs , failure is likely . "
A catastrophic failure of the Mosul Dam would result in flooding along the Tigris River all the way to Baghdad
US letter to Iraqi government

The corps later told US commanders to move their equipment away from the Tigris flood plain near Mosul because of the dam 's instability .
The top US military commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , and US ambassador Ryan Crocker then wrote to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki urging him to make fixing the dam a " national priority " .
" A catastrophic failure of the Mosul Dam would result in flooding along the Tigris River all the way to Baghdad " the letter on 3 May warned .
" Assuming a worst - case scenario , an instantaneous failure of Mosul Dam filled to its maximum operating level could result in a flood wave 20 m deep at the city of Mosul , which would result in a significant loss of life and property . "
If that were to happen some have predicted that as many as 500,000 people could be killed .
Alarm bells
Iraqi authorities , however , say they are taking steps to reduce the risk and they do not believe there is cause for alarm .
The Iraqi Minister for Water Resources , Latif Rashid , told the BBC that a number of steps were being taken to tackle the problem , including a reduction in water levels in the reservoir and a round - the - clock operation to pump grouting into the dam 's foundations .
Work would also begin next year on a longer - term plan to make the foundations safe by encasing them in a concrete curtain , he added .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says the debate over the dam has gone on largely behind the scenes so as not to cause public panic or attract the interest of insurgents .

It ’s no secret that the dollar is on a downward spiral .
Its value is dropping , and the Fed is n’t doing a whole lot to change that .
As a result , a number of countries are considering a shift away from the dollar to preserve their assets .
These are seven of the countries currently considering a move from the dollar , and how they ’ll have an effect on its value and the US economy .
Saudi Arabia : The Telegraph reports that for the first time , Saudi Arabia has refused to cut interest rates along with the US Federal Reserve .
This is seen as a signal that a break from the dollar currency peg is imminent .
The kingdom is taking " appropriate measures " to protect itself from letting the dollar cause problems for their own economy .
They ’re concerned about the threat of inflation and do n’t want to deal with " recessionary conditions " in the US .
Hans Redeker of BNP Paribas believes this creates a " very dangerous situation for the dollar , " as Saudi Arabia alone has management of $ 800 billion .
Experts fear that a break from the dollar in Saudi Arabia could set off a " stampede " from the dollar in the Middle East , a region that manages $ 3,500 billion .
South Korea :
In 2005 , Korea announced its intention to shift its investments to currencies of countries other than the US .
Although they ’re simply making plans to diversify for the future , that does n’t mean a large dollar drop is n’t in the works .
There are whispers that the Bank of Korea is planning on selling $ 1 billion US bonds in the near future , after a $ 100 million sale this past August .
China :
After already dropping the dollar peg in 2005 , China has more trouble up its sleeve .
Currently , China is threatening a " nuclear option " of huge dollar liquidation in response to possible trade sanctions intended to force a yuan revaluation .
Although China " does n’t want any undesirable phenomenon in the global financial order , " their large sum of US dollars does serve as a " bargaining chip . "
As we ’ve noted in the past , China has the power to take the wind out of the dollar .
Venezuela : Venezuela holds little loyalty to the dollar .
In fact , they ’ve shown overt disapproval , choosing to establish barter deals for oil .
These barter deals , established under Hugo Chavez , allow Venezuela to trade oil with 12 Latin American countries and Cuba without using the dollar , shorting the US its usual subsidy .
Chavez is not shy about this decision , and has publicly encouraged others to adopt similar arrangements .
In 2000 , Chavez recommended to OPEC that they " take advantage of high - tech electronic barter and bi-lateral exchanges of its oil with its developing country customers , " or in other words , stop using the dollar , or even the euro , for oil transactions .
In September , Chavez instructed Venezuela ’s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA to change its dollar investments to euros and other currencies in order to mitigate risk .
Sudan : Sudan is , once again , planning to convert its dollar holdings to the euro and other currencies .
Additionally , they ’ve recommended to commercial banks , government departments , and private businesses to do the same .
In 1997 , the Central Bank of Sudan made a similar recommendation in reaction to US sactions from former President Clinton , but the implementation failed .
This time around , 31 Sudanese companies have become subject to sanctions , preventing them from doing trade or financial transactions with the US .
Officially , the sanctions are reported to have little effect , but there are indications that the economy is suffering due to these restrictions .
A decision to move Sudan away from the dollar is intended to allow the country to work around these sanctions as well as any implemented in the future .
However , a Khartoum committee recently concluded that proposals for a reduced dependence on the dollar are " not feasible . "
Regardless , it is clear that Sudan ’s intent is to attempt a break from the dollar in the future .
Iran : Iran is perhaps the most likely candidate for an imminent abandonment of the dollar .
Recently , Iran requested that its shipments to Japan be traded for yen instead of dollars .
Further , Iran has plans in the works to create an open commodity exchange called the Iran Oil Bourse .
This exchange would make it possible to trade oil and gas in non-dollar currencies , the euro in particular .
Athough the oil bourse has missed at least three of its announced opening dates , it serves to make clear Iran ’s intentions for the dollar .
As of October 2007 , Iran receives non-dollar currencies for 85 % of its oil exports , and has plans to move the remaining 15 % to currencies like the United Arab Emirates dirham .
Russia : Iran is not alone in its desire to establish an alternative to trading oil and other commodities in dollars .
In 2006 , Russian President Vladmir Putin expressed interest in establishing a Russian stock exchange which would allow " oil , gas , and other goods to be paid for in Roubles . "
Russia ’s intentions are no secret–in the past , they ’ve made it clear that they ’re wary of holding too many dollar reserves .
In 2004 , Russian central bank First Deputy Chairmain Alexei Ulyukayev remarked , " Most of our reserves are in dollars , and that ’s a cause for concern . "
He went on to explain that , after considering the dollar ’s rate against the euro , Russia is " discussing the possibility of changing the reserve structure . "
Then in 2005 , Russia put an end to its dollar peg , opting instead to move towards a euro alignment .
They ’ve discussed pricing oil in euros , a move that could provide a large shift away from the dollar and towards the euro , as Russia is the world ’s second - largest oil exporter .
What does this all mean ?
Countries are growing weary of losing money on the falling dollar .
Many of them want to protect their financial interests , and a number of them want to end the US oversight that comes with using the dollar .
Although it ’s not clear how many of these countries will actually follow through on an abandonment of the dollar , it is clear that its status as a world currency is in trouble .
Obviously , an abandonment of the dollar is bad news for the currency .
Simply put , as demand lessens , its value drops .
Additionally , the revenue generated from the use of the dollar will be sorely missed if it ’s lost .
The dollar ’s status as a cheaply - produced US export is a vital part of our economy .
Losing this status could rock the financial lives of both Americans and the worldwide economy .
Currently , man-portable air defense systems comprise five percent of attacks on U.S. aircraft in Iraq , Middle East Newsline reported .
The army operates the AH - 64D Apache , the UH - 60 Black Hawk and the CH - 47 Chinook on a 24 - hour basis .
In an Oct. 19 briefing , Shanahan said Iranian SAM systems have forced army helicopter pilots to revise their tactics .
He said the Iranian - origin missiles arrived in Iraq over the last three months .
" In the last several months , we have had an increased threat from systems that we had not seen in the first part of the year , " Shanahan said .
Shanahan did not identify the Iranian missiles .
Over the last 18 months , Iran was said to have received the SA - 18 Igla - S man-portable missile from Russia .
Officials said U.S. Army helicopters have been equipped with additional sensors and diffusers in an effort to decrease the infrared signatures of the air platforms .
They said the biggest threat has been from shoulder - launched heat - seeking surface - to - air missiles , such as the SA - 7 .
" But if you ask the pilots , they would say that MANPADS is the biggest threat , " Shanahan said .
An anonymous George Washington University student targeted by the RIAA for file - sharing is seeking to have the subpoena served on his school quashed and the complaint dismissed .
In his motion , the unnamed student raises a couple of issues that could become significant roadblocks for the RIAA in its campaign against on - campus file - sharing .
Throughout its legal campaign against file - sharing , the RIAA has relied on the Cable Communications Policy Act to obtain subscriber data from cable ISPs and DSL providers .
Under the CCPA , cable companies are required to cough up the data when ordered to do so by a court .
It has worked in the tens of thousands of cases filed by the recording industry against broadband users , and the RIAA has cited the CCPA as the basis for the ex parte subpoenas directed at college students .
There 's one problem .
Colleges are n't cable providers .
Doe number three helpfully points that out to the judge , noting that the CCPA defines a cable operator as an entity that either provides cable service or manages and operates a cable system .
" GWU is neither , " argues Doe three .
It follows a ruling made in another campus file - sharing case , one involving students at the College of William & Mary in Virginia .
There , Judge Walter D. Kelley , Jr. ruled that William & Mary was n't a cable provider and that the RIAA had incorrectly cited the CCPA as the authority for the ex parte subpoenas .
The record labels have appealed Judge Kelley 's July decision , and he has yet to rule on the appeal .
The only alternative to the CCPA , argues Doe number three , is the DMCA .
The DMCA is the favored tool of rights holders when it comes to copyright infringement ; not only does it allow rights holders to fire off takedown notices when an infringing song or video is discovered , but it also empowers the copyright owner to obtain and serve a subpoena on the ISP which hosted the video .
Indeed , Judge Kelley ruled that the DMCA was the sole avenue available to the music industry .
The problem for the RIAA is that , in order to obtain a subpoena , it must first issue a DMCA takedown notice .
And in order to issue a notice , the ISP in question — George Washington University or William & Mary — must have hosted , cached , or transmitted the songs identified by the RIAA 's investigative arm , SafeNet .
The schools did not .
Any file sharing that occurred was from PC to PC ; the songs traversed the universities ' networks without ever residing there .
That slams the door on the DMCA as well , argues Doe three .
Citing case law holding that the DMCA does n't apply to ISPs that act as " a mere transmitter of data that is not cached , stored or located by the ISP , " Doe three says that RIAA has no authority to obtain the subpoenas .
Doe three also offers a number of other reasons that the judge should quash the subpoena and dismiss the lawsuit .
The unnamed student says that the RIAA should n't be allowed to lump together a number of unrelated students into a single case .
Instead , the labels should be forced to file separate lawsuits under federal court rules barring improper joinder .
There 's also the question of the the discovery burden that would be placed on the school , which is one of the reasons cited by the Oregon State Attorney General and the University of Oregon in their motion to have a similar set of subpoenas quashed .
If Judge Kelley 's ruling on the CCPA and DMCA is adopted in this and other cases , it would have the effect of putting the brakes on the RIAA 's legal campaign against on - campus file - sharing .
If the schools were hosting the infringing content , the labels would be able to wield the DMCA sledgehammer and easily obtain the names of the students sharing the content .
And if the schools were cable operators as defined by the CCPA , they would be forced to turn over identifying data , just as the likes of Comcast , Verizon , Cox , and AT&T are .
But it appears that neither law applies to colleges and universities when it comes to students sharing music over KaZaA .
Unless Congress sees fit to change the law , the RIAA may be stuck between a rock and a hard place on this issue .

GALVESTON , Tex. , Nov. 13 — Jurors heard opening arguments on Tuesday in the trial of a bird - watching enthusiast who fatally shot a cat that he said was stalking endangered shorebirds .
The defendant , James M. Stevenson , is the founder of the Galveston Ornithological Society and leads bird - watching tours on this Gulf Coast island 60 miles southeast of Houston .
If convicted on animal cruelty charges in the shooting last November , he faces up to two years in jail and a $ 10,000 fine .
Mr. Stevenson , 54 , does not deny using a . 22 - caliber rifle fitted with a scope to kill the cat , which lived under the San Luis Pass toll bridge , linking Galveston to the mainland .
He also admits killing many other cats on his own property , where he operates a bed and breakfast for some of the estimated 500,000 birders who come to the island every year .
In her opening statement , Paige L. Santell , a Galveston County assistant district attorney , told the jury of eight women and four men that Mr. Stevenson “ shot that animal in cold blood ” and that the cat died a slow and painful death “ gurgling on its own blood . ”
Among the many reasons why Mozilla 's Firefox browser has become popular is the fact that it 's relatively easy to build and install add on extensions for it .
That ease of extensibility however has a potential dark side to it .
Those same extensions that add power to Firefox , generally speaking , could arguably represent a security risk as well .
It 's a security gap that Mozilla is now plugging with its Alpha 8 development release of its next generation Firefox 3 browser .
In terms of add - on extension security , Firefox 3 Alpha 8 is specifically targeting the updating of add - ons to make that process more secure .
Mozilla spells out the issue in its guide on the new extension security :
" Firefox currently automatically checks for updates to add - ons using a url specified in the add - on 's install manifest .
Currently there are no requirements placed on these urls .
In particular , neither url is required to be https .
This allows either the update manifest or the update package to be compromised , potentially resulting in the injection of malicious updates .
A demonstration of one form of compromise is already public . "
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia has launched a project to create a new generation of spacecraft and boosters , the head of national space administration said on Friday , making clear that they would not appear on orbit before 2020 .
Chief of Russia 's space agency Anatoly Perminov gestures on a launch pad of a Russian Soyuz TMA - 10 spacecraft on Baikonur Cosmodrome April 7 , 2007 .
Russia has launched a project to create a new generation of spacecraft and boosters , Perminov said on Friday .
REUTERS / Shamil Zhumatov
“ A tender to design a new booster and spaceship has been announced , ” Itar - Tass news agency quoted Roskosmos chief Anatoly Perminov as saying .
Leadership in space exploration was an issue of national pride in the Soviet Union , which was the first to launch a satellite and a human into space .
Although badly hit in the years of post - Soviet political and economic turmoil , the space sector remains one of a few where Russia remains competitive and on which it pins hopes to diversify its economy heavily reliant on oil and gas exports .
Perminov did not give further details of the tender , but said TsSKB - Progress from the Volga city of Samara is likely to bid with its Soyuz - 3 design of spacecraft , as well as Moscow ’s Khrunichev centre with Angara 3P and Angara 5P .
The United States beat the Soviet Union in developing multiple - use Space Shuttle rockets , which form its current fleet of manned spacecraft .
Russian space officials have said single - use spacecraft like the Soyuz - TM currently used are cheaper and more practical .
Perminov reiterated Russia ’s commitment to build its own cosmodrome to launch new rockets .
At the moment Russia rents its main cosmodrome , Baikonur , from ex-Soviet Kazakhstan .
He said at the same time he hoped Baikonur would be used for at least another 13 years .
“ We are not leaving and will not be able to leave Baikonur until 2020 as long as Soyuz craft fly , ” he said , quoted by RIA news agency .

The Ron Paul Revolution keeps running .
Just when I get complacent and think , " Okay , that ’s more than anyone could have expected from him , let ’s get ready for President Clinton … " he goes and mentions Austrian economics to Jay Leno on national TV .
( And I had thought some young , " cool " Austrian economist would have to do that ! )
A few weeks ago I wrote about the site Intrade.com , which is structured like a futures market in commodities , but where the contracts can be on events such as " Ron Paul wins the 2008 GOP Nomination . "
When I last wrote , his chances were 6.1 % , and he had just edged out McCain to be in 4th place .
Well guess what ?
As of this writing , Ron Paul ’s chances are up to 8.5 % , and he is slightly ahead of Fred Thompson to now be in third place .
Now remember folks , this is n’t some survey .
These are actual contracts with real money behind them .
So to the extent that you think the futures price of oil represents the " market ’s expert opinion " about what oil prices are going to do , you should also believe that the market ’s best guess has Ron Paul in third place to win the GOP nomination , and what ’s crucially important is the momentum behind him .
Forgive me but I just have to include the chart of his progress :
Incidentally , the reason I personally refer to Intrade as the best barometer is that it represents real money and has a separate contract on Ron Paul .
In contrast , the more famous Iowa Electronic Market does n’t have a contract for Paul , so you have to guess at his standing by looking at the " Rest of Field " contract .
The results there are comparable to Intrade ’s , but it ’s not as obvious how much of the " none of the above " results are due to Ron Paul .
For those wishing IEM to have a separate Ron Paul contract , you could write a polite email to its Board of Directors explaining why they should reconsider .
( From an intermediate associate it is my understanding that they are n’t biased against Ron Paul , but have a desire to keep the list of candidates manageable . )
So what do I mean by the title of my article ?
Simply this : Ron Paul ’s opponents thought they could ignore his message and just dismiss him as a kook .
There was no need for them to grapple with his positions , because they were irrelevant .
As Rush Limbaugh explained when a caller told him he had the power single - handedly to make Paul — the truest " conservative " running — a contender : " I do n’t think Congressman Paul has a snowball ’s chance . "
I do n’t know quite why I do it , but whenever I ’m driving during the afternoon I listen to the local talk radio station .
( I listen to NPR during rush hour , so I think it keeps me balanced with support for the welfare - warfare state . )
Now whenever these guys ( especially Sean Hannity ) start ranting about the Democrats and how they have no respect for the Constitution , I just have to laugh .
You could quite literally take their rants and equally apply them to the foreign policy moves suggested by most of the Republicans .
I actually heard two guys discussing Ron Paul ’s views on terrorism , and how he quotes John Quincy Adams , George Washington , and so forth .
These guys actually said something like , " That was good advice back then .
But when the Founders lived , all they worried about were Muskets of Mass Destruction ! "
Now plenty of readers might sympathize with that joke , but by the same token you should then understand how modern day liberals think the 2nd Amendment is anachronistic because of AK - 47s .
You have no right to go through the roof over Democrats ’ trampling of the Constitution , if at the same time you think Ron Paul is crazy for wanting a declaration of war before preemptively nuking a country .
The right - wing pundits are going to have a harder time ignoring Ron Paul as he gains in various polls and other measures .
And if he actually wins or places 2nd in the first few primaries , even the official debates may have to start giving him as much time as the median candidate .
Although some places at least have the courage to flat - out admit that they are stifling Ron Paul support , most other outlets want to at least appear professional and objective .
As I say , the right - wingers who have ignored Ron Paul thus far are really in a fix .
They hoped he would just fade away , and so they would n’t be put into an uncomfortable position .
But if he wins a primary or two , the other candidates will have no choice but to explain why , e.g. , we need the IRS , or why the Department of Education is actually a good thing .
They ’ve certainly made a case for keeping the troops in Iraq , so they can battle Paul on that point .
But on virtually all the other ones ( except maybe ending the Drug War ) , Ron Paul out - Ronnies them all on the Reagan scale .
I ’m genuinely curious :
What are they going to say ?
Ron Paul ’s opponents gambled on him just fading away , and they lost .
The next tactic will of course be to paint him as an absolute nutball , and again , not by actually debating his positions , but just by asserting them as self - evidently crazy .
Over time that too will prove inadequate .
At some point , they will need to explain why the party of limited government could n’t possibly nominate a man who would actually limit government .
What are they going to say ?

Veteran GOP consultants said Monday that they were relaunching a drive to change the way California allocates its electoral college votes , aimed at helping the 2008 Republican presidential nominee capture the White House .
Political strategist David Gilliard said he was taking over the ballot initiative campaign , along with strategist Ed Rollins and fundraiser Anne Dunsmore .
Consultant Mike Arno will oversee the signature - gathering effort .
“ Our budget is going to be whatever it takes to make the June ballot , ” said Gilliard , who played a key role in getting the recall of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis onto the 2003 ballot .
The proposed initiative would change California ’s method of allocating its 55 electoral votes from a winner - take - all basis , which favors Democrats , to a congressional district - based approach .
Republicans hold 19 congressional seats , so presumably the GOP nominee could win a similar number of electoral votes .

The effort stalled last month when its original organizers failed to raise the $ 2 million needed to place the initiative on the June ballot .
Until recently , Dunsmore oversaw fundraising for Rudolph W. Giuliani ’s presidential campaign -- prompting Democrats to charge that the former New York mayor was behind the initiative drive .
A major Giuliani benefactor , Wall Street mogul Paul E. Singer , donated $ 175,000 to fund the original effort .
Giuliani ’s campaign has denied any involvement .
Gilliard said he was not associated with any of the presidential campaigns and predicted that donors to all of the major Republicans would chip in for the initiative drive .
On Monday , Democrats were gearing up to battle the measure .

“ Republicans seem to be pursuing a strategy where they will lose at the polls and , along the way , define the GOP as the party of electoral fraudster , ” said Chris Lehane , a former Clinton White House aide who was organizing the opposition .
California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has set Nov. 13 as the deadline for submitting signatures to place the measure on the June ballot .
Backers must gather 434,000 valid signatures of registered voters .
Because many signatures are typically deemed invalid , circulators will probably seek at least 650,000 .
The initial campaign had gathered about 100,000 signatures .

I 'm usually a pretty patient guy about marketing .
Unlike some , I am not educated by it and , unlike others , I do n't look down on it .
I know why it it exists and I appreciate its value but at some point in advocacy issues ( in this case the environment ) it invariably crosses a line from being funny to offensive and then it goes completely over the line into being the kind of junk science that needs to be ridiculed .
My latest gripe is the claim that low energy bulbs are a magic panacea for the environment and that they are wonderful in all respects .
I do n't use them and there are a few compelling reasons why you should focus on other ways to save the environment also .
The main reason I do n't use them is because I am not smug enough .
You know what I am talking about .
Who actually laughed at those Apple television ads where the smug , hipster guy is the Apple user and the buffoon uses a PC ?
It takes some true marketing incompetence to make Microsoft seem lovable but they did it .
The only people who liked those ads were Apple users , who are already smug .
Now we have commercials where a hip CFL bulb guilt trips a traditional light bulb in the same condescending manner - and without about the same level of actual data behind it .
It will sell some lightbulbs - and maybe make your cat insane , but we 'll get to that in a minute .
First , let 's discuss light .
Are you really surprised Al Gore is on the Apple Board of Directors ?
The whole point of light bulbs was to give us daylight at night - at first , anything was better than dark but we later discovered that the closer you can get to natural light , the better off you will be .
Here is a chart showing the light spectrum , including daylight , incandescent and fluorescent bulbs .
As you can see , natural light is terrific at every wavelength and everything else tries to catch up , with limited success .
Since some of you may respond better to examples , natural light is basically this girl :
Also , most women who use incandescent lights look like this .
And get to date scientists .
So everything is out to replicate natural light in a cost - effective way but there are trade - offs .
If you do n't know , traditional ( incandescent ) lights work because an electric current passes through a thin tungsten wire ( filament ) and heats it , which makes it glow .
A low - energy bulb does the same thing , except it uses gas in a tube - basically it smacks electrons into mercury atoms to produce an atomic emission of ultraviolet light , which is made visible by the coating on the glass .
That 's the definition of fluorescence ; being able to absorb light of one frequency , like UV , and then re-emit it at a different frequency , like visible light .
Incandescent bulbs are not very efficient ( 72 % of the energy is lost as heat ) but if you ever saw people who spent a lot of time under ' fluorescent lighting ' , that was sure not a better solution .
Typical fluorescent light user .
In principle , I have no gripe with the modern CFL ( Compact Fluorescent Lamp ) bulbs being advertised - for many people they are a way to assuage guilt while they drive an SUV and they 're certainly better than they used to be - but you might just want to wait for LED technology .
Why ?
It 's not the mercury content , which activists will say is negligible because they can only conceptualize ' toxic ' when it comes to business ideas they dislike , though the government 's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive disagrees with their assessment .
And it's not the high cost of purchase , which has enough margin that PG&E can give a million of them away for free and still make money and it's not even the many endorsements by Treehugger , who have n't been this excited about an environmental savior since Ethanol , though I assume no one at Treehugger has dropped one in their house and had the Haz - Mat guys show up .
No , it 's none of those .
I am concerned about your pets , my friends .
First , one more quick primer .
Fluorescent lights need a spike in voltage to start that gas on its way so older versions used a magnetic ballast to handle the spike and then control the current .
These ballasts created a 100 Hz frequency that caused the ' flicker ' ( and hum ) that made people dislike them .
Modern CFLs use an electronic ballast and for better efficiency convert to a much higher frequency , such as 25 kHz .
This eliminates the flicker and even the hum associated with the old models because that 25 kHz is outside human hearing range .
But guess whose hearing range it is in ?
Yeah , everything on the planet .
The big question is , of course , do they emit any ultrasound ?
I do n't have a tunable ultrasound detector but David Pye at University of London does .
He tested two low energy bulbs ; U - shaped and coiled .
The U - shaped bulb emitted at a fundamental frequency of 27 kHz and a coiled type at 37 kHz.
Both had strong acoustic signals at the second harmonics ( 54 kHz and 74 kHz , respectively ) and appreciable signals at the third harmonics ( 81 kHz and 11.1 kHz ) , he wrote .
Now , rats and mice are not such a big deal .
If anything , these could be passive pest control for those critters .
But those signals are easily within the hearing range of numerous pets - especially cats .
What would happen to you if you heard a persistent , eerie hum coming from the lights for 16 hours a day ?
Nothing good I can tell you .
So you can wait for LEDs and find other ways to conserve energy now or you can be educated by advertising and turn your scientific pet friend from this :
Schrödinger 's LOLCat
to this :
My recommendation ?
If you feel like you must spend a lot more to avoid old school light bulbs , get this Herman - Miller LED Leaf Lamp
Your pets will thank you .

Facebook TRENTON , N.J. ( AP ) 
An anonymous buyer has paid more than $ 30 million for a collection of rare U.S. prototype coins , some from the 1700s , that never went into circulation , according to the dealer that brokered the deal .
The collection consists of about 1,000 coins that collectors refer to as pattern coins — trial designs that never went into production because the U.S.
Mint chose other designs .
" This collection is an incredible collection .
...
These were some of the first coins ever , ever struck by the United States government , " said Laura Sperber , a partner in Legend Numismatics of Lincroft , N.J. , which brokered the deal .
The seller wanted to remain anonymous , and the buyer , concerned about security , agreed to be identified only as " Mr. Simpson , a Western states collector , " Sperber said .
" Both the buyer and the seller are very competitive people .
And they 're very successful in their careers , and they both love the romance and collectability of coins , " Sperber said .
The coins span the period from 1792 to 1942 .
Highlights include test designs for the first pennies made in 1792 and six coins from 1872 that are often referred to as " Amazonian " patterns because the female figure portraying liberty is much stronger and regal looking than earlier versions .
It took the seller about 10 years to assemble the collection , Sperber said .
Gathering such a large collection of pattern coins is difficult because so few were created in the first place .
And they were usually supposed to stay in the possession of the Mint — after all , these were the rejects .
" To accumulate as many patterns as there are in this collection , that 's incredible , " said Douglas A. Mudd , Curator of the American Numismatic Association Money Museum in Colorado Springs
The coins could have made their way into private hands as gifts , or as trades with collectors for other coins that the Mint wanted to acquire , Sperber said .
Independent , third - party experts have verified the collection , Sperber said .
Many of the coins bear depictions of a woman representing liberty and not the profile of a former president , as displayed on coins currently circulating .
Until 1909 , when Abraham Lincoln 's face was placed on the penny , presidents were n't allowed on coins .
At the time the first coins were minted in 1792 , putting the nation 's leader on a coin seemed too similar to the practice of kings being displayed on European coins .
That was n't considered the best example for a country less than a decade removed from the Revolutionary War .
" To put an individual on coinage was considered very unrepublican because the people have the power in a republic , " Mudd said .
Sperber would not say how much her company earned for brokering the deal but said she hopes the magnitude of the sale will get more people interested in collecting coins .
" They 're historical .
They 're beautiful works of art , " Sperber said .
" They 're just plain neat .

This experimental coin from 1792 was intended as a possible design for a dime , which was spelled disme back then .
At the time , putting the face of a national leader on a coin seemed too similar to the European practice of displaying kings , which was an unpopular idea in a country less than a decade removed from the Revolutionary War .

MORALES , Guatemala , Oct 17 ( Reuters ) - Masked gunmen dumped a Guatemalan banana picker 's bullet - ridden corpse yards from fields of fruit bound for the United States , a grim reminder of the risks of organizing labor in the Central American country .
Marco Tulio Ramirez , killed last month , was the fifth Guatemalan labor leader murdered this year .
Activists say the deaths show promises to protect labor rights under a U.S. trade pact have changed little at a time President George W. Bush is pressing for similar deals in other Latin American nations with bad labor records .
The Central American Free Trade Agreement , or CAFTA , was approved by the U.S. Congress in 2005 after a tough battle with Democrats who argued that worker safeguards in the agreement were too weak .
CAFTA breaks down tariff barriers between Central American countries and the United States .
It has increased Guatemala 's export revenues and improved the investment climate in the country , the government says .
Guatemala , which began implementing the pact last year , was notorious for labor abuses during its 36 - year long civil war and rights are still weak .
Opponents of CAFTA both in the United States and Central America complained that Washington should not encourage trade with countries like Guatemala without tougher rules to protect workers .
The U.S. Trade Representative gave $ 40 million to spend in Guatemala on strengthening the labor ministry , resolving industrial disputes and monitoring work - related abuses .
But little has changed .
" Organizing a union in Guatemala is life - threatening , " said Noe Ramirez , Marco Tulio's brother and the head of the banana workers ' union SITRABI .
" We know the Central American Free Trade Agreement has a chapter on labor protections , but it is not followed , " he said , at the union 's office in the town of Morales .
FACTORIES CLOSED
Bush urged Congress on Friday to approve pending free trade pacts with Colombia , Panama and Peru , saying failure to do so would reduce Washington 's leadership in the region .
Critics fiercely oppose the agreement with Colombia , where rights group Human Rights Watch says 72 trade unionists were killed last year .
" I oppose continuing the same failed CAFTA - style trade model in other countries , " said Rep. Linda Sanchez , a California Democrat .
" Colombia is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for labor organizers , more so than even Guatemala . "
Abuses are common across the Guatemalan economy , especially in textile factories known as maquilas , where workers put in long hours for little pay .
Activists say companies often close factories when workers try form unions .
In January , Pedro Zamora , head of Guatemala 's port workers ' union , was murdered in front of his two sons in the middle of contentious negotiations between the union and company bosses .
Two leaders of the municipal vendors ' union were killed a month later .
In 1999 , SITRABI leaders were forced to resign after 200 armed men threatened them ahead of a planned strike .
Seven still live in exile in the United States .
In July , soldiers raided the SITRABI union 's office asking to see information about members .
The ministry of defense later said the action was unjustified .
Since Ramirez 's death , suspicious cars have followed union members on and off the company 's property , his brother said .
Such intolerance of labor unions has a long history .
Hundreds of union members were murdered or ' disappeared ' by state security forces during the country 's 1960 - 1996 civil war between the army and left - wing rebels .
The war began after a coup backed by banana company United Fruit , now known as Chiquita Brands International
CQB .N
. United Fruit sold many of its plantations , including the ones where Ramirez worked , to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc

.
Representatives from the Fresh Del Monte Produce subsidiary Ramirez was employed by said they have nothing to do with his killing and urged authorities to conduct a full investigation .

On Sunday 's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer , Gen. Wesley Clark reflected on Gen. Petraeus ' testimony on Iraq last week , the MoveOn ad controversy , and Clark 's recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton .
Having served as the NATO Supreme Allied Commander under Clinton from 97-00 , during which he had to testify before a Republican led House and Senate about the conflict in Kosovo , Wesley Clark shares a seasoned perspective into last week 's pro-surge sales - pitch by the White House , and offers up some real insight into where we are in Iraq today and where he thinks we ought to be headed .
Download Download
He then talks candidly about the need for broad diplomatic efforts in the middle east , including Iran .
Just as several new reports over the weekend asserted that the White House is considering military strikes against Iran , Clark 's sober assessment of the overall picture of the situation really is in Iran and how we ought to be dealing with them could n't be more different and reassuring .
He was also asked about this damning passage in his new book , " A Time to Lead . " about the neo-con underpinnings for the Bush administration 's war in Iraq :
" Here 's the paper from the Office of the Secretary of Defense outlining the strategy .
We 're going to take out seven countries in five years ! '
And he named them , starting with Iraq and Syria and ending with Iran .
It was straight out of Paul Wolfowitz 's 1991 play book , dressed up as the search for weapons of mass destruction and the global war on terror . "
Partial transcript below the fold :
Asked about how he would choose to deal with Iran Wesley Clark had this to say :
CLARK : Well , there 's a lot to talk about and I think he 's certainly willing to talk .
If he 's not , other people are .
Iran is in a deep hole economically .
They do n't have their oil industry in order .
Their finances are being constrained .
Their neighbors are opposed to them .
They 're surrounded on four sides by either American troops , American forces or the potential of American military intervention .
They have regional ambitions but they have a limited time .
BLITZER : So you 're saying that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is only one voice there .
There are other voices in Iran .
General Petraeus testified , Ambassador Crocker testified that Iranians were helping to kill American soldiers and Marines in Iraq .
And others are now saying that Iranians are doing the same thing in Afghanistan , trying to send in their improvised explosive devices , et cetera .
Does that affect your thinking about having a dialogue with Iraq ?
CLARK : Absolutely .
It makes it much more imperative that we talk because there 's no question Iran is fighting back .
From the time we went into Iraq , the Iranians ' understanding was they were somewhere two or three or four down the hit list .
So as soon as we could digest the problem of Iraq , we would knock off Syria , take over Lebanon and come after Iran .
That was the sort of loose talk around Washington and , of course , they understood that .
So their first line of defense has been to -- and it's not just military aid inside Iraq , by the way .
It 's political engagement .
It 's economic support .
It 's medical support .
It 's education support .
It 's a continuous dialogue of people .
This is their nearest neighbor , and they have a vital interest in Iraq .
And so , yes , they 're engaged .
And we need to talk to them .
That does n't mean negotiating anything away .
What it means is real , hard - headed dialogue about what their aims are , what our interest and aims are , and see if there 's any common interest at all .
BLITZER : Here 's a quote from the book , your new book , " A Time to Lead . "
And you write this : " ' Here 's the paper from the Office of the Secretary of Defense outlining the strategy .
We 're going to take out seven countries in five years ! '
And he named them , starting with Iraq and Syria and ending with Iran .
It was straight out of Paul Wolfowitz 's 1991 play book , dressed up as the search for weapons of mass destruction and the global war on terror . "
Now , that jumped out at me .
Explain to our viewers what you 're referring to when you make a very serious charge like that , that this whole war in Iraq was basically built on a lie .
CLARK : Well , not exactly a lie .
But a theory about how to deal with terrorism .
It was the " drain the swamp " theory that emerged after 9/11 and people talked about it .
But before that , in 1991 , I remember being in Secretary Wolfowitz 's office when he was the number three guy in the Pentagon .
And he said , yeah , the Gulf war , well , we did n't get rid of Saddam , but what we did learn is we can use military power to clean up these old client states .
We 've got maybe five or ten years to clean them up , Syria , Iran , the rest of them , before the next superpower comes along .
I said , five or ten years ?
You mean , China and -- the discussion sort of wandered off .
But it was one of those nuggets you remember .
And then I'm in the office with this senior general in the Pentagon , and he says , well , he says , sir , I just -- this is after I 'm retired .
Sir , I just got this memo down from the office upstairs .
He 's pointing upstairs .
And they 're on the second floor , and the civilians are on the third floor .
And he says , seven countries .
I said , is that classified ?
And he read the countries .
I said , is that classified ?
Stop .
He was going to show it to me .
I said , do n't show that to me .
I do n't want to see that .
And so it was n't a plan .
Maybe it was a think piece .
Maybe it was a sort of notional concept , but what it was was the kind of indication of dialogue around this town in official circles , just like unofficial circles , that has poisoned the atmosphere and made it very difficult for this administration to achieve any success in the region .

「 Makefileの書き方、その勘どころ」にて：
というわけで続きを書きます。
実は、関数呼び出しを使うときは、代入に「=」を使うより「:=」のほうが適切かつ効率的なときが多いのですが、その話は次の機会にします。
これの説明が中心になります。
内容：
前置き 変数の種類と変数定義 ソースコードの後のほうを参照すること Makeは上から下へと実行していくのだ Make とLispは似ている 実例
●前置き
以下 、Make一般ではなくてGNU Makeの話です。GNU
Makeより古いMakeにも備わっていた伝統的機能の説明はしません。
GNU Make のMakefile記述構文は、ある種のプログラミング言語とみなせます。そのことを認識しないと、シッカリしたMakefileは書けないと思います。そこであえて、Makefile記述構文を「プログラミング言語Make」、あるいは「Make言語」と呼びます。プログラミング言語Makeのソースファイルを、実際の名前がどうであれMakefileと呼びます*1。
最後の実例では 、Erlangのビルドに使う処理を出しますが、Erlangの知識は一切不要です。次のことだけ知っておけば十分。
Cで考えたい人は、「.erl→.c」「.hrl→.h 」「.beam→.o（または.obj）」と置換すればOKです*2。
●変数の種類と変数定 義
GNU Makeの変数は2種類（2つのフレーバー）あって、再帰的変数と単純変数と呼ばれています。でも、再帰的変数と単純変数を構文的に区別することはできません。「=」で定義されるか、「:=」で定義されるかの違いです。
これ以上 、Makeの概念と用語法で説明してもラチがあかないと思うので、思い切って次のように考えましょう。
例えば、
INCLUDE_DIR := ../ include
HEADERS = $ ( wildcard $ ( INCLUDE_DIR ) /*.hrl ) $ ( wildcard *.hrl )
var INCLUDE_DIR = " ../ include " ;
function HEADERS ( ) {
return wildcard ( INCLUDE_DIR + " /*.hrl " ) + " " + wildcard ( " *.hrl " ) ;
}
( setq INCLUDE_DIR " ../ include " )
( defun HEADERS ()
( concat
( wildcard ( concat INCLUDE_DIR " /*.hrl " ) )
" "
( wildcard " *.hrl " ) ) )
となります。 Lisp なら、ですかね 。
以前 のMakeには、「=」しかなかったので、すべての変数は引数なし関数のような扱いだったのです。習慣と互換性から、変数定義には今でもたいてい「=」が使われていますが、多くの場合は「:=」のほうが適切かつ効率的です。例えば、右辺が定数（$を含まない）なら、「:=」でかまいません（つうか、そのほうがベター）。
●ソースコードの後のほうを参照すること
前節で、JavaScriptとLispによって、Makefileに対応するコードを示しました。JavaScriptとLispでは動作原理が異なるところがあるので、その点に触れておきましょう。
var x = f( ) + 1 ;
function f( ) {
return g() * 2 ;
}
function g( ) {
return 3 ;
}
alert ( " x= " + x ) ; // OK ! x=7
こ のJavaScriptコードは、問題なく実行できます。JavaScriptはいったんソースファイルを全部見て変数／関数の宣言を処理してから実行に入ります。つまり、次のようにソースを書き換えていると思っていいでしょう。
/* == 宣言部 == */
var x ;
function f( ) {
return g() * 2 ;
}
function g( ) {
return 3 ;
} /* == 実行部 == */
x = f( ) + 1 ;
alert ( " x= " + x ) ;
一方Lispは、上から下へとそのまま実行していくので、まだ定義されてない関数が出現するとエラーになります。
( setq x (+ ( f ) 1 ) ) ; error 関数fはこの時点で定義されてない .
( defun f ( ) (* ( g ) 2 ) )
( defun g ( ) 3 )
( princ ( format " x=%d
" x ) )
● Makeは上から下へと実行していくのだ
さてMakeですが、JavaScriptよりLispに似た動作をします。
# file : t7.mk
x := $ ( f ) + 1
f = $ ( g ) * 2
g = 3 print_x :
@echo " x= ' $ (x ) ' "
$ make -f t7.mk
x= ' + 1 '
Makeでは、すべての変数が空文字列で初期化されている*3のでエラーにはなりませんが、期待した結果ではありません。LispでもMakeでも、変数xへの代入文を最後に持ってくればOKです。
( defun f ( ) (* ( g ) 2 ) )
( defun g ( ) 3 )
( setq x (+ ( f ) 1 ) )
( princ ( format " x=%d
" x ) )
# file : t8.mk
f = $ ( g ) * 2
g = 3
x := $ ( f ) + 1 print_x :
@echo " x= ' $ (x ) ' "
$ make -f t8.mk
x= '3 * 2 + 1 '
あるいは、xを変数ではなくて関数にしてしまうのも手です。関数定義内で未定義関数を使っても平気ですから。
( defun x ( ) (+ ( f ) 1 ) )
( defun f ( ) (* ( g ) 2 ) )
( defun g ( ) 3 )
( princ ( format " x=%d
" x ( ) ) )
# file : t9.mk
x = $ ( f ) + 1
f = $ ( g ) * 2
g = 3 print_x :
@echo " x= ' $ (x ) ' "
$ make -f t9.mk
x= '3 * 2 + 1 '
● Make とLispは似てい る
Make構文の一部は、次のようなプログラミング言語になっています。
データ型は文字列だけ。 文字列を、空白で区切った語（ワード）のリストとして扱うことができる。
変数を持ち、「:=」により代入ができる。 いくつかの組み込み関数を持つ。 引数なしの 関数を「=」で定義できる。（[追記]引数も使えます。コメント欄参照、コッチも参照。[/追記 ]）
繰り返し制御構造は、組み込み関数foreachでサポートされる。
まー、ちっちゃな関数型言語といってもいいと思いますよ。リスト処理モドキもできるし。雰囲気はLispに似てます；ストールマンの趣味のような気がするな。
でも、ちょっと奇妙なところともありますよ。JavaScriptでもLispでも、変数と引数なし関数はまったくの別物です。しかしMakeでは、変数と引数なし関数の区別は曖昧で、「=」で定義された引数なし関数（Make用語では再帰的変数）が、単なる変数（Make用語では単純変数）に化けたりします。
# file : t10.mk
INCLUDE_DIR := ../ include
HEADERS = $ ( wildcard $( INCLUDE_DIR )/*.hrl )
HEADERS := $ ( HEADERS ) $ ( wildcard * .hrl ) print_headers :
@echo " HEADERS = '$ ( HEADERS ) ' "
これは何の問題もなく動きます。実はLispでも同じように書けます。
( setq INCLUDE_DIR " ../ include " )
( defun HEADERS ()
( wildcard ( concat INCLUDE_DIR " /*.hrl " ) ) )
( setq HEADERS ( concat ( HEADERS ) " " ( wildcard " * .hrl " ) ) )
しかし、変数参照と関数呼び出しの構文が違うので、変数HEADERSと関数HEADERSの区別は厳密にできます。Makeでは、$( HEADERS )
という構文しかありません。まー、いいや、許せる範囲。
●実例
「 作業ディレクトリにあるすべてのErlangソースを、変数SOURCESにセットする」という問題を考えましょう。
SOURCES :=$ ( wildcard * .erl ) でほぼOKなんだけど、一時ファイルまでSOURCESに入るとイヤですよね。一時ファイル名はtmpで始まるという約束にしておけば、filter-out関数でふるいにかけられます。
SOURCES :=$ ( filter - out tmp % , $( wildcard *.erl ) ) ；ここで %は、正規表現 「(.*) 」に相当するパターン・メタ文字です。
tmpによるネーミング規則から外れるゴミファイルがあるときはどうしましょう。not_sources.mkというファイルに、ゴミを並べておくことにします。
SOURCES : =$ ( filter - out tmp % , $( wildcard *.erl ) )
- include not_sources.mk
ifdef NOT_SOURCES
SOURCES :=$ ( filter - out $ ( NOT_SOURCES ) , $( SOURCES ) )
endif # NOT_SOURCES
もしnot_sources.mkがあれば読み込み、not_sources.mk内で定義されている変数NOT_SOURCESに列挙されたゴミをフィルターアウトします。
さて、作業ディレクトリがゴミばっかりで、ほんとのソースは手で列挙するしか方法がないこともあるでしょう。そのときは、ソースファイル達を露骨に（explicitly :-)）書き並べたsources.mkを作ることにします。
- include sources.mk
ifndef SOURCES
SOURCES : =$ ( filter - out tmp % , $( wildcard *.erl ) )
- include not_sources.mk
ifdef NOT_SOURCES
SOURCES :=$ ( filter - out $ ( NOT_SOURCES ) , $( SOURCES ) )
endif # NOT_SOURCES
endif # ! SOURCES
その他、なにやらかにやら設定すると、こんなふうになります。
INCLUDE_DIR :=../ include
BIN_DIR :=../ebin - include sources.mk
ifndef SOURCES
SOURCES : =$ ( filter - out tmp % , $( wildcard *.erl ) )
- include not_sources.mk
ifdef NOT_SOURCES
SOURCES :=$ ( filter - out $ ( NOT_SOURCES ) , $( SOURCES ) )
endif # NOT_SOURCES
endif # ! SOURCES - include headers.mk
ifndef HEADERS
HEADERS :=$ ( wildcard $ ( INCLUDE_DIR ) /*.hrl ) $ ( wildcard *.hrl )
endif # !HEADERS COMMON_HEADERS :=$ ( filter common % , $( HEADERS ) )
OBJECTS :=$ ( patsubst %.erl , $( BIN_DIR ) /%.beam , $( SOURCES ) ) print_vars :
@echo " SOURCES = '$ ( SOURCES ) ' "
@echo " HEADERS = '$ ( HEADERS ) ' "
@echo " COMMON_HEADERS='$ ( COMMON_HEADERS ) ' "
@echo " OBJECTS = '$ ( OBJECTS ) ' "
さー、あなた もMakeプログラミングしてみませんか*4 。
The other ballot issues are never mentioned .
This is a misdemeanor under California election code .
But the f'kery continues in many different ways .
My hope for this diary is that we can collect up everyone 's experiences and post links to any articles relating to this .
There seems to be 3 different aspects to the fraud .
The collection methods for the signatures ( as described above ) , Daryll Issa 's illegal involvement ( by poaching the names from the recall signatores and trading food for signatures on skid row .
The children 's cancer hospital / sign multiple copies tactic is documented in the UCSB student newspaper , The Daily Nexus .
The other tactic used is to describe the initiative as an anti-war initiative ( registration required ) .
Hjiorst has an excellent diary up on Daryll Issa 's involvement and Jerry Brown 's possible response .
Trading food for signatures on skid row in downtown L.A. seems particularly cynical .
( hat tip LooHoo ) .
If you spot an article , please post a link .
If you get hit by these guys , do n't be afraid to call the CA Secretary of State ( they were very easy to talk to ) and your local county voter registrar ( no enforcement , but they are put on alert to look extra carefully ) .
If you encounter these people , please do n't interupt their " process " - see exactly what it is they are doing , so it can be reported .
There are other groups out there this weekend doing petitioning .
The others were doing it by the book and the contrast is quite interesting .
The relevant election code is :
California Elections Code SECTION 18600-18603 18600 ( b) Willfully and knowingly circulates , publishes , or exhibits any
false statement or misrepresentation concerning the contents ,
purport or effect of any state or local initiative , referendum , or
recall petition for the purpose of obtaining any signature to , or
persuading or influencing any person to sign , that petition .
I think this is even more relevant
Any person working for the proponent or proponents of a statewide initiative or referendum measure who covers or otherwise
obscures the summary of the measure prepared by the Attorney General
from the view of a prospective signer is guilty of a misdemeanor .
The " circulation deadline " , according the the CA Secretary of State website , is November 29th , 2007 to qualify for the June ballot .
Thank you , Vikingkingq for bringing this important issue into view !
Let 's keep it at the top of the heap .

UPDATE II : The California Democratic Party has a website called FraudBusters ..
You can email them your sightings and they will post them on the sight .

Entertainment reporter , BBC News
Radiohead have let fans name their price for new album - but is In Rainbows worth paying for ?
Radiohead fans could enter any amount for the album , up to £ 99.99
And it could - the ordering process skipped the credit card section and went straight to the confirmation screen .
But soon my conscience was nagging me to be a bit more equitable and give them a fair price - I was going to listen to , and hopefully enjoy , the album after all .
I remember the old - fashioned pre-download days when you could n't get anything and everything for free - and the argument about the band , and others , needing to get paid instilled a sense of guilt .
But what is a fair price ?
I decided on £ 9.82 because that , I remembered reading , was the average price paid for a CD in the UK in 2006 .
In fact , I got it wrong - it should have been £ 8.92 .
No matter - I 'll just deduct 90 p next time .
The e-mail contained a link that automatically started the download , taking a few minutes before the songs popped up in a zip file .
Simple .
So what of the songs .
Are they worth £ 9.82 - or £ 0.00 ?
In Rainbows is Radiohead 's seventh studio album , and the style has not changed much from their last three - Kid A , Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief .
It has lots of sparse beats , incomprehensible wailing and dreamy orchestration , and not much in the way of wailing guitars , emotional punch or , well , good tunes .
Like their last three albums ( and Thom Yorke 's solo work ) , I will probably listen to it a few times , feel that there must be some greater artistic excellence that I 'm not fully appreciating , then forget about it .
Stuck in a rut
I remember being unsure about OK Computer at first , before finally realising it was brilliant after a good half - dozen listens .
But this feels like it has less substance to worm its way into your life .
I thought Radiohead were supposed to be the masters of invention and innovation , but they seem to have been stuck in the same creative rut for a bit too long now .
I am drastically revising my views on the value of this album .
But unfortunately , there is not a facility on Radiohead 's website to claim a refund if you think you have overpaid .
Is it a one - off gimmick , or the future of the music industry ?
And actually , I may have been a bit foolish thinking that was a fair price in the first place because Radiohead , of course , do n't have all the record company people to pay , nor do they have to press up and send out any CDs .
They do n't have a record company at all after their deal with EMI ran out - so will take much more of my money than they would have done under a traditional deal .
The record company signed the band in the first place , developed them and brought them to our attention .
So maybe I should have paid £ 4.91 to Radiohead and sent a cheque for the other half to EMI for its part in Radiohead 's career , and to pay for finding the next Radiohead .
But really , who 's going to do that ?
Too powerful ?
If more major bands wield their newfound power in the way Radiohead have , punters will get used to paying £ 0.00 , or even £ 4.91 , for an official release .
Prices of other albums will start to seem very steep , and record companies and record shops will be in even deeper trouble than they are now .
HAVE YOUR SAY I can only imagine Radiohead doing something like this .
God bless them !
Daniel Levy
Send us your comments
Radiohead 's pay - what - you - like idea may be a one - off gimmick , or it may be the future of the industry .
But maybe the digital revolution has given the bands a bit too much power .
Maybe Radiohead need a record company .
Maybe they need someone to tell them their output is getting a bit samey now and is n't actually that good , and maybe they should try something else .
And maybe the record company needs them , to get a slice of that sale in order to fund the next Radiohead , whoever that may be .
Either that , or everyone will go down the Radiohead route and new ways of developing and discovering the next Radioheads will take over .
It feels like a pivotal point in music history - but for Radiohead 's method of sale rather than the music itself .
Anyway , my favourite Radiohead album is still Pablo Honey .
Get back to your best , boys , and I might be persuaded to give you more than £ 0.00 next time .
Instead of just fixing that glitch , the White House and its allies on Capitol Hill railroaded Congress into voting a vast expansion of the president ’s powers .
They gave the director of national intelligence and the attorney general authority to intercept — without warrant , court supervision or accountability — any telephone call or e-mail message that moves in , out of or through the United States as long as there is a “ reasonable belief ” that one party is not in the United States .
The new law all but eviscerates the 1978 law .
The only small saving grace is that the new statute expires in six months .
The House handled this mess somewhat better than the Senate , moving to the floor a far more sensible bill .
Mr. McConnell certified that the House bill would address the problem raised by the court .
That is , until the White House made clear that it wanted to use the court ’s ruling to grab a lot more power .
Mr. McConnell then reversed his position and demanded that Congress pass the far more expansive bill .
In the Senate , the team of Harry Reid , the majority leader , gave up fast , agreeing to a deal that doomed any good bill .
The senators then hurriedly approved the White House bill , dumped it on the House and skulked off on vacation .
Representative Rahm Emanuel , the fourth - ranking member of the Democratic House leadership , said yesterday that his party would not wait for the new eavesdropping authority to expire , and would have a new , measured bill on the floor by October .
We look forward to reading it .
But the problem with Congress last week was that Democrats were afraid to explain to Americans why the White House bill was so bad and so unnecessary — despite what the White House was claiming .
There are good answers , if Democrats are willing to address voters as adults .
To start , they should explain that — even if it were a good idea , and it ’s not — the government does not have the capability to sort through billions of bits of electronic communication .
And the larger question : why , six years after 9/11 , is this sort of fishing expedition the supposed first line of defense in the war on terrorism ?
While serving little purpose , the new law has real dangers .
It would allow the government to intercept , without a warrant , every communication into or out of any country , including the United States .
Instead of explaining all this to American voters — the minimal benefits and the enormous risks — the Democrats have allowed Mr. Bush and his fear - mongering to dominate all discussions on terrorism and national security .
The modified mice :
They were also found to be aggressive
' Supermouse ' goes head - to - head with normal mouse
It also lives longer , and breeds later in life compared with its standard laboratory cousin .
The research has been conducted at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio .
Details of the scientists ' new transgenic animals are published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry .
The mice were produced to study the biochemistry at play in metabolism and could aid the understanding of human health and disease .
The GM rodents can run five to six kilometres at a speed of 20 meters per minute on a treadmill , for up to six hours before stopping .
The performance was tested on rodent treadmills
He told BBC News : " The muscles of these mice have many more mitochondria .
These are the little ' engines ' in the cell that produce energy .
For some reason , the number of mitochondria are around 10 times more than we see in the muscle of their littermates . "
The mice over - express a gene responsible for the enzyme phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinases ( PEPCK-C ) .
Normal expression is in the liver , in the production of glucose .
The scientists found their new mice would eat twice as much as normal mice - but weigh half as much .
They could also give birth at three years old - which in human terms is akin to an 80 - year - old woman giving birth .
The research is featured in the Journal of Biological Chemistry
But Professor Hanson played this down .
" Right now , this is impossible to do - putting a gene into muscle .
It 's unethical .
And I do n't think you 'd want to do this .
These animals are rather aggressive , we 've noticed . "
Scientists say such work is more likely to help them understand human conditions , such as those which lead to wasting of the muscles .
US Troops Kill as Many as 7 Civilians in Shootings in Iraq
By VOA News
27 November 2007
Iraqi officials say American troops in Baghdad have killed as many as seven Iraqi civilians , including a child , in two separate shootings .
In one incident , Iraqi security officials say as many as four people were killed Tuesday when U.S. troops opened fire on a minibus .
Officials say the troops shot at the vehicle as it advanced toward a roadblock in Baghdad 's northern Shaab neighborhood .
A U.S. military spokesman says the street is restricted to passenger cars , and the driver failed to heed a warning shot .
In other news , a delegation of Sunni religious leaders met with Iraq 's most respected Shi'ite cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , in the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf today .
A Sunni cleric says Sistani called for unity and an end to sectarian violence in the country .
Earlier Tuesday , the U.S. military said troops opened fire on a car speeding toward a checkpoint in Baiji Monday , killing two men and a child .
A spokesman said the military regrets that civilians are hurt or killed while coalition forces work to rid Iraq of terrorist networks .
In other violence , Iraqi police say a suicide bomber killed six people and wounded several others after detonating explosives at the entrance to a police headquarters in the central city of Baquba Tuesday .
Also Tuesday , Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich said Warsaw could withdraw all its troops from Iraq by mid-2008 .
Klich made the remark in an interview published in the Polish daily newspaper , Rzeczpospolita .
Poland has about 900 soldiers in southern Iraq .
Some information for this report was provided by AFP , AP and Reuters .
PARIS , Nov. 23 ( Reuters ) 
Internet users in France who frequently download music or films illegally risk losing Web access under a new antipiracy system unveiled on Friday .
The three - way pact among Internet service providers , the government and owners of film and music rights was drafted by a commission led by the chief executive of FNAC , a big music and film retailer in France .
The industry has called for action against illicit downloads , which are cutting into its sales .
Under the agreement , service providers will issue warning messages to customers downloading files illegally .
If users ignore those messages , their accounts could be suspended or closed altogether .
“ We run the risk of witnessing a genuine destruction of culture , ” President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a speech endorsing the deal .
That means Mr. Libby ’s appeal of his conviction and his remaining sentence can continue .
The original sentence was within the range called for by federal sentencing guidelines .
Had Mr. Bush pardoned Mr. Libby , it would have been easier for Mr. Libby to rebuild his life .
Mr. Libby ’s ability to practice law , for instance , may be affected by the fact that Mr. Bush chose to commute his sentence rather than pardon him .
“ The garden - variety pardon is a forgiveness , ” said Margaret Colgate Love , the pardon lawyer at the Justice Department for most of the 1990s .
“ It does not expunge or seal a conviction , but it provides relief from the collateral legal consequences of a conviction . ”
Commutations , by contrast , only make the punishment milder .
Governors sometimes commute death sentences to life in prison , for instance .
The Constitution gives the president the “ power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . ”
The provision is generally understood to grant complete discretion where federal crimes are involved .

Top Five Republican Gay Sex Scandals
Pink elephants on parade
Q : How many Republican politicians can you fit in the closet ?
A : Evidently , all of them .
It ’s gone past ridiculous and straight to the absurd .
At this point , it appears your average public restroom has more gay Republicans in it than clean handtowels .
The “ holier - than - thou ” party has spent an awful lot of time on their knees this past year , but they have n’t been doing a lot of praying .
I have no theories why this is the case , other than I think that being gay is the way God made some people and being conservative is a choice , and almost every Republican I ’ve met thinks the opposite .
But why question it ?
The larger point is that if you enjoy seeing politicians destroyed by their own hypocrisy , it ’s been a very , very good year .
So I give you the top five republican gay sex scandals of the past 12 months .
Mark Foley
U.S. Representative
( September 28 , 2006 )
The Crime : Sending sexually laced , gramatically challenged instant messages and e-mails to teenaged boys in the Congressional page program for more than 10 years .
The Hypocrisy : Chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children .
One of the foremost opponents of child pornography in the Senate .
The Quote : “ get a ruler and measure it for me ”
The Video :
Ted Haggard
Leader of the National Association of Evangelicals
( November 2006 )
The Crime : Paying male prostitutes for sex and snorting crystal meth .
The Hypocrisy : A powerful force in the evangelical movement , Haggard participated in weekly meetings with President George Bush and top advisors where he gave spiritual advice .
He taught that homosexuality was an abomination and actively lobbied against gay rights .
The Quote : “ I did not have a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver . ”
The Video :
Larry Craig
U.S. Senator
Senate Liason for Mitt Romney ’s Presidential Campaign
( June 11 , 2007 )
The Crime : Soliciting sex from an undercover cop in an airport bathroom
The Hypocrisy : Craig twice voted against adding the words “ sexual orientation ” to the federal hate crimes law .
Craig also voted to give states the right to refuse to recognize gay marriage–a right they already had , but the Senator wanted to really , really prove he did n’t like gay people .
The Quote : “ I am not gay , I do n’t do these kinds of things . ”
The Video :
Bob Allen
Member of the Florida House of Representatives
Florida Chairman of John McCain ’s Presidential Campaign
( July 11 , 2007 )
The Crime : Offering an undercover cop $ 20 to allow Allen to blow him in a men ’s room in a public park .
After being arrested , Allen tried to explain that he only offered to blow the cop because the cop was a “ burly black man ” and he “ did n’t want to become a statistic . ”
The Hypocrisy : Allen was one of 21 Florida legislators to sign Gov. Jeb Bush ’s friend - of - the - court brief supporting the state ’s ban on gays adopting children , and he co-sponsored an unsuccessful bill that would have enhanced penalties for “ offenses involving unnatural and lascivious acts ” such as indecent exposure .
The Quote : “ I certainly was n’t there to have sex with anybody and certainly was n’t there to exchange money for it . ”
The Video :
Glenn Murphy Jr.
National Chairman of the Young Republicans
Chairman of the Clark County Republican Party
( July 28 , 2007 )
The Crime : Murphy got a fellow Young Republican drunk and then spent the night at his house .
The other young man woke up in the middle of the night to find Murphy giving him mouth - to - penis resuscitation .
After this incident , a 1998 sexual battery report came to light in which Murphy was alleged to have done the exact same thing .
The Hypocrisy : Murphy was a well - paid political consultant for Republican candidates and often advised them to use gay marriage as a wedge issue to paint their opponents as out of touch with traditional values .
The Quote : “ I was in the Sound of Music in High School … do n’t ask ” ( from his now - defunct Myspace page . )
The Video : Unfortunately , the Young Republicans took down all of their videos of Mr. Murphy .
So instead , I give you :
The agricultural ministry announcement that the wheat harvest is only about a third of what is required , and that imports are held up by lack of hard currency , came as a deadline passed today for the last white farmers to leave their land or face prosecution for trespass .
The maize harvest is expected to be equally dire and price controls to contain hyperinflation have emptied the stores of most other foodstuffs .
The World Food Programme says at least 3 million people - one in four of the population - will need food aid in the coming months .
It describes hunger in some parts of the country , which used to be a food exporter , as " acutely serious " .
Last week , the government said it plans to import 100,000 tonnes of wheat but acknowledged that a shipment of 35,000 tonnes was held up in Mozambique because of a shortage of hard currency to pay for it .
The agriculture minister , Rugare Gumbo , has blamed the food shortages on black farmers who have taken over formerly white - owned land .
" I am painfully aware of the widespread theft of stock , farm produce , irrigation equipment and the general vandalism of infrastructure by our new farmers , " he said .
" I am disappointed that our new farmers have proved to be failures since the start of the land reform programme in 2000 .
In spite of all the support government has been pouring into the agricultural sector , productivity and under-utilisation of land remain issues of concern . "
The ministry of agriculture has also blamed electricity shortages for the wheat shortfall , saying that power cuts have affected irrigation and halved crop yields per acre .
The power shortages are likely to continue .
Mozambique has reduced electricity supplies to Zimbabwe because of a $ 35 m ( £ 17.1 m ) unpaid bill .
Shortages of coal and spares for power stations and mining equipment have also hit electricity production and power cuts are now a regular feature of daily life .
Zimbabwe , once the world 's second largest exporter of tobacco , has also seen production of its main cash crop nosedive , further undermining its ability to buy food from abroad .
This year 's crop is not likely to be much better than recent harvests , with many farmers saying that their seedlings have died for lack of irrigation .
Cigarettes are only available on the black market at many times the official price , and now cost more than marijuana - a cash crop that does not appear to have been severely affected by the crisis .
The government 's admission that the land redistribution has failed to deliver the promised boost to food production coincides with a deadline for the last white farmers to vacate their land .
The farms were nationalised last year and the handover to the state was set for today .
Any farmer remaining on their former land faces prosecution for trespassing on state property .
About 50 farmers have already been summonsed by the courts .
White farmers say that senior ruling party , military and intelligence officials have been touring their former properties to lay a claim and that they have little confidence the land will be distributed among the poor as the government claims .
Zimbabwe 's economic problems are likely to be compounded by a law passed last week that compels many publicly owned companies , including foreign firms , to sell a majority of their equity to black Zimbabweans .
Critics say the legislation amounts to expropriation because it effectively forces the companies to hand over half of their value by taxing them to raise the money to " buy " the 51 % stake for black investors approved by the government .
The government has ignored the protests of some foreign investors , including South African banks and mining houses .
With the collapse of tobacco production , mining is now the country 's largest source of foreign currency .
Zimbabwe 's minister of indigenisation , Paul Mangwana , said those companies that do not like it can " pack their bags and go " .
" If they feel that we went into the bush [ to fight against white rule ] for them to enjoy our wealth then they can leave .
We are talking about the total liberation of this country .
I have no apologies for that , " he said .
Last week , the International Monetary Fund said that it would not renew assistance to Zimbabwe until it adopts economic policies rooted in " reality " .
The IMF suspended dealings with Harare late last year .
President Robert Mugabe continues to blame his country 's financial problems on what he calls British - led economic sanctions .
The UK says that the sanctions , imposed by the EU and the US , target leading Zimbabwe officials and have no impact on the economy .
The New York Times had a news article about Venezuela in Thursday 's edition , but it was about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez saying he would cut diplomatic ties with neighboring Colombia .
There was n't a word about a memo from a CIA operative in Caracas to CIA Director General Michael Hayden , uncovered yesterday , outlining a plan for interfering with a Venezuelan referendum set for Dec. 2 , and laying out the steps for instigating and backing a coup .
The plot , called " Operation Pliers , " and laid out in the letter to Hayden by an undercover operative named Michael Steele , who reportedly works in the US Embassy as a " regional affairs officer , " was intercepted by Venezuelan intelligence and released publicly on state TV yesterday .
In the Nov. 20 - dated letter , Steele refers to an $ 8 million US - funded in - country propaganda campaign against Chavez and the referendum , already being implemented , which is designed to institutionalize many of Chavez 's socialist reforms and to permit him to continue to run for president beyond his current two - term limit .
He proposes trying to stall the referendum , which pro-Chavez forces are expected to win handily , and failing that , to then promote a campaign to refuse to accept the results .
Steele further confirms that the agency is working with international news agencies in an effort to distort reports about the referendum and the reforms .
( CNN had to apologize for a " mistake " which led to the words " Who killed him ? " superimposed over a photo of Chavez broadcast on CNN's Spanish - language international broadcast in Venezuela .
Was this a deliberate CIA - inspired black - op ? )
Among the tactics Steele recommends in his letter are :
Promoting street demonstrations and violent protests
Creating a climate of ungovernability
Provoking a general uprising
Working through the US military attache at the embassy to coordinate with
ex-military officers and former coup plotters against Chavez .
Even more darkly , the letter calls for initiating " military actions " to support opposition mobilizations and strategic building occupations , involving US military bases in neighboring Curacao and Colombia to provide support , and even taking control of parts of Venezuela in the days after the referendum , while encouraging a " military rebellion " inside the Venezuelan National Guard .
The CIA communication has been reported in articles filed by the Associated Press , but the Times and other major US news organizations have not mentioned it .
Instead , the Times today ran a column by Roger Cohen , which compares Chavez to the fascists of 1930s Europe , and which calls for defeat of the referendum .
( Are Cohen and the Times part of the CIA 's propaganda campaign ? )
The Cohen column is so rabid that it would be almost comical , were it not for the fact that there is a real threat of a bloody CIA - inspired coup in the democratic nation of Venezuela .
In fact , I thought it would be fun and instructive to alter Cohen 's hit piece a bit , substituting the US for Venezuela , and Bush and Cheney for Chavez , to show its hypocrisy .
Here then , a sample of the only lightly tweaked column :
Shutting Up America's Bush and Cheney By Richard Cohen ( courtesy of editing by Dave Lindorff )
It was a fascist general in 1930s Spain who coined the phrase " Viva la muerte ! " or " Long live death ! "
Essentially meaningless , the words captured the cult of soil , blood and savagery that coursed through European Fascism , in its Francoist and other forms .
President Bush and Vice President Cheney hate Islamo - fascists ; they are central to their repertoire of insults .
But they have not hesitated to deploy the imagery of death to bolster their rightist brand of petro- authoritarianism , now operating under the ludicrous banner of " Homeland , Free Markets and Democracy ! "
The slogan looks almost quaint in its anachronism .
Bush and Cheney would no doubt claim American Revolutionary , rather than Spanish fascist , roots for it ( Patrick Henry also invoked liberty and finality ) .
The bottom line is this .
America 's oil - gilded caudillos are getting serious about instituting executive rule , much like Franco and Mussolini .
I might add Vladimir Putin to that list .
Like the Russian leader , Bush and Cheney have already used fears of terrorism , a pliant judiciary , subservient institutions like the Congress , and the galvanizing appeal of vitriolic anti-Arabism to concoct a 21st - century authoritarianism , complete with gulags and arrest and indefinite detention without charge .
But even Putin has not contemplated going as far as Bush and Cheney with their doctrine of pre-emptive war and " regime change " abroad .
Americans will vote next November most likely between two candidates for president who endorse many of the new powers already claimed by Bush and Cheney , and the Congress , even under Democratic control , continues to grant them additional powers , including the power to conduct sweeping spying on electronic communications without any court order or demonstration of probable cause , the power to declare martial law anywhere in the country on the slightest of pretexts , and the power to expropriate private property of those deemed to be " threatening " the American occupation in Iraq .
" The measures amount to a constitutional coup , " said Teodoro Petkoff ...etc. ... Bush 's and Cheney 's grab for emperor status is grotesque and dangerous -- as Fascism was -- a terrible example for a world that is moving towards democracy .
Venezuela 's Chavez got it right when he told the assembled delegates at the United Nations General Assembly , shortly after President Bush had left the podium after addressing the same group , that he could still " smell the sulfur " left in the room by the American president .
Of course , we in America only read such things about foreign governments , not about our own .
[ Update : The NY Times did deign to mention the memo towards the end of a piece on Venezuela that ran Nov. 30 , but it completely sought to deny the memo 's authenticity . ]
Which may explain why despite the constitutional coup that has been occurring in the US over the last seven years , we have yet to see any hearing in the Judiciary Committee on the impeachable crimes of Bush and Cheney .

Bill Maher :
Show me a man wearing an American flag pin , I 'll show you an asshole

" Show me a man wearing an American flag pin in his lapel , and I 'll show you an asshole , " says Bill Maher during a recent New Rules segment .
Calling it the " first genuine controversy " of the 2008 presidential campaign , Maher brings up last week 's " shocking news " that Democratic candidate , Illinois Senator Barack Obama , does not wear an American flag pin .
" So apparently , he and America are no longer going steady . "
Quips Maher : " Why do n't you just stab the Statue of Liberty in the eye while bitch - slapping a 9/11 widow ? "
Obama came under media scrutiny after expressing to a reporter that wearing the pin seemed like a " substitute for true patriotism . "
Continues Maher , " Another in a series of bullshit non-stories that have zero effect on the troops , the war , or anything in the real world .
Or , as Fox calls it : Breaking news . "
One personality called it " too much information , " saying that Obama was showing a sign of insecurity by not simply saying he was making a fashion statement .
" This is typical press hypocrisy , " says Maher .
" They say they want someone who does n't give pat political answers , but when they get one , they call them a loser .
They say they do n't want safe robots like [ Sen. Hillary Clinton ] , but they create conditions where only that species can survive .
And then , they give cover to people like Sean Hannity , who reported on No - Pin - gate ... and then had to call a doctor because his fake outrage hard - on lasted longer than 72 hours . "
" Of course , the Republicans are the party of Mark Foley , and Ted Haggard , and Larry Craig , and countless other closeted homosexuals ... so their fixation on jewelry is understandable . "
Video of the entire monologue , and the remaining New Rules segment , is below .
It was broadcast on HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher on October 12 , 2007 .
Updated at 12:14 a.m. EDT , Sept. 5 , 2007

On Monday , the day before a fourth man in a suspected plot to bomb jet fuel tankers at Kennedy International Airport turned himself in to the authorities , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg waded once again into the emotional discussions of how ordinary residents can conduct themselves in a post - 9/11 world .
WCBS -TV quoted Mr. Bloomberg as saying :
There are lots of threats to you in the world .
There ’s the threat of a heart attack for genetic reasons .
You ca n’t sit there and worry about everything .
Get a life .
The mayor added , “ You have a much greater danger of being hit by lightning than being struck by a terrorist . ”
Digg , a Web site that allows news readers to share articles with each other , has been fairly abuzz with readers who ’ve highlighted the WCBS - TV item .
Kurt Vonnegut is one of my few idols , an elegantly simple poet - philosopher of the first class .
I grew up near where he lived in Sag Harbor , and I ’ve enjoyed his writing since I was in junior high , where I silently hoped to one day have the courage to visit him .
Alas , I am too late .
He passed on April 11 , 2007 .
I was very fortunate , however , to stumble upon the best interview I ’ve ever seen with him , and it also happened to be his last .
I ’ve edited J. Rentilly ’s piece from US Airways Magazine for length to take two minutes at average reading speed , selecting the questions and answers I found most relevant to designing a rewarding life ( the first half ) or thought - provoking ( the second half ) .
I believe this is two minutes very well spent .
It covers his views on creativity , seriousness , the power ( or lack thereof ) of the written word , and more .
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did …
###
Tell me the reasons you ’ve been attracted to a life of creation , whether as a writer or an artist .
I ’ve been drawing all my life , just as a hobby , without really having shows or anything .
It ’s just an agreeable thing to do , and I recommend it to everybody .
I always say to people , practice an art , no matter how well or badly [ you do it ] , because then you have the experience of becoming , and it makes your soul grow .
That includes singing , dancing , writing , drawing , playing a musical instrument .
One thing I hate about school committees today is that they cut arts programs out of the curriculum because they say the arts are n’t a way to make a living .
Well , there are lots of things worth doing that are no way to make a living .
[ Laughs . ]
They are agreeable ways to make a more agreeable life .
In the process of your becoming , you ’ve given the world much warmth and humor .
That matters , does n’t it ?
I asked my son Mark what he thought life was all about , and he said , “ We are here to help each other get through this thing , whatever it is . ”
I think that says it best .
You can do that as a comedian , a writer , a painter , a musician .
He ’s a pediatrician .
There are all kinds of ways we can help each other get through today .
There are some things that help .
Musicians really do it for me .
I wish I were one , because they help a lot .
They help us get through a couple hours .
“ A lack of seriousness , ” you wrote , “ has led to all sorts of wonderful insights . ”
Yes .
The world is too serious .
To get mad at a work of art — because maybe somebody , somewhere is blowing his stack over what I ’ve done — is like getting mad at a hot fudge sundae .
Nearly forty years after Slaughterhouse - Five , people still love reading your books .
Why do you think your books have such enduring appeal ?
I ’ve said it before : I write in the voice of a child .
That makes me readable in high school .
[ Laughs . ]
Not too many big sentences .
But I hope that my ideas attract a lively dialogue , even if my sentences are simple .
Simple sentences have always served me well .
And I do n’t use semicolons .
It ’s hard to read anyway , especially for high school kids .
Also , I avoid irony .
I do n’t like people saying one thing and meaning the other .
When Timequake was published ten years ago , you said you were basically retired as a writer .
You ’ve published two essay collections since then , God Bless You , Dr. Kevorkian and the best - selling A Man Without a Country .
I wonder if the visual arts have become a substitute for writing in your life .
Well , it ’s something to do in my old age .
[ Laughs . ]
As you may know , I ’m suing a cigarette company because their product has n’t killed me yet .
Is it a different creative process for you , sitting down to write or picking up a paintbrush ?
No .
I used to teach a writer ’s workshop at the University of Iowa back in the ’60s , and I would say at the start of every semester , “ The role model for this course is Vincent van Gogh — who sold two paintings to his brother . ” [ Laughs . ]
I just sit and wait to see what ’s inside me , and that ’s the case for writing or for drawing , and then out it comes .
There are times when nothing comes .
James Brooks , the fine abstract - expressionist , I asked him what painting was like for him , and he said , “ I put the first stroke on the canvas and then the canvas has to do half the work . ”
That ’s how serious painters are .
They ’re waiting for the canvas to do half the work .
[ Laughs . ]
Come on .
Wake up .
We live in a very visual world today .
Do words have any power left ?
I was at a symposium some years back with my friends Joseph Heller and William Styron , both dead now , and we were talking about the death of the novel and the death of poetry , and Styron pointed out that the novel has always been an elitist art form .
It ’s an art form for very few people , because only a few can read very well .
I ’ve said that to open a novel is to arrive in a music hall and be handed a viola .
You have to perform .
[ Laughs . ]
To stare at horizontal lines of phonetic symbols and Arabic numbers and to be able to put a show on in your head , it requires the reader to perform .
If you can do it , you can go whaling in the South Pacific with Herman Melville , or you can watch Madame Bovary make a mess of her life in Paris .
With pictures and movies , all you have to do is sit there and look at them and it happens to you .
Many years ago , you said that a writer ’s job is to use the time of a stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted .
There are a lot of ways for a stranger to pass time these days .
That ’s right .
There are all these other things to do with time .
It used to be people would wonder what the hell they were going to do for the winter .
[ Laughs . ]
Then a big book would come out — a big , wonderful book — and everybody would be reading it to pass the time .
It was a very primitive experiment , before television , where people would have to look at ink on paper , for God ’s sake .
I myself grew up when radio was very important .
I ’d come home from school and turn on the radio .
There were funny comedians and wonderful music , and there were plays .
I used to pass time with radio .
Now , you do n’t have to be literate to have a nice time .
You ’ve stated that television is one of the most viable art forms in the world today .
Well , it is .
It works like a dream .
It ’s a way to hold attention , and it ’s awfully good at that .
For a lot of people , TV is life itself .
Churches used to provide people with better company than they had at home , but now , no matter what your neighborhood life or family life is like , you turn on the television and you get relatives , family .
I do n’t know if you ’ve heard about this , but scientists have created baby geese that believe that an airplane is their mother .
Human beings will believe in all kinds of things that are n’t true , and that ’s okay .
And TV is a part of that .
Is there another book in you , by chance ?
No .
Look , I ’m 84 years old .
Writers of fiction have usually done their best work by the time they ’re 45 .
Chess masters are through when they ’re 35 , and so are baseball players .
There are plenty of other people writing .
Let them do it .
So what ’s the old man ’s game , then ?
My country is in ruins .
So I ’m a fish in a poisoned fishbowl .
I ’m mostly just heartsick about this .
There should have been hope .
This should have been a great country .
But we are despised all over the world now .
I was hoping to build a country and add to its literature .
That ’s why I served in World War II , and that ’s why I wrote books .
When someone reads one of your books , what would you like them to take from the experience ?
Well , I ’d like the guy — or the girl , of course — to put the book down and think , “ This is the greatest man who ever lived . ” [ Laughs . ]

The image is a frame from a " virtual earthquake " simulation showing the up - and - down velocity of the ground as waves radiate out from a magnitude 4.3 earthquake centered near Beverly Hills , Calif .
Only in California will you soon be able to experience a life - threatening earthquake and watch a locally made , supercomputer - generated , 3 - D movie of that shaking ground within 30 minutes of the first jolt .
A digital chain reaction is now in place , on purpose , so that scientists at Caltech and the San Diego Supercomputer Center ( SDSC ) can use data from a network of ground sensors and supercomputers to turn an earthquake into a near real - time animated movie that the public can watch on home computers or on TV as soon as the news breaks .
In fact , Caltech and the SDSC will make the first movie of this kind available to the media and public information providers the next time a magnitude - 3.5 or greater earthquake strikes Southern California — which could be any day now .
How it 's done
When an earthquake rattles Southern California , seismic recorders scattered at hundreds of stations across the earthquake - prone region constantly measure ground motion , providing seismologists with information to determine the temblor 's epicenter , depth and intensity , explained Jeroen Tromp , a computational seismologist of Caltech who works with SDSC to make the movies .
Caltech scientists collect the data .
For earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.5 or greater — which typically strike once or twice a month — the information is fed into a SDSC supercomputer called OnDemand .
Rather than waiting several hours or days for results , a sophisticated computer model can produce a simulation of the ground motion in the area within about 28 minutes .
The OnDemand is a Dell cluster run by open - source Linux operation software and made up of 256 processors .
It has a theoretical peak performance of 2.4 teraflops ( a teraflop is a trillion floating point operations per second , and floating - point is an encoding system that makes it easy to work with extremely long numbers ) .
OnDemand is funded by the National Science Foundation .
E -mailed quake movies
In addition to the seismic data , the computer simulation relies on archived information about the subsurface structure of the region , which largely controls how the seismic waves will ripple out from the earthquake 's epicenter .
For instance , when seismic waves pass through soft sediments , they slow down and the waves amplify ( residents of low - lying regions near San Francisco Bay learned all about this in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake ) .
Waves speed up when passing through hard rocks .
These 3 - D animations are digitally overlaid onto the topography of Southern California and rendered into animated movies , which will be sent as an e-mail to public and news media subscribers .
“ We ’re getting good performance that will let us cut the time to deliver earthquake movies from about 45 to 30 minutes or less , and every minute is important , " Tromp said .
Detailed information about earthquake strikes assists in the delivery of emergency services to victims .
' Big one ' movie
Another group of seismologists and computer scientists has generated simulations , or movies , of future California quakes , including the predicted " big one " that keeps some people awake at night in fearful anticipation .
Scientists at the Southern California Earthquake Center in Los Angeles are using these " virtual earthquakes , " also generated by SDSC supercomputers , to learn more about how these most intense of ground shakers work .
One project called the TeraShake shows the trembling that would result if a 143 - mile ( 230 - kilometer ) length of the San Andreas Fault ruptured to produce a magnitude - 7.7 earthquake .
When the new American Embassy in Baghdad entered the planning stage , more than three years ago , U.S. officials inside the Green Zone were still insisting that great progress was being made in the construction of a new Iraq .
I remember a surreal press conference in which a U.S. spokesman named Dan Senor , full of governmental conceits , described the marvelous developments he personally had observed during a recent sortie ( under heavy escort ) into the city .
His idea now was to set the press straight on realities outside the Green Zone gates .
Senor was well groomed and precocious , fresh into the world , and he had acquired a taste for appearing on TV .
The assembled reporters were by contrast a disheveled and unwashed lot , but they included serious people of deep experience , many of whom lived fully exposed to Iraq , and knew that society there was unraveling fast .
Some realized already that the war had been lost , though such were the attitudes of the citizenry back home that they could not yet even imply this in print .
Now they listened to Senor as they increasingly did , setting aside their professional skepticism for attitudes closer to fascination and wonder .
Senor 's view of Baghdad was so disconnected from the streets that , at least in front of this audience , it would have made for impossibly poor propaganda .
Rather , he seemed truly convinced of what he said , which in turn could be explained only as the product of extreme isolation .
Progress in the construction of a new Iraq ?
Industry had stalled , electricity and water were failing , sewage was flooding the streets , the universities were shuttered , the insurgency was expanding , sectarianism was on the rise , and gunfire and explosions now marked the days as well as the nights .
Month by month , Baghdad was crumbling back into the earth .
Senor apparently had taken heart that shops remained open , selling vegetables , fruits , and household goods .
Had he ventured out at night he would have seen that some sidewalk cafés remained crowded as well .
But almost the only construction evident in the city was of the Green Zone defenses themselves — erected in a quest for safety at the cost of official interactions with Iraq .
Senor went home , married a Washington insider , and became a commentator on Fox News .
Eventually he set himself up in the business of " crisis communications , " as if even he finally realized that Iraq had gone horribly wrong .
Inside the Green Zone the talk of progress slowed and then died .
The first of the nominal Iraqi governments arrived and joined the Americans in their oasis .
The rest of Baghdad became the fearsome " Red Zone , " and completely off limits to American officials , although reporters and other unaffiliated Westerners continued to live and work there .
Meanwhile , through institutional momentum and without regard to the fundamental mission — the reason for being there in the first place — the Green Zone defenses kept growing , surrounding the residents with ever more layers of checkpoints and blast walls , and forcing American officials to withdraw into their highly defended quarters at the Republican Palace , whereupon even the Green Zone became for them a forbidden land .
That was the process that has led , now , to this — the construction of an extravagant new fortress into which a thousand American officials and their many camp followers are fleeing .
The compound , which will be completed by late fall , is the largest and most expensive embassy in the world , a walled expanse the size of Vatican City , containing 21 reinforced buildings on a 104 - acre site along the Tigris River , enclosed within an extension of the Green Zone which stretches toward the airport road .
The new embassy cost $ 600 million to build , and is expected to cost another $ 1.2 billion a year to run — a high price even by the profligate standards of the war in Iraq .
The design is the work of an architectural firm in Kansas City named Berger Devine Yaeger , which angered the State Department last May by posting its plans and drawings on the Internet , and then responding to criticism with the suggestion that Google Earth offers better views .
Google Earth offers precise distance measurements and geographic coordinates too .
Islam is known as a faith for all people and for all times .
Muslims come from all continents and backgrounds , encompassing 1/5 of humanity .
In the heart of a Muslim , there is no room for arrogance and racism .
Allah tells us that the diversity of life , and the various languages and colors of human beings , is a sign of Allah ’s majesty , and a lesson for us to learn about humility , equality , and the appreciation of differences .

He creates you out of dust , and then , behold !
You become human beings ranging far and wide ! ” ( Quran 30:20 ) .
“ For Muslim men and women , for believing men and women , for devout men and women , for true men and women , for men and women who are patient and constant , for men and women who humble themselves , for men and women who give in charity , for men and women who fast , for men and women who guard their chastity , and for men and women who engage much in Allah ’s praise – for them , Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward ” ( Quran 33:35 ) .
The Nation of Islam
Most people , when they think of African - American Muslims , think of the " Nation of Islam . "
Certainly , there is an historical importance to how Islam took hold among African - Americans , but we will see how this initial introduction transformed in modern times .
Among the reasons why African - Americans have been and continue to be drawn to Islam are 1 ) the Islamic heritage of West Africa from where many of their ancestors had come ; and 2 ) the absence of racism in Islam in contrast to the brutal and racist enslavement they had endured .
In the early 1900s , a few black leaders strived to help the recently - freed African slaves regain a sense of self - esteem and reclaim their heritage .
Noble Drew Ali started a black nationalist community , the Moorish Science Temple , in New Jersey in 1913 .
After his death , some of his followers turned to Wallace Fard , who founded the Lost - Found Nation of Islam in Detroit in 1930 .
Fard was a mysterious figure who declared that Islam is the natural religion for Africans , but did not emphasize the orthodox teachings of the faith .
Instead , he preached black nationalism , with a revisionist mythology explaining the historical oppression of the black people .
Many of his teachings directly contradicted the true faith of Islam .
In 1934 , Fard disappeared and Elijah Muhammed took over the leadership of the Nation of Islam .
Fard became a " Savior " figure , and followers believed that he was Allah in the flesh on earth .
The poverty and racism rampant in the urban northern states made his message about black superiority and " white devils " more widely accepted .
His follower Malcolm X became a public figure during the 1960s , although he separated himself from the Nation of Islam before his death in 1965 .
Malcolm X
Muslims look to Malcolm X ( later known as Al - Hajj Malik Shabaaz ) as an example of one who , at the end of his life , rejected the racially - divisive teachings of the Nation of Islam and embraced the true brotherhood of Islam .
His letter from Mecca , written during his pilgrimage , shows the transformation that had taken place .
As we shall see shortly , most African - Americans have made this transition as well , leaving behind the " black nationalist " Islamic organizations to enter the worldwide brotherhood of Islam .
The number of Muslims in the United States today is estimated to be between 6 - 8 million .
According to several surveys commissioned between 2006 - 2008 , African - Americans make up about 25 % of the Muslim population of the U.S .
The vast majority of African - American Muslims have embraced orthodox Islam and have rejected the racially - divisive teachings of the Nation of Islam .
Warith Deen Mohammed , a son of Elijah Mohammed , helped lead the community through a transition away from his father 's black nationalist teachings , to join the mainstream Islamic faith .
The number of Muslim immigrants to the United States has increased in recent years , as has the number of native - born converts to the faith .
Among immigrants , Muslims come largely from Arab and South Asian countries .
A major study conducted by Pew Research Center in 2007 found that American Muslims are mostly middle - class , well - educated , and " decidedly American in their outlook , values and attitudes . "
Today , Muslims in America represent a colorful mosaic that is unique in the world .
African - Americans , Southeast Asians , North Africans , Arabs , and Europeans come together daily for prayer and support , united in faith , with the understanding that they are all equal before God .
If you are n't a Senator who can call up the head of Homeland Security , or a high - powered nun whose boss who can ring up Karl Rove , working free from government watch lists will be a tedious and not -very transparent process .
The first rule for most people in getting off a watch list is to accept that you are not on a list .
Most likely , if you are being singled out at the airport for extra scrutiny , or your credit report says you might match a Treasury list , you are the victim of a bad matching algorithm or a vague watch - list entry for some other person .
For instance , men named Robert Johnson across the country have been logging extra hours at airports because there 's no way for the airlines to know , without an I.D. check , which Robert Johnson is the one the government is looking for .
The signs you are being snagged by a watch list include the repeated inability to print out a boarding pass at home or through a kiosk ; being pulled aside repeatedly for extra questioning and scrutiny of your luggage ; not being able to open a bank account or get a mortgage , despite fine credit .
If you only occasionally get an SSSS on your boarding pass , you likely are n't on a watch list – you 've just been elected for random screening , or for buying a one - way ticket .
( Real Americans fly roundtrip . )
Once you think you are either on , or the collateral damage of , a watch list , you need to figure out which one got you .
If your problem is domestic - or international - travel - related , you can try the Department of Homeland Security 's new online redress system , called the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program , reintroduced in February .
( The old one was so badly designed that Congress opened an investigation ) .
After filling out the form with details , a stymied traveler will need to submit copies of identification documents .
You can file online , or submit a version by fax , mail or e-mail .
If DHS determines your name is matching incorrectly to a watch - list entry , it may add you to a white list that gets you through airport security without the extra scrutiny .
If you 're attempting to shake free of a list you are actually on , it can only be done by the agency that put you on the list in the first place .
DHS may forward your complaint to the Terrorist Screening Center , which runs the master watch list , but the department wo n't tell you which agency blacklisted you .
DHS spokesman Darrin Kayser says the new system demonstrates the government 's determination to stop inconveniencing Americans .
" The program exhibits our commitment to an efficient and safe travel experience by offering a seamless redress policy that differentiates between legitimate travelers and those who wish to do us harm , " Kayser said .
If you find you can't get a credit card or a mortgage or an apartment lease , you can get a copy of your credit report from AnnualCreditReport.com ( you 're entitled to a free copy from each of the three major credit bureaus once a year ) .
Look to see if there is an OFAC ( Office of Foreign Assets Control ) alert on the report .
If there is , and you 're not actually on the list – which is public – contact the credit bureau , the Fair Trade Commission , advocacy groups and the media .
There 's no clear legal recourse , but shame can work wonders with big companies .
Treasury Department spokeswoman Molly Millerwise says individuals on the OFAC list can challenge the designation , and that OFAC offers detailed guidance on how companies can comply with the list .
" OFAC has and will continue to work with credit bureaus and reporting agencies to help them ensure the accuracy of their reporting on the OFAC list , " Millerwise said in an e-mail .
" We 're actively thinking about ways to help them improve their processes . "
If you 're on one of the secret government watch lists , the feds say you have to find the agency that nominated you to the list , and appeal through that agency 's ombudsman , privacy officer or Inspector General .
The Terrorist Screening Center maintains the master " unified terrorist watch list " ( which you can't see ) , but says it is only the keeper , not the creator , of the list .
Nevertheless , in 2005 the center removed 31 entries , based on complaints forwarded to it by watch - list - using agencies , according to a recent Congressional report .
For foreigners having a tough time getting a visa , such as Abbas Kiarostami , an Iranian director widely considered to be the world 's greatest living filmmaker ... good luck .
Redress rules do not apply .

DRIVING across
Utah , I am struck by the majestic scenery , the wide open spaces and the realisation that the early Mormons covered it all on foot .
Whizzing across the semi- desert in an air - conditioned car is quite restful .
With a music system that holds six CDs at a time , I do n't even have to lift a finger to switch from “ Carmen ” to “ La Bohème ” .
Nineteenth - century Mormons had it somewhat tougher .
Back east , they were persecuted .
The governor of Missouri called for them to be exterminated or driven out .
After Joseph Smith , their prophet , was lynched in 1844 , most of his followers went on a great Exodus westwards .
Jupiter
Looks nice , but try crossing on foot
Many drove wagons over the Rocky Mountains into what is now Utah , where they founded Salt Lake City .
Some who could not afford wagons loaded their possessions onto wooden handcarts and pulled them all the way from Iowa — a distance of some 1,300 miles .
Many died en route .
A group of 1,000 got stuck in the Rockies and began to starve .
A mule train was sent up to rescue them , but some 200 died of cold or hunger , and many survivors had to have their frostbitten toes amputated .
I found the monument to these handcart trekkers outside the Temple , the most sacred building of the Mormon faith , profoundly moving .
It also reminded me how closely Mormon history mirrors America's .
The early Mormons , like the early American settlers , were devout pioneers who fled religious persecution .
They trekked westward in search of land and freedom .
They found both , and are now thriving .
Many aspects of Mormon culture are impossible not to admire .
Church charities respond quickly and generously to natural disasters .
If there was an earthquake in Latin America , says one of my guides , “ I could make a phone call and by 6 pm there would be 10,000 volunteers here boxing up [ relief supplies ] . ”
Nearly everyone agrees that Mormons make agreeable neighbours : cheerful , friendly and highly unlikely to throw drunken parties .
Yet many Americans remain suspicious of Mormonism .
In a recent poll , 25 % said they would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who was a Mormon .
That dwarfs the proportion who will admit to bias against a black or female candidate .
Only Muslims and atheists fare worse .
Many evangelicals consider Mormons heretics .
Bill Keller , a televangelist , argues that “ a vote for Mitt Romney is a vote for Satan , ” and that his example will lead millions to Hell .
So Mr Romney has a mountain to climb if he is to win the Republican nomination .
His defenders say it is unAmerican to apply a religious test to a candidate .
But the awkward truth is , voters can make their choice for any reason they please , foolish or otherwise .

Thursday
MANY Americans falsely assume that Mormons are polygamous .
In fact , the church renounced plural marriage , as it was known , in 1890 .
So Mitt Romney 's great - grandfather had four wives , but Mitt himself is the only serious Republican presidential candidate this year to have contented himself with just one .
Polygamy has not vanished from Utah , however .
A few splinter sects keep it up .
One such is the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , whose leader , Warren Jeffs , was arrested last year for abetting statutory rape .
This cult gives an excellent demonstration of why polygamy does not work .
Or rather , why it makes for an unstable society .
AFP
No wives where he 's going
Mr Jeffs ruled over a remote town on the Utah - Arizona border like a priest - king .
He preached that only polygamists go to heaven .
That was fine for him — he had plenty of wives .
But if some men have lots of wives ( and women are only allowed one husband ) , many men are left single .
The cult quickly found itself with a surplus of young single , sex - starved males .
Mr Jeffs 's solution was to expel them .
He would throw out boys as young as ten for “ trouble - making ” .
That could mean an offence as trivial as playing video games or talking back to an elder .
Hundreds of these “ Lost Boys ” can now be found in the nearest towns , subsisting by working on building sites .
I chatted to some Lost Boys in Saint George , in southwest Utah .
They admitted to finding it hard to adjust to mainstream America .
Having lived so austerely for so long , some go wild , at least temporarily , drinking and chasing girls .
Girls like them because they are so buff .
Many have hefted bricks for eight hours a day since they were ten or eleven .
Mr Jeffs believed in hard work .
Most of the Lost Boys had harsh words for their former Prophet , whose trial was playing live on CNN when I spoke to them .
One described how Mr Jeffs would split up families on a whim .
If he suddenly decided that a man was unworthy , he could order that man 's wives to marry another he judged worthier .
The new husband would adopt their children .
The penalty for saying “ No ” was to burn in Hell .
Looking back on his time in the cult , one of the Lost Boys says : “ If you 're raised in it , you do n't realise how bad it all is .
Now I see it 's all crap . ”
Mr Jeffs was convicted and faces a long , long time in jail .

Wednesday
SALT LAKE CITY is the Mecca of Mormonism .
The city was founded by Mormon pioneers escaping persecution back east .
It houses the church 's global headquarters .
The centre of town is dominated by an imposing and elegant temple .
Yet the atmosphere is less straight - laced than you might expect .
You can always get a drink , though some of the rules are irritating .
If you are not eating and you abhor watery beer , you need to join a private club .
To do this , you must give your name and address — hardly an insurmountable obstacle .
Salt Lake City gets a special mention in a book called “ 50 Fabulous Gay Friendly Places to Live ” .
The author , Gregory Kompes , visited the city expecting to find it dour and puritan , but was pleasantly shocked at the vibrancy of the gay scene .
AP
The pride of Salt Lake City
In a way , this is not surprising .
Utah may be America 's reddest state , but it still has its liberals and its bohemians , who tend to cluster in cities .
Practising Mormons tend to get married , have kids and move out to the suburbs in search of bigger backyards and better schools .
Mormons are now a minority in Salt Lake City itself .
That is why the city has a mayor , Rocky Anderson , who is not merely a lapsed Mormon but also quite snippy towards the church .
Mr Anderson marches in gay pride parades and thinks the city should ditch all its finicky drinking laws .
He has clashed often with the city council , which is dominated by Mormons .
He points with mock pride to a cartoon on his office wall of a Mormon politician showing his picture to a tough - looking seagull ( a Mormon symbol ) and telling the bird to “ make it look like an accident ” .
The mayor says that relations between Mormons and non-Mormons are “ quite strained ” .
This is surely an exaggeration .
No one is coming to blows over anything much in Salt Lake City .
Non-Mormons typically find their Mormon neighbours quiet and considerate .
Mormons may have strict rules for themselves , but they rarely seek to impose them on others .
The drinking laws are an exception , though they are probably primarily aimed at Mormons — if your family all think alcohol is sinful , you may hesitate to give your name at a bourbon bar .

Tuesday
YOUNG Mormons , especially men , are expected to go on missions .
Mitt Romney went to France ( where he nearly died in a car crash ) .
Stephen Covey ( a self - help guru best known for writing “ The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People ” ) honed his public - speaking skills as a missionary in England .
So many Mormons go on missions at roughly the same age ( just before or during college , if they are men ; a bit older , if they are women ) that a sudden dip in the number of 19 - year olds shows up in the census figures for Utah .
I went to Brigham Young University in Provo to chat to a group of ex-missionaries .
AP
A highly effective Stephen Covey
They are a pleasant and clean - cut bunch of students .
All have spent a year or two spreading the word in places as far - flung as the Philippines or as close as Nevada .
Most found it a formative experience .
They were obliged to live frugally , rise early , put on a suit every day and tirelessly accost strangers .
The endless rebuffs forced them to develop an unflinching optimism and thick skin .
Conversions are easiest , they say , in places where Christianity is already entrenched .
People who already love Jesus find it easier to accept new revelations about Him .
Converting , say , Taiwanese Buddhists is much tougher : they find basic Christian doctrine strange and unpalatable .
Some people find the Mormons ' emphasis on wholesome family life attractive .
One student recalls a Filipina whose husband habitually got drunk and beat her .
She thought Mormonism 's ban on alcohol a splendid idea .
Her husband did not .
Ironically , one of the worst places to be sent on a mission is the American Bible belt , says another of the students : “ People there have had guns pulled on them or dogs set on them . ”
The missionary experience means that Mormons are more likely than other Americans to speak foreign languages .
The State Department is full of them .
Erlend Peterson , a vice president at Brigham Young , says that whenever he visits an American embassy abroad , he nearly always bumps into alumni .
The students at Brigham Young are conservative — at least by the standards of American campuses .
But some are uneasy at the notion of a Romney presidency .
Ryan Decker , an economics student , worries that with a Mormon in the White House , Mormon missionaries will be seen in many countries as somehow representing American foreign policy .
That will make it harder to fish for souls .

Monday
With a Mormon running for president , many people want to know : what do Mormons believe ?
Mitt Romney , the candidate in question , casts little light on the matter .
When pressed , he lists only the uncontroversial tenets that Mormonism has in common with other Christian churches .
He believes in God , in the Bible and that Jesus Christ is his saviour .
But what else ?
I went to Utah to find out .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( as it is properly known ) is arguably America 's most original contribution to world religion .
As many polite folk tell me , Mormons have everything that other Christians have , plus something extra .
That something is the Book of Mormon .
AP
Standard - bearer
This is a controversial scripture .
Joseph Smith , the founding prophet of Mormonism , said he discovered it a century and a half ago .
An angel showed him where to dig , and he unearthed some metal plates with inscriptions on them in a language called “ Reformed Egyptian ” .
Smith translated these , he said , and then gave the plates back to the angel .
The result was the Book of Mormon .
Sceptics snort that Smith must have written it himself .
But 13 m Latter - day Saints disagree , and the faith Smith founded is one of the fastest - growing large ones in the world .
Russell Ballard , one of the Mormon church 's 12 apostles ( roughly equivalent to a Catholic cardinal ) , invites me into his comfortable office at church headquarters in Salt Lake City .
He is a gentle , thoughtful man .
Like most senior Mormons , he has just had another grandchild .
( Mormons have not been polygamous for over a century , but they still have a lot of children . )
The Christian church was lost , he says .
With God 's guidance , Joseph Smith restored it .
Elder Ballard and the church 's amiable public relations man , Michael Otterson , explain how Mormonism differs from other Christian denominations .
Mormons have a different view of the Trinity , seeing Father , Son and Holy Spirit as three separate entities , not three in one .
They believe that a marriage performed in a Mormon temple is eternal — husband and wife remain together in the afterlife .
In a sermon only weeks before he was murdered by a lynch mob in 1844 , Joseph Smith taught that God was once a man and that people , if truly devout , can become like God .
Many other Christians think that is utterly heretical .
A few of the more aggressive evangelicals come to Salt Lake City during Mormon conferences to shout abuse at attendees and warn them that they are all going to Hell .
The Mormons ignore them .
The phrase " we want to publish your blog " has crept into the list of phrases you never expected to hear , just after " we want to option the movie rights to your blog . "
A friend of mine has been making a good living self - publishing books online , while other friends who used to earn a steady income writing computer books have had to find some way to keep food on the table .
Things are changing in the world of computer book publishing , that 's for sure .
Is the market for computer books in a slump ?
Dying ?
Already dead and it just has n't noticed yet ?
It depends on whom you talk to .
Right up front this has to be acknowledged :
If you want to know what the trends are in computer book publishing , you check with Tim O'Reilly .
Nobody is more tapped into the research on what 's moving and who 's moving it than Tim .
In his quarterly report on the state of the computer book market , Tim draws upon Bookscan 's weekly tallies of book sales , folds in various other statistical ingredients , then cooks the result into a palatable dish for public consumption .
Or actually Mike Hendrickson does that , since Tim turned the report over to him this year .
But you know Tim 's looking over his shoulder , studying the numbers and the colorful charts , perching in the leaf nodes of those treemaps like a statistical Julia Butterfly Hill .
Which is kind of strange because if you believe the legend , Tim already knows what 's hot before it 's hot .
It 's that O'Reilly radar .
I 'm not making this up ; you can read about it in back issues of Wired .
But Tim is such a professional that even though he knows the answers instinctively , he still does the research .
It 's from the O'Reilly analyses that you 'll learn things like :
Web Design and Development as a book category is surprisingly down .
There are a remarkable four Ubuntu titles in O'Reilly 's top 10 ten opsys books .
Microsoft Press is highly efficient , selling twice as many units per title as Pearson or Wiley .
It 's Dead , Jim
But what if you still have questions after you study every O'Reilly report and climbed every O'Reilly Treemap ?
Rude questions like :
Is computer book publishing finished ?
Do we really need 40 books on the same subject ?
Are computer books even necessary ?
And why do so many computer books suck ?
If these are the kind of questions that come to your mind when you think about computer book publishing , where do you go for answers ?
I do n't know where you go , but I went to Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt of The Pragmatic Bookshelf .
Thomas and Hunt see a dramatic shift in the center of power in publishing over the past five years .
" The power has moved relentlessly away from the publishers of information into the hands of the consumers of information , " Thomas says .
" And that 's exactly how it should be information will become free .
We see more and more of the world 's information moving online .
It is being created and maintained by communities of ( mostly ) volunteers , and being read for free by anyone who knows how to follow a hyperlink .
From blogs , online essays , and entire electronic books to vast resources such as Wikipedia , the world has changed forever .
At the same time , communities have formed to vet this information , winnowing the wheat from the chaff .
From simple mailing lists , to tumbleblogs , to sites such as anachaia and reddit , an interested reader is never short of recommendations . "
So , where does this leave the publisher ?
" Frankly , " Thomas says , " I think that publishing in its current form is dead . "
That 's a remarkable statement from a computer book publisher .
" Most publishers view themselves as a conduit for information , " Thomas says .
" They see their capital value as their list of current and past titles , authors as a resource to be mined in the creation of these assets , and their readers as simple consumers .
[ They ] live in an industry where the power comes traditionally from the ability to choose topics for books , and to distribute these paper books to consumers .
So we have publishers who see themselves as a machine for converting authors ' thoughts into paper books , a channel that is an incredibly inefficient distribution system , and booksellers who dislike taking risks .
And all of that worked in a world where publishers and distributors were an effective oligopoly . "
But the Internet has changed all that .
In this new world , Thomas says , " authors are free to create information for themselves a billion potential readers are just a few clicks away , and they no longer need publishers and distributors to get what they write into the hands of readers .
Services such as Lulu even allow these new authors to have their work printed as paper books .
Publishing has become an individual , not a corporate , act . "
But can computer book publishing really be dead ?
Would n't we have noticed ?
Description :
We present a new paper - based voting method with attractive security properties .
Not only can each voter verify that her vote is recorded as she intended , but she gets a “ receipt ” that she can take home that can be used later to verify that her vote is actually included in the final tally .
Her receipt , however , does not allow her to prove to anyone else how she voted .
Well , maybe .
Here ’s a situation where a video record came in handy :
Ouch .
The caption accompanying the video explains : Seems like it was a good idea for the motorcyclist to install the video camera .
Why not put them in automobiles etc ?
That would probably be a good idea , but I do n’t know if people will want to do it if it ’s required , say , by insurance companies or legislation — anything that looks like a black box where only Big Brother gets to access the data will be a tough sell .
But such concerns evaporate if individuals control their own tapes .
As video cameras become cheaper , more people are going to think ,
Why not have one in my car / front porch / living room ?
You never know when it will be useful .
: Reverse - Colorblind Test : Update , 13 March 2007 : First , thank you for stopping by .
You should read my blog entry about this test , which explains its background a little more , and also discusses some of the results people have communicated to me over email , since I first put this page online in April of 2001 .
It also explains that this test is only a proof - of - concept , and is not meant to be robustly diagnostic .
In other words , YMMV .
Enjoy !
And , please feel free to email me with your own experience of the test .
End Update Color blind is the name given to people who do not have a ' normal ' range of chromatic ( color ) contrast sensitivity .
There are several different kinds of color blindness , and not all are due to genetic variation .
The subjective experience of color vision is partially created by the retina measuring differences in the wavelengths of incident light .
That is , ' normal ' color vision is enabled by having essentially three relatively independent ' channels ' , each sensitive to a different distribution of wavelengths .
When , say , the red channel is stimulated relatively more than another , then we subjectively experience the color red , with the details being partially controlled by the relative intensity of the stimulation .
A fourth channel - your rods - is not used in this way , and is thus more sensitive to variations in lightness versus darkness ( luminosity ) .
( For a much more thorough explanation of how color vision operates , try here . )
Tests for color blindness ( such as the popular Ishihara test ( a fancy flash version is available here ) - the one where bubbles of diferent sizes and colors are used to conceal a number from color blind people ) are typically designed around ' confusion lines ' , which are basically colors that do n't differentially stimulate different color channels , and thus appear to be basically identical .
In April of 2001 , while discussing with a close friend of mine Nick Yee , who is red - green colorblind , the differences in our subjective visual experiences , we realized that color vision is not an unequivocal gain .
That is , in some situations , he could perceive variations in luminosity that I could not .
This difference got us to thinking whether we could design a " reverse " color blindness test - one that he could pass because he is color blind , and one that I would fail because I am not .
The hypothesis we worked from is that , under certain circumstances for a color - sighted person , the information the brain receives about color contrasts can overwhelm ( or otherwise discount ) the information it receives from luminosity contrast .
That is , we could distract color - sighted people with bright colors from noticing " hidden " information in subtle but systematic variations in luminosity .
This test is the result of that conversation .
Red Spectrum Gradient
This image contains both a simple red gradient , and a pattern .
colorblind_gradient.jpg
If you can see the pattern overlayed on the gradient , this suggests that you may be red - green color blind .
If you can't see it , you could try looking to either side of the image .
Outside of the fovea - i.e. , in your peripheral vision - there is a greater relative concentration of rods than cones , and this may increase your ability to distinguish variations in luminosity .
( For instance , ever notice that when looking up at the stars , there are some you can't see when you look dead - on , but which you can if you look slightly away ?
Your rods are so sensitive that they can basically detect single photons , but obviously color contrast requires more light than that ! )
Red Speckles
In this example , I created an image more reminiscent of the classic Ishihara plates .
Again , there is a pattern ( different from the previous one ) overlayed on the background speckles .
If the pattern is clear to you , then you may be red - green colorblind .
That is , if you ' fail ' this test , then you probably have the full range of color sensitivity that is attributed to ' normal ' people .
colorblind_speckle.jpg
' Answers ' for these images are on a separate page .
To make these , I tweaked the color contrast to make the overlayed patterns significantly more obvious .
If you ' failed ' the test , once you 've seen the answers , come back and look again .
It may be easier to pick out the subtle variations in luminosity now that you know what to look for .
And , I 'm always interested to hear about people 's subjective experiecnes with this test , so please feel free to email me directly about them !
( Over the years that this page has been online , I 've received about 100 personal testimonials , and while there are certainly some people who erroneously ' fail ' or ' pass ' the test , it seems to be otherwise pretty accurate . )
