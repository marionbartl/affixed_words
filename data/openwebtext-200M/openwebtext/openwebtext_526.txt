US Department Of Justice Has Hands Full Dealing With Sea Of 900 + Fraud Cases By By Can Tran Jul 2 , 2008 in Politics
The United States Department of Justice has its hands full as it deals with a decade long backlog of cases dealing with alleged fraud on the parts of contractors and pharmaceutical companies .
Yes , that ’s right .
The To make things worse , those charged with reviewing such cases do not have enough staff .
Those in the DOJ definitely have their hands tied .
In this sea of backlogged fraud cases , the total number goes over 900 .
However , the DOJ is not entirely at fault .
It could not keep pace with the spike in suits brought upon my whistle - blowers .
Yes , whistle - blowers are crucial in exposing fraud .
Without them , it would be far difficult to uncover fraud .
The main reason that lawmakers and nonprofits are giving their undivided attention is due to that a good number of such backlogged cases are linked with Iraq , Afghanistan , the increase of payouts in health - care , privatization of government functions , and so forth .
Yes , many of the cases have something to do with these issues .
Iraq , Afghanistan , and health care are major issues for the 2008 US Presidential Elections .
At this current rate , it might take over another decade to deal with all these cases .
This is if no cases are filed .
Cases filed in regards to alleged fraud have been in the triple digits .
These are high triple digit figures .
However , most get rejected by the government .
Still , those that are not rejected are more than enough .
1,000 cases should keep the Department of Justice busy for decades .
But , most of the cases share one or two common themes : sales of defective products or overcharging of government agencies .
In short , the alleged cases of fraud are attributed by companies screwing taxpayers out of billions .
In a nutshell , many of the cases backlogged have something to do with one company screw - job after another .
The government agencies have been screwed over and the United States military has been screwed over .
Being understaffed while having to deal with a bunch of fraud cases would not be a good mix .
Should the cases be successfully tried , whistle - blowers do get a slice of the cash pie .
That is provided if the cases are in the favor of the whistle - blowers .
Personally , I have mixed feelings about whistle - blowers getting cash settlements as a result of such cases .
On one hand , I think whistle - blowers should step forward because they ’re good people and not care about getting some hefty settlement at the end .
On the other hand , whistle - blowers are “ marked ” afterwards .
In regards to handling the cases , due to the backlog , it would take many years for the accepted cases to see the light of a courtroom .
A lot of things can happen over time .
Such things consist of : foggy memories , corporate restructuring , corporations dying out , certain people leaving corporations , loss of evidence , and so forth .
The DOJ certainly has a lot on its hands .
Fraud cases should be keeping the DOJ busy for quite awhile .
At the same time , the DOJ itself would be going through changes of structuring .
There are also other factors to be considered : there could be change of leadership within the DOJ , the DOJ itself could be restructured at least once or twice , several members will leave the DOJ , new members have to fill in those positions , new members would have to familiarize themselves with fraud cases , and many other things .
Sorting through the pile of backlogged cases will be long and tedious .
However , United States President George W. Bush should not be worried about the backlogging of fraud cases .
Bush leaves office in January of 2009 .
It will either be presumed Democratic nominee Senator Barack Obama of Illinois or presumed GOP nominee Senator John McCain of Arizona who will have to deal with such cases after this November .
While the members of the DOJ will change , the piles of unsettled cases of alleged fraud will still remain .
For those working in the DOJ , have fun settling every single one of those cases .
Unfortunately , dealing with such fraud cases will be painful for US taxpayers .
Yes , our tax dollars are used to hire such lawyers to deal with fraud cases .
2008 will be an extremely painful year for the United States Department of Justice .
It seems to be feeling pain from all different fronts .
There was the recent overturning of a ruling in regards to the 9/11 prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
And then there was a report not long ago revealing that the DOJ ’s hiring process was biased as applicants with liberal and / or Democratic backgrounds and connections were passed over for employment .
Now , here comes a new pain that the DOJ must deal with : fraud cases .
Yes , that ’s right .
The Department of Justice has to deal with a backlog of alleged fraud by both government contractors and drug companies .
So far , these cases have built up gradually within at least the last 10 years .
It has turned into a pile of cases that should keep the DOJ busy for quite awhile .
Over the last decade , it has seen several hundred new cases stacked onto the previous several hundred cases .
To make things worse , those charged with reviewing such cases do not have enough staff .
Those in the DOJ definitely have their hands tied .

It ’s likely that most people have never heard of Gaucho .
And no , it ’s not a South American cowboy .
I ’m talking about a pesticide .
There is increasing reason to believe that Gaucho and other members of a family of highly toxic chemicals -- neonicotinoids -- may be responsible for the deaths of billions of honeybees worldwide .
Some scientists believe that these pesticides , which are applied to seeds , travel systemically through the plant and leave residues that contaminate the pollen , resulting in bee death or paralysis .
The French refer to the effect as “ mad bee disease ” and in 1999 were the first to ban the use of these chemicals , which are currently only marketed by Bayer ( the aspirin people ) under the trade names Gaucho and Poncho .
Germany followed suit this year , and its agricultural research institute said it concluded that the poisoning of the bees was because of the rub - off of the pesticide clothianidin ( that ’s Pancho ) from corn seeds .
So why did the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2002 grant an “ emergency ” exemption allowing increased use of Gaucho -- typically invoked during a major infestation -- when only a few beetles were found in blueberries ?
Why did the agency also grant a “ conditional ” registration for its close relative , Pancho , allowing the chemical on the market with only partial testing ?
And why is the agency , hiding behind a curtain of “ trade secrets , ” still refusing to disclose whether the additional tests required of companies in such cases were conducted and , if so , with what results ?
Therein lies a tale .
Most pesticides , we ’re told , are safe .
So we add about 5 billion pounds a year of these deadly chemicals to our world , enough to encircle the planet if it were packaged in 100 - pound sacks .
Sure , they are regulated -- but badly -- under the antiquated Federal Insecticide , Fungicide and Rodenticide Act .
This law allows a chemical on the market unless it ’s proved to pose “ an unreasonable risk , ” far too weak a standard .

Gerard Eyries , a Bayer marketing manager , said in connection with the French action that “ imidacloprid [ that ’s Gaucho ] left a small residue in nectar and pollen , but there was no evidence of a link with the drop in the bee population . ”
Bayer also blamed seed makers and suggested that there may be “ nonchemical causes ” for this massive bee kill .
But Bayer may not be entirely objective here .
In 2006 , Gaucho sales topped $ 746 million .
Something is killing the bees , though .
Some scientists suspect a virus ; others mites , even cellphones .
( Bees are not known to use phones , though , having their own communications system -- a dance called the “ waggle . ” )
Here in the U.S. , the bee kill is a big problem .
Domesticated bees were brought to the U.S. on the Mayflower .
Today , they contribute at least $ 15 billion to the nation ’s agricultural economy .
For example , California ’s $ 2 - billion - a - year almond crop is completely dependent on honeybees from about 1.5 million hives for pollination .
This year , more than 2.4 million bee colonies -- 36 % of the total -- were lost in the U.S. , according to the Apiary Inspectors of America .
Some colonies collapsed in two days .
Part of the problem is how we farm .
Rather than rotating crops , farmers grow the same one each year .
This “ monoculture ” creates a breeding ground for pests .
Farmers then use chemicals that kill not only the target organism but other life forms as well -- like honeybees .
That this approach may now be coming back to bite big-production agriculture is not without some irony .
For decades the agriculture industry has been its beneficiary -- with farmworkers , consumers and local communities the victims .
But , actually , we ’re all in trouble .

No independent government testing is required before a pesticide is registered for use .
Large gaps in basic scientific knowledge about pesticides remain , including their environmental “ fate ” ( where they end up ) and their toxicity to humans and to wildlife .
A problem pesticide may be removed from the market only after a long process and full trial -- something that should be done before .
The Food Quality Protection
Act of 1996 improved control of residues in our food .
That did n’t help the bees .
Rachel Carson was vilified by an industry smear nearly 50 years ago , after the release of her book , “ Silent Spring . ”
“ If we were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson , ” said American Cyanamid , the maker of DDT , “ we would return to the Dark Ages ... insects , vermin and disease would once again inherit the Earth . ”
But , as Carson so eloquently put it in a CBS documentary in 1964 : “ Man ’s attitude toward nature is today critically important simply because we now have acquired a fateful power to alter and destroy nature .
But man is part of nature , and his war is inevitably a war against himself . ”
The score was authenticated last year A previously unknown piece of music by Mozart has been discovered at a library in western France .
Ulrich Leisinger , head of research at the International Mozarteum Foundation in Austria , said the single sheet of music was " really important " .
" His handwriting is absolutely clearly identifiable , " he added .
" There 's no doubt that this is an original piece handwritten by Mozart . "
The sheet was found among the archives by staff at a library in Nantes .
Mr Leisinger said the municipal Mediatheque library contacted his foundation to ask for help authenticating the work .
It 's a melody sketch so what 's missing is the harmony and the instrumentation , but you can make sense out of it
Ulrich Leisinger
The score appears to be for a " Credo in D major " .
There is a second piece which looked like a " first draft , in parts illegible , " said a library official .
It was part of the collection of Pierre - Antoine Laboucheroe , a 19th - century collector who donated his legacy to the city .
The score was catalogued as part of the library 's collection , but was later " entirely forgotten " about .
It was rediscovered by the library as it re-catalogued its archives , and authenticated by a researcher from the Mozarteum Foundation last year .
Mr Leisinger said there had been just 10 Mozart finds of such importance over the past 50 years .
If sold , the single sheet would likely fetch around $ 100,000 .
' Extremely rare '
Mr Leisinger said it was the " draft for a piece that Mozart did not work out , for whatever reason " .
" It 's a melody sketch so what 's missing is the harmony and the instrumentation , but you can make sense out of it , " he said .
" The tune is complete .
It 's only one part , and not the whole score with eight or twelve parts .
" One can really get a feeling of what Mozart meant , although we do not know how he would have orchestrated it . "
He added : " The fact that an entirely new sheet shows up is extremely rare . "

The headlines are about the broad polling reaction to Palin .
But the most fascinating part of the first Rasmussen poll on the matter is how those who are currently undecided in the election feel .
They , after all , are the votes both campaigns are trying to win over with their veep picks .
The key data is in the cross-tabs , which have been missed in some of the coverage so far .
On the critical question , " With Palin As Vice - Presidential Nominee , Are You More Or Less Likely To Vote For McCain , " there 's a striking result .
Among those already for McCain , 68 percent say it makes them more likely to vote for him ; only 6 percent say less ; and 23 percent said no impact .
Among those already for Obama , Palin made only 9 percent of them more likely to switch to McCain , 59 percent less likely , and 30 percent said it would make no difference .
But among the critical undecideds , the Palin pick made only 6 percent more likely to vote for McCain ; and it made 31 percent less likely to vote for him .
49 percent said it would have no impact , and 15 percent remained unsure .
More to the point : among undecideds , 59 percent said Palin was unready to be president .
Only 6 percent said she was .
If the first criterion for any job is whether you 're ready for it , this is a pretty major indictment of the first act of McCain 's presidential leadership .
One other striking finding .
If McCain thought he could present Palin as a moderate , he was wrong .
A whopping 69 percent view her as conservative ( 37 percent as very conservative ) , and only 13 percent see her as moderate .
From this first snap - shot ( and unsettled ) impression , Palin has helped McCain among Republicans , left Democrats unfazed , but moved the undecideds against him quite sharply .
I totally understand why .

In physics , quantum mechanics is the study of the relationship between quanta and elementary particles .
Among other relationships the valence shell electrons and photons are quantized .
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of physics with wide applications in both experimental and theoretical physics .
Quantum theory generalizes all classical theories , including mechanics , electromagnetism ( except general relativity ) , and provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena such as black body radiation and stable electron orbits .
The effects of quantum mechanics are typically not observable on macroscopic scales , but become evident at the atomic and subatomic level .

COLUMBIA , Mo. -
For only the second time in presidential debate history , a female nominee will take the stage to spar with a male opponent .
While Geraldine Ferraro broke new ground in 1984 , it has taken 24 years for another female to be included as part of a major party ticket .
On Thursday night , the nation will be watching as vice presidential candidates Sarah Palin and Joe Biden clash in the vice presidential debate .
A revealing study by a University of Missouri researcher has found that male and female candidates , when debating head - to - head , actually adopt each other 's traditional communication styles .
" In politics , the stereotypical ' masculine ' traits of being tough and ambitious , as well as having strong leadership and administrative skills , are more highly valued over the so - called ' feminine ' traits of being compassionate and family - oriented , and possessing strong people skills , " said Mitchell McKinney , associate professor of communication at MU , who conducted the study along with Mary Banwart , communication professor at the University of Kansas .
The study , published in the journal Communication Studies , examined candidates engaged in televised , mixed - gender campaign debates , which included U.S. Senate and gubernatorial debates .
McKinney found that female candidates were more likely to use so - called " masculine " communication strategies than their male counterparts .
Conversely , it was the male candidates who frequently adopted a " feminine style " in their debate responses .
According to McKinney , female candidates issued personal attacks of their male opponents in their debate responses 58 percent of the time , compared with male candidates who attacked their female opponents in 45 percent of their debate responses .
Female candidates were more likely to raise traditional " masculine " issues , such as crime , defense , taxes and budget issues , than male candidates and it was the female candidates who were more likely to tout their own experience and accomplishments .
" By being the more aggressive debater , shying away from the so - called ' feminine ' issues and adopting strategies that focus on their experience , these women are trying to overcome traditional notions that question a female candidate 's governing competence .
They also are challenging the stereotype that male candidates possess greater strength or political ability and have greater political experience , " McKinney said .
Male candidates were more likely to emphasize feminine traits , such as sensitivity and cooperation , in selling themselves .
Men were more likely to address so - called " feminine " issues , such as women 's issues , health care and education , than the female candidates .
" This study suggests that when female and male candidates meet face - to - face on the debate stage , both seem mindful of gendered stereotypes and respond with a strategy of gendered adaptiveness - with each adopting communication strategies and styles characteristically attributed to the opposite gender , " McKinney said .

I kind of tried both for a while and Python gave the better impression in every way , readability , ease of use , libraries , documentation , expressiveness etc .
But there are so many really enthusiastic posts about Ruby and while Python has a lot of users and is very popular and successful I rarely see anyone rave about it .
But maybe that just means it has gotten mainstream .
But anyway I like the Python philosophy that there should preferrably be one obvious way to do things .
While similar in most ways , there the languages differ .
So , what do you Rubyists like so much about Ruby ?
Especially what do you think Pythion lacks ?

The USB Lighter is a great electric gadget that is both hot and practical .
This used to be just a concept in the USB Drive Lighter but was actually made into a functional product that provides a 2 in 1 solution .
Although on the surface it seems it would be for smokers only , this electric gadget is too cool for anyone to pass up .
similar to the USB bottle opener , this provides the practicality received by a needed USB drive and a functional lighter in one gadget .
It has a storage capacity of 8GB , which is more than enough for most of your files , documents , music and videos to take on the go .
The USB connector slides out of the lighter for easy connecting , and an additional USB cable is provided for hard to reach places .
The USB lighter is refillable , made of metal , has an adjustable flame , and is a cool gadget to own and carry on a daily basis .
With the practicality and storage , this lighter is only $ 49.99 and can be found at ThinkGeek.com .
What does it mean to expand a function “ in powers of x - 1 ” ?

Copyright is not and never was intended to be a rod to punish people getting things for free .
There are many benefits to information and IP being shared freely with the rest of society .
We should not be too quick to outright dismiss this idea as many today do .

As determined by who ?
The people who want to get something without paying ?
@mhlaxp : You get a sold product without paying for it or being gifted , without permission of the owner .
Sounds a lot like theft to me .

Well if you ’re anywhere near downtown Denver during the Democratic National Convention , you probably are .
Over the past three weeks , the Denver Police Department has quietly rolled out an ultra - high - tech network of wireless cameras that have put much of the city center under 24 - hour observation –- or “ extreme video surveillance , ” according to the manufacturer , Maryland - based Avrio Group .
The system was paid for out of the $ 50 million in federal grant moey the city received for DNC security .
The view from 14th and Curtis .
What makes the Rapid Deployment Surveillance System different from traditional closed - circuit cameras is that there are no cables ; the images are sent through the air , digitally , in an elaborate internet - based “ mesh network . ”
This means the cameras can be put up and taken down quickly , allowing the system to monitor any number of locations , groups and events during a given period .
In Denver , the distinctive , white RD Pole Cameras can now be spotted attached to light poles , building roofs and parking garages around the city .
While similar to webcams with a wireless internet hook - up , these cameras can pivot and zoom , giving them the ability to read a license plate from 200 yards away .
For example , the newly - installed camera on the Greek Amphitheater in Civic Center Park , where many protest - related events will take place , could focus on an individual 300 feet across the park at Seal Fountain -- and read the title of a book they ’re carrying .
Not only are they the eyes of law enforcement , these cameras can actually gather intelligence data themselves .
The cameras can be equipped with sensors that recognize gunshots and triangulate with other cameras to find the location .
They can also detect illegally parked cars , detect abandoned bags or loiterers , and count people in a crowd .
In 2005 , the DPD did n’t even have a video surveillance program .
The next year they introduced the High Activity Location Observation ( HALO ) initiative that has since installed hundreds of CCTV cameras at schools , public buildings and street intersections across the city , using grants from the Department of Homeland Security and a program run by the retailer Target .
And in the run-up to the DNC , private property owners of office , retail and apartment buildings have installed hundreds of surveillance cameras of their own , citing fears of protests and riots .
Now , with the introduction of the Avrio wireless camera network , Denver has become one of the most heavily surveilled cities in the nation .
How many cameras does the city now have ?
No one knows .
The officers in charge of the HALO program , Lt. Ernie Martinez and Det. Chuck Boyles , have consistently declined to offer details on the system , citing security concerns .
When they asked vendors for bids earlier this year , they said they were seeking “ a 20 - camera wireless network ” in downtown Denver and near the Pepsi Center .
But Westword has taken photographs of more than 60 of the cameras throughout the city , including dozens in and around Civic Center Park .
In a report to City Council , officials disclosed that the contract with Avrio was $ 947,364 , quite a small amount for the number of cameras in the photographs .
A 60 - camera system that Avrio built for Buffalo , New York , earlier this year cost more than $ 3 million .
Avrio ’s local manager , Ed Thomas , a former cop and former City Councilman , was n’t able to offer particulars on the system .
“ I ’d like to but I ’ve been told all questions have to go through the police department . ”
Right now those officials are likely hunkered down in the several new “ war rooms ” the department has reportedly set up for the DNC , inside the police headquarters on 1331 Cherokee Street .
Live video surveillance are being watched on as many as a dozen newly purchased flat screen television monitors .
The surveillance feed also leads to the recently disclosed Multi-Agency Command Center at the Federal Center in Lakewood , where representatives of 62 agencies – CIA , FBI , ICE and ATF them -– can monitor the images from the ground , as well as satellite imagery of the city .
An intelligence - crunching “ Super Fusion ” center has also been opened in Centennial , south of Denver .
According to DPD spokesman Sonny Jackson , “ We get to keep all the cameras . ”
So while these federal command centers are only supposed to operate during the week of the DNC , Denver 's new wireless camera network is here to stay .

Advertisement A massive bomb blast has hit the Marriott Hotel in Pakistan 's capital , Islamabad , killing at least 40 people .
The hotel 's owner said the explosion occurred when a lorry , which was being checked by security staff and sniffer dogs blew up at the hotel 's entrance .
The blast created a 20 ft ( 6 m ) deep crater , and destroyed the entire front section of the hotel .
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack and vowed to " continue to fight terrorism and extremism " .
In a statement , he said : " Such dastardly acts cannot dent the government 's commitment to fight this menace . "

The explosion - a suspected suicide bombing - is thought to have been caused by more than a tonne of explosives and police are warning that the hotel could collapse .
The BBC 's defence and security correspondent , Rob Watson , says that the attack bears the hallmarks of al - Qaeda , given the scale , the target and what would appear to be the careful political timing involved .
The attack came just hours after the newly elected President Zardari had given his first speech to MPs , vowing not to allow Pakistan 's territory to be violated by terrorists or foreign powers fighting them .
Our correspondent says the attack is without doubt the most serious in the Pakistani capital to date and will spark fears about the country 's stability in the face of a growing Islamist insurgency .
Heavy security A huge area of the 315 - room hotel remained on fire hours after the explosion .
The BBC's Barbara Plett , at the scene , said the emergency services were struggling to reach the upper floors of the hotel , where more people were feared trapped .
At least 100 people have been injured in the attack , among them four British citizens as well as Saudi , German , Moroccan , Afghan and US nationals .
A hotel employee , Mohammad Sultan , said he was in the reception when something exploded , forcing him to the ground .
" I do n't understand what it was , but it was like the world is finished , " he said .
There are reports that at least 200 people were in the hotel 's restaurants at the time of the explosion , many breaking their Ramadan fast .
The Marriott is the most prestigious hotel in the capital , and is popular with foreigners and the Pakistani elite .
The hotel is located near government buildings and diplomatic missions , so security is tight , with guests and vehicles subject to checks .
The Marriott has previously been the target of militants .
Last year a suicide bomber killed himself and one other in an attack at the hotel .
Insurgency
In an interview with the BBC , Senator Enver Beg , from the Pakistan People 's Party , appealed to the international community for help in the struggle against terrorism .
" Pakistan is a frontline country in the war on terror .
We are , again , with suicide bombings which are taking place all over the country .
" Our economy is affected because of these terrorist activities .
And I think the international community has to come out and help Pakistan to fight against this terrorism , " he said .
Pakistan has been a key ally of the US in its " war on terror " US President George W Bush condemned the attack and said it was " a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by Pakistan , the United States , and all those who stand against violent extremism " .
He said the US would " assist Pakistan in confronting this threat and bringing the perpetrators to justice " .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband called the attack " disgraceful " and said it would reinforce Britain 's resolve to fight violent extremism with Pakistan .
Pakistan has been a key ally of the US in its " war on terror " , but relations have become strained over tactics .
In recent months Pakistan has voiced growing disquiet over US raids targeting militants in its territory , launched from neighbouring Afghanistan .
Al - Qaeda and Taleban militants based in Pakistan 's north - west tribal region have repeatedly carried out attacks across the border in Afghanistan .
Militants have also carried out waves of attacks in Pakistan in recent years .
Just over a year ago , Pakistani army commandos stormed Islamabad 's Red Mosque - also known as Lal Masjid - which had been taken over by pro-Taleban clerics .
The operation brought an end to the bloody siege .
But Islamist militants responded with a wave of suicide bombings around the country that killed around 1,000 people .

Multi -core processing is changing the way we write programs .
Modern computers come with multi-core or multiple processors , and modern applications no longer do just one thing at a time .
But all of this has left Java a little bit behind .
While languages like Erlang and Haskell , even other JVM languages like Scala , have powerful concurrency abstractions , concurrent programming in Java is still mostly based around the threading practices of way back in the time of applets .
Threading in Java has long been the domain of the brave or foolish , weaving a brittle and intricate web of manual synchronization between threads , or threads waiting on other threads to feed them work .
We all know the examples from old Java books where there might be a thread running in a loop , sleeping for a second , and waking up to check if work needs to be done .
This kind of implementation is still being taught to newcomers to the Java language .
And when they start writing their own applications in Java , they find that this approach does not scale .
Not along the axis of program complexity , nor the axis of the number of threads .
In a complex application or one with many threads , you may end up with a program that stops doing anything at all for long periods of time , or worse , hangs forever , while still consuming all the operating system resources that go with those threads .
Blocking vs. Nonblocking Concurrency
The new concurrency library in Java 5 help this situation a great deal .
At least some advancement has been made towards better concurrency abstractions .
But there are still pitfalls .
For instance , as we ’ve seen , the Future and Callable interfaces are really rather jolly useful , and they can take us a long way towards the kinds of things possible in those other languages .
But at the end of the day , something has to call Future. get ( ) , and that something will block unless the value is already available , until such time that it is .
This can result in deadlocks or starvation , as you may end up in a situation where all threads are blocking on Futures and none are available to advance your program forward .
This would be bad .
In fact , we could say that in a highly concurrent system , blocking on shared state is a catastrophic event .
The Java libraries are a veritable minefield of methods that , ultimately , block on shared memory monitors .
There ’s Thread.join ( ) , Future.get ( ) , BlockingQueue.take ( ) , and the list goes on .
But what if we could solve this problem with a simple abstraction ?
Could we solve the blocking problem once and re-use our solution for different situations ?
Let ’s see .
Instead of sleeping or blocking , what we really want is the ability for our code to say : “ When X happens , wake up a thread to execute me . ”
That is , in some sense we want threads to go on doing useful work , and have them be notified when an event happens that requires more work to be done .
For example , when Bob comes into my office and asks me for this month ’s TPS reports , he does n’t stand around and wait for them , nor does he check periodically to see if I have them done , and he certainly does n’t go to sleep to periodically wake up and poll me for them .
He will continue with his work ( or whatever it is he does all day ) , since I have instructions to send him those TPS reports as soon as they ’re ready .
We ’re independent and concurrent actors , so we do n’t wait on each other .
There is a model of computation , called the Actor Model , that works very much the same way .
This is the model employed in the design of Erlang , and it was a major motivator for languages like Simula and Scheme .
An implementation of Actors comes with the standard Scala library , and as it happens an implementation of it for Java has just been released as part of the 2.8 version of the Functional Java library .
You can read more about the actor model on your own , but I will explain in some detail how it works in Functional Java .
Algorithm + Strategy = Parallelism
The first thing to explain is Parallel Strategies .
I ’ve talked about them before , but I ’ll do so again here since they ’re important to what I ’m trying to demonstrate .
The idea of the Parallel Strategy is that we can capture a threading pattern , or some method of concurrency in general , in a separate abstraction called a Strategy , and write our concurrent programs independently of the particular threading pattern .
In Java terms , a Strategy < A > is a way of turning any Java expression , whose evaluated type is A , into a value of type A .
How this happens is implementation - specific , but we ’d like it to be concurrent .
First , we need a way of capturing the idea of an unevaluated A .
It ’s a bit like the idea behind Runnable , only that we can get a value out of it .
Java 5 has the Callable interface , which is really close to representing “ any expression ” , since we can create Callables anonymously , but its call ( ) method throws Exceptions , creating a kind of barrier for the programmer .
Instead , we ’ll use fj .
P1 <A> .
It ’s an abstract class with one abstract method : A _1 ( )
The Strategy class has an instance method called par ( P1 < A > ) .
This will evaluate the given P1 concurrently , immediately returning another P1 that can get the value once it ’s ready .
Behind the scenes , it actually creates a Callable , turns it into a Future , then returns a P1 that calls Future. get ( ) , but all of that is implementation detail .
Strategy comes with some static construction methods that implement basic threading patterns , and you can implement your own by passing a Future - valued function to the strategy ( F < P1 < A > , Future < A > > ) method .
You might be concerned that P1 ca n’t throw any checked exceptions .
This is by design .
You ’ll find that once you start working with concurrent effects , the value of checked exceptions goes out the window .
Besides , if our P1 did need to throw errors , we would use Lazy Error Handling and declare this in the P1's type .
Strategy + Effect = Actor
So now we have concurrent evaluation and parallel transformations .
But we ’re still ending up with objects that require us to call a blocking method to get their value .
The only way around that is to not return any values at all .
Instead , we ’re going to let our P1s have side - effects .
So instead of returning a P1 that lets us wait for the value , our P1s are now going to update a variable or send the value somewhere .
To model a P1 that does n’t return a useful value , I ’m going to use the Unit type .
It ’s another one of those trivial but useful classes .
The Unit type is part of Functional Java , and it ’s simply a type that only has one possible value .
It ’s a lot like the standard library ’s Void type , except Void is even further impoverished .
When you use this type , you ’re saying that the actual value is immaterial .
So to describe a P1 that does n’t return anything useful , we use the type P1 < Unit > .
We can also describe a transformation from some type T to Unit , with F< T , Unit > .
Functional Java comes with a more honest version of F< A , Unit > , which is Effect < A > .
It ’s more honest in the sense that it does n’t pretend to be a transformation , which properly should have no side - effects .
Effect < A > is explicit about having side - effects , which is what we intend for Actors .
It has one method that does n’t return a value at all : void e( A a ) .
We now have what we need to instantiate the Actor class .
Here ’s an example of how to create and use a simple actor :
Strategy < Unit > s = Strategy.simpleThreadStrategy ( ) ; Actor < String > a = Actor.actor(s , new Effect < String >( ) { public void e( String s ) { System .out.println(s ) ; } } ) ; a.act ( " Hello , actors ! " ) ;
The actor receives “ messages ” on its act method , and the Strategy serves as a kind of mailbox for it .
You will note that there ’s no dependency at all on any particular threading strategy or any part of the concurrency library by the Actor class .
The strategy could be sending our Effects to be evaluated by Threads , remote server farms , by ForkJoin tasks , or even by a Mechanical Turk .
An Actor With its Own Mailbox
The Actor class by itself does n’t yet quite achieve the kind of actors model you see implemented in Erlang or Scala .
The important difference is that the Actor above can process multiple “ messages ” simultaneously .
This solution , then , is more general , although if an actor such as the above mutates some state , we ’re likely to run into race conditions .
Not to worry , it ’s easy to construct the more specific case .
We just add a queue and ensure that only one message is processed at a time .
This construct is available as part of Functional Java , and it ’s called QueueActor .
Of course , the “ one thread at a time ” requirement is not implemented using any blocking or synchronization .
Instead , The QueueActor has two possible states –“ suspended ” or “ running ” –and , behind the scenes , this is enforced with an AtomicBoolean to keep it consistent in the face of concurrency .
If the actor is suspended when it receives a message , it becomes running and its Effect is immediately handed off to its Strategy .
If it ’s already running , then callers will leave a message on its queue .
The QueueActor 's Effect is a concurrent , threadless recursion ( i.e. it uses a Strategy rather than a Thread ) that completely empties the queue , then puts the QueueActor 's state back to “ suspended ” .
QueueActor puts some sanity into managing locally mutable state within an actor ’s Effect , since it ’s ensured that the state can only be mutated by one thread at a time .
It is guaranteed to act on its messages in some unspecified order , but is otherwise semantically equivalent to Actor .
The Obligatory Example
We now have a light - weight implementation of the actor model , in Java .
Do n’t believe it ?
Have a look at this implementation of the canonical Ping - Pong example ( imports omitted ) , and compare it to similar examples for Erlang and Scala .
First , a Ping actor that sends a number of pings to a given Pong actor , waiting for a pong reply each time before sending the next ping .
public class Ping { private final Pong pong ; private final Actor < Pong > ping ; private final Actor < Integer > cb ; private volatile int n ; public Ping ( final Strategy < Unit > s , final int i , final Pong pong , final int id , final Actor < Integer > callback ) { n = i ; this .pong = pong ; cb = callback ; ping = actor ( s , new Effect < Pong > ( ) { public void e( final Pong pong ) { n--; if ( n > 0 ) pong.act( Ping . this ) ; else // Done .
Notify caller .
cb.act ( id ) ; } } ) ; } // Commence pinging public P1 < Unit > start ( ) { return pong.act ( this ) ; } // Receive a pong public P1 < Unit > act ( final Pong p ) { return ping .act ( p ) ; } }
The Pong actor simply receives ping messages and responds .
public class Pong { private final Actor < Ping > p ; public Pong ( final Strategy < Unit > s ) { p = actor(s , new Effect < Ping > ( ) { public void e( final Ping m ) { m.act ( Pong .
this ) ; } } ) ; } //
Receive a ping public P1 < Unit > act ( final Ping ping ) { return p.act ( ping ) ; } }
And here ’s the main program that uses the Ping and Pong actors .
There ’s only one Pong actor that responds to any number of Ping actors pinging it concurrently .
There ’s also a further QueueActor that is contacted by each Ping actor once that Ping actor has done its work .
The example uses a thread pool to back its Strategy .
When all the Ping actors have sent all their pings and received all their pongs , the program is terminated by shutting down the thread pool .
public class PingPong { private final int actors ; private final int pings ; private final Strategy < Unit > s ; private final Actor < Integer > callback ; private volatile int done ; public PingPong ( final ExecutorService pool , final int actors , final int pings ) { this .actors = actors ; this .pings = pings ; s = Strategy.executorStrategy( pool ) ; //
This actor gives feedback to the user that work is being done // and also terminates the program when all work has been completed .
callback = QueueActor.queueActor ( s , new Effect < Integer >( ) { public void e( final Integer i ) { done ++ ; if ( done >= actors ) { System .out.println (
" All done . " ) ; pool.shutdown ( ) ; } else if ( actors < 10 || done % ( actors / 10 ) == 0 ) System .out.
println ( MessageFormat . format ( " {0} actors done ( {1} total pongs ) . " , done , pings * done ) ) ; } } ) .asActor ( ) ; } public static void main ( final String [ ] args ) { final int actors = Integer .parseInt ( args [ 0 ] ) ; final int pings = Integer .parseInt ( args [ 1 ] ) ; final int threads =
Integer .parseInt( args [ 2 ] ) ; new PingPong ( Executors .newFixedThreadPool( threads ) , actors , pings ) . start ( ) ; } public void start ( ) { //
We will use one Pong actor ... final Pong pong = new Pong(s ) ; // ... and an awful lot of Ping actors .
for ( int i = 1 ; i <= actors ; i++) { new Ping (s , pings , pong , i , callback ) . start ( ) ; if ( actors < 10 || i % ( actors / 10 ) == 0 ) System .out.println ( MessageFormat .format( " {0} actors started . " , i ) ) ; } } }
What follows is an example run of this Java program , with a million concurrent Ping actors pinging 7 times each .
Each actor takes about 300 bytes of memory , so we need a sizable heap for one million of them , but 19 real Java Threads handle this quite nicely on my 8 - core machine .

As you see , these simple tools , built on basic components of the Java 5 concurrency library , paired with powerful abstractions from programming in functional style , makes it seem like we have millions of tasks running concurrently .
We get a virtually unbounded degree of concurrency while never seeing any locks nor performing any blocking calls .
The number of concurrent tasks is limited only by the size of your heap .
Again , everything you see here , and more , has been released just recently as part of the Functional Java library .

" It 's the strangest thing — I can't connect to the wireless anymore .
I can still use the Microsoft but not the email . "
The Microsoft was a key phrase that let Jay L. know that the woman on the line was n't exactly what you 'd call a power user .
" I 'll be happy to help .
First , can you tell me what router you 're connecting to ?
" ... "
" Miss ? "
" I 'm not having a problem with anything other than the wireless . "
" Yes , I 'm sorry , " Jay began .
She was being perfectly polite , which is more than he could say for most customers with internet issues , so he was careful to avoid " talking down " to her .
" Does the computer say anything , or is it just not working when you try to use the internet ? "
" It 's asking me for a password .
It 's never asked for a password before ! "
Jay walked her through some troubleshooting steps and learned that it was asking for a WEP key , though the network name was the same .
She 'd changed ISPs almost two months ago , but did n't have any problems for the first month and a half .
Perhaps she had a neighbor with the same SSID on the same channel ?
If you 've ever lived in a crowded apartment building you 've seen your share of default SSIDs : linksys , wireless , wlan , 2 wire ...
Or , if you 've ever lived near Alex , " alexsprivatenetworkbiotch . "
After learning that it was an ADSL line , Jay asked one of the stock questions .
" What devices do you have plugged into your phone lines ? "
" Phones , " she said before giggling .
" What else would I use a phone line for ? "
" Wait , you do n't have any little white box , a little gray box , or a little black box plugged into any of the jacks ? "
" No ... "
" Nothing with a little antenna sticking out of it ?
Did n't your internet provider send you anything when you signed up with them ? "
" Oh ! Hang on ! "
Jay waited for a minute or two while he heard the sounds of cupboards opening , closets being searched , and drawers being rifled through .
" OK , I found it !
This says ' ADSL Router ' on it .
Is that what you mean ? "
The woman was n't able to find any manufacturer names on it , but was kind enough to give Jay all the information he needed .
When he asked how many ports were on the back of it , she asked if she should remove the shrink wrap to see .
" Yes , please . "
It seems that contrary to popular methods of router use , she 'd chosen not to connect any cables to hers .
With the router having been forgotten in a random closet , Jay realized that she'd been leeching her neighbor 's connection all along , which made sense because the SSID ( Norris ) did n't match her last name .
For over two years she 'd been connected to someone else 's unsecured network — and to top it all off , she had n't used a single byte of the bandwidth she 'd been paying for that whole time .
She 'd be any ISP 's dream customer .

Send me a postcard , drop me a line ,
Stating point of view .
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely , Wasting Away .
 the Beatles , “ When I ’m 64 ”
I set foot , so to speak , on this planet on July 20 , 1944 , not perhaps the best day of the century .
It was , in fact , the day of the failed German officers ’ plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler .
My mother was a cartoonist .
She was known in those years as “ New York ’s girl caricaturist , ” or so she ’s called in a newspaper ad I still have , part of a war - bond drive in which your sizeable bond purchase was to buy her sketch of you .
She had , sometime in the months before my birth , traveled by train , alone , the breadth of a mobilized but still peaceable American continent to visit Hollywood on assignment for some magazine to sketch the stars .
I still have , on my wall , a photo of her in that year on the “ deck ” of a “ pirate ship ” on a Hollywood lot drawing one of those gloriously handsome matinee idols .
Since I was then inside her , this is not exactly part of my memory bank .
But that photo does tell me that , like him , she , too , was worth a sketch .
Certainly , it was appropriate that she drew the card announcing my birth .
There I am in that announcement , barely born and already caricatured , a boy baby in nothing but diapers  except that , on my head , I ’m wearing my father ’s dress military hat , the one I still have in the back of my closet , and , of course , I ’m saluting .
“ A Big Hello  From Thomas Moore Engelhardt , ” the card says .
And thus was I officially recorded entering a world at war .
By then , my father , a major in the U.S. Army Air Corps and operations officer for the 1st Air Commando Group in Burma , had , I believe , been reassigned to the Pentagon .
Normally a voluble man , for the rest of his life he remained remarkably silent on his wartime experiences .
I was , in other words , the late child of a late marriage .
My father , who , just after Pearl Harbor , at age 35 , volunteered for the military , was the sort of figure that the  on average  26 - year - old American soldiers of World War II would have referred to as “ pops . ”
He , like my mother , departed this planet decades ago , and I ’m still here .
So think of this as ? what ?
No longer , obviously , a big hello from Thomas Moore Engelhardt , nor  quite yet  a modest farewell , but perhaps a moderately late report from the one - man commission of me on the world of peace and war I ’ve passed through since that first salute .
On Imagining Myself as Burnt Toast
Precisely what do I mean to say now that I ’m just a couple of weeks into my 65th year on this planet ?
Let me start this way :
If , on the evening of October 22 , 1962 , you had told me that , in 2008 , America ’s most formidable enemy would be Iran , I would have danced a jig .
Well , maybe not a jig , but I ’ll tell you this : I would have been flabbergasted .
On that October evening , President John F. Kennedy went before the nation 
I heard him on radio  to tell us all that Soviet missile sites were just then being prepared on the island of Cuba with “ a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere . ”
It was , he said , a “ secret , swift and extraordinary buildup of communist missiles  in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the United States and the nations of the Western Hemisphere . ”
When fully operational , those nuclear - tipped weapons would reach “ as far north as Hudson Bay , Canada , and as far south as Lima , Peru . ”
I certainly knew what Hudson Bay , far to the north , meant for me .
“ It shall be the policy of this nation , ” Kennedy added ominously , “ to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack on the United States , requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union . ”
And he ended , in part , this way : “ My fellow citizens : let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out .
No one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred ? ”
No one could mistake the looming threat : Global nuclear war .
Few of us listeners had seen the highly classified 1960 SIOP ( Single Integrated Operational Plan ) in which the U.S. military had made its preparations for a massive first strike of 3,200 nuclear weapons against the communist world .
It was supposed to take out at least 130 cities , with estimated casualties approaching 300 million , but , even without access to that SIOP , we  I  knew well enough what might be coming .
After all , I had seen versions of it , perfectly unclassified , in the movies , even if the power to destroy on a planetary scale was transposed to alien worlds , as in that science fiction blockbuster of 1955 “ This Island Earth , ” or imputed to strange alien rays , or rampaging radioactive monsters .
Now , here it was in real life , my life , without an obvious director , and the special effects were likely to be me , dead .
It was the single moment in my life  which tells you much about the life of an American who did n’t go to war in some distant land  when I truly imagined myself as prospective burnt toast .
I really believed that I might not make it out of the week , and keep in mind , I was then a freshman in college , just 18 years old and still wondering when life was slated to begin .
Between 1939 and 2008 , across much of the world , few people could claim to have escaped quite so lightly , not in that near three - quarters of a century in which significant portions of the world were laid low .
Had you , a seer that terrifying night , whispered in my ear the news about our enemies still distant decades away , the Iranians , the… are you kidding ?…
Iraqis , or a bunch of fanatics in the backlands of Afghanistan and a tribal borderland of Pakistan … well , it ’s a sentence that would , at the time , have been hard to finish .
Death from Waziristan ?
I do n’t think so .
Truly , that night , if I had been convinced that this was “ my ” future  that , in fact , I would have a future 
I might have dropped to my knees in front of that radio from which Kennedy ’s distinctive voice was emerging and thanked my lucky stars ; or perhaps  and this probably better fits the public stance of an awkward , self - conscious 18 - year - old  I would have laughed out loud at the obvious absurdity of it all .
( “ The absurd ” was then a major category in my life . )
Fanatics from Afghanistan ?
Please ?
That we ’re here now , that the world was n’t burnt to a crisp in the long superpower standoff of the Cold War , well , that still seems little short of a miracle to me , a surprise of history that offers hope ? of a sort .
The question , of course , is : Why , with this in mind , do n’t I feel better , more hopeful , now ?
After all , if offered as a plot to sci - fi movie directors of that long - gone era  perfectly willing to populate Los Angeles with giant , mutated , screeching ants ( Them ! ) , the Arctic with “ The Thing From Another World , ” and Washington D.C. with an alien and his mighty robot , capable of melting tanks or destroying the planet ( “ Klaatu barada nikto ! ” )  our present would surely have been judged too improbable for the screen .
They would n’t have touched it with a ten - foot pole , and yet that ’s what actually came about  and the planet , a prospective cinder ( along with us prospective cinderettes ) is , remarkably enough , still here .
Or to put this in a smaller , grimmer way , consider the fate of the American military base at Guantanamo  an extra-special symbol of that “ special and historical relationship ” mentioned by Kennedy between the small island of Cuba and its giant “ neighbor ” to the northwest .
In that address to the nation in 1962 , the president announced that he was reinforcing the base , even as he was evacuating dependents from it .
And yet , like me in my 65th year , it , too , survived the Cuban Missile Crisis unscathed .
Some four decades later , in fact , it was still in such a special and historical relationship with Cuba that the Bush administration was able to use it to publicly establish all its new categories of off - shore injustice  its global mini-gulag of secret prisons , its public policies of torture , detention without charges , disappearance , you name it .
None of which , by the way , would the same set of directors have touched with the same pole .
Back in the 1950s , only Nazis , members of the Japanese imperial Army , and KGB agents could publicly relish torture on screen .
The FOX TV show “ 24 ” is distinctly an artifact of our moment .
A Paroxysm of Destruction Only a Few Miles Wide
Of course , back in 1962 , even before Kennedy spoke , I could no more have imagined myself 64 than I could have imagined living through “ World War IV ”  as one set of neocons loved to call the President ’s Global War on Terror  a “ war ” to be fought mainly against thousands of Islamist fanatics scattered around the planet and an “ axis of evil ” consisting of three relatively weak regional powers .
I certainly expected bigger , far worse things .
And little wonder :
When it came to war , the full weight of the history of most of the last century pointed exponentially in the direction of a cataclysm with few or no survivors .
From my teen years , I was , you might say , of the Tom Lehrer school of life ( as in the lyrics from his 1959 song , “ We Will All Go Together When We Go ” )  and I was hardly alone :
We will all fry together when we fry .
We ’ll be french fried potatoes by and by .
There will be no more misery
When the world is our rotisserie .
Yes , we will all fry together when we fry ?
And we ’ll all bake together when we bake ,
They ’ll be nobody present at the wake .
With complete participation
In that grand incineration ,
Nearly three billion hunks of well - done steak .
I was born , after all , just a year and a few weeks before the United States atomically incinerated Hiroshima and then followed up by atomically obliterating the city of Nagasaki , and World War II ended .
Victory arrived , but amid scenes of planetary carnage , genocide , and devastation on a scale and over an expanse previously unimaginable .
In these last years , the Bush administration has regularly invoked the glories of the American role in World War II and of the occupations of Germany and Japan that followed .
Even before then , Americans had been experiencing something like a “ greatest generation ” fest ( complete with bestselling books , a blockbuster movie , and two multi- part greatest - gen TV mini- series ) .
From the point of view of the United States , however , World War II was mainly a “ world ” war in the world that it mobilized , not in the swath of the planet it turned into a charnel house of destruction .
After all , the United States ( along with the rest of the “ New World ” ) was left essentially untouched by both “ world ” wars .
North Africa , the Middle East , and New Guinea all suffered incomparably more damage .
Other than a single attack on the American fleet at Hawaii , thousands of miles from the U.S. mainland , on December 7 , 1941 , the brief Japanese occupation of a couple of tiny Aleutian islands off Alaska , a U - boat war off its coasts , and small numbers of balloon fire bombs that drifted from Japan over the American west , this continent remained peaceable and quite traversable by a 35 - year - old theatrical caricaturist in the midst of wartime .
For Americans , I doubt that the real import of that phrase World War  of the way the industrial machinery of complete devastation enveloped much of the planet in the course of the last century  ever quite came home .
There had , of course , been world , or near - world , or “ known world ” wars in the past , even if not thought of that way .
The Mongols , after all , had left the steppes of northeastern Asia and conquered China , only being turned back from Japan by the first kamikaze ( “ divine wind ” ) attacks in history , typhoons which repelled the Mongol fleet in 1274 and again in 1281 .
Mongol horsemen , however , made their way west across the Eurasian continent , conquering lands and wreaking havoc , reaching the very edge of Europe while , in 1258 , sacking and burning Baghdad .
( It would n’t happen again until 2003 . )
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , the British and French fought something closer to a “ world war , ” serial wars actually in and around Europe , in North Africa , in their New World colonies and even as far away as India , as well as at sea wherever their ships ran across one another .
Still , while war may have been globalizing , it remained , essentially , a locally or regionally focused affair .
And , of course , in the decades before World War I , it was largely fought on the global peripheries by European powers testing out , piecemeal , the rudimentary industrial technology of mass slaughter  the machine gun , the airplane , poison gas , the concentration camp  on no one more significant than benighted “ natives ” in places like Iraq , the Sudan , or German Southwest Africa .
Those locals  and the means by which they died  were hardly worthy of notice until , in 1914 , Europeans suddenly , unbelievably , began killing other Europeans by similar means and in staggering numbers , while bringing war into a new era of destruction .
It was indeed a global moment .
While the American Civil War had offered a preview of war , industrial - style , including trench warfare and the use of massed firepower , World War I offered the first full - scale demonstration of what industrial warfare meant in the heartlands of advanced civilization .
The machine gun , the airplane , and poison gas arrived from their testing grounds in the colonies to decimate a generation of European youth , while the tank , wheeled into action in 1916 , signaled a new world of rapid arms advances to come .
Nonetheless , that war  even as it touched the Middle East , Africa , and Asia  was n’t quite imagined as a “ world war ” while still ongoing .
At the time , it was known as the Great War .
Though parts of Tsarist Russia were devastated , the most essential , signature style of destruction was anything but worldwide .
It was focused  like a lens on kindling  on a strip of land that stretched from the Swiss border to the Atlantic Ocean , running largely through France , and most of the time not more than a few miles wide .
There , on “ the Western front , ” for four unbelievable years , opposing armies fought  to appropriate an American term from the Vietnam War  a “ meat grinder ” of a war of a kind never seen before .
“ Fighting , ” though , hardly covered the event .
It was a paroxysm of death and destruction .
That modest expanse of land was bombarded by many millions of shells , torn up , and thoroughly devastated .
Every thing built on , or growing upon it , was leveled , and , in the process , millions of young men  many tens of thousands on single days of “ trench warfare ”  were mercilessly slaughtered .
After those four unbearably long years , the Great War ended in 1918 with a whimper and in a bitter peace in the West , while , in the East , amid civil war , the Bolsheviks came to power .
The semi-peace that followed turned out to be little more than a two - decade armistice between bloodlettings .
We ’re talking here , of course , about “ the war to end all wars . ”
If only .
World War II ( or the ever stronger suspicion that it would come ) retrospectively put that “ I ” on the Great War and turned it into the First World War .
Twenty years later , when “ II ” arrived , the world was industrially and scientifically prepared for new levels of destruction .
That war might , in a sense , be imagined as the extended paroxysm of violence on the Western front scientifically intensified  after all , air power had , by then , begun to come into its own  so that the sort of scorched - earth destruction on that strip of trench - land on the Western Front could now be imposed on whole countries ( Japan ) , whole continents ( Europe ) , almost inconceivable expanses of space ( all of Russia from Moscow to the Polish border where , by 1945 , next to nothing would remain standing ) .
Where there had once been “ civilization , ” after the second global spasm of sustained violence little would be left but bodies , rubble , and human scarecrows striving to survive in the wreckage .
With the Nazi organization of the Holocaust , even genocide would be industrialized and the poison gas of the previous World War would be put to far more efficient use .
This was , of course , a form of “ globalization , ” though its true nature is seldom much considered when Americans highlight the experiences of that greatest generation .
And no wonder .
Except for those soldiers fighting and dying abroad , it simply was n’t experienced by Americans .
It ’s hard to believe now that , in 1945 , the European civilization that had experienced a proud peace from 1871 - 1914 while dominating two - thirds of the planet lay in utter ruins ; that it had become a site of genocide , its cities reduced to rubble , its fields laid waste , its lands littered with civilian dead , its streets flooded by refugees : a description that in recent times would be recognizable only of a place like Chechnya or perhaps Sierra Leone .
Of course , it was n’t the First or Second , but the Third “ World War ” that took up almost the first half - century of my own life , and that , early on , seemed to be coming to culmination in the Cuban Missile Crisis .
Had the logic of the previous wars been followed , a mere two decades after the “ global , ” but still somewhat limited , devastation of World War II , war ’s destruction would have been exponentially upped once again .
In that brief span , the technology  in the form of A - and H - bombs , and the air fleets to go with them , and of nuclear - tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles  was already in place to transform the whole planet into a version of those few miles of the Western front , 1914 - 1918 .
After a nuclear exchange between the superpowers , much of the world could well have been burnt to a crisp , many hundreds of millions or even billions of people destroyed , and  we now know  a global winter induced that might conceivably have sent us in the direction of the dinosaurs .
The logic of war ’s developing machinery seemed to be leading inexorably in just that direction .
Otherwise , how do you explain the way the United States and the Soviet Union , long after both superpowers had the ability to destroy all human life on Planet Earth , simply could not stop upgrading and adding to their nuclear arsenals until the U.S. had about 30,000 weapons sometime in the mid-1960s , and Soviets about 40,000 in the 1980s .
It was as if the two powers were preparing for the destruction of many planets .
Such a war would have given the fullest meaning to “ world ” and no ocean , no line of defenses , would have left any continent , any place , out of the mix .
This is what World War III , whose name would have had to be given prospectively , might have meant ( and , of course , could still mean ) .
Or think of the development of “ world war ” over the twentieth century another way .
It was but a generation , no more , from the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk to the 1,000 - bomber raid .
In 1903 , one fragile plane flies 120 feet .
In 1911 , an Italian lieutenant in another only slightly less fragile plane , still seeming to defy some primordial law , drops a bomb on an oasis in North Africa .
In 1944 and 1945 , those 1,000 plane air armadas take off to devastate German and Japanese cities .
On August 6 , 1945 , all the power of those armadas was compacted into the belly of a lone B - 29 , the Enola Gay , which dropped its single bomb on Hiroshima , destroying the city and many of its inhabitants .
All this , again , took place in little more than a single generation .
In fact , Paul Tibbets , who piloted the Enola Gay , was born only 12 years after the first rudimentary plane took to the air .
And only seven years after Japan surrendered , the first H - bomb was tested , a weapon whose raw destructive power made the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima look like a mere bagatelle .
Admittedly , traces of humanity remained everywhere amid the carnage .
After all , the plane that carried that first bomb was named after Tibbets ’s mother , and the bomb itself dubbed “ Little Boy , ” as if this were a birthing experience .
The name of the second plane , Bockscar , was nothing but a joke based on similarity of the name of its pilot , Frederick Bock , who did n’t even fly it that day , and a railroad “ boxcar . ”
But events seemed to be pushing humanity toward the inhuman , toward transformation of the planet into a vast Death Camp , toward developments which no words , not even “ world war , ” seemed to capture .
Entering the Age of Denial
It was , of course , this world of war from which , in 1945 , the United States emerged triumphant .
The Great Depression of the 1930s would , despite wartime fears to the contrary , not reappear .
On a planet many of whose great cities were now largely rubble , a world of refugee camps and privation , a world destroyed ( to steal the title of a book on the dropping of the atomic bomb ) , the U.S. was untouched .
The world war had , in fact , leveled all its rivals and made the U.S. a powerhouse of economic expansion .
That war and the atomic bomb had somehow ushered in a golden age of abundance and consumerism .
All the deferred dreams and desires of depression and wartime America  the washing machine , the TV set , the toaster , the automobile , the suburban house , you name it  were suddenly available to significant numbers of Americans .
The U.S. military began to demobilize and the former troops returned not to rubble , but to new tract homes and G.I. Bill educations .
The taste of ashes may have been in global mouths , but the taste of nectar ( or , at least , Coca Cola ) was in American ones .
And yet all of this was shadowed by our own “ victory weapon , ” by the dark train of thought that led quickly to scenarios of our own destruction in newspapers and magazines , on the radio , in movies , and on TV ( think , “ The Twilight Zone ” ) , as well as in a spate of novels that took readers beyond the end of the world and into landscapes involving irradiated , hiroshimated futures filled with “ mutants ” and survivalists .
The young , with their own pocket money to spend just as they pleased for the first time in history  teens on the verge of becoming “ trend setters ”  found themselves plunged into a mordant , yet strangely thrilling world , as I ’ve written elsewhere , of “ triumphalist despair . ”
At the economic and governmental level , the 24/7 world of sunny consumerism increasingly merged with the 24/7 world of dark atomic alerts , of ever vigilant armadas of nuclear - armed planes ready to take off on a moment ’s notice to obliterate the Soviets .
After all , the peaceable giants of consumer production now doubled as the militarized giants of weapons production .
A military Keynesianism drove the U.S. economy toward a form of consumerism in which desire for the ever larger car and missile , electric range and tank , television console and atomic submarine was wedded in single corporate entities .
The companies  General Electric , General Motors , and Westinghouse , among others  producing the icons of the American home were also major contractors developing the weapons systems ushering the Pentagon into its own age of abundance .
In the 1950s , then , it seemed perfectly natural for Charles Wilson , president of General Motors , to become secretary of defense in the Eisenhower administration , just as retiring generals and admirals found it natural to move into the employ of corporations they had only recently employed on the government ’s behalf .
Washington , headquarters of global abundance , was also transformed into a planetary military headquarters .
By 1957 , 200 generals and admirals as well as 1,300 colonels or naval officers of similar rank , retired or on leave , worked for civilian agencies , and military funding spilled over into a Congress that redirected its largesse to districts nationwide .
Think of all this as the beginning not so much of the American ( half ) Century , but of an American Age of Denial that lasted until ?
well , I think we can actually date it ?
until September 11 , 2001 , the day that “ changed everything . ”
Okay , perhaps not “ everything , ” but , by now , it ’s far clearer just what the attacks of that day , the collapse of those towers , the murder of thousands , did change  and of just how terrible , how craven but , given our previous history , how unsurprising the response to it actually was .
Those dates  1945 - 2001  56 years in which life was organized , to a significant degree , to safeguard Americans from an “ atomic Pearl Harbor , ” from the thought that two great oceans were no longer protection enough for this continent , that the United States was now part of a world capable of being laid low .
In those years , the sun of good fortune shone steadily on the U.S. of A. , even as American newspapers , just weeks after Hiroshima , began drawing concentric circles of destruction around American cities and imagining their future in ruins .
Think of this as the shadow story of that era , the gnawing anxiety at the edge of abundance , like those memento mori skulls carefully placed amid cornucopias in seventeenth - century Dutch still - life paintings .
In those decades , the “ arms race ” never abated , not even long after both superpowers had a superabundant ability to take each other out .
World - ending weaponry was being constantly “ perfected ”  MIRVed , put on rails , divided into land , sea , and air “ triads , ” and , of course , made ever more powerful and accurate .
Nonetheless , Americans , to take Herman Kahn ’s famous phrase , preferred most of the time not to think too much about “ the unthinkable ”  and what it meant for them .
As the 1980s began , however , in a surge of revulsion at decades of denial , a vast anti-nuclear movement briefly arose  in 1982 , three - quarters of a million people marched against such weaponry in New York City  and President Ronald Reagan responded with his lucrative ( for the weapons industry ) fantasy scheme of lofting an “ impermeable shield ” against nuclear weapons into space , his “ Star Wars ” program .
And then , in an almost - moment as startling as it was unexpected , in 1986 , in Reykjavik , Iceland , Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev almost made such a fantasy come true , not in space , but right here on planet Earth .
They came to the very “ brink ”  to use a nuclear - crisis term of the time  of a genuine program to move decisively down the path to the abolition of such weapons .
It was , in some ways , the most hopeful almost - moment of a terrible century and , of course , it failed .
Thanks largely , however , to one man , Gorbachev , who consciously chose a path of non-violence , after four decades of nuclear standoff in a fully garrisoned MAD ( mutually assured destruction ) world  and to the amazement , even disbelief , of official Washington  the USSR simply disappeared , and almost totally peaceably at that .
You could measure the era of denial up to that moment both by the level of official resistance to recognizing this obvious fact and by the audible sigh of relief in this country .
Finally , it was all over .
It was , of course , called “ victory , ” though it would prove anything but .
And only then did the MADness really began .
Though there was , in the U.S. , modest muttering about a “ peace dividend , ” the idea of “ peace ” never really caught hold .
The thousands of weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal , which had seemingly lost their purpose and whose existence should have been an embarrassing reminder of the Age of Denial , were simply pushed further into the shadows and largely ignored or forgotten .
Initially assigned no other tasks , and without the slightest hiccup of protest against them , they were placed in a kind of strategic limbo and , like the mad woman in the attic , went unmentioned for years .
In the meantime , it was clear by century ’s end that the “ peace dividend ” would go largely to the Pentagon .
At the very moment when , without the Soviet Union , the U.S. might have accepted its own long - term vulnerability and begun working toward a world in which destruction was less obviously on the agenda , the U.S. government instead embarked , like the Greatest of Great Powers ( the “ new Rome , ” the “ new Britain ” ) , on a series of neocolonial wars on the peripheries .
It began building up a constellation of new military bases in and around the oil heartlands of the planet , while reinforcing a military and technological might meant to brook no future opponents .
Orwell ’s famous phrase from his novel 1984 , “ war is peace , ” was operative well before the second Bush administration entered office .
Call this a Mr. Spock moment , one where you just wanted to say “ illogical . ”
With only one superpower left , the American Age of Denial did n’t dissipate .
It only deepened and any serious assessment of the real planet we were all living on was carefully avoided .
In these years , the world was essentially declared to be “ flat ” and , on that “ level playing field , ” it was , we were told , gloriously globalizing .
This official Age of Globalization  you could n’t look anywhere , it seemed , and not see that word  was proclaimed another fabulously sunny era of wonder and abundance .
Everyone on the planet would now wear Air Jordan sneakers and Mickey Mouse T - shirts , eat under the Golden Arches , and be bombarded with “ information ” ?
Hurrah !
News was circling the planet almost instantaneously in this self - proclaimed new Age of Information .
( Oh yes , there were many new and glorious “ ages ” in that brief historical span of self - celebration . )
But with the Soviet Union in the trash bin of history  forget that Russia , about to become a major energy power , still held onto its nuclear forces  and the planet , including the former Soviet territories in Eastern Europe and Central Asia open to “ globalizing ” penetration , few bothered to mention that other nexus of forces which had globalized in the previous century : the forces of planetary destruction .
And Americans ?
Do n’t think that George W. Bush was the first to urge us to “ sacrifice ” by spending our money and visiting Disney World .
That was the story of the 1990s and it represented the deepest of all denials , a complete shading of the eyes from any reasonably possible future .
If the world was flat , then why should n’t we drive blissfully right off its edge ?
The SUV , the subprime mortgage , the McMansion in the distant suburb , the 100 - mile commute to work ?
you name it , we did it .
We paid the price , so to speak .
And while we were burning oil and spending money we often did n’t have , and at prodigious rates , “ globalization ” was slowly making its way to the impoverished backlands of Afghanistan .
A Fierce Rearguard Action for Denial
This , of course , brings us almost to our own moment .
To the neocons , putting on their pith helmets and planning their Project for a New American Century ( meant to be just like the old nineteenth century , only larger , better , and all - American ) , the only force that really mattered in the world was the American military , which would rule the day , and the Bush administration , initially made up of so many of them , unsurprisingly agreed .
This would prove to be one of the great misreadings of the nature of power in our world .
Since what ’s gone before in this account has been long , let me make this  our own dim and dismal moment  relatively short and sweet .
On September 11 , 2001 , the Age of Denial ended in the “ mushroom cloud ” of the World Trade Center .
It was no mistake that , within 24 hours , the site where the towers had gone down was declared to be “ Ground Zero , ” a term previously reserved for an atomic explosion .
Of course , no such explosion had happened , nor had an apocalypse of destruction actually occurred .
No city , continent , or planet had been vaporized , but for Americans , secretly waiting all those decades for their “ victory weapon ” to come home , it briefly looked that way .
The shock of discovering for the first time and in a gut way that the continental United States , too , could be at some planetary epicenter of destruction was indeed immense .
In the media , apocalyptic moments  anthrax , plagues , dirty bombs  only multiplied and most Americans , still safe in their homes , hunkered down in fear to await various doom - laden scenarios that would never happen .
In the meantime , other encroaching but unpalatable globalizing realities , ranging from America ’s “ oil addiction ” to climate change , would continue to be assiduously ignored .
In the U.S. , this was , you might say , the real “ inconvenient truth ” of these years .
The response to 9/11 was , to say the least , striking  and craven in the extreme .
Although the Bush administration ’s Global War on Terror ( aka World War IV ) has been pictured many ways , it has never , I suspect , been seen for what it most truly may have been : a desperate and fierce rearguard action to extend the American Age of Denial .
We would , as the President urged right after 9/11 , show our confidence in the American system by acting as though nothing had happened and , of course , paying that visit to Disney World .
In the meantime , as “ commander - in - chief ” he would wall us in and fight a “ global war ” to stave off the forces threatening us .
Better yet , that war would once again be on their soil , not ours , forever and ever , amen .
The motto of the Bush administration might have been : Pay any price .
Others , that is , would pay any price  disappearance , torture , false imprisonment , death by air and land  for us to remain in denial .
A pugnacious and disastrous “ war ” on terrorism , along with sub-wars , dubbed “ fronts ” ( central or otherwise ) , would be pursued to impose our continuing Age of Denial by force on the rest of the planet ( and soften the costs of our addiction to oil ) .
This was to be the new Pax Americana , a shock - and - awe “ crusade ” ( to use a word that slipped out of the President ’s mouth soon after 9/11 ) launched in the name of American “ safety ” and “ national security . ”
Almost eight years later , as in the present presidential campaign of 2008 , these remain the idols to which American politicians , the mainstream media , and assumedly many citizens continue to do frightened obeisance .
The message of 9/11 was , in truth , clear enough  quite outside the issue of who was delivering it for what purpose .
It was :
Here is the future of the United States ; try as you might , like it or not , you are about to become part of the painful , modern history of this planet .
And the irony that went with it was this :
The fiercer the response , the more we tried to force the cost of denial of this central reality on others , the faster history  that grim shadow story of the Cold War era  seemed to approach .
Postcard from the Edge
What I ’ve written thus far has n’t exactly been a postcard .
But if I were to boil all this down to postcard size , I might write :
Here ’s our hope : History surprised us and we got through .
Somehow .
In that worst of all centuries , the last one , the worst did n’t happen , not by a long shot .
Here ’s the problem :
It still could happen  and , 64 years later , in more ways than anyone once imagined .
Here ’s a provisional conclusion :
And it will happen , somehow or other , unless history surprises us again , unless , somehow or other , we surprise ourselves and the United States ends its age of denial .
And a little p.s. :
It ’s not too late .
We  we Americans  could still do something that mattered when it comes to the fate of the Earth .

The oceans absorb about half the carbon dioxide humankind releases into the atmosphere , and seawater is consequently acidifying .
That 's a big problem for shellfish , corals , and certain other calcareous creatures , because lowered pH dissolves their shells and skeletons .
Echinoderms — starfish and their relatives — have calcium - based skeletons , too , and so researchers have assumed they are likewise subject to slow dissolution .
Hannah L. Wood of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England and two co-workers decided to check .
They took brittlestars ( Amphiura filiformis ) , removed an arm or two , and then , to test how acidity affected regeneration of the lost arms , exposed the animals to seawater that was either normal ( pH 8.0 ) or acidified ( pH 7.7 ) — the standard worst - case prediction for the year 2100 — and pH 7.3 ) .
To Wood 's surprise , the brittlestars actually regenerated their arms faster in the acidified seawater than in the normal stuff , showing that they could lay down calcium effectively even under adverse conditions .
But there was a hidden cost .
Both intact and regenerated arms had considerably less muscle mass in acidified seawater than they did in normal seawater .
The low - pH animals consumed extra oxygen , so they were working hard , and Wood thinks they had to burn muscle to fuel the laborious regeneration .
Weakened arms would undoubtedly affect feeding and reproduction .
Thus , even if it does n't affect their calcification , low pH still costs echinoderms an arm and a leg .
The finding was detailed in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Firefighters and hazardous materials crews responded to an explosion Monday morning at the 130,000 barrel per day ( bpd ) Valero Houston refinery , according to KHOU - TV .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Valero Energy
Corp said production at its 130,000 barrel per day Houston refinery was temporarily reduced after an incident that heavily damaged a sulfur loading tank on Monday morning .
The Houston Fire Department said the tank , which contained sulfur dioxide , ruptured , leading to a shelter - in - place order to nearby residents in Houston ’s Manchester neighborhood .
The shelter order was lifted about two hours after the incident .
A total of five workers -- three contract employees from the refinery and two contractors from nearby facilities -- were taken to hospitals following the incident with breathing problems .
All had been released by mid-afternoon , the company said .
Earlier Valero said four workers were taken to hospitals .
Small homes in the Manchester neighborhood are across local streets from the refinery , which is at the west end of the Houston Ship Channel .
Local television station KHOU - TV showed video of a smoldering tank with a large hole in a portion of its roof at the refinery in a Monday morning news report .
Debris could be seen on the ground near the tank .
Lambda abstractions in C++ vs. Scheme
This article is to exhibit lambda abstractions in C++ in comparison with those of traditional functional languages ( e.g. , Scheme ) .
The article will try to demonstrate that " applicable values " in C++ not only look similar to their functional cousins .
They are equal in meaning as well .
The same can be said for currying .
This article will not prove that C++ and Scheme are identical , as they are clearly not .
Yet the extent and depth of similarity in lambda expressions is uncanny .
I humbly submit that the functional side of C++ is not a well - publicized feature of that language .
This article was posted on comp.lang.scheme , comp.lang.functional , comp.lang.lisp , comp.lang.c++.moderated newsgroups on Sun , 24 Jan 1999 23:19:27 GMT
1. Simple lambda - expressions
In Scheme :
( define foo ( lambda ( a b ) (+ a b ) ) )
The lambda - expression when evaluated produces the value of a procedural type .
The define form binds this value to an identifier foo .
Evaluation of an expression
( foo 1 2 )
looks up the procedural value bound to this identifier , and applies it .
In C++ , precisely the same idea is expressed as
Lambda ( ( int a , int b ) , int , return a +b ) foo ;
# define Lambda ( args , ret_type , body ) \ class MakeName ( __Lambda___ ) { \ public : ret_type operator ( ) args { body ; } }
foo
foo
foo
When the compiler processes an application :
cout << " foo ( 1,2 ) is " << foo ( 1,2 ) << endl ;
it looks up the type of foo , finds the procedural class and invokes the appropriate method .
The similarity between the two expressions -- in Scheme and C++ -- is almost complete .
The major difference is a compile vs. run-time lookup of values and bindings .
Optimizing Scheme compilers blur even this difference .
2. Recursive lambda - expressions
( define fact ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( not ( positive ? n ) ) 1 (* n ( fact (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) )
fact
define
fact
In C++ ,
Lambda ( ( int n ) , int , if ( n <= 0 ) return 1 ; else return n * ( * this ) ( n - 1 ) ) fact ;
this
this
3. Higher - order functions
This example is deliberately less toy -- and hopefully more serious .
It makes use of a cache to speed up computation of the n-th Fibonacci number .
( define ( print - every - other n proc ) ; A higher - order function ( display ( proc 1 ) ) ( do ( ( i 3 (+ 2 i ) ) ) ( (> i n ) ( newline ) ) ( display " " ) ( display ( proc i ) ) ) ) ( print - every - other 11 ( letrec ( (n 0 ) ( fib-n 0 ) ( n - 1 0 ) ( fib - n - 1 0 ) ( fib ( lambda ( x ) ( cond ( ( = 1 x ) 1 ) ( (= 2 x ) 1 ) ( ( = n x ) fib - n ) ( (= n - 1 x ) fib - n - 1 ) ( (= (+ n 1 ) x ) ( do - cache n x fib -n ( + fib -n fib - n - 1 ) ) ) ( else ( let* ( ( x - 1 (- x 1 ) ) ( v - 1 ( fib x - 1 ) ) ) ( do - cache x - 1 x v - 1 (+ v - 1 ( fib (- x 2 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( do - cache ( lambda ( x - 1 x v - 1 v ) ( if (> x n ) ( begin ( set ! n x ) ( set ! fib-n v ) ( set ! n - 1 x - 1 ) ( set! fib -n - 1 v - 1 ) ) ) v ) ) ) fib ) ) 1 2 5 13 34 89
Here 's the equivalent C++ code :
template < class T> struct pair { T fst , snd ; } ; typedef Lambda ( ( int x ) , struct xv : public pair < int > { xv( void ) { fst=0 ; snd=0 ; } xv( const int a , const int b ) { fst = a ; snd = b ; }} ; pair < xv > cache ; int do_cache ( const xv prev , const xv curr ) { if ( curr.fst > cache.snd.fst ) { cache.fst = prev ; cache.snd = curr ; } return curr.snd ; } int , if ( x == 1 ) return 1 ; if ( x == 2 ) return 1 ; if ( x == cache.fst.fst ) return cache.fst.snd ; if ( x == cache.snd.fst ) return cache.snd.snd ; if ( x == ( cache.snd.fst + 1 ) ) return do_cache ( cache.snd , xv( x , cache.fst.snd + cache.snd.snd ) ) ; const int vp = ( * this ) ( x - 1 ) ; return do_cach e ( xv ( x - 1 , vp ) , xv( x , vp + ( * this ) ( x - 2 ) ) ) ) fib ; template < class T> void print_every_other ( const int n ) { T closure ; cout << closure ( 1 ) ; for ( register int i=3 ; i< =n ; i+=2 ) cout << " " << closure ( i ) ; cout << endl ; } main ( ) { print_every_other < fib >( 11 ) ; }
print - every - other
proc
print_every_other
fib
4. Currying
Let 's start with the C++ code first :
static void test_currying ( void ) { cout << " Currying 1 : " << curry_add (1 ) << endl ; cout << " Currying 1+2 : " << curry_add ( 1 ) ( 2 ) << endl ; cout << " Currying 1+2+4 : " << curry_add ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 4 ) << endl ; cout << " Currying 1.1 : " << curry_add ( 1.1 ) << endl ; cout << " Currying 1.1+0.5 : " << curry_add ( 1.1 ) ( 0.5 ) << endl ; cout << " Currying 1.1+0.5-1.0 : " << curry_add ( 1.1 ) ( 0.5 ) ( - 1.0 ) << endl ; }
curry_add
Here
template < class T> class Curry_add { T a ; public : Curry_add ( const T _a ) : a( _a ) {} Curry_add < T> operator ( ) ( const T b ) const { return a + b ; } operator T ( void ) const { return a ; } } ; template < class T> Curry_add < T> curry_add ( const T a ) { return a ; }
CurryAdd <T>( x )
template < typename T > class CurryAdd { T a ; public : CurryAdd ( const T a ) { this ->a = a ; } CurryAdd < T> operator ( ) ( const T b ) { return Curry Add < T > ( a + b ) ; } operator T ( void ) { return a ; } } ; template < typename T> CurryAdd < T> cadd ( const T a ) { return CurryAdd < T > ( a ) ; } main ( ) { cout << cadd ( 1 ) << endl ; cout << cadd ( 1 ) ( 2 ) << endl ; cout << cadd ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) << endl ; cout << cadd ( 3.4 ) ( 4.5 ) << endl ; cout << cadd ( 1 ) ( 3.5 ) << endl ; // careful ! }
cout << cadd ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 )
CurryAdd<int >
1
CurryAdd<int > operator ( )
2
CurryAdd<int >
operator ( )
3
<<
CurryAdd< int >::int ( void )
In Scheme ,
( define ( curry - add x ) ( lambda p ( if ( null ? p ) x ( curry - add (+ x ( car p ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( curry - add 5 ) ) ==> 5 ( ( ( curry - add 5 ) 7 ) ) ==> 12 ( ( ( ( curry - add 5 ) 7 ) - 1 ) ) ==> 11
type Curry_add = Curry_add -> Message_app -> ( Int -> Object ) \/ Curry_add -> Message_conv ->
Int
\/
It turns out that the same technique can be used to implement Functions with the variable number of ( variously typed ) arguments in Haskell .
As a matter of fact , currying is built into C++.
Compare the following C multi-argument application
printf ( " %s%d%c
" , " passing many arguments : " , 4 , ' ! ' ) ;
cout << " passing many arguments : " << 4 << '!' << endl ;
operator <<
5. Currying and Folding
Bas van der Linden from Technische Universiteit Eindhoven very kindly contributed on Aug 18 , 2003 the following interesting example of advanced currying and folding .
In his example , the comma operator indeed acts as an infix apply .
# include < iostream > # define define ( name , op ) \ template < class T > class __Curry_ ## name { T a ; public : \ __Curry_ # # name ( const T& a ) : a ( a ) {} \ __Curry_ # # name operator , ( const T& b ) { return ( op ) ; } \ operator T ( ) const { return a ; } \ } ; \ struct { template < class T> __Curry_ # # name < T > \ operator , ( const T& a ) { return a ; } } name ; struct { template < class T > void operator , ( const T& a ) { std:: cout << a << std::endl ; } } display ; define ( max , a > b ? a : b ) ; define ( sum , a + b ) ; int main ( void ) { ( display , ( ( ( ( max , 2.0 ) , 3.0 ) , 4.0 ) , 5.0 ) ) ; ( display , ( ( ( ( max , 3.0 ) , 6.2 ) , - 4.0 ) , 5.2 ) ) ; ( display , ( ( ( ( sum , 2.0 ) , 3.0 ) , 4.0 ) , 5.0 ) ) ; ( display , ( ( ( ( sum , 3.0 ) , 6.2 ) , - 4.0 ) , 5.2 ) ) ; return 0 ; }
Bas van der Linden has modeled foldl1 .
The comparable Scheme code will be
( define ( foldf fn ) ( define ( ffn arg1 ) ( lambda opt-arg ( if ( null ? opt-arg ) arg1 ( ffn ( fn ( car opt- arg ) arg1 ) ) ) ) ) ffn ) ( define maxf ( foldf max ) ) ( define sumf ( foldf + ) ) ( display ( ( ( ( ( maxf 2 ) 3 ) 4 ) 5 ) ) ) ( newline ) ( display ( ( ( ( ( maxf 3 ) 6.2 ) - 4 ) 5.2 ) ) ) ( newline ) ( display ( ( ( ( ( sumf 2 ) 3 ) 4 ) 5 ) ) ) ( newline ) ( display ( ( ( ( ( sumf 3 ) 6.2 ) - 4 ) 5.2 ) ) ) ( newline )

Your comments , problem reports , questions are very welcome !
Feminism is the idea that women should be treated like children .
Did n’t accomplish anything this time around , sweetheart ?
That ’s okay .
Give it another shot after we bend the fuck out of the rules .
Scratch that .
Feminism is the idea that women should be treated like spoiled children — who get do - overs and freebies until they ’re chucking batteries at homeless people out the sunroof of their father ’s BMW .
Well - raised kids get stuck with Dick Soup if that ’s what they ordered .
Do-overs are not a part of man-parenting .
Do-overs are for ladies .
Feminism is the idea that women should n’t consider themselves happy unless they enjoy the same things men do — and that they should enjoy them at ten times the volume .
Have you ever seen a woman pretend to like business or sports ?
If you have , then you ’ve seen the very definition of an overcompensating attention whore .
There is n’t a big screen on Earth that can drown out the “ mating hoots ” of a woman who ’s convinced herself she likes basketball .
Professional athletes thrive on the respect and worship of men like they were Greek gods .
A respect that is so inherent to Sport it cannot even be understood without a penis .
Ladies , unless they ’re on top of you , you do n’t mean shit to professional athletes .
You ’re embarrassing yourselves with this unwanted fandom .
The idea of convincing someone to enjoy something more than they would otherwise might sound familiar to you .
It ’s called “ marketing ” .
You like beer … but do you like Coors Light ?
You should .
Personally , I do n’t like Coors Light .
I enjoy Boddingtons , Smithwick ’s , Tecate , John Smith , Guinness , Imperial , MGD , and nearly any microbrew over 10 % abv .
But there are thousands of men out there who pay their mortgage every month just trying to convince me to add Coors to that list .
Carl ’s Jr : Fuck you , I ’m eating .
Feminism is powered by women who eat and feed themselves and their dozens of worthless cats with money made by maintaining and promoting the infernal machine that is feminism .
There are women out there who make their living convincing young women to play sports .
Otherwise , they lose their budget .
Without feminism , Women ’s Studies “ professors ” and ten thousand of the ugliest bitches on Earth would have to learn how to fuck properly in order to put a roof over their heads .
Because what does life spent promoting women ’s issues prepare you for ?
It ’s technically not “ marketing ” because these dozy broads buy it by the trough .
That makes it a cult .
Feminism : the Cult of Do-Overs
Even if you swallow all the bullshit , “ equality ” is a task that has an end .
However , if feminism ever achieves this imaginary task , thousands of know - nothing , over - educated bitches will be out of a job faster than their cats will resort to eating one another to stay alive in the real world .
Feminism is n’t about achieving anything .
It ’s about staying in business .
Feminism is about creating more feminist problems .
If Richard Jewell had actually planted that bomb at the 96 Summer Olympics and then called it in so he would look like a hero — like Janet Reno said he did — feminism would be Richard Jewell .
I bet they do n’t even offer an introductory course on carpet munching in Women ’s Studies .
As far as I see it , pretending you ’re half “ lesbian ” is the first requirement to being a feminist .
Men love working our asses off .
Men love stacking up our accomplishments and shoving them in everyone ’s face — or sometimes not shoving them in everyone ’s face , but still making sure that everyone knows they could be shoved in their face at any moment .
That ’s called “ being the bigger man ” .
And that ’s also something women ca n’t do .
Men love partying , going out with our man-friends , and most importantly , sleeping around .
Women do n’t .
Women like getting shit for free based on their looks , and as long as feminism does n’t teach that , it ’s a scam and a con and a cult .
A cult of do - overs .
If you ’re one of these Daddy ’s Little Princesses who thinks I ’m full of shit because I ’m teaching some manly analogue to feminism , go fuck yourself .
I do n’t care if men do n’t agree with me .
I do n’t give a fuck if anyone agrees with me .
I ’ll make you guys a deal .
If any of you do n’t agree with me , go get a job in an office and get married to the sweetest , most caring , least likely to be a bitch in seven years while having at least two guys on the side that she secretly chats with on MySpace up until then , and then come see me in ten years with your opinion unchanged .
You ’ll be back , but it wo n’t be to gloat .
I ’ll be fucking feminism all week .
It ’ll be fun .
Like fucking a girl with self - esteem so low she can’t tell the difference between love and not getting spit on .

San Jose ( CA ) - Believe it or not , NVISION 08 is not just about Nvidia .
Earlier today we met with Gigabyte to see what we can expect from the Taiwanese manufacturer - and got a glimpse at an upcoming motherboard for Intel ’s Core i7 processors with Nehalem core .
The board , called Extreme Edition , sets several highlights , including the ability to transform your PC in a true deskside supercomputer that offers the processing horsepower of thousands of processors ten years ago .
The prototype board on display was based on Intel ’s X58 chipset and supports up to six graphics cards , four PCIe Gen2 x16 slots and two wide - open Gen 2 x4 slots .
Due to space constraints there is only Crossfire and no SLI support .
So , what can you do with six graphics cards - for example six Radeon 4850 or six Nvidia 9800 GT models ?
You could run up to 12 monitors , which should be a dream for any flight simulator enthusiast .
While you can run up to four cards in Crossfire ( graphics ) mode , you can employ all six cards for GPGPU applications and floating point acceleration .
The theoretical performance potential of such an environment would be in the 6 TFlops neighborhood for single - precision applications ( double precision will cause the performance to drop by 80 to 90 percent . )
To put this performance into perspective , consider the fact that Intel ’s 1997 Pentium Pro supercomputer with 10,000 CPUs was rated at 1 TFlops .
The actual performance advantage of supercomputers is not entirely based on pure processing horsepower , but also memory capacity , which GPUs cannot match .
But the simple thought that you can add six graphics cards with 4,800 processors for about $ 1,200 to rival the performance of supercomputers that cost billions of dollars a decade ago ( at least in some applications ) is stunning .
On the power side , Gigabyte ’s engineers developed a separated 12 - phase power supply for the CPU ; a 2 - Phase structure is in place for the memory and a separate 2 - Phase regulation for the PCI Express slots .
The company indicated that there will be room for overclocking and special attention was paid to ensure " workstation - class stability under any conditions . "
The board can support up to 24 GB DDR3 - 1333 , or 6 GB of DDR3 - 1900 / 2000 memory ( using overclocked 2 GB DIMMs ) .
Thanks to the 2 - Phase regulation , there should be enough juice to hold future 4 GB DDR3 - 1333 modules .
The board is still being worked on and the prototype will undergo significant modifications in the storage and cooling department , we were told .
The combined air / water - cooling block will be modified so that the six graphics cards can fit .
All six SATA ports will be rotated to support extend - length PCIe cards .
SANAA ( Reuters ) -
Two suicide car bombers set off a series of explosions outside the heavily fortified U.S. embassy in Yemen on Wednesday , killing 16 people , a Yemeni Interior Ministry official said .
The U.S. State Department said the bombings bore “ all the hallmarks ” of an al Qaeda attack but the United States had not yet concluded who was to blame .
Islamic Jihad in Yemen , a group some Yemeni analysts say is linked to al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack , in which other militants armed with assault rifles and rocket propelled grenades tried to storm the embassy .
“ We , the organization of Islamic Jihad in Yemen declare our responsibility for the suicide attack on the American embassy in Sanaa , ” Islamic Jihad said in a statement , adding it will carry out more attacks in the future .
Among the dead were six attackers and four bystanders .
The rest were Yemeni security personnel , including one embassy guard .
All the dead were Yemeni , with the exception of one Indian woman who was walking past when the attack happened , the official added .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said all the embassy staff were safe .
The embassy and its consular section were closed following the attack .
U.S. President George W. Bush said the attackers were trying to make the United States “ lose our nerve and to withdraw from regions of the world . ”
“ This attack is a reminder that we are at war with extremists who will murder innocent people to achieve their ideological objectives , ” said Bush , with the outgoing U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , at his side .
When asked which group was suspected in the attack , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said : “ After talking to the security personnel , the attack bears all the hallmarks of an al Qaeda attack where you have multiple vehicle - borne devices . ”
Some Yemeni analysts say Islamic Jihad , which is unrelated to a Palestinian group with the same name , is linked to al Qaeda but this has not been clearly shown to be the case .
TRYING TO STORM EMBASSY
Details of the assault remained hazy .
But the Yemeni Interior Ministry official said the suicide attackers had tried to break through the heavily guarded gates of the embassy with their cars but had failed , and that the building was not seriously damaged .
McCormack said that one car bomb exploded at a guard ’s post outside the embassy and the second near a pedestrian entrance .
Several attackers were seen on foot and the goal appeared to be to breach the wall of the embassy complex and to kill people inside .

Yemen , the ancestral home of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , has grappled with a spate of al Qaeda attacks this year , including one on the U.S. embassy , another near the Italian mission and others on Western tourists .
Islamic Jihad in Yemen has been involved in previous attacks on Western targets in Yemen including a U.S. hospital .
The leader of the group was executed in 1999 for the kidnapping of 16 Western tourists , four of whom died in a botched army attack to free them .

It had threatened on Tuesday to launch a series of attacks unless Yemen freed several jailed members .
An al Qaeda - affiliated group claimed responsibility in March for a mortar attack that missed the U.S. embassy but wounded 13 girls at a nearby school .
The United States ordered non-essential staff to leave Yemen in April after an attack on a residential compound .
The Yemeni government joined the U.S. - led war against terrorism following the September 11 attacks on U.S. cities in 2001 .
It has jailed dozens of militants in connection with bombings of Western targets and clashes with authorities , but is still viewed in the West as a haven for Islamist militants .
Over a third of the more than 250 prisoners at the U.S. prison for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay are from Yemen .
The government of the poor Arab country has also been fighting Shi’ite rebels in the northern province of Saada since 2004 and faced protests against unemployment and inflation .
WARNING : Satan is Using Olympics Volleyball to Get Young Boys to Masturbate !
International Emergency Christian ( Republican ) Family Action Alert : Freehold , Iowa - Behind the locked doors of America 's Christian bedrooms , young boys are getting swept up in a disturbing trend .
" I had a frantic mother come to me the other day in tears , " said Pastor Deacon Fred .
" She told me that her son , Timothy , invited several of his friends over into his bedroom for private prayer and devotional scripture studies .
What she told me next is enough to send shivers down the spine of every God fearing mother and father in our Christian Nation !
Satan is in our midst , my friends !
The Devil is using Olympics volleyball to lure young men into shedding their clothes , flopping around and falling off of their beds with him into the pit of iniquity .
Lucifer is turning innocent afternoon gatherings of imprecatory prayer into frenzied young Masturbating Baptist Boys ' Clubs ! "
When Mrs. Huxton put her ear to the door , she told Pastor that she " heard not the sacred sounds of scripture readings accompanied by soft sweet whispers to our Heavenly Father , but rather a noisy television set spewing Chinese gibberish , tuned to an Olympic volleyball match . "
When she listened closer , she heard the slapping sounds of flesh - on - flesh accompanied by the grunts and moans of little Christian boys !
When she opened the door , Mrs. Huxton reported seeing a pile naked young men , including her own son .
" Timothy 's head was peeking out from under the pimpled rump of his prayer leader , " she said .
" They were all on the bedroom floor covered in sweat , their stiffened purple tallywhackers pointing in every direction . "
Before Mrs. Huxton fainted in the doorway , she noticed the Tivo paused on the scantily clad knee of an Olympic volleyball player from the corner of her tearing eye .
" When church security officers arrived on the scene the boys had dressed themselves and were seated quietly in the living room , each with an open Bible on their lap , " said Pastor Deacon Fred .
" But the Devil did n't clean up his mess in the bedroom !
No sir !
His tell - tale hoof - prints were everywhere !
There were empty bottles of secular lubricant , four pairs of silk panties stained with the after - lust of Lucifer 's business , and what appeared to be a horse harness stuffed into Timothy 's closet along with a case of Red Bull .
In addition , security officers reported the boys had been playing with superhero toys , " Pastor continued .
" Anything related to superheroes except for Jesus is forbidden in this church !
Officer Wilkins told me he found a Tantus ball toy and Titanmen training tools under Timothy 's bed , and we 're looking into it because there are bound to be some some Tantus & Titanmen comic books hidden around somewhere too !
The sticky giant gold rings found under Timothy 's dresser are also suspect because the boy is probably into the fantasy book series , the Lord of the Rings , and we 'll have none of that !
There is also the possibility the boys were worshipping an idol because officer Wilkins found a sinister looking black silicone graven image with a bulbous head and nylon straps had been thrown out of Timothy 's window .
I 'm told the tip of the idol smelled like poopy !
No doubt the family dog had gotten hold of it . "
" I have no doubt in my mind that all across America , Christian families are coming across scenes exactly like this ! "
Pastor Deacon Fred told parishioners on Sunday morning .
" We wo n't stand for it in this church !
From this day forward any member of our congregation caught watching Olympic volleyball or even mentioning Olympic volleyball will be asked to pack their belongings and find a place to live where your filthy , sinful , disgusting , depraved masturbation lifestyle is accepted ! "
Timothy Huxton , Nathan DeAngelino , Alfred Fillmore , and Rufus Washington have each been sent to the Landover Baptist Creation Science Research Facility where they remain isolated from television and one another in the pre-marital mastrubatorial re-conditioning ward until further notice .

The global economy is rapidly slowing .
Today we can add two more countries to the list of countries in , or headed for recession .
Let 's start with a look at Canada .
Inquiring minds may wish to consider Canada 's biggest job loss in 17 years .
Fifty - five thousand jobs were lost in Canada in July , the biggest number since February 1991 , principally the result of a struggling private sector in Ontario and Quebec .
However most of the losses , 48,000 , were in part - time work and overall employment remained 227,000 higher than it was a year earlier , Statistics Canada said Friday .
The performance was far worse than expected .
The median estimate by analysts surveyed by Reuters had been for a gain of 5,000 jobs in July following a loss of that magnitude in June .
Traders immediately sold the Canadian dollar after the figures were released .
The loonie fell to around 93.92 U.S. cents , from 94.16 U.S. cents immediately prior to the release .
Bonds moved up as markets calculated the Bank of Canada was
less likely to raise interest rates than before .
" Certainly this is going to refocus the Bank of Canada 's attention on the growth side of the economy , " Royal Bank of Canada assistant chief economist Paul Ferley said .
" Up to now recent comments have been sort of highlighting the risk to inflation but with this kind of employment report it 's going to make clear that there is risk on the growth side as well . "
The manufacturing heartland of Ontario and Quebec bore the brunt of the losses .
Overall , 32,000 Canadian manufacturing jobs were lost in July , and 88,000 in the past year .
While there were gains elsewhere , Ontario alone lost 41,000 factory jobs in July .
Quebec 's unemployment rate rose to 7.4 percent from 7.2 percent .
Refocused Attention On Growth
Japan trade surplus down nearly 89 percent
Japan 's trade surplus in June fell 88.9 percent from a year earlier marking the fourth straight month of decline , the government announced Thursday .
Japan 's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States fell by 40.2 percent , down for the 10th straight month on slower exports of cars , auto parts and mineral fuels .
The nation 's trade surplus with Asia dipped 6.3 percent , falling for the first time in three months due to rising imports of oil , natural gas and coal , the ministry said .
The trade surplus with China fell 65.5 percent .
Japan 's trade surplus in the first half of 2008 , meanwhile , fell 42.1 percent from a year earlier to 2.959 trillion yen ( $ 27.40 billion ) , the ministry said Thursday .
Imports grew 10.5 percent , outpacing exports that increased 3.9 percent
Japan Recession Looms
Aug. 8 ( Bloomberg ) -- Japan 's economy probably contracted last quarter , bringing the country to the brink of its first recession in six years , as exports fell and consumers spent less .
Gross domestic product shrank an annualized 2.3 percent in the three months ended June 30 , according to the median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News .
Toyota Motor Corp. yesterday reported the biggest drop in earnings in five years as U.S. sales slumped .
" What you 're going to see is a long , slow , modestly painful recession , " said Robert Feldman , head of economic research at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo .
" It 's going to fall heavily on both workers and stock holders who are suffering lower returns as profits come down . "
" Most of the measures suggest that things are n't as good as they were 12 months ago , but it 's nothing like 2001 , 1998 , or 1993 , " said Richard Jerram , chief Japan economist at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Tokyo .
" When you say recession , it triggers images of 1998 or 1993 , " Jerram said .
" You 're having a period of sub - par growth , but it 's not the sort of downturn we saw three times during the previous 15 years . "
The links to documentation do not work - this is the most severe problem , and probably stops people permanently changing to the new version .
The Haddock documentation is not present .
Some database entries are duplicates .
The Lambdabot says feature is missing .
The Suggestion feature is incomplete .
The AJAX style client features are not present .
Since releasing a command line version of Hoogle 4 yesterday , I 've had some useful feedback from a number of people .
As a result , I have added a few bugs to the bug tracker , and fixed a few mistakes in the searching and ranking .
The Hoogle on Hackage is currently 4.0.0.3 and is a recommended upgrade to all early testers .
I 've now written a web interface to Hoogle 4 , which has been uploaded to http://haskell.org/hoogle/beta/ .
This web interface is primarily so people can test searching / ranking without installing anything .
There are a number of limitations :
The first three issues are fixed in Hoogle , but need various support through Haddock and Cabal to work .
Other than these limitations , I am very interested in hearing what people think .
As before , particularly regressions from Hoogle 3 or poor results / ranking .

Below is an extract from a commentary originally posted at www.speculative-investor.com on 30th March , 2008 .
Several subscribers have asked us to comment on Gary North 's article at http://www.garynorth.com/public/3118.cfm .
In this article Mr. North claims that the Fed is deflating ( contracting the money supply ) , a claim that rests solely on the lack of growth ( or outright decline ) in the monetary base .
Considering the extraordinary measures * taken by the Fed over the past four months in order to inflate ( grow the money supply ) , the idea that the Fed is purposefully deflating ( contracting the money supply ) is preposterous .
So , what should we make of the small decline in the monetary base ?
Not much , actually , because regulatory changes made during the 1990s made it possible for banks to substantially reduce the amount of money held in the form of reserves at the Fed by automatically " sweeping " money from the types of accounts that have reserve requirements to the types of accounts that do not have reserve requirements **.
These regulatory changes effectively severed the link between the monetary base and the total supply of money .
In other words , changes in the money supply are no longer governed by changes in the monetary base .
A related point worth mentioning is that the changes routinely made by the Fed to the monetary base are constrained by the difference between the effective Fed Funds rate ( FFR ) and the target FFR .
To be specific , if the Fed wants to keep the effective FFR near its target then it can only increase the monetary base when the effective rate is above the target rate .
Over the past several months , however , the actual overnight interest rate ( the effective FFR ) has almost always been below the Fed 's target .
This means that the Fed has been tagging along behind the market , which is , by the way , invariably the case around major interest - rate turning points .
To summarise the above , changes in the monetary base usually have very little to do with changes in the total supply of money ( inflation / deflation ) .
Furthermore , we can observe that the Fed has been taking ' heroic ' measures in an effort to keep the inflation going .
Therefore , there is no evidence that the Fed is TRYING to deflate ( quite the opposite , actually ) ; but is it the case that deflation is occurring DESPITE the Fed 's best efforts ?
No , that is definitely not the case .
As evidenced by the following charts , M1 -- a very narrow measure of money supply that tends to move in synch with the monetary base -- has essentially gone nowhere over the past three years , while MZM , a more comprehensive measure of liquid money supply within the economy , has experienced a parabolic increase .
For some reason unknown to us , Mr. North is fixating on ultra-narrow monetary aggregates such as M1 while ignoring the broader , and more useful , measures of money supply .
There is certainly a chance that the inflation rate ( the rate of increase in the BROAD money supply ) will slow over the coming months , but if / when that happens it will be a market - driven , not a Fed - driven , occurrence .
Moreover , the Fed can be relied upon to fight any substantial slowdown in the inflation rate and to ultimately win such a fight .
There are a lot of things the Fed cannot do , but the one thing it can always do is increase the supply of money .
* A little over three months ago the Fed introduced the Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) to make it easier and less costly for banks to obtain money .
When that proved to be insufficient , the Fed introduced the Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) in an effort to inject more " liquidity " into the banking system .
And when the TAF combined with the TSLF failed to give the desired inflationary boost , the Fed offered to lend huge amounts of money to non-bank financial corporations .
** From the 5th March 2007 Weekly Update : " Many pundits still treat M1 's growth rate as an important indicator of monetary conditions on the basis that the amount of ' narrow money ' is supposed to have a substantial influence on the total supply of money due to the famous " money multiplier " effect .
In fact , some well - respected analysts have expressed concern that the lack of growth in the narrowest measures of US money supply over the past couple of years means that Fed policy has been excessively restrictive .
But these analysts are failing to appreciate that regulatory changes made by the Fed in the early 1990s caused M1 to become a shadow of its former self with respect to its usefulness as a general monetary indicator .
In rough terms , the rules were changed in the early 1990s to allow banks to dramatically reduce the amount of money held in the form of reserves at the Fed by " sweeping " money from checking accounts ( components of M1 that are subject to reserve requirements ) into savings accounts ( non -M1 components of M2 for which there are no reserve requirements ) .
For example , you might think you have a checkable deposit at your local bank , but in the bank 's books you probably have a zero- interest CD ( the type of deposit that has no reserve requirement ) .
Whenever one of your checks is presented the bank 's software " sweeps " the relevant amount of money from the zero- interest CD you never knew you had into the checking account you thought you had .
These rule changes have made commercial banks more profitable because money held in reserve at the Fed is money that does n't generate income for the banks ; and this , of course , is why the changes were made in the first place . "

Thinking about the massive failure of the US media to report truthfully is sobering .
The United States , bristling with nuclear weapons and pursuing a policy of world hegemony , has a population that is kept in the dark -- indeed brainwashed -- about the most important and most dangerous events of our time .
The power of the Israel Lobby is an important component of keeping Americans in the dark .
Recently I watched a documentary that demonstrates the control that the Israel Lobby exercises over Americans ' view of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The documentary is available here : http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article14055.htm
As a result of the US media 's one - sided coverage , few Americans are aware that for decades Israel has been ethnically cleansing Palestinians from their homes and lands under protection of America 's veto in the United Nations .
Instead , the dispossessed Palestinians are portrayed as mindless terrorists who attack innocent Israel .
If one reads Israeli newspapers , such as Haaretz , or publications from Israeli organizations , such as the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions , one gets a radically different view of the situation than the propagandistic version delivered by US media and evangelical pulpits .
Most Americans know of the 2000 attack by Muslim terrorists on the USS Cole in Aden harbor that resulted in 17 dead and 39 wounded American sailors .
But few have heard of Israel 's 1967 attack on the USS Liberty that left 34 American sailors dead and 174 wounded .
Pressured by the Israel Lobby , President Johnson ordered Admiral McCain , father of the Republican presidential nominee , to cover up the attack .
To this day there never has been a congressional investigation .
The failure of the American media is again evident in the coverage of the Georgian - Russian conflict .
The US media presented the conflict as a Russian invasion of Georgia , whereas in actual fact the American and Israeli trained and equipped Georgian military launched a sneak attack to kill and to drive the Russian population out of South Ossetia , a separatist province .
Russian peacekeepers , together with Georgian ones , had been stationed in South Ossetia since the early 1990s .
On orders from Mikheil Saakashvili , the American puppet " president " of Georgia , the Georgian peacekeepers turned their weapons on the unsuspecting Russian peacekeepers and murdered them .
This action by Saakashvili , elected with money from the neoconservative National Endowment for Democracy , an election - rigging tool of US hegemony , was a war crime .
In truth , the Russians should have hung Saakashvili , as he is far more guilty than was Saddam Hussein .
But it is Russia , not Saakashvili , that the US media has demonized .
Americans have become perfect subjects for George Orwell 's Big Brother .
They sit stupidly in front of the TV news or the New York Times or Washington Post and absorb the lies fed to them .
What is wrong with Americans ?
Why do they put up with it ?
Are Americans the nation of sheep that Judge Andrew P. Napolitano says they are ?
Americans flaunt " freedom and democracy " and live under a Ministry of Propaganda .
Two decades ago , President Reagan reached agreement with Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev to end the dangerous cold war .
But every one of Reagan 's successors has sought to pick a new fight with Russia .
In violation of the agreement , NATO has been taken to Russia 's borders , and the US is determined to put former constituent parts of Russia herself into NATO .
In an effort to neutralize Russia 's nuclear deterrent and compromise her independence , the US is putting anti-ballistic missile bases on Russia 's borders .
The gratuitously aggressive US military policy toward Russia will lead to nuclear war .
I am confident that if Americans elect John McCain , or the Republicans steal another presidential election , there will be nuclear war in the second decade of the 21st century .
The neocon lies , propaganda , macho flag - waving , and use of US foreign policy in the interests of a few military - security firms , oil companies , and Israel are all leading in that direction .
The November election is perhaps the last chance to avoid nuclear war .
But the opportunity might already have been missed .
The Republicans have chosen as their candidate one of the most ignorant warmongers alive .
The Democrats ' choice was between one of the most divisive women in America and a man of mixed race with a funny name .
Considering American 's taste for war , the Democratic candidate could fail to defeat the GOP war candidate .
Many Americans will vote against Obama because he is black .
Why does mixed ancestry confer the black label ?
If America 's population was predominantly black , would Obama be considered white ?
Race and propaganda are more likely to determine the outcome of the November election than any awareness or consideration of real issues by voters .
The real issues are suffocated by the media .
The American middle class is being destroyed by jobs offshoring and work visas for foreigners , while the incomes of the super rich are soaring .
The US dollar 's reserve currency status is eroded .
The US is massively in debt at home and abroad .
Health insurance is unaffordable for the vast majority of the population .
Injured veterans are being nickeled and dimed , while Halliburton 's profits escalate .
Americans are losing their homes , while the US government bails out banks .
Wars with Iran , Russia , and China are being planned in order to secure US hegemony .
Americans no longer have a government that is for the people and by the people .
They have a government for and by special interests and an insane ideology .
But Americans have war , which lets them take out all their frustrations , resentments , and disappointments on " Muslim terrorists " and " Russian aggressors . "
Few Americans are disturbed that 1.25 million Iraqis and an unknown number of Afghans have died as a result of American invasions based on Bush regime lies and deceptions .
Even Americans , like Senator Biden , Obama 's selection for vice president , who understand that the wars are based on lies , still want the US to win .
So , it was all a mistake and a deception , but let 's win anyway and keep on killing .
I know people who still complain that the US did not nuke North Vietnam .
When I ask why Vietnam should have been nuked , they reply , " if we had nuked them we would have won . "
What would America have won ?
The answer is world loathing and the loss of the cold war .
For many Americans , war is like a sports contest in which they take vicarious pleasure and cheer on their side to victory .
Millions of Americans are still bitter that " the liberal media " and war protesters caused America to lose the Vietnam war , and they are determined that this wo n't happen again .
These Americans have no realization that there was no more reason for the US to be fighting in Vietnam 40 years ago than to be fighting today in Iraq and Afghanistan or tomorrow in Iran .
Obama , if elected , is no guarantee against nuclear war .
Obama has shown that he is as much under the Israel Lobby 's thumb as McCain .
Obama 's foreign affairs advisor , Zbigniew Brzezinski , is not a neocon , but he was born in Warsaw , Poland , and has the Pole 's animosity toward Russia .
The Bush administration has already changed US war doctrine to permit preemptive nuclear attack .
With the US government determined to ring Russia with puppet states and military bases , war is inevitable .
Presidential appointees face confirmation in the Senate .
Any of Obama 's appointees who might be out of step with plans for US and Israeli hegemony could expect opposition from large corporations and the Israel Lobby .
There is no assurance that an Obama administration would not be positioned on " the issues " by the same special interests that have positioned the Bush administration .
Americans are filled with hubris , not with knowledge .
They have no awareness of the calamity that their government 's pursuit of hegemony is bringing to themselves and to life on earth .

Is there anything graphene cannot do ?
The great graphene gold rush continues today with the news that graphene nanoribbon could be the key ingredient of the next generation of quantum computers .
The trick with quantum computing is to use qubit - carrying particles that are easy to manipulate so that their quibits can be written and read , that interact with each other so that the qubits can be processed in logic gates but are robust in the sense that thay do not easily interact with the environment so that data is n’t needlessly lost .
Photons are the current darlings of the quantum computing crowd because they do not interact easily with the environment and can be relatively easily manipulated themselves ( although getting photons to interact with each other is hard ) .
But electron spins are also a good prospect because they can be easily controlled and interact readily with each other .
Their downside is that it is hard to insulate them from stray magnetic and electric fields in the environment , so storing them is hard .
Now it looks as if graphene nanoribbon may come to the rescue .
Guo -Ping Guo and pals from the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei say that z - shaped graphene ribbons can easily store electrons in the corners of their Zs , where they can be read and written to .
And by placing two Zs close to each other on a graphene strip , the electrons can also be made to interact with each other .
Materials scientists have recently worked out how to make Z - shaped graphene reliably in the lab so all the ingredients are in place for a test device to be knocked up shortly .
As Guo-Ping Guo and buddies put it : “ Due to recent achievement in production of graphene nanoribbon , this proposal may be implementable within the present techniques . ”

Throughout history magicians have been performing amazing tricks for our entertainment , as time went on , the tricks got better and better .
They continued to push the boundaries , Combining danger with illusion , resulting with more and more ridiculous feats being performed to this very day .
But everyone knows it ’s all smoke and mirrors right ?
Well this is not always the case ; Magicians have stretched the limits right to the edge , where sometimes the danger is very real .
I think we should take a look at a ten of the most dangerous tricks that have been performed throughout history , some of these are illusion , and some are just plain crazy !
“ Nobody wants a man to fall to his death but they want to be there when it happens . ”
- Houdini
10 Sawing A Woman In Half
Everyone has seen or at least heard of a magician sawing a woman in half , and everyone has their own little theory on how it works , but the truth is that the methods of this trick vary considerably which has lead to some of the greatest versions of the illusion emerging today .
One of my personal favorite versions is performed by rock star magician Criss Angel , where there are no funny boxes or giant saws , just a magician and a spectator …
9 Roller Coaster Escape
Award winning magician Lance Burton , while shackled and handcuffed to roller coaster tracks , with the roller coaster zooming along , has to pick the locks and escape before he ’s little more than roadkill .
The only thing I can think of to make this more dangerous is if the roller coaster was on fire .
Enjoy !
8 The Sword Cabinet
Here is another great classic of magic , the sword cabinet !
The assistant climbs into a tiny little box which is then sealed shut .
The magician then proceeds to thrust swords through every conceivable angle , leaving no apparent room to hide ,
The swords are then removed and the assistant reveals herself unharmed .
But it is all a trick right ?
Not unlike the sawing in half illusion , there were many versions of this trick in history .
Some of these versions do rely purely on calculated sword thrusts and a contortionist assistant , so the danger can be very real depending on who is performing it .
There have been many injuries over the years .
In the clip above , we see Hans Moretti performing this trick in a cardboard box .
7 Straight Jacket Escape
Escape artist Harry Houdini was touring through a mental institution , when he spotted a man strapped in a straight jacket .
He was struggling with all his strength and energy to get free of this device but to no avail .
Houdini was fascinated at the effectiveness of this jacket and this was just the challenge that he had been looking for , thus giving birth to one of the most popular escapes to date .
Since then it has grown more and more dangerous , such as being performed under water , hanging upside down from a crane , and being dragged behind a boat .
If you can think of a stupid thing to do with a straight jacket , magicians have probably done it .
There are no illusionary elements here , just good old escapology .
The video above shows the original footage of Houdini performing this trick .
6 Frozen In A Block Of Ice
At 9 a.m , Monday November 27 , 2000 , in Manhattan ’s Time Square , Magician David Blaine decided it was a good idea to freeze himself inside a solid 6 ton block of ice for 63 hours .
He was encased in two halves , in which his body contour had been cut , so he had a small amount of room to scratch his nose ( yeah , an itchy nose is the primary danger here Dave ! ) .
He also had life lines to monitor his health and a catheter to urinate .
In my opinion this is one of the craziest feats in magic to date .
5 Spike
This nasty little number may not be the most Dangerous , or even the most impressive , but it has caused a lot of people a lot pain in the last couple of years !
It is a variation on the old three shell game where the magician places a pea under one of three shells , then mixes them up at which point you try to identify the shell with the pea .
Modern magicians have given this classic a dangerous new spin by replacing the the pea , with a large spike , and the shells with styrofoam cups .
The magician ( blindfolded , or in another room ) lets
The spectator cover all the wooden blocks with the cups .
He then walks over to the three cups and instantly smashes his hand on two , leaving the cup with the spike underneath untouched !
Sounds amazing ?
Here ’s what happens when it goes wrong with a spectator involved .
4 Tornado Of Fire
In 2001 David Copperfield stood in the center of a 2000 degree tornado of fire , and survived .
This trick makes the list just on the name alone !
3 Chinese Water Torture Cell
Another crazy feat invented by Houdini was the water torture cell .
The magician is handcuffed , his ankles are locked into a Restraint brace , he is suspended upside down in mid air , and then lowered into a glass tank of ice water , with the restraint locked at the top of the tank .
Dangerous enough ?
Houdini was n’t killed in the water torture cell , despite popular belief .
2 Buried Alive
Here is a very old and Very dangerous trick , being buried alive .
Originally performed by the Fakirs of India , this trick found its way onto Houdini ’s “ to do list ” , but due to his sudden death this trick was cut short .
That did n’t stop magicians performing the trick years later , Notably the late Joe Burrus .
Joe was an upcoming magician in California when he decided to tackle the buried alive feat , shackled up inside a plexiglass coffin and lowered into the earth .
Assistants then covered him with seven tons of soil and concrete , however when they were almost complete , the level suddenly dropped 18 inches which indicated something had gone wrong .
After fifteen minutes of excavating he was found crushed .
Since then it has been performed time and time again by contemporary magicians such as David Blaine and Criss Angel , but it does n’t hide the fact that there is always a very real danger with these kinds of tricks .
Interesting Fact : Although Houdini never got round to performing it , he did have a specially designed coffin made for the trick .
with his sudden death , he was later buried in that very coffin .
Kind of ironic that the escape artist lies trapped forever in a coffin he once planned to escape from !
1 Bullet Catch
The most dangerous magic trick ever performed is undoubtedly the Fabled Bullet Catch .
This fatal trick has claimed the lives of many magicians , assistants , spectators , and wounded countless others over the years .
The basic effect is a bullet ( usually signed or marked ) loaded into a gun and shot at the magician , who then usually catches it in his hand or teeth .
This trick contains illusionary elements , but the danger is still very real , as has been proven over the years .
According to legend , this trick dates back to the 1600 ’s , where a magician named Coullew was claiming to successfully catch bullets ,
This however did n’t last long as he was beaten to death with his own gun by an angry spectator , who probably thought he was some kind of demon .
Next was Torrini De Grisy , who accidently shot his son on stage .
Another magician of the time De Linsky took the life of his wife when a real bullet was accidently loaded into the gun .
Magician Arnold Buck was killed when a spectator secretly loaded nails into the gun .
Michael Hatal and Otto Blumenfeld were both killed from forgetting to switch the real bullets for blanks .
The Black Wizard of the West was killed when his wife purposely loaded real bullets into the gun .
But Perhaps the most famous bullet catch performer was Chung Ling soo , who was a very famous oriental style magician who was shot when a piece of shrapnel from the gun was accidently fired at him live onstage .
he was rushed to hospital and upon removal of his clothes they discovered he was actually an american who had been secretly pretending to be Asian to distinguish himself .
Estimates say this trick has claimed the lives of around 15 magicians , not counting assistants or spectators .
After such a bloody history this trick has earned the reputation of being cursed , as very little professional magicians perform it today .
In the video clip above we see a more recent version performed by Penn and Teller .
Delimited overloading is a syntax extension to ease the writing of efficient arithmetic expressions in OCaml .
This project was sponsored by Jane Street Capital during their OCaml Summer Project 2008 .
We are very grateful for their support .
See the complete proposal ( PDF ) .
This project is hosted on OCamlForge .
Description
This project provides three syntax extensions provided by several modules .
The information below should give you a taste of the possibilities of these syntax extensions but the main reference is the ocamldoc help .
pa_do
This module allows to locally overload operators and functions .
The syntax is X.( e ) where X is a module name and e is an expression .
For example , you can write
Big_int . ( 23 ** 567 mod 45 + " 123456789123456789123456789 " ) Int64.( float( q * of_int n - ( s * s ) lsr 3 ) ) /. float n Int32.( incr x )
Big_int
Int64
Int32
Big_int
Int32
Int64
Nativeint
Complex
Num
Big_int
Ratio
nums.cma
num
Int
Float
Complex
I
Complex .( log( z + 2I ) = I / u )
and this will be transformed into the appropriate , andfunction calls ( the string will be checked to represent a validat compile time ) .
The standard OCaml numeric modules ( provided by the Pa_do .
Std module ) , and ( in a separate extension pa_do_num because they require thelibrary ( ocamlfind package ) to be loaded in caml p4 for static checking ) are overloaded , as well as two " phantom " modulesand .
Themodule use the nameto denote the imaginary unit so one can write
You can easily define your own overloadings by either using the concrete syntax or the API .
As an example , suppose you have a module X that defines the usual arithmetic functions , add , sub , mul , div and the unary negation neg .
To be able to write expressions using the usual arithmetic operators , like X.( x * y + z ) , simply put
OVERLOAD_ARITHMETIC
X
OVERLOAD_STRING Rope( of_string ) OVERLOAD_COMPARISON Rope( compare ) OVERLOAD Rope (( ^ ) -> concat2 ) OVERLOAD_STRING_GET
Rope( get )
Rope .( if max s u <= " pre " ^ u then s.[ 0 ] else u . [ 0 ] )
Poly
OVERLOAD_INT Poly( constant_int_poly ) OVERLOAD_FLOAT Poly ( constant_poly ) OVERLOAD_ARITHMETIC
Poly OVERLOAD Poly ((= ) -> equal ; ( <>) -> not_equal ; ( ** ) -> pow ) OVERLOAD_POLY_VAR Poly( var_of_string )
let p = Poly .( 1 + `x * `x + `x * `y + `x **k)
q
x
y
var_of_string " x "
Poly .( `x ** 2 )
2
at the beginning of your source file .
As another example , let us use the Rope library .
To make it more like strings , one can declareWith this one can just write .
Finally , for a polynomial moduleon the field of the reals , one probably would like to use ( the name of the functions have been chosen to be self - documenting ) :
Then one can use the natural lookingto declare the polynomialwith variablesand .
Note that the library caches the evaluation of constants so there will actually be only a singlefor the entire source file .
To support , wherehas not to be transformed into a polynomial , one has to add a new rule with the constants function from the API
Of course , to avoid putting the OVERLOAD declarations in every source file , one would usually prefer to write a syntax extension module and perform these tasks with the Delimited overloading API .
Macro
Pa_do .
Macro enables macros compatible with delimited overloading — and with other syntax extensions by means of a clear API .
They provide a way write ad - hoc polymorphic code .
They also correct some design flaws of the original macros ( especially the interaction of IFDEF and DEFINE ) .
As a simple example of what macros enable you to do , here is a generic " incrementor " :
DEFINE INCR ( M, x ) = M.( x := !x + 1 )
INCR ( Int , x )
INCR ( Float , x )
+
*
DEFINE RK4 ( M ) = let onesixth =
1 . /. 6 . and onethird = 1 . /. 3 . in fun ? ( n=200 ) f t0 t1 x0 -> let h = ( t1 -. t0 ) /. float n in let xt = Array . make ( n + 1 ) x0 in M. ( for i = 0 to Int . ( n - 1 ) do let ti = t0 +. float i *. h and xi = xt .( i ) in let ti5 = ti +. 0.5 *. h in let k1 = h * f ti xi in let k2 = h * f ti5 ( xi + 0.5 * k1 ) in let k3 = h * f ti5 ( xi + 0.5 * k2 ) in let k4 = h * f ( ti +. h ) ( xi + k3 ) in xt .
( Int . ( i + 1 ) ) pa_infix
The purpose of pa_infix is to be able to say , for any OCaml operator symbol , whether one wants it as prefix , postfix or binary infix .
It also allows to set the associativity and precedence of operators .
The easier way to use it is to use the concrete syntax .
For example to turn <+> into an binary infix operator at the same level as + , you just write in your source code : INFIX ( <+> ) LEVEL ( + ) let ( <+> ) x y = (* definition of the operation *)
To turn ++ into a post operator — thus binding stronger than function application — simply use POSTFIX ( ++ )
You can then , for example , define it with let ( ++ ) x = x + 1 and use it : let z = 3 ++ .
This extension also allows to define purely alphabetical operators ( no digits , no underscore , no prime ) : INFIX subset LEVEL ( && )
Such an operator is used as the standard OCaml alphabetical operators such as lsl : define it with let ( subset ) = ... and use it with a subset x .
Beware that these operators become keywords and can therefore not be used as variable names anymore .
If your definitions may be useful in several source files , we recommend you create a syntax extension module instead and use the API .
Getting the development version and contributing
This project uses bzr as its source control management .
You can download the source and its history with bzr branch http://bzr.ocamlcore.org/pa-do/pa-do/trunk pa-do
You can then hack on the code , commiting your modifications , and then submit your changes with bzr bundle > file .
patch ( and post file .
patch to the one of the trackers ) or bzr send ( and email the bundle to one of the developers ) .
For your convenience , a copy of the history is kept in the SVN repository ( it may be updated slightly less frequently than the bzr repository ) .
Here is more information on how to use bzr with OCamlForge .
You can then use it with , ...
As a more interesting example , here is a generic implementation of a Runge - Kutta scheme of order 4 parametrized by a vector space V ( assuming that " " is overloaded as the vector addition and " " denotes the scalar multiplication with the floats first ) :

Obama ’s swing to right sparks warnings from “ left ” backers
By Bill Van Auken
9 July 2008
The sharp and relentless push to the right by the Senator Barack Obama has evoked a flood of worried responses from some of those who had promoted illusions in Democratic Party ’s presumptive presidential nominee during the protracted primary season .
A series of high - profile statements by Obama , apparently calculated to disassociate himself from what is vaguely referred to as the “ left , ” are the source of this consternation .
In the space of barely a week , the candidate declared his support for a bill that he will vote for this week legalizing the Bush administration ’s massive domestic wiretapping program and giving retroactive immunity to the telecom companies that facilitated it ; opposed a decision by the US Supreme Court opposing the extension of the death penalty to crimes other than homicide and appealed to the Christian right with a pledge of double funding for “ faith - based ” programs .
This embrace of positions associated with the Republican right followed his slavish declaration of support for right - wing Zionism at last month ’s conference of the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC and a series of bellicose statements regarding Afghanistan , Iran and Pakistan .
Finally , on July 3 , the candidate held a news conference that many cast as a retreat from his campaign pledge to withdraw US combat troops from Iraq in 16 months after entering the White House .
Obama stressed that “ the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability , ” while insisting that he would “ continue to refine my policies ” based on information he receives from “ our commanders on the ground . ”
The remarks drew praise this week from the editorial board of the Washington Post , in a lead editorial which declared that the candidate ’s “ softening on his unrealistic withdrawal plan is only sensible . ”
The shift , the Post affirmed constituted a “ real step toward a responsible position on a conflict that , like it or not , involves vital US interests . ”
This position reflects a growing consensus within America ’s ruling establishment that , whatever the divisions over the “ mistake ” of launching the war in the first place , the predatory venture must be made to succeed in the end , furthering “ US interests , ” specifically domination over the strategic energy resources of Iraq .
However , for many of those who , over the course of the more than year - and - a - half - long campaign for the Democratic nomination , portrayed Obama ’s candidacy as a fundamental change in American politics , the candidate ’s new “ sensible ” approach has apparently come as a shock .
Typical is a column Tuesday by Bob Herbert in the New York Times , entitled “ Lurching with abandon . ”
An unabashed supporter of Obama over the course of the primary campaign , Herbert writes , “ Obama ’s strongest supporters are uneasy , upset , dismayed and even angry at the candidate who is now emerging in the bright light of summer . ”
Obama , he continued , “ is not just tacking gently to the center .
He is lurching right when it suits him , and he ’s zigging with the kind of reckless abandon that ’s guaranteed to cause disillusion , if not whiplash . ”
He notes , “ There ’s even concern that he ’s doing the Obama two - step on the issue that has been the cornerstone of his campaign : his opposition to the war in Iraq . ”
Herbert portrays the candidate ’s recent positions as “ clever panders ” based on cynical electoral calculations .
He says that Obama is convinced that “ in the long run none of this will matter , that the most important thing is winning the White House , that his staunchest supporters ( horrified at the very idea of a President McCain ) will be there when he needs them . ”
The Times columnist warns , however , that this is “ a very dangerous game for a man who first turned voters on by presenting himself as someone who was different , who would n’t engage in the terminal emptiness of politics as usual . ”
Herbert ’s colleague at the Times , Frank Rich , penned a column Sunday expressing somewhat less outrage , but similar concerns that Obama may have miscalculated .
“ For all the hyperventilation on the left about Mr. Obama ’s rush to the center — some warranted , some not — what ’s more alarming is how small - bore and defensive his campaign has become , ” writes Rich .
“ Whether he ’s reaffirming his long - held belief in faith - based programs or fudging his core convictions about government snooping , he is drifting away from the leadership he promised and into the focus - group - tested calculation patented by Mark Penn in his disastrous campaign for Hillary Clinton . ”
The implication is clear .
Like Herbert , he fears that the retooling of the Obama campaign in preparation for the general election may alienate large numbers of voters , opposed to the war and deeply hostile to the Bush administration , who had previously viewed him as a political alternative .
The Washington Post ’s liberal columnist E.J. Dionne Jr. expressed particular concern Monday about the perception that Obama had shifted his position on Iraq , noting that the Democratic candidate had been compelled to call a second news conference on July 4 — declaring , “ I intend to end this war ” — in order to clarify remarks made at the first .
“ Obama needs to be careful not to cede the high ground on Iraq , ” Dionne warns .
“ Because Obama ’s strongest argument for himself on foreign policy rests on his sound judgment in opposing the war from the beginning , any appearance of waffling on this issue is especially dangerous . ”
He continues : “ Republicans are pressing Obama on Iraq because they know that any new moves he makes will be interpreted , fairly or not , as a change in position and that this will hurt him with two groups : the antiwar base of the Democratic Party and independent voters , many of whom are just tuning in to the campaign . ”
“ Progressives for Obama ”
Among the more foul responses to Obama ’s lurch to the right came from the former Vietnam War protester and longtime Democratic state legislator Tom Hayden .
Together with Carl Davidson , an ex-Maoist shill for the Democratic Party , Hayden established a group calling itself “ Progressives for Obama . ”
In a July 5 column in the Nation , Hayden acknowledges that Obama ’s “ core position on Iraq has always been more ambiguous than audacious ” while warning that “ as his latest remarks are questioned by the Republicans , the mainstream media and the antiwar movement , ” his candidacy could be placed “ at risk . ”
Hayden goes on to note that Obama ’s position on Iraq has always included the continued deployment in the country of “ counter - terrorism ” units , advisors and military trainers , a force that would number at least 50,000 .
Nonetheless , he states : “ I first endorsed Obama because of the nature of the movement supporting him , not his particular stands on the issues .
The excitement among African - Americans and young people , the audacity of hope , still holds the promise of a new era of social activism . ”
He adds that “ rising expectations ... could pressure a President Obama in a progressive direction . ”
He concludes , “ The challenge for the peace and justice movement is to avoid falling into the Republican divide and conquer traps while maintaining a powerful and independent presence in key electoral states . ”
Among the left liberals who have assiduously promoted illusions in Obama , there are those who are deluding themselves and those who work quite consciously to deceive others .
Hayden clearly falls into the second category .
He supports Obama not because of any misunderstanding of his own about the Democratic candidate ’s program , but because of candidate ’s ability to generate illusions in others .
Rather than seeking to clear up these misconceptions , Hayden works to deepen them in the name of building a movement that can “ pressure ” a right - wing big business politician from the left .
Nothing could more clearly define the politics of cynical opportunism that characterizes the great majority of the so - called left in America .
Worshipers of the accomplished fact , they are mesmerized by the supposed immutability of the two - party system and seek to paint the Democratic Party as some vehicle for effecting progressive social change , despite decades of evidence to the contrary .
As an antidote to Obama ’s turn rightward , Hayden proposes “ a demand that Obama talk to legitimate representatives of the peace movement , not simply hawkish national security advisers . ”
This pathetic proposal is based on the false conception that Obama is merely being pushed to the right by advisers and can be brought back around with a good pep talk from the protesters .
What a fraud !
Obama ’s campaign itself is a creature of these supposed advisers .
His presidential candidacy has been engineered by a section of the political establishment that sees it as an ideal means of putting a new face on discredited American imperialism and carrying out real but quite limited adjustments in American policy after eight years of the Bush administration .
His brief though meteoric political career represents for these forces an empty vessel into which policies are being poured that have nothing to do with peace .
The entire thrust of the politics pursued by the likes of Hayden is to tie those forces seeking a means of fighting against war and social inequality to the Democratic Party and thereby prevent the emergence of a genuine political alternative .
In Hayden ’s view , fighting for such an alternative based on the political independence of the working class and the struggle for socialism means “ falling into the Republican divide and conquer traps . ”
Obama ’s rhetoric about “ change you can believe in , ” his invocations of Martin Luther King ’s “ fierce urgency of now ” and phony concern for the poor have always served to mask a right - wing capitalist program .
When the candidate insists that he has not shifted on Iraq , he is essentially correct .
His promise to “ end the war ” always envisioned the continuation of the US occupation and the pursuit of the war ’s original predatory aims .
His essential difference with McCain is over whether more troops should be shifted from Iraq to Afghanistan to escalate the US war there and potentially extend it into Pakistan .
As for domestic policy , the money that has poured into his campaign coffers from Wall Street , nearly twice the amount donated to his Republican rival John McCain , is based on the clear understanding that an Obama administration will faithfully serve America ’s financial oligarchy .
If the candidate is more openly promoting his right - wing agenda now , it is not in interests of gaining votes .
Over two - thirds of the American people want an end to the war and the overwhelming majority is hostile to the Bush administration ; he does not have to appeal to some vast right - wing constituency .
On the contrary , Obama is making his pitch to the ruling elite , attempting to cast himself as “ presidential , ” i.e. , someone who is prepared to do whatever it takes to defend the interests of American capitalism , both at home and abroad .
McCain's Ties to Neocon Hard Lines Randy Scheunemann , one of John McCain ’s top foreign policy advisers , represents a key link in neoconservative strategy that seeks simultaneously to remove hostile regimes in the Middle East and to box in Russia through an expanded NATO that incorporates former Soviet bloc countries .

Printer friendly Scheunemann has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for his past lobbying work on behalf of the government of Georgia , even while he was advising McCain who vowed to bar lobbyists from his campaign .
Scheunemann ’s company , Orion Strategies , has received about $ 750,000 from Georgia , with payments as recently as May .
After the Aug. 7 outbreak of fighting between Georgia and Russia over Georgia ’s breakaway province of South Ossetia , McCain – advised by Scheunemann – led a crescendo of tough rhetoric warning of a possible new Cold War and demanding harsh penalties against Moscow .
But Scheunemann 's advice on the Russia - Georgia conflict only captures part of his role in shaping McCain ’s neoconservative foreign policy .
Scheunemann merges two key prongs of a neocon global strategy for permanent U.S. military dominance : the simultaneous projection of U.S. power into the Middle East and the elimination of Russia ’s dream of reestablishing itself as a major international player .
Operating mostly behind the scenes , Scheunemann has long worked to unify former East Bloc states into an anti-Moscow alliance and to apply regime - change tactics against U.S. adversaries in the Middle East , such as Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq and the mullahs in neighboring Iran .
In that regard , Scheunemann was one of the neocon operatives who helped promote bogus intelligence about Iraq in the run-up to the U.S. - led invasion .
He also has said the U.S. government has not been tough enough in dealing with other “ rogue ” nations , such as Iran .
For instance , Scheunemann believes one area of U.S. foreign policy that needs change is the ban on assassinating leaders of foreign governments .
“ It makes no sense to regularly target command and control nodes with precision - guided munitions , while denying highly capable sniper teams the ability to attack individual targets , ” Scheunemann told conservative author Bill Gertz in the 2002 book Breakdown .
According to the book , Scheunemann believed the CIA should have been given the authority to assassinate Saddam Hussein during the first Persian Gulf War .
“ The messy business of back - alley tradecraft has taken a back seat to the much simpler business of ‘ liaison ’ with foreign intelligence services , ” Scheunemann told Gertz , adding that he would seek to change that approach if and when he returned to the U.S. government .
A director of the neocon Project for the New American Century , Scheunemann worked on McCain ’s failed bid for the White House in 2000 and became a top adviser to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2001 .
Foreign Contacts
But Scheunemann ’s primary service to the Bush administration has come in his private capacity as a contact to Eastern European states as well as his association with Iraqi exiles .
In fall 2002 , Scheunemann got a green light from the White House to launch the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , an organization whose mission was to promote regime change in the region and to gather European support for a preemptive strike on Iraq .
“ The Committee for the Liberation of Iraq was the brainchild of the Bush administration , ” the Financial Times reported on Dec. 16 , 2002 .
“ It is said that , once the Saddam regime has been overthrown , the CLI will act as a ‘ shadow government ’ for Baghdad .
“ But it will limit itself to policy matters and will not deal with details .
It will , eventually , press for a ‘ competitive petroleum production - sharing regime ’ which could make OPEC irrelevant to Iraq 's oil output or supply decisions . ”
Scheunemann had been an early supporter of Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress , which supplied false intelligence to the CIA about Hussein ’s alleged WMD and his supposed ties to Osama bin Laden .
In 1998 , while an adviser to Republican Senators Bob Dole and Trent Lott , Scheunemann drafted the Iraq Liberation Act and got the federal government to funnel $ 98 million to Iraqi exiles associated with Chalabi ’s INC .
Later , the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq housed its offices at the same address as Chalabi ’s INC .
Scheunemann worked closely , too , with the White House Iraq Group , which was headed by George W. Bush ’s Chief of Staff Andrew Card .
The so - called WHIG was charged with selling the war to the American public .
In November 2002 , the Washington Post reported that Scheunemann ’s group would push for regime change in Iraq through “ sessions with opinion makers , contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe . "
On Jan. 28 , 2003 , the same day that President Bush delivered his State of the Union address that included the now - debunked claim that Iraq had sought yellowcake uranium from Niger , Scheunemann tapped McCain and his close ally , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , as honorary co-chairmen of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq .
“ By joining our efforts , Senators McCain and Lieberman highlight their commitment to ending the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and freeing the Iraqi people , " Scheunemann said in a statement issued by his committee .
McCain and Lieberman aggressively promoted the CLI ’s goal of Iraqi regime change via a preemptive military strike , which was launched on March 19 , 2003 , toppling Hussein ’s government in three weeks .
In an April 13 , 2003 , op - ed in the Los Angeles Times , Scheunemann wrote how a “ democratic Iraq ” would help remake the Middle East , an argument that remains a focal point of McCain ’s presidential campaign .
‘ New Europe ’
But Scheunemann also personifies another part of the neocon agenda .
He is a key bridge between an aggressive U.S. policy in the Middle East and the projection of U.S. influence into the former East Bloc nations which were long dominated by the Soviet Union .
In October 2002 , during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , President Bush considered naming Scheunemann as a special envoy to the Iraqi opposition .
But Scheunemann was judged to have more value enlisting Eastern European nations into the " Coalition of the Willing . ”
So , Scheunemann pulled together the “ Vilnius 10 ” group of East European nations – Slovenia , Slovakia , Romania , Bulgaria , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia , Albania , Croatia and Macedonia – in support of Bush ’s war policy .
At the time , some foreign policy analysts recognized this collaboration as part of the neoconservative desire to build up NATO to circumvent the United Nations Charter , which bars military attacks without UN sanction .
“ With NATO now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven East European nations including the three Baltic states , it is said that both the Bush team and the [ Committee for the Liberation of Iraq ] want the political mechanism of the Atlantic alliance to replace the UN Security Council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major U.S. action outside North America , ” the Financial Times reported on Dec. 16 , 2002 .
“ This is because , unlike the UN Security Council where the French or Russians might block American action , NATO 's political decisions do not require consensus .
Only NATO 's military decisions require consensus . ”
For actual military operations , President Bush made clear he would rely on ad hoc alliances , such as the Iraq War ’s “ Coalition of the Willing . ”
The reward for the “ willing ” Eastern European countries , which the Bush administration called “ New Europe , ” was future inclusion in NATO with the umbrella of its mutual security guarantee that treats an attack on one as an attack on all .
“ Considering the nations - including the Baltic states - signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the European Union , the Scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for Washington and a coup d’etat in Brussels , ” the Baltic Times reported in August 2003 .
Scheunemann ’s crossover between his work on the Iraq invasion and his connections to former East Bloc countries proved lucrative , too .
He advised them that their collaboration on the Iraq War could get them Iraqi reconstruction contracts as well as U.S. support for their entry into NATO .
He earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from countries , such as Romania which paid him $ 175,000 for providing advice on Iraqi reconstruction deals .
For another lobbying client , Latvia , Scheunemann made himself even more valuable .
He helped form the Latvian Builders Strategic Partnership , a consortium for parlaying Latvia ’s support for the Iraq invasion into a cut of the multimillion - dollar reconstruction spending .
Five months after the U.S. - led invasion , Scheunemann met with Peteris Elferts , Latvia ’s parliamentary secretary in the Foreign Ministry and ambassador - at - large for Iraqi policy , and Valdis Birkavs , chairman of the Latvian Builders Strategic Partnership , about constructing an information technology system in Baghdad .
Georgia , another of Scheunemann ’s lobbying clients , also backed the Iraq invasion , contributed troops , and thus counted on Washington ’s support to bring it into NATO .
[ For more on McCain - Scheunemann - Georgia ties , see Washington Post , Aug. 13 , 2008 ]
Though other NATO members , especially “ Old Europe ” nations like France , blocked Georgia ’s admission , Georgia ’s pro-U.S. president Mikheil Saakashvili apparently believed he would have Western backing on Aug. 7 when he launched an offensive against the breakaway province of South Ossetia .
Instead , the Russian military intervened to drive back the Georgian army and then took up security positions inside Georgian territory .
McCain joined with leading neoconservative voices in denouncing the Russian attack .
McCain ’s tough talk about Russia and his insistence that he will only tolerate “ victory ” in Iraq offer an important insight into what his foreign policy would look like if he wins the presidency .
Surrounded by hardcore neoconservatives , like Scheunemann , there is every reason to believe that a McCain administration would continue using force to impose Washington ’s will in the Middle East while engaging in geopolitical brinkmanship against old rivals like Moscow .

For years , with the help of compliant Republicans and frightened Democrats in Congress , President Bush has denied the protections of justice , democracy and plain human decency to the hundreds of men that he decided to label “ unlawful enemy combatants ” and throw into never - ending detention .
Twice the Supreme Court swatted back his imperial overreaching , and twice Congress helped Mr. Bush try to open a gaping loophole in the Constitution .
On Thursday , the court turned back the most recent effort to subvert justice with a stirring defense of habeas corpus , the right of anyone being held by the government to challenge his confinement before a judge .
The court ruled that the detainees being held in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , have that cherished right , and that the process for them to challenge their confinement is inadequate .
It was a very good day for people who value freedom and abhor Mr. Bush ’s attempts to turn Guantánamo Bay into a constitutional - rights - free zone .
The right of habeas corpus is so central to the American legal system that it has its own clause in the Constitution : it can not be suspended except “ when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . ”
Zogby : Obama has electoral college majority ; Barr has 6 % support
A new nationwide poll shows Barack Obama securing a majority of electoral college votes over Republican opponent John McCain in a new state - by - state poll .
The Zogby Interactive online survey also shows Libertarian Candidate Bob Barr shaping up as a substantial factor in this year 's election , pulling 6 percent of the vote .
( He was substantially outperforming then - Green Party candidate Ralph Nader at a similar point in the 2000 campaign )
The poll was conducted June 11 - 30 among more than 46,000 likely voters .
If the election were held today , Obama would win 273 electoral votes , enough to hand him the presidency , according to Zogby 's tally .
McCain would receive 160 electoral votes , leaving 105 up for grabs .
Obama is the choice of 44 percent of voters surveyed , compared to 38 percent who prefer McCain .
Other projections , like the one being maintained at FiveThirty Eight.com , have Obama winning with as many as 308 electoral votes .
Pollster John Zogby said Barr " could really hurt McCain 's chances , " pointing to the former Georgia Republican 's 7 percent support among conservative or very conservative voters , 43 percent support from libertarians and 11 percent showing with independents .
Liberal gadfly Nader , now running as an Independent , is polling at less than 2 percent in the latest survey .
Obama 's campaign has been paying attention to Barr , saying he could help them in states like Alaska and Georgia .
Most observers blamed Nader for siphoning votes from Gore in 2000 , especially in Florida , handing the White House to George W. Bush .
The Zogby poll released Monday shows Barr is now well outperforming Nader at a similar point in the 2000 campaign .
A June 2000 Zogby poll showed Nader receiving about 2 percent of the vote , just a third of Barr 's level of support .
He told a conference of wine economists last week , said : " Restaurants , like all businesses , have strong incentives to embellish their images online .
We turn to experts and awards bodies to help navigate the chaotic world of information and misinformation that results .
If Google , Chowhound and a couple of unanswered phone calls suffice to verify not just the existence of a restaurant but also the authenticity of its wine list , then it 's not clear what role the critic is playing . "
Good To Great is a management book phenomenon that has sold millions of copies since it came out in 2001 and continues to sell at a clip of 300,000 a year .
The book examines 11 companies that went from " good " to " great " .
The lessons from these 11 companies , instilled in business students and managers around the world , are supposed to be a blueprint for future success .
Or , as Amazon puts it , " a well - reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider " .
Well , Steven Levitt , of Freakonomics fame , believes this book points out an even more valuable lesson .
Past performance does not guarantee future results :
Ironically , I began reading the book on the very same day that one of the eleven “ good to great ” companies , Fannie Mae , made the headlines of the business pages .
It looks like Fannie Mae is going to need to be bailed out by the federal government .
If you had bought Fannie Mae stock around the time Good to Great was published , you would have lost over 80 percent of your initial investment .
Another one of the “ good to great ” companies is Circuit City .
You would have lost your shirt investing in Circuit City as well , which is also down 80 percent or more .
Best Buy has cleaned Circuit City ’s clock for the last seven or eight years .

The first shots of what appears to be a renewed Lebanese civil war rang out three days ago as the U.S. - backed government cracked down on Hezbollah , the main opposition party , with a ban on the group ’s private telecommunications network and the attempted ouster of an alleged sympathizer , Brig .
Gen. Wafiq Shuqeir , as overseer of the Beirut airport .
This is plainly meant as a provocation : Hezbollah , which fought off the Israelis during the 2006 war , is not about to give up its communications infrastructure .
After all , it was Hezbollah , not the Lebanese army , that resisted the Israelis when they rained bombs down on Lebanese civilians , killing and maiming thousands , destroying homes , factories , and houses of worship .
The army stayed in its barracks while Hezbollah fought for Lebanon .
But no matter .
The Lebanese government  with the Americans and the Israelis behind it  clearly wants a fight .
That fight is part of a brewing regional battle that would leave the Middle East a cauldron of flame and blood .
This dire prospect does n’t deter the War Party : they have been waiting for this moment for years .
It is their moment of triumph .
As we ordinary folk go about our lives  paying bills , raising children , attending to the mundane and increasingly difficult everyday affairs that dominate our lives  our betters are planning a surprise .
You might call it an October Surprise , although it may take place much sooner  rumor has it as early as summer .
The second chapter in the Great Middle Eastern War is being written , and its authors in Washington have in mind an even more dramatic plot - line than we witnessed in chapter one , which was , of course , the invasion of Iraq .
In the run-up to that conflict , we were told Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , links to al - Qaeda , and was getting ready to wreak havoc on our allies in the region  and even attack the United States .
None of it turned out to be true , as we now know , but , as John McCain says , " we ’re there now , " " we ’re in it to win it "  and winning it apparently means extending the war to Iran .
In a rerun of the cherry - picked " intelligence " - mongering of the pre-Iraq war years , we are being treated to a propaganda campaign that blames Iran for the failure of the " surge , " ignoring the inherent impossibility of subduing an occupied people .
Ever since Judy Miller , the New York Times has been the neocons ’ favorite venue for war propaganda , and now we have a new report from the Old Gray Lady that asserts Hezbollah is training Iraqi militias on the outskirts of Tehran .
Here we have an all - inclusive stew that includes practically all the " bad guys " : Hezbollah , the Iraqi militias , and the Iranians .
If we hear tomorrow that Osama bin Laden himself is personally instructing the attendees of this " training camp " and plotting another 9/11 with their assistance , no one wil be the least bit surprised .
It ’s Halloween in springtime : all the ghouls and goblins are out , haunting and gibbering and howling at the moon .
With U.S. casualties up in the last month and the situation on the ground steadily worsening , the War Party is seizing the opportunity to target Tehran , positioning itself to launch Operation Iranian Freedom under the guise of " defending " our troops in Iraq .
But first comes the provocation , the catalyzing incident that creates a " crisis " atmosphere and inspires our warmongers  and theirs  to act .
Lebanon is a tinderbox , the Balkans of the Middle East , and the " government "  which is not quite a government , since it lacks a president  has lit the fuse .
For 17 months , the two sides have been locked in a confrontation with little prospect for a peaceful resolution , and foreign hands  the Americans , the Israelis , the Iranians , the Syrians , the Saudis  are stirring the pot .
Amid all this tumult and drama , as armed factions engage in street battles and a country that was once the jewel of the Middle East is blackened in the flames of war , what is the American interest ?
What does the United States have to gain by starting World War III ?
The answer is clearly nothing .
War with Iran would put our troops in Iraq at risk and plunge the entire region into chaos : the economic consequences of this alone should be enough to deter us .
Rumors of oil at $ 200 a barrel already have the markets roiling .
Wait until you see what happens to prices when the Persian Gulf is impassable .
Who benefits from such a war ?
Not the Lebanese , who have suffered enough over the years and want only to live in peace .
Not the Iranians , either , who are stumbling under the weight of economic sanctions imposed at the instigation of the Western powers .
And surely not the war - weary American people , who want out of Iraq and have no desire to " liberate " another unwilling candidate for " democratic " emancipation .
Israel ’s lobby in the U.S. has been calling for confrontation with Iran ever since " Mission Accomplished . "
AIPAC , the powerhouse lobby for the Jewish state , has made the Iranian " threat " the centerpiece of its legislative and " educational " agenda .
The Lobby ’s neoconservative allies have been clamoring for a fresh conflict , using their key positions as columnists , publicists , think - tank gurus , and television talking heads to beat the drums for war .
And those neocons still in positions of power in the government , centered in the office of the vice president , have been making the case inside the administration , with some success .
The people of Israel will also be big losers if  or , rather , when  war comes .
The governing elites , on the other hand , have plenty to gain .
In both Israel and the U.S. , where pressing economic problems and continuing scandals threaten their grip on power , the elites will have a welcome respite from having to explain their failures , and a new " enemy " to pin the blame on .
The rulers of both countries desperately want to change the subject , diverting the rising tide of anger away from themselves by conjuring up an external " threat . "
Both regimes are in the midst of a political crisis and could use a good old - fashioned war to channel the frustrations and pent up hostility of their long - suffering citizens in a convenient direction .
It ’s the oldest trick in the book  and it ’s working .
We are in the midst of a presidential campaign season , yet not a single major candidate has pointed with alarm to the rather obvious fact that we are on the brink of a major military conflict .
Indeed , two of them have welcomed this prospect , while the third  the Democratic front - runner , who owes his status to his antiwar credentials  has addressed the subject only indirectly .
It ’s like one of those dreams where you scream and no sound comes out , so that none can hear your cries for help .
Peace advocates might as well be living ghosts , whose hands pass through solid matter and whose voices merge with the sighing of the wind .
We are invisible and unheard : the Silenced Majority .
Dems on bailout : Include homeowners
Democrats are drafting a joint House - Senate bill to expedite action on the Treasury Department ’s $ 700 billion rescue plan for the financial markets but want the government to use its new leverage to slow foreclosures and cap compensation for the Wall Street chiefs whose companies are being bailed out .
There will be provisions as well in either the core bill or side deals asking the White House to accept new economic stimulus spending and bankruptcy court relief for homeowners , a legal issue long opposed by bankers yet now championed by leading Senate Democrats as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .

But House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) said he was prepared to move quickly next week in tandem with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
And Frank said he has assured Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that he will publicly support them if they decide that they must take further ad hoc steps before the final package is completed .
“ I called Ben and said , ' Just because I ’m giving you a new gun , does n’t mean I do n’t want you to use the one in your holster , ' ” Frank told Politico .
This assurance reflects the immense sensitivity of the political and market situation , given the turmoil of the past week .
While not predicting the need for more ad hoc interventions , a Treasury official said “ the markets may not wait for Congress to act . ”
And Paulson , who appears to have encouraged Frank to call Bernanke , is pushing hard for lawmakers to move quickly .
In this spirit , the Treasury draft bill is short and to the point : authorizing purchases of up to $ 700 billion in mortgage - related assets at any given time and giving the department sweeping authority for at least two years to carry out the enterprise .
Frank will clearly add more to the dozen sections penned by Paulson ’s legislative office and delivered to Capitol Hill early Saturday morning .
How far he and fellow Democrats can go and not drive off Republican conservatives will be a critical question in the week ahead .
“ The Administration has requested that Congress authorize , in very short order , sweeping and unprecedented powers for the Treasury Secretary to confront a financial crisis of historic proportions , ” Pelosi said in a statement late Saturday .
“ “ Democrats will work with the Administration to ensure that our response to events in the financial markets is swift , but we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street and keep people in their homes by reducing mortgage foreclosures
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) followed Pelosi last evening , saying that the “ American people have every right to be outraged that we are at this point .
But Reid cautioned “ We can not allow ourselves to be in denial about the threat now facing the world economy .
From all indications , that threat is real , and the consequences of inaction could be catastrophic . "
Reid promised to work with Treasury but asked in turn that the White House and Republicans “ work with us to address the crisis facing the middle class .
Democrats believe we must provide real relief to working families before we adjourn . "
Frank said there is a strong sense that the government should use its leverage to prod investors to be more willing to write down mortgages rather than pursue foreclosures .
The massive housing bill approved by Congress this summer held out the promise that the Federal Housing Administration could help a homeowner find government - insured refinancing and such write - downs .
But the relief will never be realized unless the financing industry is more willing to come forward and negotiate reductions .
Frank , who has been in phone discussions with Paulson , said the secretary appeared receptive to adding some foreclosure - relief language .
The second Democratic proposal — to impose compensation limits on Wall Street executives — is meeting more resistance .
“ Hank says it ’s a poison pill , ” Frank said .
“ I say I do n’t think it ’s very patriotic for someone to not give up his golden parachute when we ’re trying to save the markets . ”
As now drafted , the bill increases the U.S. debt ceiling to $ 11.3 trillion to help accommodate the financing arrangement , but further modifications may be needed to ensure that this extra borrowing authority is dedicated to the rescue plan and not eaten up by other spending .
All of the purchases would be limited to assets held by financial institutions headquartered in the United States .
But Treasury officials said Saturday that this would also apply to American subsidiaries of foreign companies , leading Frank to argue that those governments should also share in the financial commitment now being shoulder by U.S. taxpayers .
Apart from the price tag , the bill is striking in the authority that would be vested in the Treasury Department .
Rather than create a separate entity , as some lawmakers have suggested , Paulson clearly feels that he can move faster alone and asks for power to issue such regulations as needed , appoint employees to carry out the authorities and designate “ financial institutions as finance agents of the government . ”
The secretary would have the authority to manage the mortgage - related assets purchased by the government and may “ at any time , upon terms and conditions and at prices determined ” by him “ sell or enter into securities loans , repurchase transactions or other financial transactions ” in regard to the purchased assets .
The hope remains that , by reselling the assets when the housing and financial markets have recovered , the taxpayers ’ exposure will be greatly reduced .
And for this reason , the two - year sunset provision does not appear to apply to the department ’s authority to hold onto assets after two years , and therefore better manage future sales .
It is possible that Congress could shorten the window for purchases still further in order to prompt banks to come forward faster with their bad debts .
But learning from the experience of the Resolution Trust Corporation in the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and early '90s , there is general agreement that the government should have flexibility about selling .
Paulson and Bernanke are slated to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday , but that schedule may also be moved up given the pressure to move quickly .
And the whole process is extraordinary in that the administration wants such quick action on such a large commitment by taxpayers .
Punctuating this is the fact that the bill has a rather delayed schedule of reporting back to Congress .
For example , the first report from Treasury need only be “ within three months of the first exercise of the purchase authority . ”
That could mean almost Christmas .
In a conference call with reporters Saturday , Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) said there is discussion of creating a “ supervisory authority ” to report back to Congress on the Treasury bailout program , but he declined to discuss too many details on that effort at this point .
Schumer , who also spoke to Paulson on Saturday , said Congress must move quickly .
“ This crisis is very , very serious , ” Schumer said .
“ It not only affects Wall Street but all of America — people with credit cards , auto loans , the whole economy . ”
After a dramatic Capitol meeting Thursday night , Paulson and Bernanke won pledges of bipartisan support .
And true to this commitment , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) predicted Friday the full House will vote by the end of next week .
At the White House , President Bush said Saturday morning it was “ necessary to get something done quickly ” and predicted that Congress would do so .
" Look , I 'm sure there are some of my friends saying , ' I thought this guy was a market guy — what happened to him ? ' "
Bush said .
" Well , my first instinct was n't to , you know , lay out a huge government plan .
My first instinct was to let the market work , until I realized , being briefed by the experts of how significant this problem became .
And so , I decided to act and act boldly .
“ It turns out that there 's a lot of interlinks through the financial system .
The system had grown to a point where a lot of people were dependent upon each other and a collapse of one part of the system would n't just affect a part of the financial markets , it would affect ... capacity to borrow money , to buy a house or to finance a college loan .
It 'd affect the ability of a small business to get credit .
In other words , the systemic risk was significant and it required a significant response .
And Congress understands that and we 'll work to get things done as quickly as possible . ”
Mindful of the huge financial commitment , Hoyer and other Democrats have been careful to underscore the fact that the massive government intervention is very much a “ Bush administration ” plan that the president and Republicans must own up to politically .
And playing to the left in her caucus , Pelosi ended a party conference call Friday with a strong attack on the administration ’s economic record .
For Republicans , it may be even more complicated , since just days ago many conservatives were in revolt over the government ’s intervention to shore up the ailing insurance giant , AIG , at a price tag of just $ 85 billion .
And Paulson has had his own troubles with the House Republican leadership in the past .
But thus far , House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) has been supportive , and the more interesting tensions have been between different factions on the right .
Rep. Jeb Hensarling , a Texas conservative with leadership ambitions , has been among those most outspoken , skirmishing with Paulson in a party conference phone call .
“ My fear is that taxpayers will be left with the mother of all debts , the federal government becomes the lender and guarantor of last resort , and our nation finds itself on the slippery slope to socialism , ” Hensarling said Friday .
But other conservatives have tempered their remarks .
" What 's going on right now is an education process , " said Rep. John Campbell ( R - Calif . ) , who is typically outspoken .
" We need to take dramatic , complete and immediate action . "
New guidelines would give FBI broader powers RAW STORY
Published : Thursday August 21 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON  A Justice Department plan would loosen restrictions on the Federal Bureau of Investigation to allow agents to open a national security or criminal investigation against someone without any clear basis for suspicion , Democratic lawmakers briefed on the details said Wednesday .
The plan , which could be made public next month , has already generated intense interest and speculation .
Little is known about its precise language , but civil liberties advocates say they fear it could give the government even broader license to open terrorism investigations .
Congressional staff members got a glimpse of some of the details in closed briefings this month , and four Democratic senators told Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey in a letter on Wednesday that they were troubled by what they heard .

One of France 's most iconic cars , the Citroen 2CV , is celebrating its 60th birthday this October .
The BBC's Emma Jane Kirby in Paris has been looking at how this vehicle revolutionised the French motor industry .
Your pictures : The 2CV Some may dismiss it as nothing more than an old tin can .
The BBC Top Gear programme 's Jeremy Clarkson wrote it off as a " weedy , useless little engine " .
But enthusiasts like Xavier Audran who owns a dozen of them , worships the 2CV " not just as a car , but as a way of life " .
It may be 18 years since the 2CV went out of production , but Mr Audran is adamant that its charm has never gone out of fashion .
His maroon 2CV is illegally parked in the middle of the pavement by the Paris canal but he laughs when I suggest he is asking for a fine .
" Usually , 2 CV owners do n't get tickets .
Policeman just smile .
Almost everybody in France had a 2 CV at some time in their youth - so they 're nostalgic and not angry with us , " Mr Audran says .
' Umbrella on wheels '
In 1948 , when the Deux Chevaux first appeared at the Paris car show , it was hard for motoring enthusiasts to get excited about this odd - looking little car .
Please turn on JavaScript .

It had one headlight , no starter motor and even its own designer , Pierre Jules Boulanger , admitted it looked like an umbrella on wheels .
It was originally destined as a cheap country round - around for farmers , designed to be able to carry four people ( or sheep ) and a basket of eggs across a ploughed field without breaking any shells ... or indeed bones .
But its cheapness meant that the low - income segment of the French population could afford one , and soon there was a waiting list of five years .
Economical on fuel , cheap to repair with an almost indestructible air - cooled engine and with a comically soft suspension that made it springy enough to bump along off road , the 2CV was the perfect family holiday car .
Its removable back seats handily doubled up as a picnic bench , saving generations of skirts and trousers from unsightly grass stains .
' Symbol of France '
These days it is fairly rare to see this most quintessentially French vehicle trundling along the roads .
But in Paris , a fleet of 2CVs offers sightseeing trips to tourists .
Florent Dargnies says driving the 2CV is " an experience in itself " Florent Dargnies , who runs such tours , says the Deux Chevaux is the epitome of Gallic charm .
" The 2CV is a symbol of France , I mean like the Eiffel Tower or the French baguette , " Mr Dargnies says .
" When you are in a 2 CV you escape .
It is an experience in itself .
Its an adventure , and you feel like you 're in a cosy cocoon . "
' Indestructible '
France is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the 2CV with a special exhibition of the car at the Cite des Sciences et de L'industrie in Paris .
The fascinating display takes the visitor through the birth of the Deux Chevaux , with one of the five remaining examples of an abandoned early production run from 1939 , and follows the car through its numerous renaissances and modifications .
Wistful ex-owners stroke the exhibits fondly , reminiscing about their 2 CV salad days .
The standing 2CV joke was that it managed to do 0 to 60 km in one day Only five million 2 CV cars were ever sold , but no - one knows how many people were 2CV owners - the little car was so tough that it rarely needed repairs and was the perfect hand - me - down vehicle .
Perhaps , its indestructibility was its downfall - a car which never needed spare parts was not going to make big profits for manufacturers .
Its lack of vroom also became a bit of problem in the modern age of speed .
The standing 2 CV joke was that it managed to do 0 to 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) in one day .
I remember driving with my French friend Francoise in our university holidays in Devon - her 2CV happily took us to the beach but - at the first sign of a hill - I had to get out and help push her up .
The Deux Chevaux is often unfairly accused , however , of earning its name because it only had a two - horse power capacity - in fact it had an eight - chevaux capacity and its name refers to the very low tax category into which it fell .
Mr Audran will not hear a word said against his favourite French car .
He has been all over Europe in his various 2CVs , and this summer is off to attend a 2CV convention in Italy .
What other car , he asks me , can do 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the gallon , has a soft top and never suffers from electrical faults ?
His friend , he boasts , has even carried his donkey in his 2CV with its head sticking out of the roof .
Jeremy Clarkson may laugh but the truth is that the humble Deux Chevaux - designed to replace the horse and cart for farmers - revolutionised the French motor industry .

What are these ?
One of the most perplexing , and to some irritating , aspects of Wittgenstein 's later philosophy is his apparent insistence that he is not putting forward philosophical theses , or making any claim with which others could possibly disagree or which it is possible to dispute .
It can be hard to see how this can be understood as anything other than an attempt by Wittgenstein to privilege his own conceptions of meaning or of psychological phenomena , or as a claim to the absolute and indisputable correctness of his observations on rules , understanding , sensations , the propositions of mathematics , and so on .
The idea that Wittgenstein 's later philosophy is in some way implicitly dogmatic has been encouraged by interpretations , such as the one developed in great detail by Peter Hacker and Gordon Baker in their commentary on the Philosophical Investigations , which hold that Wittgenstein does not put forward theses insofar as he is merely describing the rules for the use of expressions ; his remarks are held to be indisputable insofar as anyone who understands the relevant expressions must agree to Wittgenstein 's descriptions , and recognize that any deviation from them inevitably results in nonsense .
On this conception of it , the kind of conceptual investigation that Wittgenstein is engaged in results in the articulation of the grammatical rules implicit in our use of expressions , and provides a base from which unanswerable criticisms of the use that philosophers make of the expressions of our language can be mounted .
Wittgenstein's idea that his aim is to make philosophical problems ' completely disappear ' is , on this interpretation , taken to be equivalent to an intention to show that they one and all depend upon a demonstrably deviant , and therefore nonsensical , employment of words .
In the late 1990s , Gordon Baker came to believe that the approach that he and Hacker had taken to Wittgenstein 's later philosophy was fundamentally misconceived , and he began to develop an interpretation that departed radically from the one presented in their commentary .
Oskari Kuusela was a pupil of Gordon Baker 's and he shares his conviction that the later philosophy can only be understood if Wittgenstein 's struggle to avoid precisely the sort of dogmatism that characterizes the approach he took with Hacker in their commentary is made absolutely central to it .
Kuusela 's book may be seen , at least in part , as a continuation of Baker 's project to provide a critique of interpretations that fail to recognize that the key to understanding Wittgenstein 's later thought lies in appreciating that his principal concern is to overcome the urge to dogmatize in philosophy .
Pace Hacker , statements that our use of a particular expression is governed by a given rule , or that a given rule for the use of a word represents the bounds of sense , constitute substantial , and therefore questionable , philosophical claims ; attributing such statements to Wittgenstein goes against the rejection of philosophical dogmatism which , according to Baker and Kuusela , defines his later approach to philosophy .
It is hard to imagine a more subtle , careful or rigorous working out of what goes wrong when interpreters fall into extracting from Wittgenstein 's text claims about how a word must be used , about how philosophy must be done , about what can or cannot be said , and so on .
However , Kuusela 's aim is not only to show how such interpretations miss what is most original and fundamental in Wittgenstein 's later work , but also to present an alternative account of what the later Wittgenstein means when he says that he is not advancing philosophical theses .
Although Kuusela 's principal concerns are with the interpretation of the later philosophy , he shares Cora Diamond 's view that to understand the later philosophy you need to understand the nature of Wittgenstein 's criticisms of the Tractatus , and how he responds to what he sees as the problems with his own early work .
He argues that Hacker 's misreading of the later work begins in a misunderstanding of the early work , and of the way in which Wittgenstein believes it goes wrong .
It is not only that Hacker 's view that Wittgenstein shifts from a realist to an anti-realist conception of necessity , or from believing that the rules that govern the use of expressions are hidden and need to be brought out by analysis to the idea that they are fully manifest in our everyday use of words , misrepresents both the early and the later philosophy .
It is also that , having failed to identify the kind of criticism Wittgenstein later makes of the Tractatus , Hacker also fails to see how the interpretation of the later work that he develops repeats the very errors that Wittgenstein detects in his early work and is struggling to overcome .
Kuusela agrees with Diamond that Wittgenstein believes the real problem with the Tractatus is not that it attempts to ground what are seen as the essential features of language in essential features of reality , but that it is committed to the idea of an essence of representation , that is , to the idea that there is a once and for all answer to the question what the logical order of any language in which thoughts about the world are expressed must be .
It is the dogmatism of his early thought that Wittgenstein is later critical of and which he is responding to in the methodological developments which , according to Kuusela , define the shift to the later work .
The fundamental problem with Hacker 's approach to the later philosophy , Kuusela argues , is that it remains wedded to a conception of language and of philosophical investigation , which , from the early 1930s onwards , Wittgenstein is self - consciously attempting to shed .
Kuusela offers his own distinctive and compelling account of the reflections that lead Wittgenstein from his early dogmatism to the undogmatic approach of the later work .
In the Tractatus , Kuusela argues , Wittgenstein attempts to find a solution to all philosophical problems once and for all , by solving what he sees as the single fundamental problem : the problem of the essence of a proposition .
The solution to the fundamental problem finds its expression in the general form of a proposition , which determines in advance what form the analysis of any proposition must take .
The conception of the correct method of philosophy , which Wittgenstein describes in 6.53 , is a dogmatic claim that philosophy must take the form of a critique of language , and that this critique must take the form of an analysis of propositions into truth - functions of elementary propositions that are concatenations of simple names .
Insofar as all philosophical problems arise out of a misunderstanding of the logic of language , Wittgenstein believes that in articulating this conception of philosophy , and the method of analysis on which it rests , he has thereby solved , in essentials , all the problems of philosophy .
Kuusela argues that , although the Tractatus has broken with a metaphysical tradition that assumes it is possible to state in a proposition what the essence of a proposition is , Wittgenstein remains committed to the idea that propositions have a shared nature , which can be expressed in the form of a variable , which determines in advance what form the analysis of any proposition must take , and which provides the foundation for his conception of the nature of philosophy .
One of the problems with Hacker 's version of the later philosophy is that it merely conceives of the logic -- or grammar -- of our language as more complex than Wittgenstein had supposed in the Tractatus ; Hacker remains committed to the idea that our language has an implicit grammatical structure that it is the task of philosophy to elucidate , to the claim that all philosophical problems can be dissolved by making the grammar of our concepts clear , and to the idea that Wittgenstein 's conception of philosophy is grounded in , and justified by , a conception of the essence of language .
Kuusela 's aim is to show that the later philosophy is motivated by a concern to avoid any dogmatic claim about what philosophy is , about how it must be done , about the essence of a given concept , or about how expressions must be used .
He does not dispute that Wittgenstein 's aim is to dissolve philosophical problems by coming to understand the uses or roles of the expressions of our language .
However , he claims that there is no attempt to ground or justify this philosophical approach by appeal to a conception of the essence of language .
He argues that Wittgenstein 's remarks on the practice of philosophy are to be understood as describing nothing more than how he proceeds , and that he does not attempt to ground or justify his procedure ; the test of it lies entirely in its power to dispel particular philosophical problems and eliminate particular philosophical paradoxes .
In the early 1930s , Kuusela argues , Wittgenstein came to realize that the possible uses of language are far too complex to be captured in any particular set of rules .
However , this does not mean that the task of clarification in which he is engaged does not involve articulating rules for the use of expressions , rather it means that Wittgenstein now recognizes the status of the rules that he articulates : the rule -- for example , ' the meaning of a word is its use in the language ' -- serves as a prototype , that is , as a model or way of presenting an aspect of our use of words , for example , of how we use the word ' means ' .
There is no longer any suggestion that the rule covers all uses of the relevant expression , rather the rule is put forward as an object of comparison , as something which can be used to shed light on our actual use of a word by means of both similarities and dissimilarities .
The dogmatism of the Tractatus , Kuusela claims , consists in taking what is merely a method of presenting the object of investigation -- the idea of a proposition as a picture -- for the object of investigation itself , and projecting what are merely essential properties of the model onto reality .
For Kuusela , the key to the transition from the early to the later philosophy lies in Wittgenstein 's recognition of the role of prototypes , examples and analogies in philosophy : they provide a way of looking at things that can be used to throw a new light on our use of concepts .
There is no claim that these objects of comparison provide correct descriptions of a system of grammatical rules that is held to govern our employment of expressions ; rather they are used to relieve the mental cramps caused by an entrenched way of looking at things ; it is a matter of using one representation of the use of language to combat the pathological effects of another .
That 's why Wittgenstein can give up a particular representation of the use of a word , with which someone disagrees , and employ some other object of comparison : there never was a claim that a rule that Wittgenstein articulates is one by which speakers of the language proceed , or that it defines the absolute limits of sense .
Kuusela works out this account of the later philosophy , and how it emerges from Wittgenstein 's criticisms of the Tractatus , in great detail and with careful attention to the scholarly evidence provided by the Nachlass .
He focuses particularly on the question whether Wittgenstein is committed to any essentialist claims about language , for example , that it is essentially rule - governed , or that a word has a meaning only insofar as it has a rule - governed use .
He tries to show that Wittgenstein does not make any claim about the necessary conditions for meaning , but merely offers a characteristic picture of a word 's meaning that helps us overcome the problems created by a referentialist conception .
He also considers whether the later Wittgenstein is committed to a particular -- conventionalist -- view of the nature of necessity , and again argues that he remains philosophically neutral on the source of necessity .
The idea that necessary connections are grammatical conventions is , it is argued , merely a clarifying model , or object of comparison , that can be used to shed light on our use of statements of necessity .
He tries to show that it is precisely by not taking sides in any philosophical dispute that Wittgenstein 's method offers the hope of doing justice to the immensely complex phenomenon that is our linguistic practice , and of achieving clarity about various aspects of our everyday life with language that are the focus for philosophical problems and paradoxes .
Overall the book articulates and defends a conception of Wittgenstein 's philosophy very far removed from the one put forward by Hacker and Baker in their commentary ; one on which Wittgenstein 's relation to contemporary philosophical thought becomes both more complex and more indirect .
Important aspects of the conception are , as Kuusela acknowledges , already familiar in the literature , but by focusing so precisely on the question of dogmatism and what Wittgenstein means by saying that he does not put forward any philosophical theories or explanations , Kuusela has undertaken an important clarificatory task , and the story he tells represents a real contribution to the discussion of how Wittgenstein 's philosophy is to be interpreted .

Bacon .
Tofu .
Two proteins on the opposite ends of the food social scale .
One is revered , serenaded , hailed as the food of the Gods .
The other is reviled , sneered at , as being bland , boring , even disgusting .
When I saw this conflict depicted as bendable figurines ( via Serious Eats ) I had to do something to end this conflict .
The only reason why tofu is put down is because of its mishandling by well meaning but unskilled cooks who focused only on its healthy benefits .
There are plenty of Westerners who hate tofu , but you 'd be hard put to find many Asians who do .
That is becase in eastern Asian cuisines , tofu is infused with other flavors , as it should be .
So , back to the bacon and tofu .
This is actually not an uncommon dish in Japanese households .
It 's called either just bacon tofu ( or tofu bacon ) or even bacon tofu steak .
The salty bacon-ness of the bacon infuses the bland tofu , and the two marry together to become a tasty morsel that 's good hot or cold .
It 's salty - crispy on the outside , soft on the inside .
( Yes , it 's good for bento - here is one that features it ! )
Bacon wrapped tofu
1 block firm tofu
Several strips of bacon , depending on the size .
A leaner type bacon is preferred .
You can even use proscuitto .
Optional : brown sugar , soy sauce
Drain the tofu , and wrap in several layers of paper towels .
Place on a plate and put a board or another plate on top .
Leave for a few minutes to drain some water out of the tofu .
Unwrap and cut into bite sized pieces that are about the width of your bacon .
Wrap each piece in bacon , going around at least once so the ends overlap .
You may need to cut the bacon .
Heat up a non -stick frying pan over medium - high heat .
Put the bacon wrapped tofu pieces with the overlapping edges side down .
Cook until crisp , then turn .
Keep cooking and turning until done on all sides .
A sweet - salty variation is to add a little bit of soy sauce to the pan , and a sprinkle ( maybe about 2 tsp. ) of brown sugar ; stir rapidly to melt the sugar , then turn the bacon - tofu in the sauce until the moisture has largely evaporated .
Eat hot or at room temperature , preferably with plain rice as part of a Japanese meal .
Also a nice appetizer or sake drinking accompaniment .
( Addendum :
If you are visiting from Chow.com , howdy !
Just to make it clear , I have nothing to do with that suggestion to combine a veggie burger with bacon and call it the " Hypocrite " ( !!)
That sort of statement is like , so not me . )

Once I ’ve got a set of features there that I consider feature complete I ’ll freeze the “ v1 ” so that people can create mashups based on that and be sure that the API will remain stable .
This does do capitalization correction , but does not do redirect detection .
I ’m debating if I want to do that by default or use another REST path since it requires another couple DB queries and is as such a little slower .
There are three basic facts to keep in mind about the smokin ’ little war in Ossetia :
1. The Georgians started it .
2 . They lost .
3 . What a beautiful little war !
For me , the most important is # 3 , the sheer beauty of the video clips that have already come out of this war .
I ’m in heaven right now .
Of course , if you want to get all serious and actually study up on Ossetia , North and South , and Georgia and the whole eternal gang war that they call the Caucasus , you can check out a column I did on that school - hostage splatter in Beslan , North Ossetia , a few years back .
But for me , right now , I say let ’s stick to the action .
This is the war of my dreams — both sides using air forces !
How often do you see that these days ?— so I ’ll skip the history .
Just remember that South Ossetia is a little apple - shaped blob dangling from Russian territory down into Georgia , and most of it has been under control of South Ossetian irregulars backed by Russian “ peacekeepers ” for the last few years .
The Georgians did n’t like that .
You do n’t give up territory in that part of the world , ever .
The Georgians have always been fierce people , good fighters , not the forgiving type .
In fact , I ca n’t resist a little bit of history here : remember when the Mongols wiped out Baghdad in 1258 , the biggest slaughter in any of their conquests ?
Nobody knows how many people were killed , but it was at least 200,000 — a pretty big number in the days before antibiotics made life cheap .
The smell was so bad the Mongols had to move their camp upwind .
Well , the most enthusiastic choppers and burners in the whole massacre were the Georgian Christian troops in Hulagu Khan ’s army .
Wore out their hacking arms on those Baghdadi civilians .
So : hard people on every side in that part of the world .
No quarter asked or given .
No good guys .
Especially not the Georgians .
They have a rep as good people , one - on - one , but you do n’t want to mess with them and you especially do n’t want to try to take land from them .
The Georgians bided their time , then went on the offensive , Caucasian style , by pretending to make peace and all the time planning a sneak attack on South Ossetia .
They just signed a treaty granting autonomy to South Ossetia this week , and then they attacked , Corleone style .
Georgian MLRS units barraged Tskhinvali , the capital city of South Ossetia ; Georgian troops swarmed over Ossetian roadblocks ; and all in all , it was a great , whiz - bang start , but like Petraeus asked about Iraq way back in 2003 , what ’s the ending to this story ?
As in : how do you invade territory that the Russians have staked out for protection without thinking about how they ’ll react ?
Saakashvili just did n’t think it through .
One reason he overplayed his hand is that he got lucky the last time he had to deal with a breakaway region : Ajara , a tiny little strip of Black Sea coast in southern Georgia .
This is a place smaller than some incorporated Central Valley towns , but it declared itself an “ autonomous ” republic , preserving its sacred basket - weaving traditions or whatever .
You just have to accept that people in the Caucasus are insane that way ; they ’d die to keep from saying hello to the people over the next hill , and they ’re never going to change .
The Ajarans are n’t even ethnically different from Georgians ; they ’re Georgian too .
But they ’re Muslims , which means they have to have their own Lego parliament and Tonka - Toy army and all the rest of that Victorian crap , and their leader , a wack job named Abashidze ( Goddamn Georgian names ! ) volunteered them to fight to the death for their worthless independence .
Except he was such a nut , and so corrupt , and the Ajarans were so similar to the Georgians , and their little “ country ” was so tiny and ridiculous , that for once sanity prevailed and the Ajarans refused to fight , let themselves get reabsorbed by that Colussus to the North , mighty Georgia .
Well , like I ’ve said before , there ’s nothing as dangerous as victory .
Makes people crazy .
Saakashvili started thinking he could gobble up any secessionist region — like , say , South Ossetia .
But there are big differences he was forgetting — like the fact that South Ossetia is n’t Georgian , has a border with Russia , and is linked up with North Ossetia just across that border .
The road from Russia to South Ossetia is pretty fragile as a line of supply ; it goes through the Roki Tunnel , a mountain tunnel at an altitude of 10,000 feet .
I have to wonder why the Georgian air force — and it ’s a good one by all accounts — did n’t have as its first mission in the war the total zapping of the South Ossetian exit of that tunnel .
Or if you do n’t trust the flyboys , send in your special forces with a few backpacks full of HE .
There are a lot of ways to cripple a tunnel .
Hell , do it low - tech : drive a fuel truck in there , with a car following , jackknife the truck halfway through with a remote control or timing fuse — truck driver gets out and strolls to the car , one fast U - turn and you ’re out and back in Georgia , just in time to see a ball of flame erupt from the tunnel exit .
And rebuilding a tunnel way up in the mountains is not an easy or a fast job .
Sure , the Russians could resupply by air , but that ’s a much , much tougher job and would at least slow down the inevitable .
Weird , then , that as far as I know the Georgians did n’t even try to blast that tunnel .
I do n’t go in for this kind of long - distance micromanaging of warfare , because there ’s usually a good reason on the ground for tactical decisions ; it ’s the strategic decisions that are really crazy most of the time .
But this one I just do n’t get .
Most likely the Georgians just thought the Russians would n’t react .
They were doing something they learned from Bush and Cheney : sticking to best - case scenarios , positive thinking .
The Georgian plan was classic shock ’n’awe with no hard , grown - up thinking about the long term .
Their shiny new army would go in , zap the South Ossetians while they were on a peace hangover ( the worst kind ) , and then…uh , they ’d be welcomed as liberators ?
Sure , just like we were in Iraq .
Man , you pay a price for believing in Bush .
The Georgians did .
They thought he ’d help .
And I just saw the little creep on TV , sitting in the stands watching the US - China basketball game .
( Weird game — the Chinese were taller , muscled the boards inside but could n’t shoot from outside .
Not what you expect from foreign b- ball teams at all . )
I did n’t even recognize Bush at first , just wondered why they kept doing close - ups of this guy who looked like Hank Hill ’s legless dad up in the stands .
Then they said it was the Prez .
They talk about people “ growing in office ” ; well , he shrunk .
And the more he shrinks , the more you pay for believing in him .
The Georgians were naïve because they were so happy to get out from the Soviets , the Russians ’ old enemy , the US , must be paradise .
So they did their apple - polishing best to be the perfect obedient little ally .
Then we ’d let them into NATO and carpet - bomb them with SUVs and ipods .
Their part of the deal was simple : they sent troops to Iraq .
First a contingent of 850 , then a surprisingly huge 2000 men .
When you consider the population of Georgia is less than five million , that ’s a lot of troops .
In fact , Georgia is the third - biggest contributor to the “ Coalition of the Willing , ” after the US and Britain .
You might be thinking , Wow , not a good time to have so many of your best troops in Iraq , huh ?
Well , that ’s true and it goes for a lot of countries — like us , for instance — but at least we ’re not facing a Russian invasion .
The Georgians are so panicked they just announced they ’re sending half their Iraqi force home , and could the USAF please give ’em a lift ?
We ’ll probably give them a ride , but that ’s about all we can do .
We ’ve already done plenty , not because we love Georgians but to counterbalance the Russian influence down where the new oil pipeline ’s staked out .
The biggest American aid project was the GTEP , “ Georgia Train and Equip ” project ( $ 64 million ) .
It featured 200 Special Forces instructors teaching fine Georgia boys all the lessons the US Army ’s learned recently .
Now here ’s the joke — and military history is just one long series of mean jokes .
We were stressing counterinsurgency skills : small - unit cohesion , marksmanship , intelligence .
The idea was to keep Georgia safe from Chechens or other Muslim loonies infiltrating through the Pankisi Gorge in NE Georgia .
And we did a good job .
The Georgian Army pacified the Pankisi in classic Green - Beret style .
The punch line is , the Georgians got so cocky from that success , and from their lovefest with the Bushies in DC , that they thought they could take on anybody .
What they ’re in the process of finding out is that a light - infantry CI force like the one we gave them is n’t much use when a gigantic Russian armored force has just rolled across your border .
The American military ’s response so far has been all talk , and pretty damn stupid talk at that .
A Pentagon spokes - thingy called Russia ’s response “ disproportionate . ”
What the Hell are they talking about ?
They ’ve been watching too many cop shows .
Cops have this doctrine of “ minimum necessary force , ” not that they actually operate that way unless there are video cameras around .
Armies never , ever had that policy , because it ’s a good way to get your troops killed needlessly .
The whole idea in war is to fight as unfairly and disproportionately as possible .
If you ’ve got it , you use it .
Thank God we never fought “ proportionately ” in Viet Nam .
The French tried that , because they never had much of an air force , and got wiped out .
By the time the French withdrew from Indochina , their Lefty Prime Minister , Mendes - France , made a big show of promising peace withing 30 days of taking office — and his commanders in Indochina said privately , “ I do n’t think we can hold out that long . ”
That ’s what fighting “ proportionately ” gets you : Dien Bien Phu .
If you want a translation , luckily I speak fluent Pentagon .
So what “ disproportionate ” means is — well , imagine that you ’re watching some little hanger - on who tags along with you get his ass whipped by a bully , and you say , “ That ’s inappropriate ! ” I mean , instead of actually helping him .
That ’s what “ disproportionate ” means from the Pentagon : “ We ’re not going to lift a finger to help you , but hey , we ’re with you in spirit , little buddy ! ”
The quickest way to see who ’s winning in any war is to see who asks first for a ceasefire .
And this time it was the Georgians .
Once it was clear the Russians were going to back the South Ossetians , the war was over .
Even Georgians were saying , “ To fight Russia by ourselves is insane . ”
Which means they thought Russia would n’t back its allies .
Not a bad bet ; Russia has a long , unpredictable history of screwing its allies — but not all the time .
The Georgians should know better than anybody that once in a while , the Russians actually come through , because it was Russian troops who saved Georgia from a Persian invasion in 1805 , at the battle of Zagam .
Of course the Russians had let the Persians sack Tbilisi just ten years earlier without helping .
That ’s the thing : the bastards are unpredictable .
You ca n’t even count on them to betray their friends ( though it ’s the safer bet , most of the time , sort of like 6:5 odds ) .
This time , the Russians came through .
For lots of reasons , starting with the fact that Bush is weak and they know it ; that the US is all tied up in that crap Iraq war and ca n’t do shit ; and most of all , because Kosovo just declared independence from Serbia , an old Russian ally .
It ’s tit for tat time , with Kosovo as the tit and South Ossetia as the tat .
The way Putin sees it , if we can mess with his allies and let little ethnic enclaves like Kosovo declare independence , then the Russians can do the same with our allies , especially naïve idiotic allies like Georgia .
Luckily , South Ossetia does n’t matter that much .
I ’m just being honest here .
In a year nobody will care much who runs that little glob of territory .
What ’s more serious is that another , bigger and more strategic chunk of Georgia called Abkhazia , on the Black Sea , is taking the opportunity to boot out the last Georgian troops on its territory .
Georgia may lose almost all its coastline , but then the Georgians were always an inland people anyway , living along river valleys , not great sailors .
What ’s happening to Georgia here is like the teeny - tiny version of Germany in the twentieth century : overplay your hand and you lose everything .
So if you ’re a Georgian nationalist , this war is a tragedy ; if you ’re a Russian or Ossetian nationalist , it ’s a triumph , a victory for justice , whatever .
To the rest of us , it ’s just kind of fun to watch .
And damn , this one has been a LOT of fun !
The videos that came out of it !
You know , DVD is the best thing to happen to war in a long time .
All the fun , none of the screaming agony — it ’s war as Diet Coke .
See , this is the war that I used to see in the paintings commissioned by Defense contractors in Aviation Week and AFJ : a war between two conventional armies , both using air forces and armored columns , in pine - forested terrain .
That was what those pictures showed every time , with a highlighted closeup of the weapon they were selling homing in on a Warsaw Pact convoy coming through a German pine forest .
Of course , a real NATO / Warsaw Pact war would never , ever have happened that way .
It would have gone nuclear in an hour or less , which both sides knew , which is why it never happened .
So all that beautiful weaponry was kind of a farce , if it was only going to be used in the Fulda Gap .
But damn , God is good , because here it all is , in the same kind of terrain , all your favorite old images : Russian - made tanks burning , a Soviet - model fighter - bomber falling from the sky in pieces , troops in Russian camo fighting other troops , also in Russian camo , in a skirmish by some dilapidated country shack .
No racial overtones to get bummed out by — everybody on both sides is white !
And white from places you do n’t know or care about !
The fretting and fussing and sky - is - falling crap about this war is going to die down fast , and the bottom line will be simple : the Georgians overplayed their hand and got slapped , and we caught a little of the follow - through , which is what happens when you waste your best troops — and Georgia ’s , for that matter — on a dumb war in the wrong place .
We detatched Kosovo from a Russian ally ; they detached South Ossetia from an American ally .
It ’s a pawn exchange , if that .
If it signals anything bigger , it ’s the fact that the US is weaker than it was ten years ago and Russia is much , much stronger than it was in Yeltsin ’s time .
But anybody with sense knew all that already .
What will last is those beautiful videos , like some NATO - era dream , like God giving me one last chance to see the weapons I spent my twenties dreaming about in action .
Even the wounded - civilian videos are interesting because a lot of the wounded are fat and old , which you did n’t see much in classic Korean or Normandy or Nam footage .
We ’re the new normal , but damn , we sure are ugly casualties .
Skinny people just look better sitting in rubble with bloody faces , I ca n’t lie .
As the war fades out — and it will ; countries do n’t fight to the death these days — there ’ll be time to see how the various weapons systems played .
I ’m especially interested to see how well the Georgian air defense missiles , some very good recent Russian models , worked .
But there ’s plenty of time to bebrief later .
For now , just go to LiveLeak or YouTube ( LiveLeak has better stuff right now ) and enjoy yourself .
This is when us war nerds get all the free porn we can handle .
Call in sick , take your comp time , whatever — just do n’t miss those videos .

Control of Government
To understand how to control government we must first understand what our government is .
Once again , the United States of America is a nation of Sovereigns .
That means , a nation of Kings .
From the beginning , the founding fathers ( people ) of our nation recognized that God gave them dominion , agency and possession then commanded them to be fruitful and multiply , replenish and subdue the earth .
Those three elements : dominion , agency and possession , constitute the very definition of sovereignty .
Respectively , by design , the people formed our government , to function of the people , by the people and for the people .
When I went to school , they still taught the part about : “ of the people , by the people and for the people ; ” but , the part about the people being sovereign was already lost .
Since then , those that control the school system have completely eliminated the whole principle of “ the people govern the government ” from their curriculum .
In its place they have instilled the illusion the government is there to protect you .
Programs like D.A.R.E. go so far as to formally teach the students to be government agents policing their parents / guardians .
However , much was lost when the people stopped learning about our history .
Respectively , to learn how to control the government lawfully , we must first remember our history .
In the beginning , the King of Great Britain granted people freehold ( Allodial ) Title to the Land in America .
Thus , those people were granted freedom — the right of self government — the right of kings .
However , by the end of the French American War , Great Britain had almost taken control over the Americas through the contractual control of debts ; both with the individual people and with the states .
And , Great Britain had begun unlawfully usurping governmental powers as if it were their right .
The 13 independent states responded by joining together to sign the Declaration of Independence ; to stand against Great Britain ’s unlawful attempts to take control over the governments .
The War of Independence compelled those 13 states to unite under Articles of Confederation .
However , the Articles of Confederation were significantly flawed ( see : Articles of Confederation ) ; largely because they were formed in a world made up of Monarchies ; thus , under those Articles , the states were recognized as independent sovereign nation states ; wielding the “ collective sovereignty of the people ” as if they were Kingdoms unto themselves — which was impossible , given that the people had not granted the government control over the independent peoples ’ private freehold lands .
The central government had no power to : unite the states , settle disputes , set a standard of money or even to martial an army for defense of the nation .
When the War of Independence was over , the nation and the states were nearing bankruptcy ; hard money was almost nonexistent anywhere in the nation , the people were literally starving and the government had no way to generate funds to pay the army .
Congress was left with no choice but to send the soldiers home with nothing but a worthless written promise that their pay for the previous four years would come .
The people made deals with banks , merchants and private capitalists to borrow grain ( and seed ) on the promise that they would repay with their crops ( again there was no money available ) .
Before the year was over the lenders went to the state legislatures to have the laws changed to compel the people to repay their grain loans in hard money , regardless of their contractual agreements .
With the states ’ shaky financial condition , and pressure from foreign lenders promising support if the legislation passed the bogus measures , the states changed the laws .
When harvest time came the banks refused to accept payment according to the terms of loans ; the people could not sell their crops for hard money because there was no money to be found ; so , the courts put the people in debtor ’s prison and foreclosed on their farms .
Great Britain , France , Holland and Spain all stood by gobbling up cheap land from such foreclosures ; yet they continued to hold their own ports closed to trade with American based ships ; vying for who would be the kingdom that would pick up the pieces and become the new rulers over America , while the independent states battled each other over borders , tariffs and control of the rivers .
Something had to change or all would be lost .
Thats when the Constitutional Republic was born .
Visionary men like Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , George Washington and the like petitioned the states to send representatives to Annapolis then to Philadelphia with authority from the states to fix the problem .
The Governors and or State Legislatures of the individual states each sent deputies with authority to speak for their State .
Those deputies used a Trust Indenture ( contract ) called , The Constitution for the United States of America to form the government and unite the nation ’s states under one controlling Law .
Under the new Constitution : the states were no longer recognized as independently sovereign , only the central government had the power to coin hard money and to regulate interstate commerce and foreign tariffs and trade ; still the independent sovereign nature of the people was recognized along with their right to self government .
Our Constitutional Republic government was now governed by law with the responsibility to govern itself and the states according to specific limitations specified in the Law ; it was not given power to govern the people .
Acting as Senators , under the Constitution , the founding deputies sat George Washington in the seat of the President of the Constitutional United States of America .
Note : they properly sat George Washington in that capacity , with their delegated authority , without a popular election .
Once the Constitutional Republic was created in trust and the President and Senators were seated , copies of the Constitution were distributed amongst the states for “ ratification ” .
It is very important that we understand what ratification was .
Could it have been that the individual States had to approve of the Constitution in order for it to have any affect ?
No. Ratification did not change the fact that the President and the Senate were already seated according to the Constitution .
It was that the each State had to recognize that they were giving up their Articles of Confederation alleged state sovereignty and all of their right and title to all of the unappropriated public lands within each respective State .
After that , the First Constitutional Congress was formed and the Bill of Rights was added to the former constitution to form
The Constitution of the United States of America as a contract to which each officer of the Constitutional Republic must affirm an oath to uphold in order to serve in that office ; and , thus our original jurisdiction government was formed .
However , today , what people generally see as the United States Government is not a government at all .
Instead , it is a private municipal corporation that was formed in , The District of Columbia Organic
Act of 1871 , for the purpose of carrying out the business needs of the actual government acting under martial law .
That corporation trademarked the names : United States , U.S. , USA , and America .
We call that corporation : Corp. U.S. They adopted their own constitution ( The United States Constitution ) as one of their charter documents .
It was identical to the national Constitution except that they dropped out the national 13th amendment ( which amendment limited officers of government from raising themselves above the people ) , and renumbered the remaining amendments as the 13th , 14th , and 15th amendments to their Constitution of the United States .
That left their constitution with one less amendment than the national constitution .
They fixed that by adding their own 16th amendment without ratification .
To the corporation , ratification was not necessary ; after all , they created their constitution , by adoption , in 1871 .
What would keep them from doing the same thing with their corporate amendments ?
Nothing .
In fact , in 1913 , Corp. U.S. also adopted their 17th amendment ( which designated that from then on Corp. U.S. Senators would be elected by popular vote ) .
The Constitution forbids the original jurisdiction Congress from any authority to change where Senators are elected ; therefore , Corp. U.S. ’ 17th amendment can only apply to Corp. U.S .
Between Corp. U.S. ’ creation , in 1871 , and their adoption of their 17th Amendment , in 1913 , the original jurisdiction government ’s members of Congress wore two hats ; one for their original jurisdiction seat and one for their respective seat in Corp. U.S. ’ congress .
However , in 1913 , in accord with their adoption of their 17th Amendment , Corp. U.S. started to have their Corp .
Senators elected by popular vote and the States stopped appointing Senators to the original jurisdiction government ’s Congress ; thus , removing Corp.
U.S.  management relationship from its tie to the Republic and in effect forming what appears to be a distinctively separate ‘ Democratic Oligarchy ’ ; which , if it were the government , would be repugnant to the Laws of this nation .
In 1944 , under The Bretton Woods Agreement , codified at USC Title 22 § 286 , Corp. U.S. ’ treasury was , in effect , given to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) as their individual drawing account ; thus , giving the appearance of foreign control ; however , Corp. U.S. ’
President was also given the authority to control the IMF ’s governors and general managers .
Thus , from 1917 , our nations original jurisdiction government ( the Constitutional Republic ) has been vacant .
It s vacant because people have forgotten who they are .
It s vacant because we forgot what Land ownership is .
It s vacant because we stopped seating national Senators .
We forgot that Electors are , by definition , Land Owners .
Our nations government is vacant ; thus , to control our government we first have to re-seat it .
The first step to re-seating our government is understanding how it is lawfully seated .
The Constitution of the United States of America shows , the general popular vote of the people does not elect the President of this nations government ; the Electoral College does .
The Electoral College is made up of Electors .
After an election the Electoral College ’s votes are physically counted , before Congress , by the President of the Senate and if the outcome of the election favors a President Elect that is not otherwise constitutionally limited from serving as President , Congress ratifies the election ; and , on January 20th following the election , seats the new President .
If they do not ratify the election the Senate holds their own election and seats the President which may be of their own choosing .
Either way , the Senate always seats the President .
Now , what would happen if there was no Senate seated ?
According to Law , the President cannot be seated except by the Senate .
In 1917 , when President Wilson was reelected by the Electoral College , ⅓ of the original jurisdiction Senate had already been vacated and the new Corp.
U.S. only senators had replaced them ; respectively , because those Corp.
U.S. only senators were allowed to participate in the ratification of the vote , the only capacity any member of that ratifying Congress could have exercised was their Corp.
U.S. authority ; thus , President Wilson was only ratified into his Corp. U.S. seat and the original jurisdiction government seat for the President of the United States of America went vacant .
The result of this history is what we all see happening today : in our modern world people think that Corp.
U.S. is their government and they are contractually controlled by it with nearly no way out .
Corp. U.S. has legislatively ruled that the people of our nation are its enemies ( the Trading with the Enemy Act ) .
There is even evidence of their own involvement in killing Presidents ( Kennedy ) , killing people ( the Weavers at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , the Seventh - Day Adventist Branch Davidians at Waco , Texas and thousands more ) and participating in terrorism of the people ( The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , The World Trade Center in New York , The Pentagon ) so that they can justify things like : the P.A.T.R.I.O.T .
Act , the Homeland Security Act , starting wars around the World , tighten security / control over the people of our nation and ObamaCare .
Remember , this nation was created by the people as a Republic , a government controlled by Law ( not one that controls law and the people by its whim ) .
Until the formation of Corp. U.S. the laws and statutes controlled the government not the people .
Now , Corp. U.S. and the Corp .
States under its control create thousands of statutes every year specifically designed to destabilize ( or systematically destroy ) our economy and force the people to only act under their will and control .
Since W.W.II  the war against Fascism ( settled by the Bretton Woods Agreement )  it seems like the thing most people think of as government became fascistic .
However , now that they have forced the new world of Homeland Security upon us and we started looking at our actual history we discovered that through the social security cardholder relationship Corp.
U.S. has secured ownership and control over the people and their property ; thus , the only step left for them to execute a complete takeover of the sovereign people and transference of government control under their own form of dictatorial communism is for the people to revolt with arms .
Make no mistake — that is their long range plan now coming into effect .
Where do we go from here ?
The only legal , lawful and peaceful way out is to put our Constitutional Republic government back in place .
To do this we are re-seating the State governors [ See our election map and page ] .
Once the Governors are in place ( which will happen this year in November , 2013 ) , they can re-seat any vacant seat .
The Governors will seat the Senators .
The Senate will seat the President .
The President will seat the original jurisdiction Supreme Court and then demand that Corp. U.S. pays back the money Corp. U.S. owes to the national government / people .
Corp. U. S. cannot pay ( there is not enough money on the planet ) and they are already bankrupt .
They have no legal or lawful choice but to recognize the original jurisdiction government as their owner , as the controller of Washington D.C. and as the national government .
We will have our nation with its Republic back under the control of Law and completely free of debt .
We then put our monetary system back in place and eliminate the state of emergency that has been maintained as the controlling force over the people since the Civil War .
There is also the alternative that from the pressure the people create upon our nation and upon Corp.
U. S. to reveal the truth and to re-seat the original jurisdiction government , the corporation could legislate and or regulate themselves legitimately back into lawful elections of the original jurisdiction government and reassume our lawful original jurisdiction Constitutional Republic government .
We really dont care which way we get our nation back , so long as we get it back , and that our private sovereign rights to life , liberty and property are secured .
The question still remains , “ How do you control government ? ”
Answer : This is a Republic .
In a Republic , government is controlled by Law .
That obviously means that government cannot control the Law .
The Law controls the government .
The people entrust government with sufficient ability / authority to deal with foreign governments and to assist the sovereign people with civil and criminal remedies against trespasses .
The people are thereby left alone to control their own lives , Land and property , as sovereigns with their own sovereign land secured by land patents , against any kind of encroachment .
And , when the government fails to follow the law , the people must use the Law to limit the government to the authority the people provided them in the first instance .
Respectively , if the people do not know the law well enough to so control the government , they must first learn the law .
Team Law is well suited to help the people learn the law ; for , that is exactly what we do .
We help people learn how to learn the law firsthand from its source .
May we see it through to the end .

FHA to Raise Upfront Premiums
The FHA announced Tuesday it was halting its risk - based pricing structure beginning October 1 in accordance with the new housing bill and raising its upfront mortgage insurance premiums .
Beginning October 1 , FHA will charge an upfront premium of 1.75 percent for purchase money mortgages and full - credit qualifying refinances , 1.50 percent for streamline refinances , and 3.00 percent for FHASecure mortgages .
Annual premiums , paid monthly , will range between .50 percent and .55 percent for most loans .
The new fixed structure is up from the 1.5 percent and .50 percent that was being charged in the “ one size fits all ” approach before the FHA adopted risk - based pricing on July 14 .
The risk - based system set premiums anywhere between 1.25 percent and 2.25 percent , with annual premiums up to .55 percent .
It is assumed this system will be back in place come October 1 , 2009 , when the moratorium outlined in the housing bill expires .
Mortgages with FHA case number assignments falling between July 14 and September 30 , 2008 will maintain the risk - based premium structure for the life of the loan .
The elimination of seller - funded down payment assistance tied to FHA loans is also slated for October 1 .
FHA Commissioner Brian D. Montgomery recently noted that seller - funded loans led to $ 4.6 billion in “ unanticipated long - term losses , ” claiming they went into foreclosure three times more frequently than loans in which borrowers supplied the down payment .
At this point , we ought to have an open and honest debate as to whether McCain has simply become a serial liar , willing to do anything and say anything in order to be president , or whether McCain is having serious problems with his memory and overall cognitive abilities due to old age , a recurrence of his cancer , initial Alzheimer ’s or some other illness .
Is it dementia , confusion , or what that is causing McCain to atypically say repeated falsehoods – from placing Spain in Latin America , to claiming that Palin was against the Bridge to Nowhere , to now saying that he ’s always bought American .
We now know that at least 3 of the McCain ’s 13 cars – yes , McCain has 13 cars – are foreign cars ( a Honda , a VW , and a Lexus ) .
Now , I do n’t personally have a problem with someone buying a foreign car – though you know the Republicans would be all over Obama if his car were foreign ( it ’s not , Obama owns one car and it ’s a Ford hybrid ) .
But the issue here is that McCain has once again lied about yet another fact in his life , in order to get elected .
The old McCain did n’t appear to be this much of a liar , or this confused about the facts .
The new McCain has either decided to jettison his honor overboard , or is quite literally beginning to lose his mind .
At 72 years of age with 4 bouts of rather serious cancer , the latter ca n’t be ignored for much longer .
Especially since there ’s a very real possibility that electing John McCain would make Sarah Palin president .
Switches are a part of daily life , from snoozing your alarm , turning on the coffee maker , firing up your car engine , and so on until we turn off the lights at night .
Researchers have now cataloged even more templates of possible switches within a living cell than we use throughout our day .
Naren Ramakrishnan , associate professor of computer science at Virginia Tech , USA , and Upinder S. Bhalla , at the National Centre for Biological Sciences ( NCBS ) , part of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in India , found that cells can make use of thousands of switches to support important biological functions .
Cells use switches for determining what kind of cell to become – skin or blood , for instance , in responding to stress , and in communication with other cells .
“ A switch is like a memory unit , ” said Bhalla .
“ The state of the switch — whether it is on or off , is like a computer memory that can store a bit of 0 or 1 .
Although real biological switches are quite complex and regulated in many ways , we have shown the simplest possible ways in which switches could work ” , Bhalla said .
The researchers report their work in the June 20 issue of the Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) Computational Biology , in the article “ Memory Switches in Chemical Reaction Space . ”
Their collaboration began during a sabbatical visit by Ramakrishnan to NCBS in Bangalore , India .
Ramakrishnan is a computer scientist whose expertise is in numerical simulation and data mining .
Bhalla is a computational neuroscientist with broad interests in biochemical network modeling and simulation .
They decided to use Virginia Tech ’s System X supercomputer to search for the many ways in which cells can implement switches .
“ Our exploration using System X is rather like how a tinkerer or a kid puts together things to see if they do something useful .
We took a lot of ‘ spare parts ’ , each spare part being one chemical reaction , connected them together every which way , and we found that a surprising number of these artificially constructed networks actually were switches , ” said Ramakrishnan .
“ Popular opinion used to be that there are a small number of ways in which switches can be realized by biology , but we found thousands of switches in our search , ” Ramakrishnan said .
The researchers report in PLoS Computational Biology , ” We find nearly 4,500 reaction topologies , or about 10 percent of our tested configurations , that demonstrate switching behavior . ”
Their research also led to a comprehensive “ map ” of biochemical switches .
The map further revealed that most of the switches form a “ family ” – that is , the switches are all related to one another .
“ This has important implications since it suggests how evolution might stumble upon a switch rather easily . ” Ramakrishnan said .
“ Of course , there is more to cells than switches , ” Bhalla said .
“ But switching and memory are the most basic behaviors possible .
Armed with our catalog of switches , we can now proceed to investigate more interesting behaviors like complex information processing . ”

>Hacking Palin's e-mail </a> < br /> < span style = " font - size:9px ; " > ( < a href = " http://www.polldaddy.com " >
surveys </a>)</ span>
The activist group called " anonymous , " best known for its jousts with the Church of Scientology , has apparently hacked into the private Yahoo e-mail account of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican candidate for vice president .
Contents of that account , including two sample e-mails , an index of messages and Palin family photos , have been posted by the whistleblower site Wikileaks , which contends that they constitute evidence that Palin has improperly used her private e-mail to shield government business from public scrutiny , an issue that had already been raised by others .
( 2011's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
From a Wikileaks press release :
The internet activist group ' anonymous ' , famed for its exposure of unethical behavior by the Scientology cult , has now gone after the Alaskan governor and republican Vice - Presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
At around midnight last night the group gained access to governor Palin 's email account ... and handed over the contents to the government sunshine site Wikileaks.org .
Governor Palin has come under media criticism in the past week for using pseudo - private email accounts to avoid Alaskan freedom of information laws .
The zip archive made available by Wikileaks contains screen shots of Palin 's inbox , two example emails , governor Palin 's address box and a couple of family photos .
While the emails released so far reveal little , the list of correspondence appears to re-enforce the criticism that Palin is mixing governmental and personal affairs .
There 's no way to tell at a glance whether this material is authentic or a hoax , but the organizations involved are well known .
Obviously , the method by which the information was obtained and posted will be hugely controversial .
( And inclusion of the pictures seems gratuitous , if not mean . )
However , the e-mail index from Palin 's account does appear to indicate that she has been using it for both private and official business , with one entry addressed to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and another to Palin 's chief of staff , Michael Nizich , to cite only two obvious examples .
As for the sample e-mails , rather than bolstering the contention that Palin uses private e-mail to avoid possible public scrutiny of official business , at first blush they actually seem indicative of her dutifully separating Alaska business from Alaska and national politics .
Both samples are overtly political in nature , which , based on my admittedly limited understanding of the law in this area , make them inappropriate when using government resources .
Of course , those are only two e-mails and one would expect others to be forthcoming .

ALTHOUGH the price of oil continues to hit new records , it has in one respect been a quiet week on the oil markets .
America 's lawmakers are celebrating Independence Day by taking a few days off .
That has led to a brief interruption in the torrent of proposals aimed at curbing speculation .
Ten different bills on the subject are in the works in Congress .
Before the House of Representatives shut up shop , it approved one by a vote of 402 - 19 .
America 's politicians are not the only ones to have fingered speculators for the feverish rise in the price of oil and other raw materials .
Italy 's finance minister believes that there is a “ magnum of speculative champagne ” included in the price of each barrel .
Austria wants the European Union to impose a tax on speculation .
Saudi Arabia and other big oil producers routinely blame the price on frothy markets , rather than idle wells .
The accusers point to the link between the volume of transactions on the futures markets and the price of oil .
Since 2004 the near tripling of trading in oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) , the world 's biggest market for the stuff , has neatly coincided with a tripling in the price .
What is more , investing in oil has become something of a fad .
Commodities traders and hedge funds with long experience have been joined by less expert sorts , including pension funds and individuals .
All this , the theory runs , is contributing to a bubble in commodities .
The rush of punters betting on higher prices is begetting a self - fulfilling prophecy : it is the tide of new investment , rather than inadequate supply or irrepressible demand , that is pushing the price of oil ever higher .
Follow the oil , not the futures
This reasoning holds obvious appeal for those looking for a scapegoat .
But there is little evidence to support it .
For one thing , the surge in investment in oil futures is not that large relative to the global trade in oil .
Barclays Capital , an investment bank , calculates that “ index funds ” , which have especially exercised the politicians because they always bet on rising prices , account for only 12 % of the outstanding contracts on NYMEX and have a value equivalent to just 2 % of the world 's yearly oil consumption .
More importantly , neither index funds nor other speculators ever buy any physical oil .
Instead , they buy futures and options which they settle with a cash payment when they fall due .
In essence , these are bets on which way the oil price will move .
Since the real currency of such contracts is cash , rather than barrels of crude , there is no limit to the number of bets that can be made .
And since no oil is ever held back from the market , these bets do not affect the price of oil any more than bets on a football match affect the result .
The market for nickel provides a good illustration of this .
Speculative investment in the metal has been growing steadily over the past year , yet its price has fallen by half .
By the same token , the prices of several commodities that are not traded on any exchanges , such as iron ore and rice , have been rising almost as fast as that of oil .
Speculators do play an important role in setting the price of oil and other raw materials .
But they do so based on their expectations of future trends in supply and demand , not on whims .
If they had somehow managed to push prices to unjustified heights , then demand would contract , leaving unsold pools of oil .
The futures market does sometimes signal that prices are likely to rise , which might prompt speculators to hoard oil in anticipation .
But it is not signalling that at the moment , and there is no sign of hoarding .
In the absence of rising stocks , it is hard to argue that the oil markets have lost their grip on reality .
Some claim that oil producers are in effect hoarding oil below the ground .
But there is also little sign of that , either among companies or countries : all big exporters bar Saudi Arabia are pumping as fast as they can .
It takes two to contango
Despite their dismal reputation , the oil speculators provide a vital service .
They help airlines and other big oil consumers to hedge against rising prices , and so to reduce risk — a massive boon amid the economic turmoil .
By the same token , they provide oil producers with more predictable future revenues , and so allow them to expand more confidently and borrow more cheaply .
That , in turn , should help to lower the price of oil in the long run .
Any attempt to curtail speculation , by contrast , is likely to make life harder for firms and oil more expensive .
Yesterday , Gawker ran what appeared to be a photo of a bloated , leathery animal corpse — only it was like no animal anyone had seen before .
A stout , hairless creature with a beak , claws , and the almond - shaped eyes familiar from renderings of space aliens , it looked , in short , like a monster .
Hence the headline : “ Dead Monster Washes Ashore in Montauk . ”
The photo had come over e-mail to Anna Holmes , the managing editor at Jezebel , from an employee at Evolutionary Media Group , in Los Angeles ; Holmes passed it on to Gawker .
Because it came from a marketing company , Gawker surmised , “ our guess is that it ’s viral marketing for something . ”
They later pointed to a Cartoon Network show , Cryptids Are Real , which features similar - looking chubby monsters .
We called Evolutionary , where a woman named Alanna Navitski , who claimed to be responsible for the tip , swore it was not a viral - marketing campaign .
“ This is what happened , ” she said .
“ I got this e-mail and opened it from my girlfriend who works at Harris Publications , which has nothing to do with anything .
Anyway , my girlfriend ’s sister was there with her friends and one of them took the picture .
And we were like , ‘ This is the scariest shit we ’ve ever seen . ’
And so —
I ’m in marketing — we were like , ‘ Maybe we should send it to a few blogs and see if anyone else is as freaked out as we are . ’
We had no idea that it would turn into this .
Now it ’s literally a beast of its own .
But it has nothing to do with any kind of campaign . ”
In fact , this turned out to be true .
A number of eyewitnesses say they saw the monster with their own eyes .
“ I saw the monster , ” says Michael Meehan , a 22 - year - old waiter at the Surfside Inn , which sits above the beach where the monster washed up .
“ I just came walking down the beach and everyone was looking at it .
No one knew what it was .
It kind of looked like a dog , but it had this crazy - looking beak .
I mean , I would freak out if something like that popped up next to me in the water . ”
So did anyone there , you know , do anything about it ?
“ This woman kept calling animal control , ” said Meehan .
“ She wanted to name it after herself .
I think they came and got it .
The carcass .
Whatever it was . ”
But did they ?
The East Hampton branch of animal control referred Daily Intel to a supervisor who did not return calls for comment .
And Navitski , of Evolutionary Media Group , says her friend ’s sister ( who does n’t want to talk to the press , though Plum TV will host another woman , Jenna Hewitt , who claims she took a photo , tomorrow ) says animal control never came .
“ They say an old guy came and carted it away , ” she said .
“ He said , ‘ I ’m going to mount it on my wall . ’ ”

Ever since our report last night on an internal e-mail sent by Steve Jobs about the botched launch of MobileMe , we have received an outpouring of requests for the full text of the e-mail .
Although we originally were n't comfortable publishing the entire thing , it is now slowly becoming available in its full form across the Internet .
Because of this , we made an editorial decision to give into your requests and publish the text for your reading pleasure .
Here it is .
Team ,
The launch of MobileMe was not our finest hour .
There are several things we could have done better :
– MobileMe was simply not up to Apple 's standards – it clearly needed more time and testing .
– Rather than launch MobileMe as a monolithic service , we could have launched over - the - air syncing with iPhone to begin with , followed by the web applications one by one – Mail first , followed 30 days later ( if things went well with Mail ) by Calendar , then 30 days later by Contacts .
– It was a mistake to launch MobileMe at the same time as iPhone 3G , iPhone 2.0 software and the App Store .
We all had more than enough to do , and MobileMe could have been delayed without consequence .
We are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow MobileMe into a service that our customers will love .
One step that I can share with you today is that the MobileMe team will now report to Eddy Cue , who will lead all of our internet services – iTunes , the App Store and , starting today , MobileMe .
Eddy 's new title will be Vice President , Internet Services and he will now report directly to me .
The MobileMe launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about Internet services .
And learn we will .
The vision of MobileMe is both exciting and ambitious , and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year .

Item 1 :
Pope Benedict XVI said Monday that pharmacists have a right to use conscientious objection to avoid dispensing emergency contraception or euthanasia drugs — and told them they should also inform patients of the ethical implications of using such drugs .
...
" Pharmacists must seek to raise people 's awareness so that all human beings are protected from conception to natural death , and so that medicines truly play a therapeutic role , " Benedict said .
Benedict said conscientious objector status would " enable them not to collaborate directly or indirectly in supplying products that have clearly immoral purposes such as , for example , abortion or euthanasia . "
Okay , first of all , Your Assholeyness , emergency contraception is just that - contraception - and has nothing to do with fucking abortion .
That 's one .
Benedict 's comments resonated strongly in Italy , where pharmacists are required to fill prescriptions regardless of their moral or ethical positions , according to Federfarma , Italy 's national federation representing 15,500 private pharmacies .
In a statement , the organization said the law would have to be changed to allow for conscientious objection , but noted that the change might result in pharmacists objecting to dispensing basic contraception or other hormonal drugs prescribed for medical reasons .
The issue came to a head on Monday in Chile , when the government warned it could close drugstores that refuse to sell the morning - after pill , which has been legal in Chile since last year for sale to girls as young as 14 .
The country 's three largest drug store chains have not been selling the drugs , claiming they could not buy them locally .
The government responded by fining the stores and importing thousands of doses .
Good for Chile .
Good for Federfarma for pushing back , although far more weakly than the issue deserves .
Pharmacists are licensed medical professionals .
If you have a moral objection to doing your fucking job , then quit and go work for some Catholic hospital or just go into a different line of work , because you obviously did n't realize this one involves dispensing medicine .
Item 2 :
The Vatican took on Spain 's Socialist government Sunday , criticizing its social policies as the church beatified nearly 500 victims of leftist persecution during the country 's civil war era .
The ceremony was the largest mass beatification ever by the Vatican , which supported the fascist dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco during and after his war against the leftists .
Some in Spain questioned the timing of the beatification of the 498 martyrs , which came three days before Spain 's parliament is expected to pass a Socialist - sponsored law that will for the first time formally condemn Franco 's rule and order the removal of all fascist symbols from the country .
...
Critics say the Vatican was hitting back at the government by simultaneously beatifying the two bishops , 24 priests and 462 members of religious orders , as well as a deacon , a subdeacon , a seminary student and seven lay Catholics .
Since the late 1980s the church has beatified nearly 500 other clergy killed in the war , but in a series of smaller ceremonies .
Get that ?
The Church supported Franco and the Spanish fascists , the allies of the Nazis .
They shot teachers who did n't want the Church to control the schools and anyone suspected of " anti-clericalism " .
The Church picked sides in a civil war and a number of its priests were killed before the Nazis came in and won the war for them .
Now they put their dead fascist supporters on the road to sainthood .
In his homily , [ Cardinal Jose ] Saraiva Martins took aim at Socialist legislation that facilitates divorce and gay marriages , as well as the administration 's scrapping of plans by a previous conservative government to make religion an obligatory subject in schools .
Criticizing all three initiatives , Saraiva Martins said there was a need to protect the family " founded on the sole and indissoluble marriage between a man and woman , on the primary right for parents to educate their children . "
And the Church is upset that people are allowed to marry and divorce as they will , and that ( the Catholic ) religion is not taught in schools on the public 's dime .
You with me so far ?
Then there is this :
Ties between the church and the Spanish government , which took office in 2004 , have also grown tense over the government 's attempts to make the church more self - financing .
As of a year ago , Spain no longer makes direct payments to the church , instead allowing taxpayers a choice whether to divert 0.7 percent of their taxes or not .
So , the freedom - hating , theocratic fascist - lovers in Rome are upset that Spain no long directly pays tribute to them .
The Pope demands you kiss his ring and then tithe .
Fuck him .
It all began 15 years ago .
Back in 1993 , ESPN took it ’s College GameDay show on the road and the rest is history .
The very first road show was held at the Game of the Century , Notre Dame vs. Florida State in South Bend .
Corso picked FSU and , of course , Notre Dame won .
What has happened since is the transformation of college football into a billion dollar industry .
In honor of the 15th anniversary , Busted Coverage has compiled the “ 20 All - Time Greatest College GameDay Signs . ”

One more spammer is heading off to jail , but not before he managed to bilk at least several hundred people out of $ 400,000 or more .
Michael Dolan , 24 , has been sentenced to seven years in jail — the maximum he could have received — followed by three years of supervised release .
Dolan and a group of co-conspirators ran a scheme from 2002 - 2006 in which they first trolled AOL chatrooms for user names , then bombarded these users with phishing attempts .
As Infoworld reports , the scheme ran as follows .
Victims typically received a link to a false greeting card which , when opened , installed a malware package .
The next time the target attempted to log on to AOL , the program would request credit card numbers , bank account data , or other personal information .
Users who refused to enter the data were prevented from logging into AOL .
As schemes go , this was a fairly novel idea at the time , and I actually remember running into several systems infected this way .
Dolan also sent spam purporting to be from AOL 's billing department , asking customers to please reenter their billing details due to a server meltdown .
As you can imagine , all of this left AOL feeling a bit perturbed .
Dolan himself has something of a history of bad behavior .
He was first sentenced to two years of probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count of accessing a computer without authorization .
His probation was revoked in 2006 , after the ruling judge discovered that he had taken several trips out of state , including at least one trip overseas .
Dolan was then sentenced to nine months of imprisonment , and was charged in the AOL scam on September 28 , 2006 .
Considering that the scam itself ran from 2002 - 2006 , Dolan was likely making money from computer fraud both while on probation and in jail .
The federal government claimed that Dolan masterminded the scheme , but if he did , his intelligence appears to be confined solely to computing .
Assistant US Attorney Edward Chang stated in a sentencing memorandum that Dolan attempted to variously bribe , coerce , and threaten various witnesses , and succeeded in convincing his girlfriend to perjure herself .
Combined with his modus operandi of committing computer fraud while directly under the nose of the authorities , Dolan simply does n't seem to be the sharpest crayon in the box .
Sharp or dull , however , he 's headed to jail .
Five years for fraud , two years for aggravated identity theft , followed by his supervised release , which is essentially probation .
Judges are allowed to impose conditions during a supervised release , and can bar the individual in question from engaging in activities which are otherwise lawful .
The judge in Dolan 's case has not set the terms of the release yet , but based on his record , it 's a safe bet that Dolan wo n't be touching a PC until 2018 .
People with scalp or neck melanomas die at nearly twice the rate of people with melanoma elsewhere on the body , including the face or ears , researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have found .
The analysis of 51,704 melanoma cases in the U.S. confirms that survival rates differ depending on where skin cancer first appears .
Those with scalp or neck melanomas die at a rate 1.84 times higher than those with melanomas on the extremities , after controlling for the possible influences of age , gender , tumor thickness and ulceration .
" Scalp and neck melanomas patients have a higher rate of death than patients with melanoma anywhere else on the body , " said Nancy Thomas , M.D. , Ph.D. , associate professor of dermatology in the UNC School of Medicine , a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and the study ’s senior author .
Anne Lachiewicz , a medical student in the UNC School of Medicine , is the lead author of the study .
Thomas recommends that physicians pay special attention to the scalp when examining patients for signs of skin cancer .
" Only six percent of melanoma patients present with the disease on the scalp or neck , but those patients account for 10 percent of melanoma deaths .
That ’s why we need to take extra time to look at the scalp during full - skin examinations , " she said .
The results appear in the April issue of the journal Archives of Dermatology .
The study helps address a controversy among cancer researchers : whether scalp and neck skin cancer is more lethal primarily because it ’s diagnosed later than other melanomas .
" That was the thinking of a lot of people in the field , " Thomas said .
But the analysis indicates that the presence of the melanoma on the scalp or neck , in itself , is an indicator of a poorer prognosis .
" We think there ’s something different about scalp and neck melanomas , " Thomas said .
" This gives us directions for research to look at tumor cell types in those areas at the molecular level and to see if there are differences .
I ’m interested in identifying the mutations that drive malignancy . "
Thomas , Lachiewicz and their colleagues analyzed data from 13 National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results ( SEER ) Program registries in nine states .
Each case represented the first invasive melanoma diagnosed among non-Hispanic white adults between 1992 and 2003 .
Patients with scalp or neck melanomas were older ( 59 years ) than patients with other melanomas ( 55 years ) , and more likely to be male ( 74 percent versus 54 percent , respectively ) .
In addition , scalp and neck melanomas were thicker ( 0.8 millimeters ) than melanomas at other sites ( 0.6 millimeters ) and more likely to be ulcerated .
Lymph node involvement was also more common in patients with scalp - neck melanomas .
Melanomas on the extremities or on the face or ears had the best prognosis .
The five - year melanoma - specific survival rate for patients with scalp or neck melanomas was 83 percent , compared with 92 percent for patients with melanomas at other sites .
The ten - year survival rate was 76 percent for scalp or neck melanomas and 89 percent for other melanomas .
The medieval marvel : 14th century Hungarian stove cuts my monthly gas bill to just £ 5
With gas and electricity bills soaring , energy firms are ploughing millions into cutting - edge technology .
However , according to this man , they might be better off taking some tips from the Middle Ages .
Peter Breuer has cut his gas bill from £ 20 to £ 5 a month by heating his house with a Hungarian stove based on a 14th century design .
Peter Breuer is dwarfed by his money - saving tile stove
The 80 - year - old grandfather says it is so effective at warming up his house that he has been able to switch off his central heating .
It uses just one small bundle of wood - which he often gets free from local tradesmen - to keep his home snug for an entire day .
' I live in a sizeable house and that 's one of the reasons I had to fit the stove , ' said Mr Breuer , a retired Customs and Excise lawyer who lives in Westcliff - on - Sea , near Southend in Essex .
' Even with previous prices I could n't afford to keep heating my house .
' With most stoves you put some wood in and you get a nice little fire but as soon as the flame 's gone down , the heat disappears .
' But a tile stove works as a storage heater because there is a great mass of masonry inside which heats up and radiates heat through the tiles .
Nice and warm and it does n't cost a fortune to heat the house
' It keeps you warm for around 12 hours .
It also has a little stove so you can bake potatoes and other things in one of the hatches . '
Mr Breuer added that he has an electric water heater , so the only gas he uses is for cooking on the hob .
He had the Hungarian stove fitted for £ 3,000 last autumn , around the same as it costs to install central heating .
With the average family now spending £ 750 a year on gas , such a heater could save them £ 500 a year - meaning it would pay for itself in six years .
The stoves are virtually unheard of in Britain but have been popular in Hungary , Germany , Switzerland , northern Italy and Scandinavia since the 14th century .
Tile stoves are one of the oldest types of heater - they have been popular in parts of Europe since the 14th century
Mr Breuer said he was familiar with tile stoves because his grandparents had lived in Hungary and he owned a house there .
He was unable to find anyone in the UK with the skills to build one so a team of friends drove a van filled with materials from the country last year .
They took two days to finish the job at his three - bedroom detached house .
LOS ANGELES --( BUSINESS
WIRE ) -- According to Karl Denninger , of FedUpUSA , the $ 700 billion bailout proposed last week by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson effectively anoints Paulson “ King ” of American Finance .
The plan for the largest bailout in history has been rapidly crafted and is being forced through Congress a week before recess , effectively moving Wall Street ’s disaster to Main Street with little discussion and less understanding , according to Denninger .
The bailout does not address the issues affecting market confidence and will severely undermine the United States ’ balance sheet .
“ The plan has been sold using fear rather than facts to both Congress and the American people , ” said Denninger , of FedUpUSA , a grassroots organization , and The Market Ticker , provider of commentary on capital markets .
“ The fear gripping our financial markets flows from a lack of trust in the health of firms on both Wall Street and worldwide , ” said Denninger .
“ Throwing money around does nothing to address the root cause and , in fact , simply creates further instability as we continue to have government fiat choose which firms succeed and which ones fail . ”
Currently , interest on the national debt is the second largest expenditure besides military ( this excludes Social Security and Medicare which are included in the Unitary Budget , but funded separately ) .
The $ 700 billion bailout , which could potentially end up costing much more , will add even more debt interest .
Debt interest has the potential of becoming the largest budget item , dwarfing the entire budget .
This in turn could lead to capital flight from the United States and a devaluation of the U.S. dollar , already significantly depreciated under Secretary Paulson , among other things .
FedUpUSA and Denninger are advocating for an alternative – a plan that will restore confidence by ensuring that all market participants are able to objectively value firms , thereby calming both the credit and stock markets .
Americans concerned about this massive bailout are encouraged to visit http://financialpetition.org/petition-nobail.shtml and sign the petition to Congress , as well as phone members of Congress and tell them , “ No more bailouts ! ”
More information , including two 10 - minutes videos on the problem and solution , is at http://FedupUSA.org.
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Bush administration is stepping up pressure on lawmakers for urgent action to stabilize the financial system , calling for speedy passage of its $ 700 billion rescue plan .
Calling the past few weeks a " humbling " time for the United States , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's message is that the U.S. taxpayer is at risk from the fallout stemming from the ongoing financial crisis .
However Paulson , appearing on Sunday talk shows , is emphasizing that the plan to take bad mortgage assets off of companies ' books will be worth the cost .
There 's " much greater risk in not doing this than in doing it , " Paulson said in an interview on Fox News Sunday .
" I hate the fact that the taxpayer will be at risk , but the taxpayer was already at risk , " he said later on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
On Monday , President Bush amplified the call to action and warned Democrats not to try to tack on " unrelated " measures that could tie up the emergency legislation the government is trying to pass .
The administration is battling calls from some Democrats to amend the plan with aid for struggling homeowners and other provisions , including a new economic stimulus plan and restrictions on executive pay .
See related story .
" We want this to be clean , and we want it to be quick , and it 's urgent that we get this done , " Paulson said .
The plan allows the government to buy the bad debt of U.S. financial institutions for the next two years .
It gives the Treasury secretary the authority to buy $ 700 billion in mortgage - related assets , and would raise the statutory limit on the national debt from $ 10.6 trillion to $ 11.3 trillion .
There are no plans to buy assets from hedge funds , Paulson said Sunday .
The proposal does n't specify what the government would get in return from financial companies for the federal assistance , according to an official summary of the draft plan .
Read a summary of the plan .
Lawmakers and administration officials have been huddling over the weekend to review the plan and hash out details .
On Sunday , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , said he 's hopeful Congress will approve the plan soon .
But he made clear that he wants more steps taken .
" The cause of this problem is still the foreclosure crisis , " Dodd said .
" It needs to be part of the solution .
That 's not to clog this up .
We need to act quickly and deliberately , and we will , in my view . "
Paulson said on Fox that the plan should include " mortgage - relief components " but stopped at that .
" The biggest help we can give the American people is to stabilize our financial system right now and to prevent the system from clogging up , " he said .
Obama weighs in
Meanwhile , presidential contender Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , also said Congress must act speedily but urged officials to protect taxpayers and tighten rules on financial companies .
" We must work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to resolve this crisis to avert an even broader economic catastrophe , " Obama said in remarks prepared for delivery in Charlotte , N.C. " But Washington also has to recognize that economic recovery requires that we act , not just to address the crisis on Wall Street , but also the crisis on Main Street and around kitchen tables across America . "
Republican candidate Sen. John McCain had no publicly scheduled events Sunday .
On Saturday , McCain said he spoke with Paulson but added that lawmakers and officials hammering out the rescue plan should consider a proposal he has floated for a government entity to spot troubled financial companies and head off insolvencies .
In a separate action on Sunday , the Treasury offered more details about a plan to shore up money market funds .
First announced Friday , the plan involves insuring any publicly offered money - market fund , both retail and institutional , that pays a fee .
Sunday , the Treasury said that eligible funds include both taxable and tax - exempt money market funds and that the guarantee program covers amounts held by shareholders as of the close of business on Sept. 19 .
Read earlier story .
In his comments Sunday , Paulson tried to assure worried Americans about their bank and money market accounts , saying those with savings in FDIC - insured bank accounts worth $ 100,000 or less " wo n't lose a penny . "
I ’m a farm boy who grew up here in the hills outside Yamhill , Ore. , raising sheep for my F.F.A. and 4 - H projects .
At various times , my family also raised modest numbers of pigs , cattle , goats , chickens and geese , although they were never tightly confined .
Our cattle , sheep , chickens and goats certainly had individual personalities , but not such interesting ones that it bothered me that they might end up in a stew .
Pigs were more troubling because of their unforgettable characters and obvious intelligence .
To this day , when tucking into a pork chop , I always feel as if it is my intellectual equal .
Then there were the geese , the most admirable creatures I ’ve ever met .
We raised Chinese white geese , a common breed , and they have distinctive personalities .
They mate for life and adhere to family values that would shame most of those who dine on them .
While one of our geese was sitting on her eggs , her gander would go out foraging for food  and if he found some delicacy , he would rush back to give it to his mate .
Sometimes I would offer males a dish of corn to fatten them up  but it was impossible , for they would take it all home to their true loves .

Once a month or so , we would slaughter the geese .
When I was 10 years old , my job was to lock the geese in the barn and then rush and grab one .
Then I would take it out and hold it by its wings on the chopping block while my Dad or someone else swung the ax .
Children will warm the school using their own body heat , it is claimed Construction work has started at the site of what has been dubbed the " Weetabix school " .
Architects behind the £ 5.8 m primary say it will be so well insulated that the pupils ' bodies will provide the heat once they have had their breakfast .
It will replace Acharacle Primary School in Ardnamurchan , on the west coast of Scotland , which has fallen into a poor state .
The timber superstructure is coming from Austria .
Highland councillor Michael Foxley said it would be the most sustainable school in Scotland , but conceded it would not be cheap to build .
SCHOOL FACT FILE
The new primary is due to open in 2009
It will have five classrooms , one of which will be for shared community use A nursery , multi- purpose hall , dining facility , music practice rooms and changing rooms will also be built
He said : " The difference between this type of building construction and others is that has a high level of energy insulation , which creates a very safe non -toxic environment for people to live and work in the building .
" It 's not a cheap project because of its location , but it is a forerunner of future sustainable projects from which we will learn a lot .
" There is currently no capability within Scotland to produce this type of mass timber construction . "
However , the councillor hoped the capability could be gained locally to create jobs in the future .

He said : " The building itself has been designed to be incredibly efficient .
" It 's very well insulated and airtight , which stops heat getting out . "
Head teacher Lyndsay Bradley said the old school was no longer fit for the job .
She said : " Conditions are awful .
The children and staff have to put up with an awful lot - the doors are coming off and the ceilings come down . "

Amanda
Bere said she was " taken aback " by the comments A shop selling lingerie for pregnant women has been forced to withdraw a mannequin with a baby bump from its window after it sparked complaints .
Amanda
Bere opened her shop in Selby , North Yorkshire , eight weeks ago and dressed the dummy in a black nursing bra to promote her stock .
But she said many of the town 's older residents took offence .
The mannequin , which Mrs Bere calls ' Emily ' , has now been moved to the back of the store .
' Taking a stand '
She told BBC Look North : " It started with people looking in the window and making comments outside and they told me their points of view that they found it offensive .
" Other shop traders also told me that people were saying to them that it was offensive and that I should cover her up or move her .
" So I put a camisole on Emily and someone else made another comment , saying that they could still see the bump , so I put her in the corner of the shop away from the window . "

Mrs
Bere said more people were coming into her shop since she moved the dummy but members of a local breastfeeding group , which she supports , have been angered by the residents ' comments .
And she said she was considering " taking a stand " by moving the mannequin back into the window .

" And I am the only shop in Selby that does sell maternity wear and I wanted to show people what I did . "

Correction to this article
THE decline and fall of Bear Stearns illustrates both an old truth and a new one .
The old truth is that when cash is scarce , he who has deep pockets is king .
Bear Stearns is still standing only because JPMorgan Chase was solid enough to prop it up .
The new truth lies in the Federal Reserve 's role as matchmaker of last resort , smoothing the deal with a temporary loan of $ 30 billion .
This shows just how far a financial supervisor 's purview now extends .
Even though Bear is not a fully regulated institution , the investment bank was deemed too central to the complex web of America 's financial system to be allowed to fail .
Private - sector solutions to banking crises , in which strong institutions buy the weak , demand well - heeled banks .
Just now , these are in short supply .
Few institutions have been left unscathed by bad mortgage debts ; JPMorgan Chase is a rare exception .
When banks are threatened with insolvency , it is often the government — with the deepest pockets of all — that has to make good their losses .
But how much might the state have to stump up ?
And how should it go about it ?
As today 's credit crisis widens , commentators are turning to history as a guide .
One lesson is that trouble is all too common .
Most members of the IMF have undergone at least some distress since the late 1970s .
Crises in poorer countries tend to be deeper and more costly , often because they are twinned with collapsing currencies .
According to a 1996 survey of insolvencies by economists at the World Bank , the bail - out of Argentina 's banking system in the early 1980s cost a stunning 55 % of GDP to fix .
The rich world 's banking troubles have not been cheap either .
The bill for bolstering Finland 's banks in the early 1990s came to 8 % of GDP ; Sweden 's bail - out was scarcely less dear .
America spent more than 3 % of GDP cleaning up the savings - and - loan crisis , its priciest to date .
That suggests that the possible cost of today 's troubles , though alarming , is not off the charts .
The best , though still highly uncertain , estimate of prospective lending losses is around $ 1.1 trillion , less than half of which would be borne in America by banks , investors and in forgone taxes : $ 460 billion is equivalent to about 3 % of last year 's GDP .
Ideally , fiscal support for banks should be targeted , if it is needed at all .
Bail - outs are often limited to just one institution .
Continental Illinois in America and Johnson Matthey Bankers in Britain were rescued in 1984 , because regulators judged that the banks were large enough to rock the whole system should they go bust .
When Barings , another British bank , was wiped out by trading losses 11 years later , regulators let it fail , judging that the risk of wider damage was low .
These episodes occurred in times of relative financial calm , so have few lessons for today .
The parallels with the Nordic crises of the early 1990s look more useful .
Then as now , the banking bust followed economic and asset - price booms fired by the deregulation of credit , low interest rates and lax supervision .
Norway 's three biggest lenders were nationalised , but research by its central bank puts the fiscal cost at far less than in Finland or Sweden .
Once banks were taken into public ownership , shareholders were universally wiped out .
And though the cost of working out bad debts was around 2 % of GDP , all that and more was recouped when the banks were privatised .
In other words , the state made a profit from the crisis .
Denmark , meanwhile , avoided the storms altogether because of stricter capital rules — prevention is better than cure .
The Nordic crises were not so long ago , yet they seem a world away .
Norway probably avoided a worse fate by acting swiftly once it was clear that its biggest banks were insolvent .
The obvious contrast is with Japan , where bad debts were left to fester .
But today it is much harder for regulators to tell which banks , if any , are insolvent .
That is because bad debt is hidden within complex securities , and the value of those securities is almost impossible to measure when markets have dried up .
These days , the trouble lies as much in the financial markets as with the banks that trade in them .
1998 and all that
The growing complexity of links between banks is the reason why Bear Stearns , an investment bank that may not have worried regulators had it failed 15 years ago , could not be left to collapse today .
The manner of its rescue recalled the efforts to shore up Long - Term Capital Management , a hedge fund tied intricately into the financial system , in 1998 .
Bear 's demise also shows how the boundary between illiquidity and insolvency is fast dissolving .
The bank was sold for a fraction of its book value after it was shut out of lending markets .
Yet it is not clear whether it was insolvent in the sense that its assets were worth less than it owed .
By throwing open its discount window to investment banks , the Fed has tacitly admitted that the old rules no longer apply .
It was a bold step , but not necessarily a sufficient one .
There is still a stigma attached to discount - window borrowing , which means banks may be unwilling to avail themselves of it until it is too late , even when they are truly desperate .
In today 's unholy tangle of short - term funding and long - term derivatives contracts , more banks may well fall into the liquidity traps that snared Bear and Britain 's Northern Rock .
If so , central banks may find they have to go further than ever and provide a floor for asset prices in illiquid markets .
Since banks are unwilling to trade in mortgage assets , because they do not have the capital or cannot risk marking losses to market , there may be an opportunity for governments to buy assets at big discounts .
Judicious intervention could in principle improve liquidity , bolster confidence and may in the end even make money for taxpayers if asset prices recover .
But supporting badly run investment banks should also come with strings attached : regulatory control to reduce the chance that public support will be needed again .
Correction :
We wrongly stated that the best estimate of prospective banking losses is around $ 1.1 billion .
We meant $ 1.1 trillion .
This error was corrected on March 21st 2008 .
Andre Young , Jr. , the son of hip - hop producer Dr. Dre ( real name Andre Young , Sr. ) died over the weekend , the music mogul 's rep confirms .
The younger Dre was only 20 .
His body was discovered by his mother at his home in Woodland Hills , Calif. , on Saturday morning , according to the L.A. County Coroner 's office .
" Dr. Dre is mourning the tragic loss of his son , " rep Lori Earl said in a statement .
" Please respect his family 's grief and privacy at this time . "
Young 's mother told Los Angeles police that she attempted to rouse her son at 10:24 a.m. on Saturday , and when she could n't , she immediately called paramedics .
They pronounced Andre Young , Jr. , dead at the scene .
Andre Young , Jr. , " had been out with friends " the previous night before returning home around 5:30 a.m. , according to the L.A. County coroner 's office .
An autopsy was performed Monday .
No foul play is expected .
Dr. Dre , is one of rap 's most prolific figures .
After achieving fame with N.W.A. , Dre released The Chronic in 1992 and went on to sign and collaborate with some of hip hop 's top acts , such as Snoop Dogg , Eminem and numerous others .
An outpouring of support flooded Dr. Dre 's MySpace page in the wake of his son's passing .
We hope Andre , Jr. , rests in peace .
Dr. Dre has four other children : sons Curtis , 26 , Marcel , 17 , and Truth , 11 , and daughter Truly , 7 .
THE American housing market has deteriorated so sharply in the past two years that it is easy to fall prey to profound pessimism .
Recent weeks have brought yet more bad news .
To protect their thin capital , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the big mortgage agencies , said they would limit the volume of new mortgages that they buy .
JPMorgan Chase announced $ 1.5 billion in mortgage - related write - downs and gave warning of worsening housing conditions .
Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve found that mortgage - underwriting terms were tightening by the greatest extent since the early 1990s .
Amid the despondency , however , supply and demand are moving towards balance .
Sales of new homes , which had plunged nearly 60 % from their average level of 2005 , have been stable since March .
Sales of existing homes stopped falling last autumn .
Julia Coronado of Barclays Capital says that construction of homes built for sale , not counting units that already have a buyer , had dropped to 13 % below the level of new - home sales in the first quarter ( see chart 1 ) .
She thinks second - quarter data , due out on August 19th , will show the gap growing to 18 % .
That is why the inventory of unsold homes , though still near recent highs relative to monthly sales , has fallen sharply in absolute terms .
By the standards of previous cycles , residential construction should be nearing the bottom .
Karl Case , a housing expert at Wellesley College and one of the creators of the S&P / Case - Shiller home - price indices , notes that in three previous housing cycles , residential investment peaked at about 5.5 % of GDP and hit bottom at around 3.5 % .
In the latest cycle it peaked at 5.5 % in 2006 and by the second quarter had fallen to 3.1 % of GDP , below the troughs of 1975 , 1982 and 1991 .
He does not expect much rebound .
But like hitting yourself with a hammer , house building need only stop falling for the economy to feel better .
Most forecasters expect construction to fall further in coming quarters but since that will be from a shrinking base , the impact on overall economic growth will diminish .
Finally , since home prices have dropped about 18 % from their mid-2006 peak ( based on the S&P / Case - Shiller composite of 20 cities ) and incomes have steadily grown , homes are returning to more typical levels of affordability in some regions .
Mr Case estimates that in Los Angeles , the ratio of home prices to annual income per person doubled from 2001 - 06 to 16 , and has since fallen to 11 .
In Boston , it rose from nine to 12 , and has since fallen back to nine .
There are numerous caveats , however .
First , the scale of the housing boom means history is a flawed guide to how big a retrenchment is in store .
As Mr Case succinctly puts it , “ We really overdid it . ” David Seiders , chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) in Washington , DC , thinks that in normal times , 3.6 % of America 's housing stock — including owner - occupied homes , rental units and builders ' inventory — should be vacant .
The figure is now 4.8 % .
That translates into 1.5 m “ excess ” vacant units , one reason Mr Seiders thinks construction is going to keep falling until the second quarter of next year .
Some believe that with banks and other lenders dumping huge numbers of foreclosed homes , prices could fall well below equilibrium .
That is debatable .
A recent paper by Charles Calomiris of Columbia University and Stanley Longhofer and William Miles , both of Wichita State University , argues that foreclosure sales will impact prices less than commonly thought .
They examined state - level data from 1981 to 2007 and found that even large increases in foreclosures have only a small marginal impact on prices , perhaps because they occur late in the cycle when the supply of newly built homes is shrinking .
Most serious is the prospect of a further squeeze on credit .
The fate of the mortgage market has increasingly rested on the shoulders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , as well as Ginnie Mae , their wholly government - owned counterpart .
But they may not have much more staying power ; last month , their issuance of mortgage - backed securities plunged by 41 % from June , according to Inside Mortgage Finance , a newsletter ( see chart 2 ) .
Even if Fannie and Freddie 's capital constraints do not stop them guaranteeing mortgages , they have tightened their underwriting terms .
Banks , which lack capital themselves , are passing these tighter terms on to customers .
Mortgage rates have risen by half a percentage point since early June .
This has left both optimists and pessimists pinning hopes for a rebound on the federal government .
Last month 's housing - rescue law offers up to $ 7,500 to first - time homebuyers , a feature that the NAHB has been heavily promoting .
The law also made the government 's implicit backing of Fannie and Freddie explicit , if necessary by injecting capital into them .
Ms Coronado admits her optimistic case goes out of the window if the two firms can no longer do their job .
Which is why , she says , the government will ensure that they can .
By Jane HanStaff ReporterDespite ongoing differences worldwide , one thing remains consistent : the wage gap between men and women .
A 2005 U.S. Labor Department study showed that college - educated women , aged between 36 and 45 , earned 74.7 cents in hourly pay for every dollar that men of the same age group made .
And in the U.K. , last month 's survey said that manager - level women on average earned $ 88,854 annually , while similar - ranking men took home $ 101,245 , to which , the Chartered Management Institute says , is the first time that the pay gap among British managers widened in 11 years .
Similar differences apply locally , as women make about 80 percent of the salary that men make , said Kim Young - ok , a senior researcher at Korean Women 's Development Institute .
``Compared to 20 years ago the gap has narrowed , women used to make only 60 percent of what men did , '' she said , adding that it 's the big corporations that usually change the direction and make a statement with their salary rules .
However , a recent survey done by online recruiter Career indicated that while more major firms are hiring women , the salary difference is widening .
It said the number of females employed hiked in 61 companies out of the 100 surveyed , with Korea Electric Power Corporation seeing the biggest jump over the past five years .
LG .
Philips LCD , Samsung Tech Win , Samsung Heavy Industries and Hana Bank were some of the other companies that , compared to previous years , added more women to their payroll .
But , despite the positive turn in the hiring boost , the study showed that the average paycheck gap has reached up to 22.8 million won ( $ 24,800 ) , up 8 million compared to 2001 .
`` As we all know , this is n't just a problem of Korea , '' said Kim .
`` In other parts of the world , Even if women and men ultimately do the same work , men still take more home .
'' And there are many reasons for this , say experts .
Apart from the longer overall hours put in by men than women , Warren Farrell , author of `` Why Men Earn More : The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap _ and What Women Can Do About It , '' said male workers are more likely to be open toward factors that lead to higher pay .
Relocating or traveling extensively for work , taking on more hazardous assignments , working in the hard sciences , taking jobs requiring greater financial risk and working in unpleasant environments are some of the conditions Farrell mentions in his book .
On the other hand , he writes that women lean toward careers that are more fulfilling , flexible and safe , with the tradeoff of lower pay .
`` Not only do many women have specific work preferences , but they tend to leave the workforce early for marriage and child - rearing , which definitely affects their salary curve , '' added Kim , noting that a higher number of women are also temporary contract workers who generally get paid less than permanent ones .
Although the issue of the wage gap has been long - existent , economists and feminists have recently raised concerns that the narrowing has hit stagnation .
`` The 1980s has been a time of playing catch - up , but the speed suddenly slowed and will most likely remain sluggish , '' said Kim , as she attributed the doldrums partially to women 's indifferent reactions despite the inequality .
`` They have to step up to the plate and take action .
'' Regarding this matter , Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever , authors of ``Women Do n't Ask , '' give good reasons to why ladies should speak up , as they say , by not negotiating a first salary , an individual stands to lose more than $ 500,000 by age 60 .
Also , they wrote men are four times more likely to negotiate a first salary , with men picking metaphors such as ``winning a ballgame ' ' and a ``wrestling match '' to describe the negotiation process , while women chose to describe it as ``going to the dentist . '' `` Although the societal landscape forms the wage disparity to some degree , natural tendencies between the two genders play a significant factor as well , '' said Kim .
Mortality is 21 years old and too messed up for her own good .
She writes about her life ; both past and present .
Since sex is a part of her life she 'll write some about that too .

Law enforcement has " little adverse effect " on the availability of drugs in Britain , new research claims .
A report from the UK Drugs Policy Commission published yesterday said drug markets were " extremely resilient .
They are highly fluid and adapt to law enforcement interventions " .
The commission , a charity made up of specialists in drug treatment , public policy , policing and medical research , said attempts to tackle Britain 's £ 5.3 bn drug habit were not working
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Tim McSweeney of King 's College London , the report 's author , said : " We were struck by just how little evidence there is to show that the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on UK enforcement each year has made a sustainable impact . "
In 2003 / 04 the cost of detecting , prosecuting and sentencing class - A drug crime in the UK was £ 4bn .
The report said enforcement " can have a significant and unintended negative impact on the nature and extent of harms associated with drugs " .
A spokesman for the Home Office said that many of the report 's recommendations had already been taken up .
I noticed that Eric Wendelin wrote an article " awk is a beautiful tool . "
In this article he said that it was best to introduce Awk with practical examples .
I totally agree with Eric .
When I was learning Awk , I first went through Awk - A Tutorial and Introduction by Bruce Barnett , which was full of examples to try out ; then I created an Awk cheat sheet to have the language reference in front of me ; and finally I went through the famous Awk one - liners ( link to .txt file ) , which were compiled by Eric Pement .
This is going to be a three - part article in which I will explain every single one - liner in Mr. Pement 's compilation .
Each part will explain around 20 one - liners .
If you follow closely then the explained examples will turn you into a great Awk programmer .
Eric Pement 's
Awk one - liner collection consists of five sections :
The first part of the article will explain the first two sections : " File spacing " and " Numbering and calculations . "
The second part will explain " Text conversion and substitution " , and the last part " Selective printing / deleting of certain lines . "
I recommend that you print out my Awk cheat sheet before you proceed .
This way you will have the language reference in front of you , and you will memorize things better .
These one - liners work with all versions of awk , such as nawk ( AT&T's new awk ) , gawk ( GNU 's awk ) , mawk ( Michael Brennan 's awk ) and oawk ( old awk ) .
Awesome news : I have written an e-book based on this article series .
Check it out :
Let 's start !
1. Line Spacing
1. Double - space a file .
awk ' 1 ; { print " " }'
So how does it work ?
A one - liner is an Awk program and every Awk program consists of a sequence of pattern - action statements " pattern { action statements } " .
In this case there are two statements 1 and { print " " } .
In a pattern - action statement either the pattern or the action may be missing .
If the pattern is missing , the action is applied to every single line of input .
A missing action is equivalent to { print } .
Thus , this one - liner translates to :
awk ' 1 { print } { print " " }'
An action is applied only if the pattern matches , i.e. , pattern is true .
Since 1 is always true , this one - liner translates further into two print statements :
awk '{ print } { print " " }'
Every print statement in Awk is silently followed by an ORS - Output Record Separator variable , which is a newline by default .
The first print statement with no arguments is equivalent to print $ 0 , where $ 0 is a variable holding the entire line .
The second print statement prints nothing , but knowing that each print statement is followed by ORS , it actually prints a newline .
So there we have it , each line gets double - spaced .
2 . Another way to double - space a file .
awk ' BEGIN { ORS = "
" } ; 1 '
BEGIN is a special kind of pattern which is not tested against the input .
It is executed before any input is read .
This one - liner double - spaces the file by setting the ORS variable to two newlines .
As I mentioned previously , statement " 1 " gets translated to " { print } " , and every print statement gets terminated with the value of ORS variable .
3 . Double - space a file so that no more than one blank line appears between lines of text .
awk ' NF { print $ 0 "
" }'
The one - liner uses another special variable called NF - Number of Fields .
It contains the number of fields the current line was split into .
For example , a line " this is a test " splits in four pieces and NF gets set to 4 .
The empty line " " does not split into any pieces and NF gets set to 0 .
Using NF as a pattern can effectively filter out empty lines .
This one liner says : " If there are any number of fields , print the whole line followed by newline . "
4. Triple - space a file .
awk ' 1 ; { print "
" }'
This one - liner is very similar to previous ones .
' 1 ' gets translated into '{ print }' and the resulting Awk program is :
awk '{ print ; print "
" }'
It prints the line , then prints a newline followed by terminating ORS , which is newline by default .
2. Numbering and Calculations
5 . Number lines in each file separately .
awk '{ print FNR " \t " $ 0 }'
This Awk program appends the FNR - File Line Number predefined variable and a tab ( \t ) before each line .
FNR variable contains the current line for each file separately .
For example , if this one - liner was called on two files , one containing 10 lines , and the other 12 , it would number lines in the first file from 1 to 10 , and then resume numbering from one for the second file and number lines in this file from 1 to 12 .
FNR gets reset from file to file .
6 . Number lines for all files together .
awk '{ print NR " \t " $ 0 }'
This one works the same as # 5 except that it uses NR - Line Number variable , which does not get reset from file to file .
It counts the input lines seen so far .
For example , if it was called on the same two files with 10 and 12 lines , it would number the lines from 1 to 22 ( 10 + 12 ) .
7. Number lines in a fancy manner .
awk '{ printf ( " %5d : %s
" , NR , $ 0 ) }'
This one - liner uses printf ( ) function to number lines in a custom format .
It takes format parameter just like a regular printf ( ) function .
Note that ORS does not get appended at the end of printf ( ) , so we have to print the newline (
) character explicitly .
This one right - aligns line numbers , followed by a space and a colon , and the line .
8. Number only non -blank lines in files .
awk ' NF { $ 0=++a " :" $ 0 } ; { print }'
Awk variables are dynamic ; they come into existence when they are first used .
This one - liner pre-increments variable ' a ' each time the line is non-empty , then it appends the value of this variable to the beginning of line and prints it out .
9 . Count lines in files ( emulates wc - l ) .
awk ' END { print NR }'
END is another special kind of pattern which is not tested against the input .
It is executed when all the input has been exhausted .
This one - liner outputs the value of NR special variable after all the input has been consumed .
NR contains total number of lines seen ( = number of lines in the file ) .
10 .
Print the sum of fields in every line .
awk '{ s = 0 ; for ( i = 1 ; i <= NF ; i++) s = s+$i ; print s }'
Awk has some features of C language , like the for ( ; ; ) { ... } loop .
This one - liner loops over all fields in a line ( there are NF fields in a line ) , and adds the result in variable 's ' .
Then it prints the result out and proceeds to the next line .
11 . Print the sum of fields in all lines .
awk '{ for ( i = 1 ; i <= NF ; i++) s = s+$i } ; END { print s+0 }'
This one - liner is basically the same as # 10 , except that it prints the sum of all fields .
Notice how it did not initialize variable 's ' to 0 .
It was not necessary as variables come into existence dynamically .
Also notice how it calls " print s+0 " and not just " print s " .
It is necessary if there are no fields .
If there are no fields , " s " never comes into existence and is undefined .
Printing an undefined value does not print anything ( i.e. prints just the ORS ) .
Adding a 0 does a mathematical operation and undef+0 = 0 , so it prints " 0 " .
12 . Replace every field by its absolute value .
awk '{ for ( i = 1 ; i <= NF ; i++) if ( $ i < 0 ) $ i = - $ i ; print }'
This one - liner uses two other features of C language , namely the if ( ... ) { ... } statement and omission of curly braces .
It loops over all fields in a line and checks if any of the fields is less than 0 .
If any of the fields is less than 0 , then it just negates the field to make it positive .
Fields can be addresses indirectly by a variable .
For example , i = 5 ; $ i = ' hello ' , sets field number 5 to string ' hello ' .
Here is the same one - liner rewritten with curly braces for clarity .
The ' print ' statement gets executed after all the fields in the line have been replaced by their absolute values .
awk '{ for ( i = 1 ; i <= NF ; i++) { if ( $ i < 0 ) { $ i = - $ i ; } } print }'
13 .
Count the total number of fields ( words ) in a file .
awk '{ total = total + NF } ; END { print total+0 }'
This one - liner matches all the lines and keeps adding the number of fields in each line .
The number of fields seen so far is kept in a variable named ' total ' .
Once the input has been processed , special pattern ' END { ... } ' is executed , which prints the total number of fields .
See 11th one - liner for explanation of why we " print total+0 " in the END block .
14 . Print the total number of lines containing word " Beth " .
awk '/ Beth / { n++ } ; END { print n+0 }'
This one - liner has two pattern - action statements .
The first one is '/ Beth / { n++ }'.
A pattern between two slashes is a regular expression .
It matches all lines containing pattern " Beth " ( not necessarily the word " Beth " , it could as well be " Bethe " or " the Beth333 " ) .
When a line matches , variable ' n ' gets incremented by one .
The second pattern - action statement is ' END { print n+0 }'.
It is executed when the file has been processed .
Note the ' +0 ' in ' print n+0 ' statement .
It forces ' 0 ' to be printed in case there were no matches ( ' n ' was undefined ) .
Had we not put ' +0 ' there , an empty line would have been printed .
15 .
Find the line containing the largest ( numeric ) first field .
awk ' $ 1 > max { max = $ 1 ; maxline =$ 0 } ; END { print max , maxline }'
This one - liner keeps track of the largest number in the first field ( in variable ' max ' ) and the corresponding line ( in variable ' maxline ' ) .
Once it has looped over all lines , it prints them out .
Warning : this one - liner does not work if all the values are negative .
Here is the fix :
awk ' NR == 1 { max = $ 1 ; maxline = $ 0 ; next ; } $ 1 > max { max = $ 1 ; maxline =$ 0 } ; END { print max , maxline }'
16 . Print the number of fields in each line , followed by the line .
awk '{ print NF " : " $ 0 } '
This one - liner just prints out the predefined variable NF - Number of Fields , which contains the number of fields in the line , followed by a colon and the line itself .
17 . Print the last field of each line .
awk '{ print $ NF }'
Fields in Awk need not be referenced by constants .
For example , code like 'f = 3 ; print $ f ' would print out the 3rd field .
This one - liner prints the field with the value of NF .
$ NF is last field in the line .
18 . Print the last field of the last line .
awk '{ field = $ NF } ; END { print field }'
This one - liner keeps track of the last field in variable ' field ' .
Once it has looped all the lines , variable ' field ' contains the last field of the last line , and it just prints it out .
Here is a better version of the same one - liner .
It 's more common , idiomatic and efficient :
awk 'END { print $ NF }'
19 .
Print every line with more than 4 fields .
awk ' NF > 4 '
This one - liner omits the action statement .
As I noted in one - liner # 1 , a missing action statement is equivalent to '{ print }' .
20 .
Print every line where the value of the last field is greater than 4 .
awk ' $ NF > 4 '
This one - liner is similar to # 17 .
It references the last field by NF variable .
If it 's greater than 4 , it prints it out .

I just wrote my first e-book called " Awk One - Liners Explained " .

Dear Dr. Kierkegaard ,
All my life I ’ve been a successful pseudo - intellectual , sprinkling quotations from Kafka , Epictetus and Derrida into my conversations , impressing dates and making my friends feel mentally inferior .
But over the last few years , it ’s stopped working .
People just look at me blankly .
My artificially inflated self - esteem is on the wane .
What happened ?
Existential in Exeter
Dear Existential ,
It pains me to see so many people being pseudo - intellectual in the wrong way .
It desecrates the memory of the great poseurs of the past .
And it is all the more frustrating because your error is so simple and yet so fundamental .
You have failed to keep pace with the current code of intellectual one - upsmanship .
You have failed to appreciate that over the past few years , there has been a tectonic shift in the basis of good taste .
You must remember that there have been three epochs of intellectual affectation .
The first , lasting from approximately 1400 to 1965 , was the great age of snobbery .
Cultural artifacts existed in a hierarchy , with opera and fine art at the top , and stripping at the bottom .
The social climbing pseud merely had to familiarize himself with the forms at the top of the hierarchy and febrile acolytes would perch at his feet .
Sept. 21 , 2008  -- Congressional and administration leaders split today over how a bailout package for U.S. financial markets should look , even as all sides called for swift action .
Wrangling over the size and shape of the relief package belied a universal sense of urgency about getting it through Congress after a week of turbulence on Wall Street and concerns about global implications of a possible U.S. economic meltdown .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told ABC News ' " This Week with George Stephanopoulos " that the government was preparing to extend bailout protection to foreign companies caught up in the nation 's financial crisis , but Paulson rejected proposals that the bailout include new caps on executive compensation or steps to protect American homeowners , who are facing foreclosure in unprecedented numbers .
" We need a lot of reforms .
And this is going to be something Congress and the next administration is going to be working on for a long time , " Paulson told Stephanopolous .
" But these can't be done , and should n't be done , in a matter of days .
And we need this program in days in order to protect the American people .
" We 've been focused on homeowners for a long time , working to avoid foreclosure , " he said .
" It sure seems to me that , as we buy these mortgage - backed assets , we will have much more leverage in working on the kinds of programs we need to work on . "
Senate Banking Committee chairman Sen. Chris Dodd , however , in a separate appearance on " This Week , " said the foreclosure crisis needed to be addressed .
" The fact of the matter is the cause ... it is n't just an effect ... the cause of this problem is still the foreclosure crisis , " Dodd said .
" So it needs to be part of the solution .
That 's not to clog this up .
We need to act quickly and deliberately , and we will . "
Dodd went as far as to call the bailout more important than the presidential race .
" We 're 40 days away from a national election , but this issue supersedes an election , " Dodd told Stephanopolous .
" We need to get this right . "
Dodd described a sense of shock among congressman when Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke laid out for them the dimensions of the economic crisis .
" When the chairman of the Federal Reserve described the situation to us , there was a pause for about 10 or 15 seconds when nothing was said , " Dodd told Stephanopolous .
" The air came out of the room .
It was that ... startling . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , who appeared alongside Dodd on " This Week , " echoed the senator 's alarm .
" This is not a time for ideological purity , " said Boehner .
" I'm a free - market non-interventionist , but we face a crisis .
And if we do n't act , if we do n't act quickly , we 're gonna jeopardize our economy . "
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , said that he believed there would be changes to Paulson 's plan and that agreement could still be reached quickly .
Schumer said that he was pushing to get a provision where the government would receive stock warrants in return for the bailout relief and for the creation of a government oversight board to supervise the huge operation , which under Paulson 's plan would be run out of the Treasury Department .
He said Paulson seemed receptive to changes when he had discussed his ideas .
" I have told him ... we need changes related to housing , we need to put the taxpayer first ahead of bondholders , shareholders , " Schumer said on " Fox News Sunday . "
Members of Congress worked through the weekend to hammer out the plan 's specifics , in part because the legislature is set to recess this Friday and wo n't return until after the presidential election on Nov. 4 .
A Plan Takes Shape
Key administration players took to the airwaves Sunday to make the case for a proposed $ 700 billion financial industry bailout after the collapse last week of investment bank Lehman Brothers , the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and previous bailout packages for Bear Stearns and insurance giants Freddie Mae and Fannie Mac .
Paulson told Stephanopolous that the White House will push for foreign firms to be included in the plan .
" We have a global financial system .
And we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , " Paulson said .
" If a financial institution has business operations in the United States , hires people in the United States , if they are clogged with illiquid assets , they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution , " he said .
" That 's a distinction without a difference to the American people .
The key here is about protecting the system . "
President Bush said Saturday the White House is ready to work with Congress to quickly enact legislation to allow the government to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bad debt linked to the collapse of the housing market .
The administration proposal would be the biggest government intervention since the Great Depression .
It would dole out huge sums of money to financial firms to purchase their holdings of bad mortgage - backed securities so that these firms can resume normal lending operations .
The bad mortgage debt has been at the heart of the current credit crisis , which hit more than a year ago but erupted with special ferocity in the past two weeks , forcing extraordinary government actions .
Two weeks ago , the government seized control of the nation 's two largest mortgage companies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and then last week , it took control of the country 's largest insurance company , American International Group Inc .
The new proposal would raise the statutory limit on the national debt from $ 10.6 trillion to $ 11.3 trillion to make room for the massive rescue .
" I do n't think anyone knows whether it will work or not .
I think in the short run it has the potential to increase confidence , " financial analyst David Vise told ABC News ' " Good Morning America Weekend Edition " today .
" The plan is basically to prop up the United States system . "
But finding a solution to the credit crisis that has now dominated the financial markets wo n't happen without some pain , according to Vise .
" There is no panacea , There is not painless solution here , " said Vise , who added the economy 's primary problem is a lack of confidence .
" The idea is to inspire confidence , " Vise said .
What It All Means
The plan 's $ 700 billion price tag is a large one for taxpayers .
It 's the amount the government would increase on the budget 's limit under the Treasury Secretary 's supervision so that it could buy up big bundles of toxic assets , like bad mortgages , which are weighing down Wall Street .
The idea is that with cleared balance sheets , banks could go back to work and again lend money to individuals for new homes , cars , businesses and college tuitions .
The government does n't want to own the bad mortgages for long .
The plan is to resell them eventually and recoup the money .
The Treasury 's new powers would last for only two years and the secretary would have to report to Congress semi-annually .
" The government becomes essentially , one of the largest , or the largest homeowner in the country , " said Stanford Group Company analyst Anne Mathias .
" When you joke about your mortgage and you say , ' Well , I do n't own my house , the bank owns my house . '
Well , now , you do n't own your house but the government owns your house . "
But the bailout could have an economic downside — inflation .
" [ There is ] no question at all is that this could increase inflation , " Vise said .
He said officials believe a rise in inflation is less of a problem than troubles currently causing the economy 's hemorrhaging .
Democrats have said they will work with the administration to pass a plan , but will demand it include relief for homeowners struggling with mounting debt and not just Wall Street .
It 's the Economy Again , Stupid
The country 's financial troubles have become a major focus in the presidential election .
" It looks like it 's a defining moment in the race , " Stephanopoulos said on " GMA " today .
" This crisis over the last week has really brought focus to the economy . "
Already , Republican nominee John McCain and rival Barack Obama have come out swinging on the issue .
Obama has hammered McCain for what he believes is a flip - flop -- using the Arizona senator 's own words against him .
He referred to a magazine article McCain once wrote where he suggested the country should cut regulation of health insurance " as we have done over the last decade in banking . "
" He wants to run health care like they 've been running Wall Street , " Obama told a crowd of more than 15,000 in Jacksonville , Fla .
" Well , senator , I know some folks on Main Street who are n't going to think that 's a good idea . "
The McCain campaign has called that assertion a distortion and claims its six - point plan supporting new regulations shows leadership .
Obama canceled unveiling a plan of his own , as his aides said a measured approach is more presidential .
America 's financial troubles have taken the focus off the personalities of the campaigns and back toward the issues , Stephanopoulos said .
He added that it's had a benefit for Obama , who spent the last several weeks trying to combat the Sarah Palin effect , which boosted McCain 's campaign and its support .
But one thing is inescapable .
Whoever wins the presidency will inherit an office facing a deep recession and spend the first year digging out of an economic hole rather than furthering his own agenda , Stephanopoulos said .
When asked what will happen if the emergency bailout fails , Paulson asserted , " This is something that has to work .
I very much believe it will work . "
In a separate appearance on " Meet the Press , " Paulson admitted the bailout would be costly for taxpayers , but said that the government was picking the better of two bad choices .
" It pains me tremendously to have the American taxpayer put in this position , " Paulson said , " but it is better than the alternative . "
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Evil :
It 's the new good ! /
Shut up and drink your high fructose corn syrup , sucker
The devil is n't evil , he just has lousy PR .
Examples ?
They are legion .
Here 's one the Powers That Be desperately hope you 'll swallow , a nasty piece of marketing gall meant to stab at your intelligence and bitch - slap your intuition , but which is nevertheless being force - fed to you as happy environmental manna , a viciously deformed version of something called " progress . "
Here is " clean coal . "
Is n't it beautiful ?
Truly , the hell - bound ad agency that coughed up that one even had the nerve to film a commercial featuring Kool and the Gang 's " Celebrate " playing over perky scenes of manic Americans sucking down electricity like John McCain sucks down extra oxygen , claiming that coal is America 's namesake resource and we should therefore kneel before it and worship it like apple pie and horrible sex-ed and Lindsay Lohan 's nipples .
Did I mention the coal industry 's PR people are going to hell for this ?
Count on it .
There is , of course , no such thing as " clean coal . "
It 's as impossible as a humanitarian Republican , as insulting as Homeland Security .
Even Obama gets it wrong in his support of this lethal oxymoron .
There are only two options : Brutally pollutive coal extraction and burning techniques , rapacious strip mining and millions of acres of destroyed forest and contaminated water tables and toxified air and one of the most environmentally destructive energy sources on the planet ; or new and slightly less horribly pollutive coal extraction / burn techniques that attempt to rein in a few of the more toxic pollutants , but not including carbon dioxide or , you know , cancer and death .
That 's about it .
Translation : " clean coal " is not only one of the most insidious , repugnant oxymorons -- right up there with " friendly fire " and " conservative think tank " and " Alaskan teen virgin " -- it 's also one of the deadliest .
Not good enough ?
Do n't you worry .
Here is high - fructose corn syrup .
It appears the corporate whiners down at the Corn Refiners Association , unhappy with the billions they 've already made on the staggering rise of their dreadful product and apparently tired of their gunk getting such a bad rap from every doctor and health mag from here to the Mayo Clinic , have launched a sweet little counter - offensive aimed at proving their goop is , well , slightly less evil than you thought .
Here is their cute little commercial :
Two generic moms , one pouring her kids a big , fat glass of bright red HFCS - laden pseudo - juice , as the other frowns and says gosh golly Susan , you feed your kids that crap ?
That has high fructose corn syrup in it !
And the first irresponsible mom just smiles an 'oh you stupid bitch ' kind of robotic smile and says hey , HFCS is really no worse than sugar , it 's natural because it 's made from corn , and it 's perfectly OK in moderation , so shut the hell up and drink your nauseating food - colored crap , Marjorie ( please note : I might be paraphrasing slightly ) .
Is n't that lovely ?
To be fair , they have a meager point .
Despite its highly processed nature , HFCS might very well be exactly as bad for you as plain ol ' sugar ( by the way , thanks to the wishy - washy FDA , " natural " is a completely bulls - -t term that means nothing ; calling HFCS " natural " is like calling Cindy McCain natural ) .
But its manufacture is simply awful , from the tons of pesticides used to grow all that needless industrial corn to the ridiculous and devastating farm subsidies that force farmers to grow far more of it than our country can possibly use .
Which is why HFCS is everywhere and in everything , from soups to whole - grain bread , crackers to ketchup to pickles to tomato paste .
Thanks in part to the violent ubiquity of HFCS , bloated Americans now consume a total of 100 pounds of sweetener a year , per capita .
Go read your " Omnivore 's Dilemma " or rent the " King Corn " DVD to see just how awful this stuff is .
The Corn Refiners Association is praying you do n't .
On it goes .
Every major oil company has a pseudo - green , false - front " Let 's take care of our planet " BS campaign underway , whitewashing their evils so insultingly it 's like Dick Cheney wearing a PETA T - shirt to a canned pheasant hunt .
Even the king of consumer mediocrity , Microsoft , launched a " Vista :
It 's not quite as awful as you 've heard " campaign to help stifle the low - level groans of 20 million bug - addled users .
And recall , wo n't you , a couple of years back , when Wal - Mart launched its own ad campaign to counter all the negative press it was getting about its nasty labor policies , the lawsuits and infractions and claims of forced overtime , even lovely hints of sexism and racism and blurry photos of secret underground lairs where 10,000 paunchy middle managers met to skin live kittens and drink the blood of sweatshop workers and sacrifice their dreams as they chant Shania Twain lyrics in their underwear ( again , paraphrasing ) .
Of course , Wal - Mart , rather than actually improve its policies , instead spent millions to make itself merely look friendlier , touting all the ( low - paying , often part - time , generally miserable ) jobs they bring in to a community , and gosh , just look how happy those cashiers seem to be , and never you mind the vague threats that if anyone tries to unionize , a pale army of sexless managers will follow you home and kill you in your sleep with this 20 - pound tub of cheese - coated popcorn .
Mmm , wholesome .
But perhaps none of these examples can top the scabrous GOP , suddenly being repackaged and resold to exhausted , Bush - ravaged Americans as " the maverick party , " with John McCain desperately trying to distance himself from the worst and most abusive administration in a lifetime , all the torture and warmongering and pandering to the religious right , even as he so obviously plans to continue it all .
It 's a rather sickening marketing ploy , made even more contemptible by McCain 's choice of VP , not someone of sharp political acumen who will challenge his decisions and offer insight and inspire confidence , but Sarah Palin , former mayor of a piddling , eyeblink of a pee-stop town in rural Nowheresville , a shrill woman of zero political accomplishment clearly brought on board to lure both confused white women and the hard evangelical right , a minor state governor who thinks Creationism is dandy and who just got her first passport in 2007 and who would happily pass a law to force your daughter to have the baby if she 'd been raped .
Charming .
Truly , Palin is that most dangerous of self - aggrandizing right - wing politico , a potentially very powerful woman full of moxie and nerve and intensely intolerant , extremist views who actually hates women .
Really , you can't get much more Republican than that .
And lo , in the spirit of Wal - Mart and the Corn Refiners Association and the clean - coal cretins trying to make their rampant evils seem slightly less , well , evil , we humbly offer to McPalin this new marketing slogan : " The Republicans :
An entirely new kind of contemptible you had n't even thought of yet . "
Just trying to help , really .

John McCain may not be a BlackBerry user .
But Tuesday , one of his aides was ready to give the Republican presidential nominee credit for one of the technological marvels of the modern age .
In a comment that brought to mind the 2000 presidential campaign flap over whether Al Gore had invented the Internet , McCain ’s senior policy advisor said the candidate was responsible for the BlackBerry .
Douglas Holtz - Eakin held up his little device to show reporters in Miami as he sought to explain why McCain was qualified to lead the nation out of its economic morass .
“ He did this , ” Holtz - Eakin said .
“ The premier innovation in the past 15 years comes right from the commerce committee .
So , you ’re looking at the miracle that John McCain helped create . ”

McCain is a veteran member of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science & Transportation , which oversees telecommunication as well as aviation , trade and other economic sectors .
He headed the panel from 1997 to 2001 and in 2003 - 04 .
“ He both regulated and deregulated that industry , ” Holtz - Eakin said .
McCain , however , has not focused on telecom , has never chaired the telecommunications subcommittee and was one of only two senators to vote against a sweeping telecom deregulation bill in 1996 .
The senator from Arizona later laughed off innovative acumen attributed to him , according to campaign senior aide Matt McDonald .
“ He would not claim to be the inventor of anything , much less the BlackBerry .
This was obviously a boneheaded joke by a staffer , ” McDonald said .

Advertisement The City regulator has announced a ban on short - selling - in which traders bet on share prices falling - in a bid to tackle market instability .
The Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) is clamping down on what some think contributed to the sharp falls in HBOS shares before Lloyds TSB rescued it .
The rule came into force at midnight and is due to last until 16 January .
The FSA 's clampdown applies only to 29 leading financial stocks , and not to shares in all listed firms .
The restrictions will be reviewed after 30 days .
" While we still regard short - selling as a legitimate investment technique in normal market conditions , the current extreme circumstances have given rise to disorderly markets , " said FSA chief executive Hector Sants .
' Financial stability '
Short - selling is a technique that sees investors borrow an asset , such as shares , currencies or oil contracts , from another investor and then sell that asset in the relevant market hoping the price will fall .
There is a danger in a trading system which allows financial institutions to be targeted and subject to extreme short - selling pressures
Callum McCarthy
Financial Services Authority chairman
The aim is to buy back the asset at a lower price and return it to its owner , pocketing the difference .
Anyone can short a position in a company 's shares , but typically hedge funds are the main players .
Chancellor Alistair Darling welcomed the move by the FSA .
" I believe it is the right thing to do in the current market conditions and in the interests of financial stability , " he said .
Markets have fluctuated hugely in recent days , with fundamental changes occurring in the financial landscape .
There are fears that several firms , including Lehman Brothers , which filed for bankruptcy at the start of the week , and insurance giant AIG , which was rescued by the Federal Reserve , were targeted by those short - selling .

Speaking to the BBC , Mr Darling underlined that short - selling was not wrong in itself .
" It can help actually in providing funds , liquidity , for companies . "
But he added that it could become a problem where people " deliberately " manipulate a market , making " a difficult situation even worse " .
Callum McCarthy , chairman of the Financial Services Authority , expressed concerns over recent volatility .
" There is a danger in a trading system which allows financial institutions to be targeted and subject to extreme short - selling pressures , because movements in equity prices can be translated into uncertainty in the minds of those who place deposits with those institutions with consequent financial stability issues . "
Broader moves
It was not only in the UK that attempts were being made to address short - shelling .
The US financial regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , also announced restrictions on short - selling on Wednesday .
And on Thursday , New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo said he would start a probe into short - selling .
At issue is whether certain traders exploited short - selling to push down stock prices , breaching market rules .
New York 's state pension funds said it would cease lending stocks in 19 firms to short - sellers on a temporary basis .

What are these ?
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama blasted Congress for not passing a financial rescue package Monday , while Sen. John McCain 's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of putting " politics ahead of country . "
The House of Representatives rejected a $ 700 billion plan to bail out the financial system , putting a roadblock in front of the largest government intervention in the market since the Great Depression .
The bill failed by a vote of 205 to 228 , with 140 Democrats and 65 Republicans voting in favor and 95 Democrats joining 133 Republicans against .
" This is a moment of national crisis , and today 's inaction in Congress as well as the angry and hyper - partisan statement released by the McCain campaign are exactly why the American people are disgusted with Washington , " the Obama - Biden campaign said in a statement released shortly after the vote .
The statement went on to say that every American " should be outraged that an era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and Washington has led us to this point . "
Watch more on the vote »
Also after the vote , McCain touted his role in last week 's negotiations on the bailout bill .
" I laid out principles " including " responsible oversight , " transparency and a cap on so - called golden parachutes -- the big bonuses Wall Street CEOs would receive despite their involvement in the economic crisis , he said from Des Moines , Iowa .
" I worked hard to play a constructive role . "
He said he was satisfied with the way the bill was written , though " it was n't perfect . "
Earlier , McCain 's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of injecting politics into the American economy .
" From the minute John McCain suspended his campaign and arrived in Washington to address this crisis , he was attacked by the Democratic leadership : Sens. Obama and [ Senate Majority Leader Harry ] Reid , Speaker Pelosi and others .
" Their partisan attacks were an effort to gain political advantage during a national economic crisis .
By doing so , they put at risk the homes , livelihoods and savings of millions of American families , " Doug Holtz - Eakin , a senior policy adviser for McCain and his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , said in a statement .
" Barack Obama failed to lead , phoned it in , attacked John McCain and refused to even say if he supported the final bill .
...
This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country , " Holtz - Eakin said .
Republicans and Democrats blamed each other for the failure of the bill , which President Bush had urged Congress to approve .
Obama had earlier Monday spoken with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and congressional leaders .
Watch Pelosi say Democrats ' delivered ' »
McCain and Obama had both said Sunday that they would probably vote for the legislation , as long as it included some key principles they had pushed for .
McCain announced last week he was " suspending " his campaign events to focus on the financial crisis , but Democrats accused him of pulling a political stunt .

The economy has dominated the campaign trail this month , and both candidates have been trying to convince voters that they will do a better job of getting the financial crisis under control .
Earlier Monday , McCain told voters that Obama is n't being honest about his tax votes and said the Democrat is " always cheering for higher taxes . "

In response , the Obama campaign called McCain 's remarks " false attacks " and an " angry diatribe . "
" Two times , on March 14 , 2008 , and June 4 , 2008 , in the Democratic budget resolution , he voted to raise taxes on people making just $ 42,000 per year .
He even said at the time that this vote for higher taxes on the middle class was ' getting our nation 's priorities back on track , ' " McCain said at a rally in Columbus , Ohio .
" Then something amazing happened : On Friday night , he looked the American people in the eye and said it never happened .
My friends , we need a president who will always tell the American people the truth , " McCain said .
McCain said a vote for Obama would " guarantee higher taxes , fewer jobs and an even bigger federal government " and charged that " these policies will deepen our recession . "
Watch McCain slam Obama on spending »
Shortly after McCain finished his speech , the Obama campaign accused the Arizona senator of lying .
" Sen. McCain 's angry diatribe today wo n't make up for his erratic response to the greatest financial crisis of our time .
John McCain knows that the budget he 's talking about did n't end up raising taxes on a single American , and the lie he told the American people today is all the more outrageous a day after he admitted that his health care plan will increase taxes on some families , " Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
In McCain 's speech , the Republican presidential candidate was referring to votes on a resolution ( Senate Concurrent Resolution 70 ) meant to outline the Senate 's budget priorities through 2013 , but the measure had no practical effect .
According to a CNN review of the resolution , it assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts pushed by President Bush will expire in that time , which McCain says amounts to a tax increase .
Obama and his running mate , Sen. Joe Biden , voted " yes " on the resolution .
McCain did not vote .
However , the Democrats offered their own cuts in the 48 - page resolution , which called for several tax cuts and breaks , including rolling back the alternative - minimum tax and the so - called " marriage penalty . "
According to an analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center , the tax plan Obama has proposed during the campaign would increase taxes in 2009 on the wealthiest 20 percent of households , while offering tax cuts for the other 80 percent .
Meanwhile , as Obama and McCain continue campaigning this week , their running mates will be focused on their upcoming debate .
Palin and Biden face off Thursday in St. Louis , Missouri , in the only vice presidential debate of the election season .
After McCain 's rally , Palin headed to McCain 's ranch near Sedona , Arizona , for what a top aide calls " debate camp . "
Palin has already spent four days hunkered down in a Philadelphia hotel for debate prep with advisers .
Biden was preparing for the debate in Delaware on Monday .
CNN 's Dana Bash and Alexander Marquardt contributed to this report .

This approach is already used Apple ’s CoreAudio and Windows Vista ’s audio subsystem and has many advantages such as reduced power consumption , minimization of drop- outs and flexible adjustment of the latency to the needs of the application .
3. OpenChange
Integrating the libmapi library from OpenChange , tools such as kdepim and Evolution will become first - class clients of a Microsoft Exchange Server .
4. Security Audit
A new security too will be added to Fedora 10 , called sectool .
It can be used as a security audit and as an intrusion detection .
It consists of set of tests , library and textual / graphical frontends .
Administrators will be able to run selected tests , groups or whole security levels with ease .
5. Better Webcam Support
subject says it all :-)
6. Better Remote Support
A new graphical frontend will be developed to make it easy to connect and configure Infra - Red remote controls .
Users will be able to remotely control multimedia applications such as rhythmbox and totem with this feature .
7. RPM 4.6
The new major RPM version ( after years ) will add a lot of new feature , replacing the old RPM 4.4
8. Haskell Support
Haskell is a growing programming language , Fedora 10 will have a better support for it , adding a lot of packages for the language itself and many softwares written in Haskell .
9. Artistic 1.0 License Removal
This is not a feature as we classically think but it will bring a lot of polish in the license ecosystem removing all packages licensed only under the Artistic 1.0 license .
5 proposed features
1. Better Startup
The team is writing a software ( Plymouth ) to make the startup experience flicker - free , seamless and shiny .
This new software will get rid of RHGB , start before “ / ” is mounted and does n’t require an X server .
2. Better printing
The printer configuration GUIs will be overhauled to look friendlier and more in line with modern desktop applications .
In addition , the configurator wo n’t need root privileges anymore .
3. Port reserve
This feature will integrate the port reservation utility into Fedora 10 , preventing RPC services from taking specified privileged TCP ports .
It will do this by reserving them at boot , and providing a mechanism for releasing them on demand .
This is important for non-RPC services which require privileged ports , such as CUPS .
4. Python-NSS
This will be mostly invisible to a user , adding Python bindings for NSS / NSPR and allowing Python programs to use the NSS cryptographic libraries for SSL / TLS and PKI certificate management .
5. Save to Bugzilla
Fedora 10 ’s installer will be able to save bug reports directly to Fedora ’s bugzilla , making it easier to debug the installer .
Check a video of this feature in action .
Response to Trailer ' Off the Charts '
ICv2 has learned that , based on the overwhelming response to the Watchmen movie trailer accompanying The Dark Knight , DC Comics has ordered a huge new printing of 300,000 copies of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ’ Watchmen graphic novel .
A DC spokesperson told IC v2 that after the movie trailer hit DC was receiving huge orders for the Watchmen graphic novel from every channel .
Even before the Watchmen movie trailer hit the Watchmen graphic novel was already the top- selling American graphic novel in the bookstore market thus far in 2008 .
In the wake of the launch of the movie trailer Watchmen trade shot up to # 5 on Amazon .
All I could think as I watched Al Gore speak was " We wuz robbed . "
Can you imagine what it would be like now having President Gore passing the torch to Obama ?
The mind reels .
Eight years ago , some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it did n't really matter who became President .
Our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity .
Some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome .
But here we all are in 2008 , and I doubt anyone would argue now that election did n't matter .
Take it from me , if it had ended differently , we would not be bogged down in Iraq , we would have pursued Bin Laden until we captured him .
We would not be facing a self - inflicted economic crisis , we would be fighting for middle income families .
We would not be showing contempt for the Constitution , we'd be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race , religion , disability , gender or sexual orientation .
And we would not be denying the climate crisis , we'd be solving it .
Today , we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 , though it may be even more obvious now - because John McCain , a man who has earned our respect on many levels , is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush - Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them , the same policies all over again ?
Hey , I believe in recycling , but that 's ridiculous .
Transcripts below the fold
One of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course .
It 's not a guarantee - it 's only an opportunity .
The question facing us is , simply put , will we seize this opportunity for change ?
That 's why I came here tonight : to tell you why I feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect Barack Obama President of the United States .

Hey , I believe in recycling , but that 's ridiculous .
With John McCain 's support , President Bush and Vice President Cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact ; their readiness to sacrifice the long - term to the short - term , subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few , and short - circuit the rule of law .
If you like the Bush / Cheney approach , John McCain 's your man .
If you want change , then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
Barack Obama is telling us exactly what he will do : launch a bold new economic plan to restore America 's greatness .
Fight for smarter government that trusts the market , but protects us against its excesses .
Enact policies that are pro-choice , pro-education , and pro-family .
Establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong .
Provide health care for all and solutions for the climate crisis .
So why is this election so close ?
Well , I know something about close elections , so let me offer you my opinion .
I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents .
There is no better example than the climate crisis .
As I have said for many years throughout this land , we 're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization .
Every bit of that has to change .
Oil company profits have soared to record levels , gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels .
Many scientists predict that the entire North Polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months in the first term of the next President .
Sea levels are rising , fires are raging , storms are stronger .
Military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world , and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions .
We are facing a planetary emergency which , if not solved , would exceed anything we 've ever experienced in the history of humankind .
In spite of John McCain 's past record of open mindedness on the climate crisis , he has apparently now allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution .
And it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation : reviving our economy and strengthening our national security .
The solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon - based fuels .
Instead of letting lobbyists and polluters control our destiny , we need to invest in American innovation .
Almost a hundred years ago , Thomas Edison said , " I 'd put my money on the sun and solar energy .
What a source of power !
I hope we do n't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that . "
We already have everything we need to use the sun , the wind , geothermal power , conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis - everything , that is , except a president who inspires us to believe , " Yes we can . "
So how did this no - brainer become a brain - twister ?
Because the carbon fuels industry - big oil and coal - have a 50 - year lease on the Republican Party and they are drilling it for everything it 's worth .
And this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem when they are in fact making it worse every single day .
This administration and the special interests who control it lock , stock , and barrel after barrel , have performed this same sleight - of - hand on issue after issue .
Some of the best marketers have the worst products ; and this is certainly true of today 's Republican party .
The party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality .
But the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the Republican Party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national well - being are now irreconcilable choices .
So what can we do about it ?
We can carry Barack Obama 's message of hope and change to every family in America .
And pledge that we will be there for Barack Obama - not only in the heat of this election , but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country .
We can tell Republicans and Independents , as well as Democrats , why our nation needs a change from the approach of Bush , Cheney and McCain .
After they wrecked our economy , it is time for a change .
After they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us , it 's time for a change .
After they abandoned the American principle first laid down by General George Washington when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring , in his words , " shame , disgrace and ruin " to our nation , it 's time for a change .
When as many as three Supreme Court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president , and John McCain promises to appoint more Scalias and Thomases and end a woman 's right to choose , it 's time for a change .
Many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such change .
How will we know when it 's beginning to take hold ?
I think we might recognize it as a sign of such change if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process .
This election is actually not close at all among younger voters - you are responding in unprecedented numbers to Barack Obama 's message of change and hope .
You recognize that he represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division .
You understand that the politics of the past are exhausted and you 're tired of appeals based on fear .
You know that America is capable of better than what you have seen in recent years .
You are hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the United States Constitution .
There are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger , shaking off complacency to rise , clear - eyed and alert , to the necessity of embracing change .
A century and a half ago , when America faced our greatest trial , the end of one era gave way to the birth of another .
The candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president .
Before he entered the White House , Abraham Lincoln 's experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in Springfield , Illinois and one term in Congress - during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history .
The experience Lincoln 's supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse .
He was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land .
He insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity .
In 2008 , once again , we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning .
And once again , we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition .
Barack Obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises .
His leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope in the promise of the American dream of a boundless future .
His experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology .
His experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook : that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance .
The extraordinary strength of his personal character - and that of his wonderful wife , Michelle - are grounded in the strengths of the American community .
His vision and his voice represent the best of America .
His life experience embodies the essence of our motto -- e pluribus unum -- out of many , one .
That is the linking identity at the other end of all the hyphens that pervade our modern political culture .
It is that common American identity - which Barack Obama exemplifies , heart and soul -- that enables us as Americans to speak with moral authority to all of the peoples of the world to inspire hope that we as human beings can transcend our limitations to redeem the promise of human freedom .
Late this evening , our convention will end with a benediction .
As we bow in reverence , remember the words of the old proverb : " when you pray , move your feet . "
Then let us leave here tonight and take the message of hope from Denver to every corner of our land and do everything we can to serve our nation , our world -- and most importantly , our children and their future -- by electing Barack Obama President of the United States .
The filter
After buying my DSLR camera I 've developed symptoms of beginning camera - geekiness , and have on and off looked at all kinds of camera - related equipment , without actually buying anything .
I was , however , given a polarization filter as a get well present by colleagues at work , and in return promised to write a blog entry about it .
I actually find this an interesting subject to write about , and as I 've now spent a few months playing with it , here we are .
The filter is basically a piece of glass which you can screw onto the front of the camera lens , filtering the light which goes through the lens to the sensor .
( In the photo the filter is the topmost two rings . )
There are all kinds of filters available , such as UV filters , gray filters , colour tint filters of various kinds , and so on on .
Many of these are of dubious value in a digital world where Photoshop can do many of the same effects without the need to spend lots of time attaching and removing pieces of glass .
A polarization filter , however , can do things that Photoshop cannot , which is why it 's interesting .
The filter acts basically as a pair of sunglasses , blocking some light from entering the camera .
Of course , the whole point of a DSLR camera is to be able to soak up more light , and so this may sound completely backwards .
But not all light is created equal , and this can be exploited to get some interesting effects in photography .
The next section explains the physics behind this .
If you do n't care , skip to the practical part below .
Polarized light
A sine wave
Light is basically a wave , and often visualized as roughly a sine curve .
If you imagine this wave moving through space you 'll see that it 's possible to turn ( rotate ) the wave so that it fluctuates straight up and down , sideways , or anything in between .
Note that I 'm not talking about changing the direction , just turning the wave sideways .
This , the angle at which the light wave fluctuates , is the polarization of the light .
Most light is not polarized , meaning that the light coming from some light source will have different random polarizations .
In polarized light all the waves have the same polarization .
One example of this is IMAX 3D cinemas .
These create a 3D effect by presenting a slightly different image to each of your two eyes , thus mimicking the 3D vision your eyes give you .
Old - fashioned 3D comic books did the same thing , using one image printed in green and and another in red .
Looking at these through spectacles with one green glass and one red glass would let each eye see a different image .
IMAX , however , does this in colour by using polarized light .
The IMAX glasses are polarization filters , only letting through light with a particular polarization .
The two glasses are turned different ways , thus each letting through a separate image and filtering away the other .
If you hold the glasses out in front of you and look at the screen through them you can see the effect directly by turning the glasses 90 degrees , which will show you the two images joining up and separating in the glasses .
Another place you are likely to come across polarization filters is actually in some sunglasses , like mine .
You can check yours by turning them as you look through them ( when outdoors ! ) .
If nothing happens they 're not polarizing .
Getting rid of reflections
Most light is not polarized , but light reflected off the surface of , say , water , metal , or glass does tend to be .
This means that with a polarization filter you can remove the reflection , if you want to .
This is useful in many situations , such as with sun glare from a building or water , taking photos of shiny objects , or through a window .
In bright sunlight the reflections off buildings and plants , etc tend to wash out the colours in these , and here the filter can be used to reduce the glare , thus deepening the colours and giving them more saturation .
For an example , look at the two images below , which are obviously not of enormous artistic merit , but which illustrate what I want to show .
( Both are from the centre of Mysen in Norway . )
Without polarization
With polarization
In the two photos the lower one has removed the glare from the metal surface on the horse 's back and tail .
In addition , the colours in the grass particularly , but also in the brick building and the yellow pavilion are deeper with more saturation .
The sky above the brick building is also made very slightly darker by the filter .
Making the sky blue
Now obviously the sky is blue already , but it quite often happens that the sky behind the object you 're taking a photo of is over - exposed , turning it pale or even blowing it all the way out to white .
With a polarization filter you can often filter out much of the light from the sky , turning the sky a deeper blue .
Once you 've taken a few photos this way ( or worn polarizing sunglasses for a while ) you start seeing this effect in photos in newspapers and commercials .
A side benefit is that this tends to make the clouds look much more vivid and dramatic as well .
This time I 'm using two photos of the Oslo Plaza hotel in Oslo city center to illustrate the point :
Without polarization
With polarization
Here the difference is quite striking , with the second photo being obviously much more dramatic .
The most obvious effect is the darkening of the sky , but there are some other differences as well .
Both photos are actually taken with the filter on , but I turned it 90 degrees after taking the first photo .
The cloud reflection from the front of the building is almost gone in the first photo , showing removal of reflections .
The cloud detail is also much better in the second photo , and the right - hand side of the building is darker in the second photo .
Conclusion
I started out not quite sure how useful this would actually be , but now I find myself reaching for the polarization filter whenever I 'm taking photos in bright sunlight .
Putting it on and taking it off does take some time , but I find that it 's easily worth the effort .
In use , it 's incredibly simple .
Just turn it with your finger while looking through the viewfinder until you get the effect you want .
Sometimes it does n't remove a reflection completely , or affect the sky noticeably , but usually it works just fine .
I have found , though , that using it with my polarizing sunglasses is not an option .
I get weird optical effects at the best of times , and when the polarizations are 90 degrees to each other I see nothing at all , because all light is filtered out .
On the other hand , I find that using the sunglasses ( when not taking photos ) give me a good idea of what the camera is going to see , so there are both good and bad sides to this .
One thing to note if you want to buy yourself a polarization filter : for a DSLR you need a circular one , all the sources I 've read say .
I did n't pick up why , but there you are .
Friday , September 26 : John McCain closed the first presidential debate tonight with yet another reference to his history as a prisoner of war .
It ’s difficult ( and risky ) to criticize him for this .
His ordeal was real , extreme , and agonizingly protracted ; and his survival as a whole person is admirable , as everyone , right , left , center – republican , democrat , independent , has been scrupulously careful to acknowledge and re- re- re-acknowledge .
But while the admiration and respect of other people is entirely appropriate , his own constant political use of his imprisonment – again and again and again – is not .
The difficult truths are , first , that courage and stamina in a soldier are admirable qualities , but they do not by themselves qualify a pilot to be a commander in chief .
An effective top military leader needs a breadth and depth of understanding , a quickness and flexibility of mind , and an ability to place military decisions in the large geopolitical context .
Assessing these traits in the two candidates ( at least as far as we can do so ) a thoughtful analysis must rate Obama as least as high as McCain , if not higher .
The second difficult truth is that the constant repetition of the war prisoner story by McCain and his campaign is obviously , crassly political ; and this is too bad .
By itself , his story commands our sympathy and respect .
( Certainly , we are reminded of it every time we see the man gesture with arms unable to rise to shoulder level because of his ordeal as a prisoner . )
But the cynical use and re-use of this tale for sympathy has two negative effects : it cheapens his appeal to us to elect him president , and , in the end , it dulls our sympathy for him and our appreciation for the most truly outstanding accomplishment of his long life .
So how can those of us who oppose McCain as a candidate deal with the prostitution of his undeniable accomplishment without placing ourselves in the ranks of those who spit on the flag and kick puppies ?
First , let ’s drop the formula , “ Yes , John McCain is a great war hero , but .... ” by now , more than enough homage has been paid to his courage .

Now that Joe Biden is Obama ’s running mate and may soon be the vice president of the United States , he needs to answer a few questions .
In Jason Bermas ’ documentary Fabled Enemies , We Are Change activist Luke Rudkowski confronts Biden on his relationship to ISI director Mahmood Ahmed , who wired $ 100,000 to alleged hijacker Mohamed Atta through MI6 asset Saeed Sheikh .
As 9/11 Truth movement member Jon Gold notes , the following questions were asked by the Family Steering Committee , an independent , nonpartisan group of individuals who lost loved ones on September 11 , 2001 .
Why did Mahmood Ahmed , Director of Pakistan ’s secret service , the ISI , order Saeed Sheikh to wire $ 100,000 to hijacker Mohamed Atta ?
What was Mahmood Ahmed ’s relationship with Al Qaeda ?
Where did the money come from ?
Did officials in Pakistan know in advance about the terrorist attack ?
On September 11th , Mahmood Ahmed had a breakfast meeting in Washington , D.C. , with House and Senate Intelligence Committee chairmen , Rep. Porter Goss and Senator Bob Graham .
What were they discussing ?
The 9/11 Commission also presumably heard about Lt. Gen .
Ahmed from FBI Whistle - blower Sibel Edmonds during her 3 1/2 hours of testimony .
At the insistence of the families .
They may have also heard of Lt. Gen .
Ahmed during a meeting with the Pakistani ISI .
The 9/11 Commission did not answer the families ’ question , and did not mention Lt. General Mahmood Ahmed in their report even though they were mandated to give a “ full and complete accounting ” of the 9/11 attacks .
As the New York Times reported September 13 , 2001 , Joe Biden , as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , met with Mahmood .
Ahmed also met with George Tenet , CIA head , senators Bob Graham and John Kyl , Rep. Porter Goss , Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , and Secretary of State Colin Powell .
It is common knowledge that Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh , going under the name Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad , sent about $ 100,000 from the United Arab Emirates to Mohammed Atta , a fact confirmed by Dennis Lormel , director of FBI ’s financial crimes unit .
Former Pakistani president Purvez Musharraf told the London Times Sheikh was recruited by MI6 , took an active part in demonstrations against the Serbs in relation to their role in Bosnia , was sent Kosovo to join the jihad alongside Harkat ul - Ansar , later Harkat ul - Mujahedeen , and attended ISI training camps .
Muslim convert Aukai Collins , who fought with Islamic Chechen irregulars , claims Harkat ul - Ansar received support from Osama bin Laden , the documented CIA asset .
It is highly unlikely Biden , as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , is ignorant of these facts .
Biden needs to come clean on his meetings with Mahmood Ahmed .
Considering Biden ’s reticence , his harsh words for Pakistan , documented in Jason Bermas ’ Fabled Enemies documentary , certainly ring hollow and his exchange with truth activist Luke Rudkowski on the subject raises more questions than it answers .

More coverage : Recession is official , economists say Arguing that the Securities and Exchange Commission 's emergency restrictions on short - sellers go too far , the nation 's largest hedge fund association plans to press for modifications this week .
The rules imposed last week require institutional investment managers with aggregate accounts valued at $ 100 million or more to give the SEC regular Monday disclosures of their stock - shorting moves for the preceding week .
SEC ANNOUNCEMENT : From the agency 's website OVERSEAS : U.K. bans short - selling of financial shares RULE CHANGE : SEC reins in ' naked ' short selling , will check recent trades
The rules , scheduled to take effect today , require the first reports to be filed Sept. 29 .
They will be made public two weeks after each filing , the SEC announced Sunday .
" By disclosing where we 're investing … you 're in essence taking Colonel Sanders ' fried chicken recipe and giving it to Popeyes , " said Richard Baker , president and CEO of the Managed Funds Association , which represents more than 600 hedge funds and managed future funds .
Such public disclosure could drive some investors away from hedge funds , he said .
Baker , hedge fund executives and other investment managers plan to press the SEC and Congress to ease the disclosure requirement in meetings expected to start Tuesday .
Hedge funds would not object to the emergency rule if the SEC kept the disclosure reports private , he said .
The SEC is evaluating the issue , spokesman John Nester said Sunday .
The objection was among many raised after the SEC late last week enacted broad restrictions on short - sellers , traders who borrow stock and sell it , hoping to profit by replacing that stock with equivalent shares bought in the market at a lower price .
The SEC announced the crackdown after financial companies such as investment bank Morgan Stanley argued that their companies ' stocks had been driven down by short - selling .
Along with the new disclosure reports on shorting strategies , the rules included a two - week ban on short sales of stock in 799 financial firms .
The SEC also announced late Friday that it is subpoenaing records and seeking sworn statements from hedge fund managers , broker - dealers and others with significant recent trading activity in financial companies ' stocks .
John Standerfer , a vice president of S3 Matching Technologies , a Texas firm that provides business intelligence data reports , said an S3 market analysis of Friday 's trading showed 18 % of the stocks in which the SEC banned short sales declined , compared with 19 % of all stocks in the S&P 500 .
" This shows individual stocks can still decline even if they 're on the list , and that the percentage of stocks declining was similar between those on and off the list , " said Standerfer .
" Short - selling is not really the enemy here .
These companies got themselves in big trouble with their actions , " said David Tice , manager of the Prudent Bear fund , a large mutual fund that shorts stocks .
" If anything , the short - sellers were n't loud enough … raising concern . "

Add high energy prices to a sagging economy in an election year and politicians will inevitably come up with bad policies , like converting the corn crop into ethanol or John McCain ’s proposal to suspend the federal gas tax  neither will provide real relief at the pump while both are guaranteed to create other problems .
The good news is that Congress failed last week to cut a deal on two more bad ideas : Republicans ’ misguided push for offshore drilling and Democrats ’ misbegotten plan to curb speculation in oil futures .
Republicans should know that allowing more offshore drilling might marginally trim oil prices  in about a decade  while sacrificing important environmental protections .
Democrats should know that financial speculation is not what ’s driving oil prices , and that curbing futures trading could hamper the ability of companies like airlines and oil refineries to manage their risks by locking in the price of oil .
Putting them together is compounding one bad idea with another .
Of course , there is plenty of evidence that markets can be manipulated by fraudulent speculation  recall the Enron mess .
Yet all evidence suggests that speculation has little to do with the rising price of crude .
From rice to iron , commodity prices are all rising , even without much financial speculation , due to a variety of factors including a weak dollar and growing demand from China and India .
" Chumal ?
You do n't want to go to Chumal . "
My aunt was helping us plan our trip in the relative comfort of our rental beach house in Cancun .
This was before Palenque .
Before the military checkpoint that nearly cost us the trip .
" There 's a sign on the city gate : no photography allowed .
If they catch you , they put you in jail for three days . "
Oh !
How these words would seduce us !
How they weighed down the backs of our minds , following us around the pyramids and down the lonely Mexican highways , nagging us , never letting us forget that the photos we were taking , no matter how intricate or inspired , would never compare to those taken inside the gates of the forbidden city .
" And they 'll take your camera . "
This part , my uncle and I chose to ignore .
Let me pause for a brief confession .
There 's a fair amount of guilt involved in travel photography .
We land in far - off countries and walk around with our $ 5,000 soul - stealing JPEG file creators , profiting from the misfortunes of the misfortunate .
A large print of a fruit market sells for more than all of the fruit contained therein .
A photo of an elderly homeless woman , weathered by age and apathy alike , could be worth a half - year of alms .
My uncle found a way around the guilt years ago .
Now , he mostly photographs colorful ( sellable ) doors and windows , neither of which have souls to steal .
I had no such out .
I flew to Mexico to photograph people , a goal that I would admittedly allow to briefly trump my morals .
This was what I was thinking about as we drove into San Cristobal de las Casas , the town that would be our base camp for the expedition into Chumal .
San Cristobal was interesting enough in its own right .
Back in 1994 , the Zapatista movement organized in San Cristobal and for eleven days waged a very real war against the Mexican government and globalization .
If another Mexican revolution were to begin , we were told its source would be San Cristobal .
The city certainly seemed different .
The higher we climbed in elevation , the closer the people came to resemble their Mayan forbearers .
Girls not old enough to vote nursed children of their own in roadside shacks .
Boys bearing machetes followed their fathers to work , scaling the mountainside in neat rows .
" If you want to understand San Cristobal , you 've got to understand the Flower People and the Wool People . "
This was Scott , an Australian transplant — a big , red , sandy man with a nose that had been mashed purple by too many fights or drinks or both .
When asked why he chose San Cristobal for his home , he replied , " The culture " with a wink that meant , " The women . "
My uncle and I were at Scott 's shop to rent a pair of bright yellow scooters .
Having the kind of mobility and speed you could get from a scooter made definite sense .
Making the two of us more conspicuous did n't , really .
To make matters worse , I had n't ever driven a bike any more motorized than a ten - speed .
I decided to make up for my inexperience by completely lying about it , though I think Scott might have caught on when I crashed into the sidewalk outside of his store a few minutes after he'd handed me the keys .
I was terrified as we cut through traffic on our way out of the city .
But there was one upside to renting the scooters from Scott — while we were filling out paperwork , he told us about the Flower People and the Wool People .
Only four kilometers apart , the twin cities of Zincantan and Chumal produced two completely different cultures .
The Flower People dressed in intricate purple garments and were excessively friendly to outsiders .
Scott claimed that they would surround the scooters , wanting to cook meals for the tourists and talk with them about their travels .
The Wool People were a nasty bunch , historically violent and stoic in demeanor .
They derived their name from the long , black wool skirts worn by the women in both summer and winter .
Take a wild guess which culture came out of Chumal .
After two more minor crashes and a bit of positively treacherous mountain road , I parked and locked my scooter near the town square in Chumal .
The square itself , guarding an ancient Catholic church that was permanently robbed of its priests during a local uprising , looked empty and overcast .
The street vendors looked like they had been turned down so often they no longer had any hope for a sale .
We looked around for any other tourists to see if they were taking photos but , predictably , there were n't any .
We bought our tickets for the main attraction — the ex-Catholic church — and walked inside , our cameras still safely in their bags .
What we saw was agonizing beyond belief :
The church had no pews and dozens of families were lined up , kneeling on the floor in front of rows and rows of candles .
Their faces were lit with an even light and I assumed that they were praying until the candles burned down to a single pool of flame and wax .
The agony , of course , came from not being able to photograph it .
If I had , it would be easier to believe what I saw next — each of the families had a 2 - liter bottle of Coca - Cola .
The father of the family nearest me uncapped his Coke and started pouring it out into identical glass cups for each of the family members .
The family paused their prayer and started to burp .
Scott would tell us later that the burping released evil spirits .
The Coke was used to facilitate the process .
And because there was a Coke bottling plant in the region , we only saw one family drinking Pepsi .
The altar was covered by a haze that looked more like smog than incense .
In the back of the church , light from a window curled the smoke around a wall of statuettes , stacked on top of one another in ornate boxes from the floor to the ceiling .
Looking closer , the statuettes were all of traditional Catholic saints , but they were all wearing necklaces holding several tiny mirrors .
We learned later that these mirrors were to ward off the evil spirits .
The altar itself was quiet , the Wool People inside the church quiet , though perhaps a bit annoyed at the touristas .
Scott told us a story of a wedding he attended inside the church that culminated in the sacrifice of a chicken , the bird 's blood sprayed over the processional .
But that day , it was just the two of us , freezing in the snow next to a pile of tinder , our unopened bags filled with matches .
We got brave after stepping out of the church .
Young kids selling woven belts and colorful pencils surrounded us once again , even though I had n't bought anything the entire trip .
But this time I had something different in mind .
I had been talking in broken Spanish with one of kids before I went inside the church — a young girl named Rosa .
Rosa talked to me about being 13 in Chumal , about selling woven cinturons and about photography .
We negotiated for a bit and then I dug all of the pesos out of my pocket and handed them over .
I had always read about travel photographers buying poses from the locals .
From the comfort of my high horse , I thought it was a bit repulsive — an affront to the skill and patience and luck necessary to take an honest , journalistic photo .
But something changed in my mind during the long car ride .
Morally , it was far worse to just take the photo covertly , to slip back to the States unnoticed with a full Compact Flash card and a heavy conscience .
But paying for a photo was a simple exchange of goods .
And it would n't interfere with my goal .
The price of Rosa 's photo added up to be about two US dollars , the sum total of change in my pocket .
I dug my camera out of my bag and snapped two quick frames of her in front of the cathedral .
The photos themselves are not remarkable .
Rosa looks far older than her thirteen years would suggest , but her eyes show a generous bemusement .
My composition was as much created by nervousness as it was anything else .
But I will always look upon them as a turning point ; photos taken inside a forbidden city by a young man just getting over a bad case of traveler 's guilt .
The fake priest was " caught by surprise in the basilica "
A man posing as a priest has been caught trying to hear confessions in St Peter 's Basilica in the Vatican , a judge in the city - state has said .
Judge Gianluigi Marrone said in an interview with the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano the man had clerical robes and documents .
Judge Marrone did not say when the incident took place .
He said the man was tried by a Vatican tribunal but would not reveal the verdict or any punishment .
' Unmasked '
Judge Marrone said the man claimed he was a priest .
" He was caught by surprise in the basilica while he was trying to take his place in a confessional .
" He was wearing clerical garb , but the expert eye of our personnel did n't need much to sense something strange in his behaviour . "
The documents and Vatican pass appeared legitimate but checks with Italian authorities " unmasked him " , Judge Marrone said , as having posed as a priest before in Italy .
" It was a case of usurping an ecclesiastical title , and thus he was tried by our tribunal . "
The judge said much of the work of the tribunal involved petty thefts of Vatican visitors ' wallets .
The New York Times and Washington ’s new prison in Afghanistan
By Alex Lantier
20 May 2008
On May 17 the New York Times reported on plans for a new , US - run prison complex at Bagram air base north of the Afghan capital , Kabul .
The prison complex would occupy 40 acres on the base , house up to 1,100 prisoners , and cost more than $ 60 million to build .
The complex will replace an existing prison , the Bagram Theater Internment Facility .
Military officials told the press they were concerned about the health effects on US troops stationed at the current Bagram facility , which is heavily contaminated with toxic heavy metals .
They are unwilling to turn “ dangerous ” detainees over to the Afghan puppet government , however , and are planning on building a new prison , under direct US control .
The Times described the existing Bagram prison as overcrowded , with inadequate restroom and exercise facilities , and acknowledged that American guards had beaten several detainees to death there .
Comparing conditions there to those at Guantánamo Bay , the US - run concentration camp in Cuba which has become notorious for its torture and arbitrary punishment of detainees , it reported : “ Military personnel who know both Bagram and Guantánamo describe the Afghan site [...] as far more Spartan .
Bagram prisoners have fewer privileges , less ability to contest their detention and no access to lawyers . ”
Starting with these horrible facts , the Times then took on a grotesquely Orwellian task : presenting the construction of the new prison as an exercise in humanitarianism .
Citing US military officials who told the Times the new prison would be would be “ more modern and humane , ” it continued : “ Classrooms will be built for vocational training and religious discussion , and there will be more space for recreation and family visits , officials said . [...]
The structures will have more natural light , and each will have its own recreation area . ”
It quoted a senior Pentagon official for detention policy , Sandra L. Hodgkinson :
“ The driving factor behind this is to ensure that in all instances we are giving the highest standards of treatment and care . ”
One rubs one ’s eyes in disbelief .
US treatment of prisoners in Afghanistan has been distinguished , in fact , by its murderous brutality , from the very beginning of the US - led occupation .
According to evidence presented by Irish filmmaker Jamie Doran and the German TV program Panorama , thousands of Taliban troops who had surrendered to US - backed warlord Abdurrashid Dostum in November 2001 were transported in suffocating containers , then shot and buried in mass graves in northern Afghanistan , under the supervision of US Special Forces .
US airpower bombed Taliban prisoners - of - war who had revolted against the terms of their CIA interrogation at the Qala - i - Janghi fortress .
Upon finding American John Walker Lindh wounded but alive in the ruins of the fortress , US forces left his wounds untreated in an effort to extract confessions from him .
In breach of the Geneva Conventions , the US government admits to holding 10 children prisoner at Bagram air base .
Bagram is notorious as a destination for CIA - run flights carrying prisoners to Afghanistan to be tortured .
In 2003 , US military officials at Bagram air base told the human rights group Amnesty International they used forced standing and sleep deprivation as interrogation techniques , and a 2005 internal US Army report found that prisoners were shackled to doors and ceilings for long periods of time , a procedure the Army classified as criminal assault .
Why does the New York Times , the authoritative voice of what passes for American liberalism , present the opening of a prison in such an environment as a triumph of humanitarianism ?
The nauseating superposition of humanitarian language over the machinery of torture and repression reflects an ultimately irresolvable contradiction of liberalism : its striving to reconcile the masses ’ democratic instincts with the strategic interests of the ruling class .
This contradiction has become particularly acute as the crisis of the Washington ’s war policy in the Middle East intensifies , especially in the run-up to the US presidential elections this November .
For the US bourgeoisie , a particularly pressing electoral task is presenting the liberal Democratic Party — altogether falsely — as a viable alternative to the Bush administration .
The contradiction between this task and the defense of the US bourgeoisie ’s dominant world position is , however , increasingly difficult to hide .
The US ruling elite has essential strategic interests in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan and neighboring regions are a potential nexus of oil pipelines and trade routes connecting Iran and the broader Middle East to Central Asia , Russia , China , and the Indian subcontinent .
For US capitalism , crucial questions of influence over commercial and geopolitical rivals are to be decided by maintaining a firm grip over the region — or , at least , by preventing any competitor from doing so .
This glowing account of a new US prison emerges amid definite signs of plans to shift US strategy , towards growing emphasis on the war in Afghanistan .
The Times itself noted that US officials were foreseeing “ waves of new prisoners from the escalating fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban . ”
This comes on the heels of the May 3 announcement of the deployment of at least 7,000 more US troops to Afghanistan , bringing US troop strength there over 40,000 .
A UN report released last week also revealed that CIA death squads are now active in Afghanistan .
The Bush administration ’s strategy of focusing on Iraq and leaving Afghanistan to smaller US detachments augmented by forces provided by NATO allies has repeatedly been put in question .
One of the more prominent voices to do so was the New York Times , which in August of 2007 wrote an editorial titled “ The Good War , Still to be Won , ” arguing for an escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
NATO officials are particularly concerned that the new Pakistani government , hesitant to risk an all - out confrontation with pro-Taliban militants in its fractious border areas with Afghanistan , is not taking on anti-US fighters who attack NATO forces and then find refuge in Pakistan .
For instance , on May 15 NATO spokesman James Appathurai told reporters in Brussels that “ deals being struck between the Pakistani government and extremist groups in the tribal areas may be allowing them , the extremists , to have safe havens , rest , reconstitute and then move across the border . ”
It is significant that these reports are emerging as it seems increasingly likely the Democratic Party will nominate as its 2008 presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama , who has been a long - time and vocal advocate of a harder line on Pakistan and Afghanistan .
During his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Presidential Convention , Obama floated the idea of missile strikes against Pakistan .
In January 2007 , Obama proposed the Iraq War De-Escalation
Act of 2007 in Congress , a bill which would have reversed the Iraq troop surge and redeployed US troops to Afghanistan and other locations .
In his August 1 , 2007 foreign policy speech , Obama proposed “ getting out of Iraq and on to the right battlefield in Afghanistan and Pakistan . ”
More recently , at a May 11 campaign meeting in Cape Girardeau , Missouri , Obama complained that “ We do n’t have enough capacity right now to deal with ” the war in Afghanistan .
THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( CNN ) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic says he made a deal with the United States to disappear from public life -- in exchange for immunity from the war crimes tribunal he 's currently facing .
Radovan Karadzic makes an initial appearance at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .
In a letter , submitted to the court Thursday and released to the public Friday , Karadzic further explains the accusations he made Thursday in his first appearance before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) .
An ICTY spokeswoman said she could not comment on the letter because it is part of a case in progress .
Karadzic is charged with 11 counts including genocide , crimes against humanity , and war crimes stemming from the 1992 - 95 war in Bosnia - Herzegovina , when he was president of a breakaway Serb republic .
Karadzic , 63 , says he made a deal in 1996 with U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke that involved his complete withdrawal from public life .
The " offer , " Karadzic says , required him to " become invisible long enough for the Dayton agreement to be implemented in full . "
Watch Karadzic 's first court appearance »
In exchange , Karadzic writes in the letter , Holbrooke agreed that the former leader would not be tried before the tribunal .
The U.S. - sponsored Dayton peace accord , signed in 1995 , ended the three - year war and divided the country into Serb Republic and a Bosnia - Croat Federation .
It also established a NATO - led peacekeeping force to maintain peace among the Serb , Muslim and Croat populations .
Holbrooke was the architect of the Dayton agreement .
" There is no doubt that this offer was made in the name of the USA , " Karadzic writes .
Responding to Karadzic 's accusation Thursday , Holbrooke told CNN it is a " flat - out lie . "
" He 's been spreading it for 12 years through his friends , now he 's making it personally .
It would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing .
... We made no deal with Radovan Karadzic . "
He added , " Why would anyone believe one of the most dangerous and awful mass murderers in modern history ? "
Before Serbian authorities announced his arrest July 21 , Karadzic had been missing for more than a decade .
Afterward it emerged that he had worked at a clinic in Belgrade as an alternative medicine therapist , using an elaborate disguise of a long white beard , white mustache , and long white hair .
Karadzic says the idea for at least part of his ruse came from former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who suggested to the former Serbian president " that I get out of the way and go to Russia , Greece or Serbia and open a private clinic . "
Karadzic says he held up his part of the bargain until it became clear that Holbrooke did not want to hold up his end and instead wanted to see him dead .
" Unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the USA , he switched to Plan B -- the liquidation of Radovan Karadzic , " he writes .
That led Karadzic to want to turn himself in to the tribunal at the Hague , where he knew he would at least be safe from the threat of death , Karadzic says .
The tribunal does not impose the death penalty , and should he be convicted , Karadzic may face a sentence of life imprisonment .
But Karadzic says he changed his mind when investigators arrived in Pale , Bosnia -- his headquarters during the war -- and started looking through the archives .
The investigators first identified themselves as being from the tribunal , indicating they were unbiased , Karadzic said .
" When it was noticed that they were acting selectively and were reluctant to take exculpatory documents , " Karadzic writes , " we realized that we had been tricked and that they were not investigators from the tribunal but investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor who had fooled us and rummaged through our archives without legal permission . "
Karadzic 's letter also details his arrest in Belgrade , building on hints from his Belgrade lawyer that he was not arrested when Serbian authorities said he was .
" Unknown civilians showed me a badge so quickly that I could not identify it , took me out of a public transport vehicle and held me in an unknown place for 74 hours , " he writes .
Karadzic says his captors never told him who they were , what his rights were , or allow him to call or text his friends .
" For these 74 hours I did not exist , " he writes .
Karadzic had insisted on expressing his version of the alleged deal with Holbrooke and the " irregularity " of his arrest during Thursday 's proceedings , despite the protests of Judge Alphons Orie , who urged him to submit the matter in writing .
The resulting letter also expresses Karadzic 's concerns about the chief prosecutor 's promise to bring his case " in the most efficient manner . "
Quoting a Serbian proverb which says , " Justice is slow but sure , " Karadzic writes , " Speed is essential to the calculations of a gunslinger , but not at all in matters of law and justice . "
He also asks how he can have a fair trial when " no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal . "
The tribunal accuses Karadzic of leading a campaign that killed thousands of men , women and children -- mainly Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats who were killed by Serbs as part of a violent effort to rid the region of non-Serbs .
Forces under Karadzic 's command rounded up tens of thousands of non-Serbs and held them in camps where , an indictment says , the Serbian forces , " tortured , mistreated , sexually assaulted and killed non-Serbs , " the tribunal said Wednesday .
" The indictment also charges Karadzic with responsibility for a protracted campaign of shelling and sniping of civilian areas of Sarajevo , killing and wounding thousands of civilians , including children and the elderly , " a tribunal statement said .
The Bosnian war was Europe 's bloodiest conflict since World War II and the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s .
Backed by the government of then - Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations that introduced the term " ethnic cleansing " to the world .

We 've been using long Expires and Cache - Control : max - age headers to mark our javascripts and css as browser - cacheable for quite some time .
This way the browser only does full GETs on these once , and avoids conditional GETs except on page refresh .
This only requires a few lines of configuration in Rails ( asset timestamps and asset packaging ) and nginx and generally works well .
Except when it does not .
We 've had some bug reports that in some cases under SSL these files were not cached at all .
Meaning , just going to a different page in our application would make browser do an unconditional GET to refetch css and javascript .
Naturally , this would hurt the performance .
Now , SSL in itself makes things worse .
Firefox only caches SSL content in memory not on disk , meaning if the user closes the browser the cache goes away .
But the reported behavior was worse than that -- no caching at all .
It took us a while , but we did manage to chase it down .
It seems that Firefox divides SSL content into page marked with Cache - Control : public , which have priority for caching , and the rest .
When you open enough tabs , say 50 + , with enough rich pages in Firefox , its in - memory cache fills up and refuses to cache non-public SSL content .
We have n't had time to fully chase it down in the FF codebase , but what 's likely to happen is that FF actually does put in into cache , then realizes that cache is full , looks for pages to evict , and right away evicts the newly added content .
Since SSL content is not cached on hard disk , once the memory cache is full , the non-pubic SSL files are not cached at all .
( Note that 's just a hypothesis , we'd be most curious to know what actually happens and why . )
The server - side workaround is to add Cache - Control : public to all your SSL content you want cached .
We do :
# nginx configuration for static content
location / static { expires 1y ; add_header Cache - Control public ; }
This bug is present in Firefox 2 and 3 , but as a user you can configure them to work around the problem by setting browser.cache.memory.capacity to increase the size of memory cache or using browser.cache.disk_cache_ ssl to enable disk cache for SSL pages .
The default 24 M memory cache size for systems with 2G of RAM is really small , especially with FF3 being able to handle hundreds of tabs well .
Note that the disk_cache option works only on Firefox 3 because of some bugs in earlier browser versions .
Small remark for Acunote users - you do n't have to do anything about this .
We enabled Cache - Control : public and your Firefox will cache javascript and css files no matter how many tabs you have .
All good Catholics are well aware that the Pope walks this sinful Earth safe in the knowledge that he has robust heavenly backup .
More literal - minded believers might contend that such support , in the event of any worldly dispute turning ugly , could easily include unsleeping winged guardians that do not age or die as mortals do .
This has now been confirmed to be absolutely true on occasion , with the news that the Holy Father was watched over by an unmanned air vehicle ( UAV ) - a winged flying robot - during a recent visit to Lourdes .
Proverbs 23:5 * in action .

Pope Benedict XVI reportedly told the assembled faithful at the shrine that people must accept death " at the hour chosen by God " .
It was clear , however , that the temporal overlords of France would not be above jogging
His elbow a little in the event of any disrespect being offered to Christ 's Earthly vicar on their watch .
Aviation
Week reports that Eagle - 1 SIDM autonomous surveillance platforms orbited on high above Lourdes , providing what is often profanely referred to in military circles as the " god 's eye view " of the surrounding terrain - and the ability to call down terrifying hammerblows of destruction from the skies using laser target - designation systems .
Batteries of Crotale air - defence missiles were also on standby in the event of any impious intrusion being mounted into the Supreme Pontiff 's heavenly exclusion zone .
Military theology buffs no doubt found material for knotty debate in the fact that the Eagle - 1 genuinely comes from the Holy Land , being manufactured by Israel Aircraft Industries .
However , the modern French military is avowedly secular rather than seeing itself - as its more prominent members have in the past - as the literal Sword of God .
In the event the papal visit passed off without incident , and the temporal angels of death were n't called upon to do more than watch . ®

Anyone who wants to expand their business in this day and age has to explore the options available online .
Content marketing is essential for promoting your product or service , and there are a number of ways that you can go about setting up your campaign .
We ’re going to explore some of the primary methods of content marketing that you should use when you ’re getting started .
Hopefully , you ’ll be able to construct an effective content marketing plan after reading the article .
Let ’s get started :
4 Fundamentals of a Content Marketing Plan
Your content might be your product , or it might be used to direct users back to your online store .
In any case , there is something of a formula to content marketing and you can find significant results if you can work through a few key steps effectively .
1. Reactive Content
It might seem as if you should just create content that comes to mind .
Maybe you have a thought or a vision for a series of posts , and you create it and simply post it .
The reality is that your content will be more easily found if you create it in response to keyword trends .
Keyword trends give insight into what your audience is looking for online , and optimizing for specific keywords can give you exposure when users search for those terms .
So , while you should create content that expresses something about yourself and your brand , your bread and butter should be keyword - optimized posts that have been well - researched .
2. PPC Ads
“ PPC , ” or pay - per - click ads are one of the most effective ways to reach a broader audience online .
These ads are the sponsored posts and ads you see floating around in your social media feed .
You might have noticed that these ads are harder to spot now , and tend to be more relevant to your life and interests than before .
This is because social media platforms have sophisticated insights into what particular users are interested in .
When you create your ad , you ’ll have the option to place it in front of a very specific audience who has an interest in your product .
3. Generate Social Media Followings
The best way to get more impact out of your content is to have a dedicated following that sees everything you post .
Of course , it ’s kind of difficult to generate social media followings , but it ’s certainly possible .
If you can get individuals to follow and engage with your content , you ’ll be setting yourself up for more likes , shares , comments , and purchases .
Additionally , everyone who follows you will see exactly what you ’rNeede up to in real - time .
4. Work With Influencers
Influencers are people who have large followings online .
They ’re people that users listen to and respect .
The nice thing is , they need to get paid , too .
Paying an influencer for some ad space on their platform or program can be really effective to boost your following .
When an influencer recommends your business , their following will take note eventually and you ’ll see a big uptick in content success .

If you do n't already , you really should eat toothpaste for dinner everyday .
Virginia - based author Joe Bageant claimed Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin as a fellow " redneck " , in a recent essay for BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
He meant it as a compliment .
Here Jamie Stiehm , a city - dwelling political commentator , asks whether small - town values are all they are cracked up to be .
When an American refers to someone as " small - town " , it 's seldom clear whether it 's meant as praise or scorn .
Sarah Palin declared psychological war on Barack Obama by setting up a ' small - town girl v big - city boy ' dichotomy
It all depends on the speaker , subject , listener and ZIP code where the conversation is taking place .
For some , small towns are where virtues live : near the diner , yarn shop and swimming hole .
For others , " small - town " is a synonym for smug narrow - mindedness .
Governor Sarah Palin , the political hurricane that made landfall in early September as the surprise Republican vice - presidential nominee , hit upon the deepest contradiction in the American character .
It 's as old as the fierce fight between two founding fathers - urbane Alexander Hamilton of New York and Thomas Jefferson , a Virginia slave - owning gentleman of the land .
We Americans still have a romantic notion about the simple small town , which goes hand in hand with Jefferson 's idealised " yeoman farmer " .
But in real life , most of us live in the busy , peopled world Hamilton envisaged .
Ms Palin declared psychological war on Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , right away by setting up a " small - town girl versus big - city boy " dichotomy .
In her hello - to - the - country speech , Palin zeroed in on Obama 's work as a community organiser in Chicago before he went to Harvard Law School .
That was in another metropolis known as Cambridge , a lively academic grove in Boston .
In a rare move for a political unknown , Palin made it personal between the man running for president , Obama , and herself .
They are of the same generation : she is 44 to his 47 , and represent bipolar extremes .
VIEWPOINTS Jamie Stiehm is a political journalist based in Washington DC , whose essays on the 2008 presidential campaign have appeared in the liberal , pro-Obama Huffington Post .
This is one of a series of comment and opinion pieces that the BBC website will publish before the election .
" I have the privilege of living most of my life in a small town , " Palin told roaring Republicans at their convention .
" I was mayor of my hometown .
And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience , let me explain ...
I guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a community organiser , except you have actual responsibilities . "
Gopher Prairie But , just a moment , what 's so great about being mayor of tiny Wasilla , Alaska ?
Whether Ms Palin ever made time to see the skylines and neighbourhoods of Philadelphia , Boston or Baltimore is arguably more to the purpose of governing the United States .
For like it or not , we are a nation composed of mostly city dwellers .
We grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity
Sarah Palin quotes the late Hearst journalist , Westbrook Pegler
Palin 's convention speech
The 1920 census was the point in our social history when the population changed from living in rural and small communities to living in cities .
That shift is mirrored beautifully in the literature of the period , known as " The Revolt from the Village , " as critic Carl van Doren put it in The Nation in 1921 .
This revolt was accompanied by a rush to breathe in the exhilarating big city by young men and women , as told in the autobiographical novel , You Ca n't Go Home Again , by Thomas Wolfe .
The most famous work in the anti-small town movement was the 1920 novel Main Street , by Sinclair Lewis , who based fictional Gopher Prairie on his own Minnesota hometown .
The Nobel laureate author opened with a world - weary , ironical note : " This story would be the same in Ohio or Montana , in Kansas or Kentucky Main Street is the climax of civilisation . "
Biographer Richard Lingeman , also the author of Small Town America , said Lewis ' masterpiece launched " a conscious , definitive attack on the stuffiness , provincialism , smugness , conformity and cruel gossip of small town life , intended to puncture the myth once and for all . "
World citizen
Yet here the heartland myth persists , in popular culture as well as partisan politics .
Rock singer John Mellencamp 's song , Small Town , tells the other side of the story told by Lewis : " No , I can not forget where it is that I come from / I cannot forget the people who love me / Yeah , I can be myself here in this small town / And people let me be just what I want to be . "
The lyrics are in an ode to his Indiana hometown .
Barack Obama would have a hard time laying claim to small - town credentials Mellencamp is a big Obama supporter , as it happens .
Maybe the Democratic nominee would be well advised to take the singer on the road to help shore up his support in small towns in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania ?
One of the strengths of Obama 's curriculum vitae , for some of his supporters , is its variety .
Growing up , he lived in Hawaii and Indonesia .
He studied in LA , New York and Boston and knows his way around Washington .
He 's a world citizen .
He 'd have a hard time claiming small - town status , though Springfield , Illinois , where he served as a state legislator , is a fairly small town where another lanky lawyer who ran for President once lived .
( That would be , of course , Abraham Lincoln . )
No doubt certain strengths come from living in a small town , especially for politicians .
Bill Clinton , who hails from Hope , Arkansas , embodies the easy social connectedness which a small town upbringing can produce .
Everyone tends to relate to everyone else , up and down the social scale .
People know the person you were in high school .
You might even be married to someone you knew in high school , as Palin told the world she was .
" My guy , " was how she introduced her husband , Todd Palin , to the cheering crowd that night .
You might even be pregnant in high school , as her daughter Bristol is - but somehow the redoubtable Palin has turned that into a small - town virtue , too .
Urban sophisticates
In her convention speech , she quoted anonymously Westbrook Pegler , the long - gone Hearst newspaper columnist and scourge of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt : " We grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity . "
Was the subtext that urban sophisticates like Obama are somehow suspect ?
Just what we need , a new culture war at home .
As if we Americans were n't demoralised enough already by the economy and the war in Iraq .
But there is no obvious reason why the big city guy has to lose this ideological battle .
Maybe he should engage and ask Americans : hey , whose world would you rather live in ?
Jefferson 's or Hamilton's ?
Mine or Palin's ?
Wasilla or Chicago ?
He 'll have to watch out though , or the small - town girl will have him for lunch at the diner .

The electric solar wind sail developed at the Finnish Meteorological Institute has moved rapidly from invention towards implementation .
Electric sail propulsion might have a large impact on space research and moving in space in general .
The electric solar wind sail developed by Dr. Pekka Janhunen at the Finnish Meteorological Institute might revolutionise travelling in deep space .
The electric sail is a Finnish invention which uses the solar wind as its thrust source and therefore needs no fuel or propellant .
The solar wind is a continuous plasma stream emanating from the Sun .
Changes in the properties of the solar wind cause auroral brightening and magnetic storms , among other things .

Over its two - year history , the electric sail has developed rapidly from invention towards implementation and has aroused much international interest .
The main parts of the device are long metallic tethers and a solar - powered electron gun which keeps the tethers positively charged .
The solar wind exerts a small but continuous thrust on the tethers and the spacecraft .
The electric sail and its applications have been developed mainly at the Finnish Meteorological Institute , but component work is carried out at the University of Helsinki and in Germany , Sweden , Russia and Italy .
“ We have n't encountered major problems in any of the technical fields thus far .
This has already enabled us to start planning the first test mission , ” says Dr. Pekka Janhunen .
An important subgoal was reached when the Electronics Research Laboratory of the University of Helsinki managed to develop a method for constructing a multiline micrometeoroid - resistant tether out of very thin metal wires using ultrasonic welding .
The newly developed technique allows the bonding together of thin metal wires in any geometry ; thus , the method might also have spinoff applications outside the electric sail .
If and when realised , the electric sail could enable faster and cheaper Solar System science and exploration .
It might also enable economic utilisation of asteroid resources for , e.g. producing rocket fuel in orbit .
“ The electric sail might lower the cost of all space activities and thereby , for example , help making large solar power satellites a viable option for clean electricity production .
Solar power satellites orbiting in the permanent sunshine of space could transmit electric power to Earth by microwaves without interruptions .
Continuous power would be a major benefit compared to , e.g. ground - based solar power where storing the energy over night , cloudy weather and winter are tricky issues , especially here in the far North , ” says Dr. Pekka Janhunen .
The electric sail was invented as a by - product of basic research done at the Finnish Meteorological Institute on the interaction of the solar wind with planets and their atmospheres .
Work on the electric sail in Finland is currently funded by the Academy of Finland and private foundations .
The first international electric sail meeting will be arranged at ESA ESTEC in Noordwijk , The Netherlands on May 19 , 2008 .
Alicia Keys ' We Are Together ' Movie Premiere ( Photos )
, 28 , attended the special screen premiere of We Are Together in New York City Thursday evening , June 12th .
The documentary was three years in the making .
Written and directed by Paul Taylor , the story line deals with 25 orphans from KwaZulu Natal who have lost their parents to the AIDS epidemic .
The film 's strongest element is the music they create , from casual songs in the yard to lively recording sessions and the soaring concert performance alongside Paul Simon and Alicia Keys .
Their energetic skill as vocalists is thrilling and extremely moving .
The talented musician , a popular R&B and soul singer , has sold over 25 million albums through 2007 .
She is known to be a very private person and is rumored to be dating her song writer and record producer Kerry ' Krucial ' Brothers .
He has collaborated with her on all three of her albums and is photographed at her side frequently .
Keys would love to adopt a house full of multi-racial kids , following in the footsteps of actress Angelina Jolie .
She admits that those plans will have to stay on the back burner while she concentrates on her musical career .
Check out more photos of Keys below .
In several photos it looks like her dress is slipping dangerously , nearly exposing more than the lovely singer intended .

Experts say there is no magic to exercise :
You get out of it what you put in .
That does n't mean you have to work out for hours each day .
It just means you need to work smart .
That said , experts agree that not all exercises are created equal .
Some are simply more efficient than others , whether they target multiple muscle groups , are suitable for a wide variety of fitness levels , or help you burn calories more effectively .
So what are the best exercises ?
We posed this question to four fitness experts and compiled a list of their favorites .
1. Walking
Any exercise program should include cardiovascular exercise , which strengthens the heart and burns calories .
And walking is something you can do anywhere , anytime , with no equipment other than a good pair of shoes .
It 's not just for beginners , either :
Even the very fit can get a good workout from walking .
" Doing a brisk walk can burn up to 500 calories per hour , " says Robert Gotlin , DO , director of orthopaedic and sports rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York .
Since it takes 3,500 calories to lose a pound , you could expect to lose a pound for every seven hours you walk , if you did nothing else .
Do n't go from the sofa to walking an hour day , though .
Richard Cotton , a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise , says beginners should start by walking five to - 10 minutes at a time , gradually moving up to at least 30 minutes per session .
" Do n't add more than five minutes at a time , " he says .
Another tip :
It 's better to lengthen your walks before boosting your speed or incline .
BETTER TO REMAIN SILENT AND BE THOUGHT A FOOL ….
Amanda catches this interesting tidbit from a Washington Post report on Thursday ’s meeting at the White House between the president and top members of Congress .
We talked yesterday about John McCain ’s reluctance to step up and take the lead at the meeting — indeed , he was reportedly reluctant to contribute anything of substance at all — but this piece adds some remarkable details .
Bush turned to McCain , who joked , “ The longer I am around here , the more I respect seniority . ”
McCain then turned to Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) to speak first .
Boehner was blunt .
The plan Paulson laid out would not win the support of the vast majority of House Republicans .
It had been improved on the edges , with an oversight board and caps on the compensation of participating executives .
But it had to be changed at the core .
He did not mention the insurance alternative , but Democrats did .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , pressed Boehner hard , asking him if he really intended to scrap the deal and start again .
No , Boehner replied , he just wanted his members to have a voice .
Obama then jumped in to turn the question on his rival : “ What do you think of the [ insurance ] plan , John ? ” he asked repeatedly .
McCain did not answer .
It seems to me there are two possible explanations for McCain ’s silence .
One possibility is that this was an extension of what we saw last night — he believes his rivals are beneath him , and he has nothing but contempt for those who question him , so he refused to engage in a policy discussion .
The other is that McCain had no idea what the grown - ups were talking about , did n’t understand what the insurance alternative was , and knew he ’d humiliate himself he tried to engage in a substantive dialog with a room full of people who knew vastly more than he did .
As recently as Tuesday , he had n’t even read Paulson ’s three - page proposal , and within hours of the White House meeting , McCain was in Boehner ’s office , unfamiliar with the details of the House Republican proposal , so this could be part of a pattern .
So , McCain refused to talk at the White House meeting because he has contempt for his colleagues or because he ’s spectacularly ignorant .
I suppose it could be both .

The Senate fixture from Delaware , Joe Biden , has promised to give your money to the tin horn dictator Saakashvili and Georgia .
“ The United States will consider providing $ 1 billion in emergency aid to Georgia , a top U.S. lawmaker said Monday on his return from a visit to the conflict - torn nation , ” reports Dow Jones Newswires .
“ When Congress reconvenes , I intend to work with the administration to seek Congressional approval for $ 1 billion in emergency assistance for Georgia , ” said Biden .
“ This money will help the people of Georgia recover from the damage that has been inflicted on their economy and send a clear message that the United States will not abandon this young democracy . ”
Actually , Biden has promised to jack the debt up another billion or so .
The U.S. debt is well over a $ 100 trillion , so what ’s a mere billion ?
The government says the debt is only $ 10 trillion , but the Federal Reserve , as in Federal Express , says it ’s closer to $ 100 trillion , which means it is over that amount .
At any rate , Biden is simply taking orders from the globalists .
Biden is head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
It might as well be called the Council on Foreign Relations Committee because that ’s where the marching orders come from .
Russia punched some pretty big holes in the globalist plan for little Georgia , the NED - CIA created client state , so the American people have to ante up .
Next up , Poland .
After Russia takes out Bush ’s “ missile defense system , ” we ’ll be called upon to make up the difference .

I want to thank the the people from Progressive Accountability who have produced the new movie , " Third - Term , " which revisits John McCain 's role in the Keating 5 scandal of the ' 80s and see a direct connection to his approach and the people that surround him in today 's economy as he runs for President .
Download Download
NARRATION : It 's the same thing that 's happening now , as banks fail , and as our housing market collapses .
And the people responsible for this new crisis are the ones McCain has surrounded himself with , men like Phil Gramm and his banking lobbyists .
He will offer the same kind of deregulatory policies that led to the banking collapse of the early ‘ 90s .
It will be available on Sept. 25th to the public .
NARRATION : All of this corporate influence should remind you a bit of a previous tale in the McCain saga , his involvement with the Keating 5 .
Charles Keating was a sort of mentor of John McCain , donating vast sums of money to his senate campaigns .
DAVID DONNELLY : Charles Keating helped out Senator McCain a lot in the early part of his career .
... Senator McCain was the closest of any of the Keating Five to Charles Keating .
NARRATION : But Keating was in trouble .
His company , Lincoln Savings and Loan , was making a lot of risky investments , and the government was investigating .
ANDREA MITCHELL : Keating raised $ 1.3 million for them .
They challenged regulators who were investigating his operations .
NARRATION : So Keating called some of his old pals in the Senate to put a little pressure on the government regulator and get them off his back .
McCain accepted .
NARRATION : Lincoln collapsed , leading to a bailout of $ 2.8 billion in taxpayer money .
Keating went to prison for four years .
McCain was only chastised on the Senate floor .
The recent meltdown in the financial markets has rocked the country and as usual , required our government to pony up billions of tax payer dollars to try and rescue the corporate fat cats in Wall Street in the financial sector .
It was also the reaction to the credit markets that caused the bailout of AIG to occur as swiftly as it did .
So John McCain was implicated in the biggest S&L scandal of its time back in ' 80 s -- The Keating 5 -- and yet HE accuses Barack Obama of not doing enough in today 's nightmare .
He had the nerve to say this :
JOHN MCCAIN : Senator Obama talks a tough game on the financial markets but the facts tell a very different story .
He took more money from Fannie and Freddie than any Senator but the Democratic chairman of the committee that regulates them .
He put the Chief Executive Officer of Fannie Mae -- um , excuse me , of , yes , of Fannie Mae -- who helped create this disaster , he put that Democratic chair -- of the -- in charge of the selection process for who he was going to select for Vice President of the United States [ crowd boos ] .
You know what ?
Fannie 's former General Counsel is a senior advisor to his campaign .
Whose side do you think he 's on ?
And this :
JOHN MCCAIN : There was no transparency into the books of Wall Street banks .
Banks and brokers took on huge amounts of debt and they hid the riskiest of all investments .
Mismanagement and greed became the operating standard while regulators were asleep at the switch .
The regulators were asleep , my friends .
They were not working for you .
Did John McCain --" The DeRegulator , " as we call him -- actually say the word " regulators " with a straight face ?
Many people do n't really know or do n't remember what the Keating 5 scandal was all about and hopefully , Third Term will help explain a lot and possibly predict the future of our economy if he 's elected .
DAVID DONNELLY : ... people who lost life savings through the scandal .
There were , people who ... pensioners who lost their money because those savings and loans went belly - up .
The Black Sea town of Poti has been a port for 2,500 years .
It has been home to the Greeks and the Romans .
But now this hot , dusty , urban centre has another claim to fame - as the latest frontline in the new cold war .
Out on the Black Sea , 10 Nato battleships led by the USS McFaul have been steaming towards Poti , apparently on a mission to deliver humanitarian aid .
On land , the Russians have dug in just outside town - parking their armoured personnel carriers on a grassy verge next to the main road .
The crisis began earlier this month when Russia bombed the port during its invasion of Georgia , killing five people and sinking Georgia 's tiny naval fleet .
During my recent visit , the damage caused by Russian soldiers was n't hard to spot .
They had ransacked store rooms and trashed Poti 's coastguard building , upturning filing cabinets and stomping on a portrait of Georgia 's leader , Mikheil Saakashvili .
On Friday , much of Russia 's army withdrew from Georgia .
But in Poti , they stayed - establishing a checkpoint 7 km outside town .
The Georgians - 1,000 of whom staged a noisy protest at the weekend - accuse them of looting ; Russian soldiers have been seen driving off with photocopiers .
US warships , meanwhile , have been docking at the seaside resort Batumi , just down the coast .
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , says they are smuggling arms to the Georgians , and the Russians have shown off five US Humvees left behind by the Americans following a recent US - Georgian military exercise .
The coast is popular with Georgia 's elite ; villas with swimming pools nestle among tall fir trees .
There is no sign here of an geopolitical standoff between Moscow and the west .
The EU says Russia 's presence in Poti is in breach of a ceasefire agreement signed by Medvedev ; Russia says it is n't , and does n't appear to care .
At every stage of this crisis , Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , has assumed it will be the west that blinks first .
So far he has been proved right .
Expect the Russians - like the Greeks before them - to stay in Poti for a while yet .

Still insane , though .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday , led lower by tech shares after computer maker Dell warned that companies worldwide are cutting back on technology spending .

Nevertheless , the market managed to end August in positive territory as oil continued a sharp slide started in July .
On Friday , all three major indexes fell more than 1 percent , with the Nasdaq chalking up the biggest losses after Dell Inc ’s comments sparked fears about weakness in the whole tech sector .
Shares of Dell , the world ’s second - largest computer maker , fell nearly 14 percent , and other tech shares such as International Business Machines Corp , also declined .
All 30 stocks in the Dow industrials finished in the red on Friday .
Economic data added to the market ’s jitters ahead of the long Labor Day weekend .
A government report showed U.S. personal income fell unexpectedly in July while spending slowed as the effects of a government stimulus package wore off .
An inflation measure hit a 17 - year high .
“ The market is just very fragile .
There ’s not a lot of support going into the Labor Day weekend , ” said Gary Wolfer , senior portfolio manager at Univest Wealth Management & Trust in Souderton , Pennsylvania .
“ The Dell news has compounded the downside move .
When you have a non-financial company missing its earnings , that ’s disconcerting to the market . ”
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 171.47 points , or 1.46 percent , at 11,543.71 .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index was down 17.93 points , or 1.38 percent , at 1,282.75 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 44.12 points , or 1.83 percent , at 2,367.52 .
For the month , though , the Dow added 1.5 percent , while the S&P rose 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1.8 percent .
The U.S. bond market closed early on Friday ahead of the Labor Day holiday , contributing to thin trading volume .
Chipmakers further pressured the Nasdaq after diversified semiconductor company Marvell Technology Group Ltd gave a conservative outlook for the third quarter .
Oil settled down 13 cents at $ 115.46 per barrel even as energy companies began shutting output in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Gustav approached the region .
Earlier , oil had surged above $ 118 .
The pullback was not enough to lift equities , though , particularly the troubled tech sector .
Shares of Marvell Technology , whose chips are used in Apple ’s iPhone and Research In Motion Ltd ’s BlackBerry , fell 4.4 percent to $ 14.11 .
The company said it is still unsure of the impact of a weakening U.S. economy .
An index of semiconductor stocks fell 2.8 percent , while an index of retail stocks dropped 1.1 percent .
Dell shares fell 13.8 percent to $ 21.73 after its spending warning .
Earlier this week , the company reported a surprisingly steep fall in quarterly profit .
IBM shares dropped 2.3 percent to $ 121.73 .
There were some bright spots among the economic data , however .
Business activity in the U.S. Midwest expanded strongly in August as new orders jumped , the Institute for Supply Management - Chicago business barometer showed , even as the rate of hiring plummeted to a four - month low .
The Reuters / University of Michigan report on consumer sentiment , meanwhile , showed confidence recovered somewhat from depressed levels , helped by moderating gasoline prices .
Trading volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange , with about 915 million shares changing hands , well below last year ’s estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion .
On Nasdaq , about 1.56 billion shares traded , also below last year ’s daily average of 2.17 billion .
Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by about 1.7 to 1 while on the Nasdaq , advancers beat decliners by about 1.8 to 1 .
I just got back from seeing I.O.U.S.A. – and it was certainly a very eye opening experience .
Done in the same vein as documentaries like An Inconvenient Truth and Who Killed the Electric Car? , I.O.U.S.A. takes a hard look at United States ’ cu
rrent Federal deficit and spending problems , discusses how we got into this mess in the first place and what will likely happen if we do n’t wake up and start to tackle the problem before it gets too late .
Aside from the fact that the film is relatively terrifying , I really enjoyed it .
I ’m also a nerd , and love numbers , finances and ( most importantly ) my money , so I ’m probably predisposed to like this sort of thing .
However , even if numbers do n’t get your heart racing , because you are a tax payer and will continue to be profoundly impacted by our ballooning Federal deficit , it ’s worth your time and money to go out and see this film .
Watch the trailer by clicking the link below :
One of the things that impressed me about I.O.U.S.A.was the fact it was presented in a nonpartisan manner .
In general , there was n’t much finger pointing at anyone or any group in particular , rather the blame was spread across our elected officials , their appointees and all of us tax payers .
By spending time talking about the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy , the Executive and Legislative Branches ’ lack of a sound fiscal policy , or John and Jane Doe ’s inability to save and live within their means and pretty much everything in between , it was easy to walk out of the film and feel that all parties involved have played a significant role in helping to run up a now nearly $ 9 trillion deficit .
On the flip side , it was also easy to see how each group could do their part to help facilitate change .
With people like Warren Buffett , Dr. Ron Paul , Alan Greenspan , Paul Volker and David Walker ( more about him in a bit ) contributing , it ’s very hard to not take this film seriously .
After all , when the world ’s richest man ( Buffett ) tells you that a sustained trade deficit will ultimately cause severe economic hardship down the road , it ’s kind of hard to not believe it .
With regards to David Walker , he is my new hero , and someone that we should all admire .
As former Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office , Walker not only had more insight than anyone into the Federal government ’s books and financial problems , but he was one of the first people to really take a stand and bring these issues to light .
Despite the gloom and doom message he presents , he does not come off as a “ Chicken Little ” figure , rather someone who knows exactly what he ’s talking about .
So , please , do yourself a favor and catch a matinee showing of this important film .
Then , take action .

I am a university professor , who earns a monthly salary , and one that is certainly not overwhelming in size .
It ’s very unlikely that I will ever leave an estate that is too large to qualify for the estate - tax exemption .
Still less likely is it that I will ever inherit such an estate .
Nevertheless , I am in favor of the repeal of the estate tax on all of the much larger estates that people other than myself will leave and that people other than myself will inherit .
This is because I understand how I and all other wage and salary earners benefit from capital owned by other people , capital that will be substantially increased in its amount and thus in the benefits it can give if the inheritance tax is repealed .
Like all other wage and salary earners , I buy products and I sell labor .
The supply of the products I buy and the demand for the labor I sell depend on the amount of capital that is invested in the society in which I live .
The larger is the amount of that capital , the greater is the amount of means of production used to produce the products I buy and thus the better and more abundant is their supply and the lower - priced and more affordable they are .
At the same time , the greater is the demand for the labor I sell and thus the higher are the wages or salary I earn .
Yes , I want to live in a society in which I am surrounded by the greatest possible number of very wealthy individuals who invest their wealth in producing the products I buy and in employing the labor I sell .
I want to be surrounded by giant firms like General Motors and Exxon , with tens of billions of dollars of capital invested in producing amazing products like automobiles and gasoline by the most modern , efficient methods , so that almost everyone , myself included , can afford to own and drive such a wonderful machine as the automobile .
I want comparable sums of capital invested in everything I buy , so that I can afford to buy it and have money left over for all kinds of luxuries .
I want all these giant firms to be out in the market competing for labor , so that the wages or salary I and everyone else can earn will be that much higher .
Repealing the inheritance tax means that substantial sums that would otherwise disappear into government spending programs will instead be used to make capital investments .
Heirs will be able to keep their estates rather than have to sell off major portions to raise the money to pay estate taxes .
As a result , the people who would have bought the estates will have to invest in new and additional capital rather than in the purchase of estates , from which their funds are passed on to the Treasury .
That additional investment is what will serve my self - interest as a wage or salary earner .
For it will be added to the capital that produces the goods I buy and that underlies the demand for the labor I sell .
I do n’t benefit from government spending to pay people not to work or produce , for interfering with their ability to work and produce , for failed educational systems or a botched medical care system , or for ill - conceived military ventures all over the world .
But I do benefit from additional capital investment — that will give me better and lower - priced goods and a higher wage or salary .
It may be true , as some have argued , that repealing the inheritance tax will open up new tax " loopholes " that enable wealthy individuals to reduce their income tax payments .
If that is the case , then the result will be so much the better from the standpoint of my and every other wage or salary earner ’s actual self - interest , because the additional taxes avoided will also be used mainly to add to capital investment and thus increase the supply of goods and the demand for labor .
Consequently , I say , vive the " loopholes " and their enlargement .
It may also be true that the effect of repealing the inheritance tax will be to reduce support for various private charities .
If so , loss of support for such valuable institutions as hospitals , schools , libraries , and opera companies could easily be prevented by donors deciding to continue support for them unabated and reduce their funding only of organizations that work to undermine or destroy the capitalist economic system .
Indeed , in the spirit of self - sacrifice that they champion , the leaders of such organizations should step forward and positively urge donors to make such a choice .
( Of course , even they would ultimately benefit from such a choice , because everyone is better off in a capitalist society than in the kind of society that they are working to establish . )
Finally , no one should fear the establishment of any kind of hereditary aristocracy of wealth because of the repeal of the inheritance tax .
It ’s true that if two young men were equally talented in every respect but that one of them inherited a substantial sum of wealth while the other did not , the first would probably always be better off than the second .
But so what ?
What is wealth for if not to make an individual better off than he would otherwise be ?
The important thing is that the wealth of the one would not be a threat of any kind to the other .
On the contrary , it would work to his benefit , not only in the ways I have described but also , very possibly , in a more personal way .
For example , it could enable the two to form a partnership based both on their combined abilities and on the wealth of the one that was fortunate enough to be an heir .
While the heir ’s share in the partnership would be greater , the use of his capital would enable both to achieve greater success than if he did not possess it .
But in a capitalist society , free of governmentally imposed class distinctions , talented newcomers — self - made men— again and again rise from the ranks of the relatively poor and finish their lives as the richest members of society .
Rockefeller , Carnegie , Ford , and in our day , men like Gates and Buffet , did not enter the world in possession of any vast fortune .
They themselves created their fortunes .
Heirs can retain their fortunes if they do not waste them , but only if they possess considerable talent can they maintain their fortunes in the first rank of wealth .
Some people may attempt to dismiss the essential points I have made as " the trickle - down theory . "
Such disparagement does not in any way refute any of those points .
They all remain true .
Invested capital is the foundation of the supply of products and of the demand for labor .
To make them grow , and thus the standard of living of the average wage or salary earner rise , it must grow .
That is what repeal of the inheritance tax will help to accomplish .
The only alternative to this theory is the utterly nihilistic , loot - and - plunder theory , which is the theory of the critics of capitalism and private ownership of the means of production and of the freedom of inheritance .

One of the highlights of the Stratham Fair is the pie eating contest .
Clowns travel throughout the crowd as heralds , calling the warriors to the arena .
Nathan 's Famous Hot Dogs can be blamed for the entire eating contest thing .
In the year Nathan 's first opened , 1916 , they held the first July 4th Nathan 's Famous eating contest on Coney Island .
As if that were n't enough ignominy , Nathan 's is also credited as being the Home of Fast Food .
Nathan 's also came up with the idea of the International Federation of Competitive Eating ( IFOCE ) .
It 's for real .
The IFOCE seems to realize that it is funny as evidenced by its official heraldic emblem bearing two standing lions facing each other , each holding one end of a footlong hotdog in his mouth .
Some words of advice for first time competitors :
Do n't eat anything before the contest to maximize your potential pie intake .
Attach your plate to the table with tape or Velcro to prevent it from sliding away from you .
Tie your hands behind your back .
you do n't want to get disqualified .
Slam your whole face into the pie and stick out your tongue .
Pull the food toward your mouth .
Eat by turning your head to the sides and up and down .
This will get lot of pie stuck on your face and in your hair .
You will be dirty but it will get the pie off the plate faster .
Try to eat as much crust as possible , as a half - empty plate from side to side looks like a lot less pie then from top to bottom .
Try to uncover as much plate or pan as possible .
Have fun .

Conyers wants
You to Rebut his 5 Reasons Not to Impeach which reports , At Dailykos , markthshark has posted a diary , which reports ,
Last Friday , Code Pink was granted a meeting with Chairman John Conyers , in which he challenged the intrepid , peace - lovin ' protesters to explain to him why he should dismiss the five most common reasons indicating that impeachment is not possible .
The five reasons are below .
John Conyers ’ five [ paraphrased ] reasons for not impeaching :
I ’m going to list them twice , first with my rebuttals and then with the rebuttals given on dailykos .
Reasons by Rob Kall
• Reason one :
While the majority of people in this country want Bush gone , they do n't want impeachment .
Rebuttal : Most people do n’t understand that there are two parts to impeachment — hearings that Bush can claim executive privilege for , and the senate trial .
People do n’t want to deal with the senate trial .
The polls Conyers may be seeing that show opposition to impeachment do n’t explain this .
They allow for ignorance .
• Reason two :
The corporate media will slay us .
Rebuttal : No .
The corporate media will get tons of cheap , free content that will provide high interest , attention grabbing news .
They will love it .
Sure , FOX
News will criticize , but they do that 24/7 anyway .
• Reason three : Not enough time .
Rebuttal : The timing is perfect .
The coverage will show the dirt , corruption , lies and criminality of Bush , Cheney and their republican enablers and will do devastating damage to McCain , GOP incumbents and the image of the Republican party .
If impeachment hearings were started before June , they may have actually been TOO early , since Republicans could have cleaned up the mess and moved on .
Now it is pretty much too late , even if the Republicans give Bush and Cheney the boot .
• Reason four :
Not enough votes .
Rebuttal : The Dems control the hearings in the house .
The “ not enough votes ” concern is all about the senate .
The Dems can keep the trial from ever happening by keeping hearings going .
That ’s why we want impeachment , for the devastating hearings that will damage the Republicans .
Forget about the votes .
They will never happen .
The Republicans will do “ the Walk ” to the whitehouse to tell Cheney and Bush they have to resign or the Republican party will be destroyed .
• Reason five :
It will most likely cost the Democrats the election .
Rebuttal : Total cowardly , unsubstantiated nonsense .
Impeachment hearings will increase the factor Obama wins against McCain by and will help more Dems beat Republican incumbents .
The news coverage will be riveting and will cast an incredbly ugly light upon the Republicans .
My poll , posted last week on OpEdNews.com , Will Impeachment Hearings Help or Hurt Obama and Democrats This Year ?
drew a 94 % response saying that it would HELP , not hurt the democrats .
Rebuttals given by Markthshark on dailykos .
• Reason one :
While the majority of people in this country want Bush gone , they do n't want impeachment .
Rebuttal : According to the Institute for Public Accuracy , a poll done by the American Research Group back in July 2007 indicated that 54 % wanted to impeach Dick Cheney and 40 % did not .
In the same poll , 45 % said they wanted to see George W. Bush impeached and 46 % did not .
Democrats.com has a whole series of polls from last year .
Times have changed and percentages are most likely even higher in favor of impeachment now with recent disclosures from the long - awaited Senate Select Intelligence Committee Phase Two report and Scott McClellan ’s new book What Happened .
• Reason two :
The corporate media will slay us .
Rebuttal : Consider the source .
I ’m not trying to be trite here but the media in America simply have no credibility anymore because of how they failed to ask the hard questions during the run up to the war , and they ’ve continued their dereliction of duties as the 4th branch of our government by not holding this scofflaw administration accountable for their crimes .
Besides , impeachment hearings will be broadcast on C - Span full time and cable news part time .
It 's kind of difficult to refute the evidence once it's laid out on the proverbial table .
• Reason three : Not enough time .

7 Myths of Crowd Psychology
Crowds are not the many - armed destructive monsters of the popular or even fascist imagination .
How do you imagine an archetypal crowd of people – say at a concert , a sporting event or a demonstration ?
If you picture an irrational , spontaneous , suggestible , emotional and even potentially dangerous group then you are in good company .
Sociologists David Schweingruber and Ronald Wohlstein have found this view of crowds is promoted by many authors of introductory sociology textbooks .
Indeed the idea that crowds demonstrate bizarre , almost pathological behaviour was championed by eminent French sociologist Gustave LeBon .
Despite these beliefs both in sociology textbooks and in the general public , the actual evidence does not support it .
Crowds are not the many - armed destructive monsters of the popular or even fascist imagination .
Here are the seven myths about crowds that Schweingruber and Wohlstein identify , in order of how frequently they appear in introductory sociology textbooks .
1. Crowds are spontaneous
The most common myth about crowds is that they are spontaneous , or worse , that they are hotbeds of violence , with complete chaos only a few ill - judged jostles away .
Research into crowd violence does not support this .
One study of riots shows that violence is normally related to the presence of two opposing factions .
Mixed crowds – which are the norm – are in fact usually peaceful and only engage in stereotypical crowd - behaviour , e.g. whistling and clapping , face - painting , singing and shouting depending on the occasion .
In reality most people will go to almost any length to avoid actual violence , whether they are in a crowd or not .
2. Crowds are suggestible
The idea that people in crowds have heightened suggestibility is also a relatively common myth .
People are said to copy each other , looking for a leader , being open to others ’ suggestion about how they should behave , perhaps resulting from a lack of social structure .
Schweingruber and Wohlstein simply find no research to back up this claim .
If there is some truth to the idea that people in crowds are suggestible , no one has managed to demonstrate it empirically .
One scholar has asked why , if crowds are so suggestible , they do n’t disperse when asked to do so by an authority figure .
3. Crowds are irrational
One type of irrationality frequently attributed to crowds is panic .
Faced by emergency situations people are thought to suddenly behave like selfish animals , trampling others in the scramble to escape .
A long line of research into the way people behave in real emergency situations does not support this idea .
Two examples are studies on underground station evacuations and the rapid , orderly way in which people evacuated the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Many lives were saved that day because people resisted the urge to panic .
Resisting the urge to irrationality , or panic , is the norm .
4. Crowds increase anonymity
A less common myth , but still popular is the idea that people become more anonymous when they are in a crowd .
This anonymity is said to feed into spontaneity and even destructiveness , helping to make crowds violent , dangerous places in which society ’s laws are transgressed .
Everyday experience , though , is that people usually travel in groups , with their family or friends , and so are not anonymous at all .
Research confirms this , for example one study from the 70s found that most people at a football match were with one or more friends .
Later research has repeated this finding .
5. Crowds are emotional
Less widespread this myth – nevertheless crowds are thought by some to be particularly emotional .
It is argued that increased emotionality is linked to irrationality and perhaps violence .
Modern psychological research , though , does n’t see the emotions as separate to decision - making , but rather as an integral part .
To talk about an ’ emotional crowd ’ as opposed to a ‘ rational crowd ’ , therefore , does n’t make sense .
People in crowds make their decisions with input from their emotions , just as they do when they ’re not in a crowd .
6. Crowds are unanimous
Few of the sociology textbooks endorse the myth of unanimity , but the idea does appear that when people are together they tend to act in unison .
Research suggests , though , that this is rarely the case – people remain stubbornly individual .
7. Crowds are destructive
The least common myth in the sociology textbooks , but quite a strong cultural stereotype of crowds , is that they are destructive .
This is closely related to the myth of spontaneity and is often connected to violence .
Again Schweingruber and Wohlstein find that the research ( like this ) shows violence in crowds is extremely rare .
And what violence does occur is normally carried out by a small minority – these are the people that make it onto the news .

Since I called some STL code readable , I 've recieved numerous mails and comments .
Fellow Qt / KDE - er dhaumann added his 0.02 EUR to the pile and showed the nicety of template specialization .
Today I thought I 'd follow up on some more comments .
First of all , my personal opinion is that C++ is just as readable as most other languages .
Even in this case .
What can be less readable are the horrendus error messages that one can end up with .
I 've even compiled a small list of error messages and what they really mean in plain English , but this does not - of course - help in ugly template cases .
( Yes , the css of digitalfanatics.org is ugly and somewhat broken ... ) Back to readability .
Even plain English cannot express the two operations that I suggested in a short way .
Both cases results in fairly long sentences .
Also , try to formally parse and express such sentences with more " interesting " transformation functions .
As the commenter zwabel pointed out , in the put - the - result - in - another - list a simple foreach loop showing the actual operation is good enough and reads better .
I agree , but that kind of break my do - everything - on - a - line - thesis .
Titus Brown pointed out that I do too much on a single line .
I have to disagree with this - looping and doing something on each item is simple enough .
Then I had lots of suggestions that I say that C++ is n't functional , but I use a functional style in my example .
I 'm not sure that I agree .
My impression of the STL is that it can perform a number of functions on lists that I 'm interested in , for instance .
To make these operations flexible , they accept a functor - either a predicate or an actual transformation operation .
This is n't really functional programming in my eyes , even if it can be used for functional programming .
To me , it is just a set of ways to perform iterations and common tasks .
Anyway , some fun thought that have poped up while discussing this topic .
What if we combine these operations with the QtConcurrent framework .
I have not tried the framework myself , but I was in Munich and listened to Morten 's presentation of it , and to me it looks like it could be done .
What is missing is a nice set of flexible map and filter functions , binders and such goodies that the STL carries .

RELEASE : 08-246
NASA Mars Lander Sees Falling Snow , Soil Data Suggest Liquid Past
WASHINGTON -- NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander has detected snow falling from Martian clouds .
Spacecraft soil tests experiments also have provided evidence of past interaction between minerals and liquid water , processes that occur on Earth .
A laser instrument designed to gather knowledge of how the atmosphere and surface interact on Mars , detected snow from clouds about 2.5 miles above the spacecraft 's landing site .
Data show the snow vaporizing before reaching the ground .
" Nothing like this view has ever been seen on Mars , " said Jim Whiteway , of York University , Toronto , lead scientist for the Canadian - supplied Meteorological Station on Phoenix .
" We 'll be looking for signs that the snow may even reach the ground .
" Phoenix experiments also yielded clues pointing to calcium carbonate , the main composition of chalk , and particles that could be clay .
Most carbonates and clays on Earth form only in the presence of liquid water .
" We are still collecting data and have lots of analysis ahead , but we are making good progress on the big questions we set out for ourselves , " said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
Since landing on May 25 , Phoenix already has confirmed that a hard subsurface layer at its far - northern site contains water - ice .
Determining whether that ice ever thaws would help answer whether the environment there has been favorable for life , a key aim of the mission .
The evidence for calcium carbonate in soil samples from trenches dug by the Phoenix robotic arm comes from two laboratory instruments called the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer , or TEGA , and the wet chemistry laboratory of the Microscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer , or MECA .
" We have found carbonate , " said William Boynton of the University of Arizona , lead scientist for the TEGA .
" This points toward episodes of interaction with water in the past .
" The TEGA evidence for calcium carbonate came from a high - temperature release of carbon dioxide from soil samples .
The temperature of the release matches a temperature known to decompose calcium carbonate and release carbon dioxide gas , which was identified by the instrument 's mass spectrometer .
The MECA evidence came from a buffering effect characteristic of calcium carbonate assessed in wet chemistry analysis of the soil .
The measured concentration of calcium was exactly what would be expected for a solution buffered by calcium carbonate .
Both TEGA , and the microscopy part of MECA have turned up hints of a clay - like substance .
" We are seeing smooth - surfaced , platy particles with the atomic - force microscope , not inconsistent with the appearance of clay particles , " said Michael Hecht , MECA lead scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
The Phoenix mission , originally planned for three months on Mars , now is in its fifth month .
However , it faces a decline in solar energy that is expected to curtail and then end the lander 's activities before the end of the year .
Before power ceases , the Phoenix team will attempt to activate a microphone on the lander to possibly capture sounds on Mars .
" For nearly three months after landing , the sun never went below the horizon at our landing site . " said Barry Goldstein , JPL Phoenix project manager .
" Now it is gone for more than four hours each night , and the output from our solar panels is dropping each week .
Before the end of October , there wo n't be enough energy to keep using the robotic arm .
" The Phoenix mission is led by Smith at the University of Arizona .
Project management is the responsibility of JPL with development partnership by Lockheed Martin in Denver .
International contributions come from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus , Denmark ; Max Planck Institute , Germany ; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute .

Hockey mom outfit worth $ 2,500 -- just for the top RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This " Hockey mom " Sarah Palin 's shantung silk Valentino jacket for the Republican National Convention was worth $ 2,500 , according to a story in the New York Post .
" Insiders tell Page Six Palin has a secretive circle of stylists who dress her for events , " the Post wrote Wednesday .
For her big speech in St. Paul , where she accepted the GOP 's vice - presidential nod , this fashion - conscious team encouraged the Alaska governor to splurge on a $ 2,500 jacket from Saks Fifth Avenue designed by Valentino Garavani . "
Palin told RNC delegates : " I was just your average hockey mom , and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids ' public education better . "
The Post cited an individual " familiar " with Palin's " primping . "
" They do not want the American public to know that Palin is using stylists or that she is paying for expensive clothes this early on in the campaign , " the source said .
" We spoke to someone on Palin 's styling team , who told us , ' I did a little bit of personal styling , but I can't discuss anything I 've done with Sarah Palin .
I 'm not sure which designs she wore . . . anything related to working with her is confidential , ' " the paper wrote .
Cindy McCain , wife of the GOP presidential nominee , took heat after Vanity Fair revealed her RNC outfit cost $ 300,000 , including her outfit and diamonds .
" A representative for Valentino confirmed Palin wore one of his designs during her convention speech , but said she did not buy it from a Valentino store , " added the Post .
" Palin 's reps had no comment . "

Call it a self - fulfilling prophecy :
An estimated three - fourths of gas stations in the Nashville , Tennessee , area ran dry Friday , victim of an apparent rumor that the city was running out of gas .
" Everybody has just gone nuts , " said Mike Williams , executive director of the Tennessee Petroleum Council .
He said he has no idea about the origin of a rumor that there was going to be no gas in Nashville .
One reporter called him , saying she had heard that Nashville would be without gas within the hour , he said .
Hearing the rumor , drivers rushed to fill their cars and trucks .
CNN called 13 Nashville gas stations at random .
Only two reported having gas , and one said it was almost out .
The stations said they were being told they would not get more until Monday or Tuesday .
iReport.com : Nashville residents desperate for fuel
Katie Givens Kime , visiting from Atlanta , Georgia , was trying to fill up her tank for the trip home when she ran into trouble -- when she was already low on gas .
" We panicked and looked online , " she said .
" And holy cow , there is no gas in the city .
...
It has definitely gripped the city , for sure . "
One store clerk told her there was no way she could get gas to go back home , she said .
Williams said some drivers were following gas trucks to see where they were headed , and lines at some stations were a mile long .
Fuel was continuing to enter the city , however , as pipelines were working and barges were coming in .
He likened it to Southerners rushing out to stock up on bread and milk when they hear it might snow .
As stations began running low , the situation snowballed , he said .
One station reported selling as much gas Friday as it usually does in a weekend , Williams said .
The phenomenon seemed to be isolated to the Nashville area , he said .
iReport.com :
Is there a gas panic in your area ?
Givens
Kime said she found a station online that still had gas and waited more than an hour to pump it .
" People were freaked out , " she said .
A " renegade bunch " of men helped direct traffic to and from the pumps , even taking drivers ' cash inside for them .
She described people filling cans and other containers as well as cars .
She said that the station was not engaging in price gouging but that " emotions were running very high " among drivers .

' Science fiction like ' weapons on tap for political conventions David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday July 7 , 2008
Print This Email This
The political parties are arming themselves , in preparation for their respective conventions .
Congress has approved $ 100 million to pay for security expenses at this summer 's presidential nominating conventions , with $ 50 million dedicated to each party .
CNN's Ed Lavendera reports that Denver and St. Paul officials have said that the types of weapons being purchased are " top secret . "
Apart from the traditional pepper spray and rubber bullets employed by police for controlling large protests , Denver , Colorado and St. Paul , Minnesota officials may be spending large sums on weapons CNN calls ' science fiction like ' .
Weapons such as the sonic ray gun , which emits a head - splitting frequency and deafens large groups of people .
Also rumored for the conventions is the goo gun -- which shoots a gel that can coat and wrap people whole , or stop a moving vehicle in its path -- and a microwave pulse emitter -- a radio frequency device that makes one 's skin feel it is on fire , previously deployed in the streets of Baghdad , Iraq .
The ACLU is suing both cities to disclose how security money is being spent , with hopes as to determine what specific weapons may be deployed against Americans .
However , officials say it is important they be secretive about the technologies employed by their security forces , lest the crowds which will inevitably surround the conventions gain the upper hand .
This video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast July 7 , 2008 .

Transcript ROBERTS : Pepper ball rifles , goo guns , sonic rays .
some are wild rumors but some may not be .
some may protect our political convention this year .
Ed Lavandera in Denver where the democrats will meet and hes got more .
LAVENDERA : To prepare for this summers political conventions , Congress is giving the host cities , Denver and St. Paul , Minnesota , $ 50 million each to pay for security expenses .
But what exactly that money is being spent on is top secret here in denver .
NEWMAN : $ 25 million buys a lot of very interesting things .
LAVENDERA : Bob Newman is an anti-terrorism consultant , helping Denver companies prepare for the Democratic convention .
Hes anxious to see what kind of crowd control weaponry authorities will deploy for the convention .
NEWMAN : There are also crazy rumors going around .
LAVENDERA : City officials and the police department wont talk about most of the weapons and equipment they re buying .
FLEENER : This is your pepper rounds .
LAVENDERA : But confirmed one report several hundred thousands of high powered pepper ball rifles will be used to disperse crowds .
FLEENER : When that hits , the ball breaks , powder expels .
the same reaction as pepper spray .
Except it s powder .
LAVENERA : Congressional testimony revealed there will be specialized gas detection equipment and biohazard equipment .
Then there are the science fiction - like weapons that may or may not be part of the arsenal , like the goo gun .
SECURITY CONSULTANT :
It shoots a rubbery gelatin mass when it strikes the body and comes out in a stream it wraps around limbs and the torso and the person cant move .
LAVENERA : It can make a Humvee have spin in place .
Then there are the weapons that would make unruly crowds run for cover like a sonic ray gun , a device which emits an ear piercing sound and a microwave device that can be focused on an area and can make you feel like your skin is on fire .
The ACLU has sued the city of Denver to find out if these weapons are in the arsenal .
SILVERSTEIN : Instead of asking the public ,  How come you want to know ? 
Maybe the question should posed to the government ,  Why are you interested in keeping this secret ? 
NEWMAN : Rational people are not concerned .
Those concerned are the ones causing problems .
LAVENDERA : In Minnesota where republicans are holding their convention , the ACLU says its trying to find out how security money is being spent but law enforcement agencies insist these weapons should be kept secret so they have the upper hand in keeping the convention safe .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Children who grow up in a spic - and - span home may have a higher risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease , a study suggests .
Inflammatory bowel disease , or IBD , refers to a group of conditions marked by chronic inflammation in the intestines , leading to symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea .
It ’s thought that the conditions arise from an immune system overreaction that injures the body ’s own intestinal tissue .
In the new study , published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology , researchers looked at whether the so - called “ hygiene hypothesis ” might be involved in young people ’s risk of developing IBD .
The hygiene hypothesis was first advanced in the late 1980s as one explanation for the rise in allergic diseases in developed nations .
The theory is that when children are exposed to few viruses , bacteria and other microorganisms early in life , their immune system development is affected in a way that raises the risk of abnormal immune reactions .
For example , studies have found that young children who spend time in daycare , where they are likely to be exposed to viruses and other microorganisms , are less likely to develop allergies than their peers who spend little time around other children early in life .
For the current study , Dr. Eran Israeli and colleagues looked at the relationship between IBD risk and certain markers of how “ hygienic ” a child ’s upbringing was -- including how many siblings a child had , his or her spot in the family birth order , and whether the family lived in an urban or rural area .
A rural environment is considered generally less hygienic than an urban one .
The researchers found that among the nearly 400,000 Israeli teenagers included in the study , 768 -- or 0.2 percent -- had been diagnosed with IBD .
Those with one sibling were between two and three times more likely to have IBD than teens with five or more siblings .
Similarly , teenagers who lived in an urban setting were 38 percent more likely to suffer from IBD than their rural counterparts .
The findings do not prove that the hygiene hypothesis is at work in IBD , according to Israeli , of Hadassah Medical Center - Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
The study , he told Reuters Health , looked only at “ surrogate markers ” of childhood hygiene and showed an association between those markers and IBD .
But if the extra -clean surroundings of modern life do indeed contribute to IBD development in certain susceptible individuals , what are the implications ?
“ It would of course be impractical to suggest living in a less ‘ hygienic ’ environment or changing living conditions in order to afford possible protection ( from ) future development of IBD , ” Israeli said .
However , he added , it might be possible to lower IBD risk in people who are at higher - than - normal risk -- such as those with family members with the disease -- by exposing them to harmless microbes to help regulate their immune responses .
Researchers have already begun studying whether exposure to harmless parasitic worms might help treat Crohn ’s or colitis .
Studies have not yet investigated such tactics for preventing IBD in healthy , high - risk people , Israeli noted .

Decreasing Connections While Increasing Our Networks
While lounging on my couch this morning I decided to go through all 200 Twitter and FriendFeed requests that I ’ve procrastinated on getting to this week .
Lately I ’ve been feeling so overwhelmed with requests that I ’ve created a filter in Gmail to label and archive these requests .
When I clicked on the label and took a cursory glance at my inbox , I wondered why I ’d been feeling so overwhelmed with going through these requests .
After about 10 minutes it hit me : as my network grows social networks do n’t allow me to connect to my followers the way I used to .
It Was All A Dream
Let me take you back for a second .
When I first began to gain notoriety , I only had a handful of Twitter followers .
Definitely no more than 400 .
At that time I would tweet good morning and get several responses back .
I would reply to each response and hold about 4 conversations at once on Twitter .
This was the reason why I tweeted so much .
It was much easier to hold a conversation and keep up with individual people .
I knew who the majority of my followers were , thereby enabling me to utilize Twitter to its maximum potential .
I was able to connect , refer , analyze , and reflect on what I was getting from my followers .
Things just are n’t the same anymore .
Back To Reality
Now , I could n’t tell you who half of my followers are .
I really do n’t know who I ’m following and who I ’m not following .
I do n’t even know why certain people are following me .
In turn , my conversation on Twitter has deteriorated along with the amount of time I used to spend on Twitter .
Maybe growth on some of these networks is n’t the best thing in the world .
Should there be self - imposed limits on how many people you befriend ?
No because in the end , while your network growth may increase , your connection with your network still increases .
However , the rate at which the connection can increase actually decreases .
Did that make sense ?
Unless your friends are constantly questioning you or keeping tabs on you , it ’s going to take a lot longer to make deeper connections the more your network grows .
More Features or Better Tools ?
Though there are plenty of social networks to go around , I ’m beginning to wonder if they incorporate the right tools to be able to keep up with our growing networks .
We do n’t have a clue on where to begin to make deeper connections as our networks continue to grow .
In turn , things may just get out of hand .
You start adding people just because they added you with no desire to establish a real relationship with anyone that you have n’t already befriended beforehand .
Here are my questions for the developers and users of social networks :
How do you maintain connections with your network of friends ?
What features or tools help you to maintain these connections ?
What features or tools are missing that you feel could help you to grow your connections even more ?
What do you think ?

RELAX , computer users , after only two weeks Microsoft will stop teasing you as the company begins the next phase of an ambitious  and risky  $ 300 million campaign intended to make over its tarnished image .
The campaign , which begins Thursday and carries the theme “ Windows .
Life without walls , ” will move away from the enigmatic teaser commercials that featured Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld in offbeat conversations about shopping , shoes , suburbia and the potential of computing to improve life .
The teaser ads have generated considerable discussion since they started on Sept. 4 , not all of it positive .
What follows is an audacious embrace of the disdainful label that Apple , Microsoft ’s rival , has gleefully  and successfully  affixed onto users of Microsoft products : “ I ’m a PC . ”
One new Microsoft commercial even begins with a company engineer who resembles John Hodgman , the comedian portraying the loser PC character in the Apple campaign .
“ Hello , I ’m a PC , ” the engineer says , echoing Mr. Hodgman ’s recurring line , “ and I ’ve been made into a stereotype . ”
Sometimes the most logical , most obvious solutions are the most difficult to see .
While the presidential campaign was mired in the egregious and the trivial last week , there was a hearing in Washington that addressed what should be a critical component of the nation ’s energy strategy .
It got very little attention .
Put aside for a moment all the talk about alternative fuels .
They are no doubt important and the wave of the future .
But the fastest , cheapest , easiest and cleanest step toward a sane energy environment  a step available to all of us immediately  is the powerful combination of efficiency and conservation .
That was the message delivered again and again at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee that carried the title , “ Efficiency : The Hidden Secret to Solving Our Energy Crisis . ”
Two political leaders who are no longer very fashionable were on to this long ago  former Gov. Jerry Brown of California ( derided as “ Governor Moonbeam ” ) and former President Jimmy Carter , who presciently said of the energy crisis in 1977 : “ With the exception of preventing war , this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetime . ”
Marriage Proposal in Street View !
Google decided to take some new Street View images at the Googleplex in Mountain View , California .
This time they must have let the employees know , as there are many Googlers lining the street .
They must have given advance warning , because some people came prepared .
One Googler named Michael Weiss - Malik , a member of the Google Geo team that dos Google Maps / Earth , actually decided to make a wedding proposal in Street View .
He put up a sign which you can see here :
View Larger Map
He also has a web site called MarryMeLeslie.com which describes why he did it , and why it ’s called “ 2.0 ” .
If you turn your view to the left or right , you can see the line of Googlers down the street .
Move your view down the street to get a look at all the interesting things they decided to show .
You can also view these with the Street View layer inside Google Earth for a more immersive experience .

Starting next year , France will institute a “ taxe pique - nique , ” a tax on plastic cups , knives and forks , and non-biodegradable paper plates and napkins .
The goal , of course , is to discourage institutions and individuals from buying these one time use products that are harmful to the environment .
According to the Telegraph
A tax of 90 cents ( 71 p ) per kilogram ( 2.2 lbs ) will be placed on plastic and paper throwaway cups from next year , aimed at cutting the average 360 kg ( 793 lbs ) of rubbish generated per person per year in France .
This concept of imposing a tax , or a levy as the French environment minister , Jean - Louis Borloo calls it , on environmentally unfriendly products is not new in France .
They already have what is known as “ bonus - malus ” system which places higher taxes on high polluting vehicles and gives tax breaks for environmentally friendly cars .
Some in France see this as an attack on the people who are already struggling in a difficult economy .
Others see it as a necessity .
One mother who was picnicking with her family using durable plates and utensils is quoted as saying ,
“ We ’ll have to start cutting back on disposable stuff , otherwise we ’ll never get out of this mess . ”
I think she ’s right .
When I first started making changes in my house a couple of years ago , one of the first things I did was stop buying paper plates and napkins .
I bought inexpensive cloth napkins that get washed with the towels .
It was a completely painless change for our family .
I ’ve since bought extra stainless steel flatware at a yard sale so that when we have a lot of people over , I do n’t need to use plastic utensils .
It actually saves us money .
A tax like this might force people to do the same thing I did .
It might force schools to switch from plastic utensils to durable ones .
It might encourage cafeterias in large business complexes to do the same .
Or it might not .
But it might .
Look at what happened in Ireland when a tax was placed on plastic bags in 2002 .
Within five months plastic bag usage was cut by 90 % .
I was in Ireland this past summer .
Not a plastic bag in sight .
I ’m not a big fan of taxes .
Who is ?
I would prefer that people make these types of changes voluntarily like my family did instead of the government stepping in and forcing their hand .
But there are many people who will not make changes until it puts a dent in their wallet .
The thing about a tax like this is that it does n’t have to put a dent in anyone ’s wallet .
There might need to be a small investment in durable items , but after that the change will save money .
So , how would you react if an additional tax was placed on plastic cups , knives and forks , and non-biodegradable paper plates and napkins ?
Would you suck it up and make the switch , pitch a fit at yet another tax , or just fork over the money and keep using your plastic forks ?

KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia --
Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was formally charged Thursday with committing sodomy , an accusation the politician called " malicious . "
Mr. Anwar , who heads an alliance of opposition parties that is threatening to topple Malaysia 's National Front government , pleaded not guilty in a Kuala Lumpur court and was freed on bail .
Several hundred supporters gathered outside , restrained by a large police contingent .
Sodomy ...
It was already known that Nintendo was on the hook for $ 21 million in a patent suit over the company 's controllers .
A Texas judge last week denied the game maker 's request for a new trial , and Bloomberg is reporting that the judge will issue a ban to halt sales of the controllers tomorrow .
However , if the ban were to be issued , it would not take effect until after a Nintendo appeal on the original ruling was resolved .
Nintendo could also avoid the ban by posting a bond or putting royalties into an escrow account , according to Bloomberg .
The original suit sought to have Nintendo's Wii Classic Controller , Wii Nunchuk , GameCube controller , and GameCube WaveBird all deemed in violation of an Anascape patent for a " six degrees of freedom " interface device .
A jury found that all of those products , with the exception of the Wii Nunchuk , infringed on Anascape 's patent .
Microsoft was also named as a defendant in the suit , but settled out of court before it went to trial .
Sony has licensed the patent for use in its own products since 2004 .
After Netshare was pulled for the second time from the App Store , there was a glimmer of hope it might return after the developer finally got in touch with Apple .
Enter AT&T and their terms of service : " Plans ( unless specifically designated for tethering usage ) cannot be used for any applications that tether the device ... to Personal Computers ( including without limitation , laptops ) , or other equipment for any purpose . "
There is no tethering plan for the iPhone .
But it 's not that simple , either .
The obvious question is " Why does n't AT&T just offer a tethering plan , so everyone 's happy ? "
Trying to get a straight answer on this question is like interrogating a leprechaun about the current location of Elvis .
Here 's AT&T 's official party line from an AT&T spokesman : " The iPhone is not intended to be used as a tethering device and we have no plans to offer separate tethering plans for it . "
Pushed on NetShare specifically , he added that
" Apple runs the app store , so you 'll have to ask them about the availability of this and other apps .
For customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capabilities , AT&T has a number of other options to choose from . "
Advertisement
The implication - though AT&T wo n't come out and say it - is that the decision to not allow tethering is actually Apple 's after all - besides , why would n't AT&T want to hit you for another $ 30 a month ( or more if you go over their tethering plans ' 5 GB cap ) ?
We 're still trying to get the very bottom of who 's calling the shots on tethering being a no - no , but in the meantime , do n't hold your breath for NetShare to show its pretty face back in the App Store .
If you managed to snag it before it got yoinked , be careful , you do n't want your account terminated .
( P.S. if you 're an international reader and NetShare is still available where you 're at , let us know . )

Despite my wife 's initial disapproval , I have removed all forms of net nanny software from the kid 's computer .
They now surf unhindered by the arbitrary limits of the ambiguous cyber - morality - police .
The experience has been great for all of us because they do not need my approval to visit every new variant of Disney.com or Cartoon Network .
I 've had a number of parents express concern , or horror over this .
I assure them that the lack of " automatic " software does n't mean our children are unsupervised on the Inter webs .
We are choosing instead to take an active role in monitoring and teaching our kids how to self monitor their use of the Internet .
We started out with a few basic rules and have expanded slightly on them .
First and probably most important , was the speech about " bad things " on the internet .
I explained that just like on TV , there are things on the Internet that children should n't be watching .
If they find something they do n't understand , or think is inappropriate they should click Home and go back to Webkinz .
The other rules include no downloading ( hit cancel if it wants to save anything ) , limited time on Youtube , no using computer to watch TV shows , and no registration forms without an adult watching over .
We also like to discuss new sites before the children go there , and hover over their shoulder for a while on their first visit .
Aside from a little problem with shared Webkinz passwords , we have only had one issue with a downloaded ( but not installed ) application .
I occasionally browse through the Firefox history , and have yet to find more than mistyped URLs .
In every case , regardless of the content of the mistyped page , they immediately return to their intended site .
I have shown them how to use bookmarks to minimize typos .
I am sure they have seen , or will soon see some risque pictures , objectionable content , or profanity .
No amount of software , supervision , or training will keep them from seeing something inappropriate for their age .
All you can hope to do is delay it .
When I took the time to educate my geeklets about " inappropriate " things , they listened close and agreed that if they find something they do n't think is appropriate they will hit Home and go back to a nicer site .
All my experiences so far indicate the kids are much more interested in playing games than looking at naked pictures .
I am sure that at some point their views will change , but with some guidance they may adopt a healthy attitude about these things .
If I forbid it , do n't talk about it , and forbid them from seeing it , then I can only imagine they will be more curious and find ways to see it .
Um the paper seems to be coming out just fine .
But RepairCat™ is not happy with that result ...

It 's not a right ; it 's theft , plain and simple .
The arrogance of those who proclaim rights to " public " this and that ( education , libraries , military defense , whatever ) astounds me .
But those who sincerely believe they are part of an honest and fair exchange between participants in a social construct deserve , perhaps , the benefit of the doubt .
Let me try to explain it as I see it .
You 've heard of the " national debt , " I assume ?
You know that the " country " is paying for everything with borrowed dollars , right ?
So when you receive some " service " from " your " government , you do realize that the payment for this service is not actually being paid by anyone , do n't you ?
No .
What the deal is , is there are I.O.U.s which are written to pay for all this stuff .
Since the government has long ago run out of current money in hand , all transactions with the government are funded by claims made against future payments .
Loans , if you will .
But these loans are not like the ones you make with Ned , where he loans you $ 1,000 for a year and you pay him back and give him some extra to pay him for his generosity and expenses .
No , these loans are to be paid back by the " taxpayer . "
So what you have in essence is a deal where you get something you want now , like maybe a " free " education for your kids , or a group of hired killers to wreak havoc on some small foreign country you think deserves it , and the guy who has to actually pay for this is someone down the road who never agreed to any of these things .
No , he is told that he " owes " taxes .
He will be obliged to pay for your goodies , or his stuff will be taken from him , his house will be sold off on the courthouse steps , to pay for the " free education " your child got " from the government . "
Is this starting to make sense ?
People seem to think that stuff they get from the " government " is free .
It 's not .
Think about it .
If there were free stuff then no one would need to go to work and make things , they could just go and get the magic free stuff whenever they needed something .
Nope .
There is no such thing as free stuff .
Everything that we have is something that someone somewhere had to work hard to make .
So you can feel all self - righteous and claim that " society " owes you universal health care , or good " public " transportation , or good retirement benefits or whatever , but what you are really saying is that you deserve to have someone else wait on you -- you are the king and everyone else is part of your private serfdom whose lives are forfeit to your own very special one .
That is a fraud and you are but a common thief .
Maybe worse than a common thief , for at least the common thief is honest and does n't go around acting all holier - than - thou about how he deserves the stuff he 's stealing .
But it 's even worse than this .
You wanna know why ?
Remember the debt ?
The " national debt ? "
There is no money .
It 's all debt .
Anything you are getting from the government now will be paid for by forced extractions ( a pretty word for slavery ) from the lives of innocent children who have not even been born yet .
So we 're not talking just slavery and theft here , we 're talking cannibalism .
The national debt is the literal consumption of the lives of people who have not even been born yet .
You 're eating your grandchildren .
So please , when someone tells you it 's okay , it 's free , it 's from the government , stop and ask yourself if that is how you want to treat your grandchildren .
I doubt that it is .
We all want the very best for our children , our grandchildren .
Most of us want the very best for our friends and neighbors as well .
Some of us even want to see smiles on the faces of those funny looking brown people in far off lands .
In fact , most of us are really kind and generous people all around .
Do n't let that get lost in the con-job the vote - buyers use on you .
Stuff is n't free .
We all have to work hard for our lives .
And that 's okay .
We 're worth it .
Treat each other with respect .
We 're precious .
I bid you peace and love .
P.S. And if you " work " for the " government " ( or a government contractor ) - Stop .
Get a real job where you actually contribute value to the world instead of sucking the marrow from the living bones of the rest of us .
Universe is 13.73 billion years old .
Let ’s compare it to human ’s life .
Let ’s say you will live 100 years .
That means Universe is already 137,300,000 times older than you will ever be .
Let ’s try to visualize that .
Your life ( 100 years ) = 1 pixel .
Age of the universe = 137,300,000 pixels .
Time in the universe when you was not born yet will be all the black pixels .
Your life will be that one white pixel in the end .
For full effect , try scrolling down using your mouse wheel .
Long way to go , eh ?

DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) --
So what is Congress doing , anyway ?
That was a common refrain in a handful of questions posed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the first Digg Dialogg interview Wednesday night .
Digg CEO Jay Adelson presents the community 's questions to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi live on CNN.com .
i Report contributor ReallyRick , whose real name is Rick Seno , wanted to know how Pelosi explained Congress ' low approval rating .
" What can you do to assure the voters that the Congress is not in gridlock ? " he asked on camera from his Dallas , Texas , apartment .
" Everything has been eclipsed in my view by the fact that we have not stopped the war in Iraq .
And we have to do that , " Pelosi responded , but also said she was disappointed to hear that young people do n't know about Congress ' other recent successes in areas including college affordability and job creation .
Seno was one of hundreds of online contributors who submitted and ranked questions on Digg.com and iReport.com for an interview with the Speaker outside the Democratic National Convention .
Watch ReallyRick 's question
In all , Pelosi answered the nine top - ranked questions , including one on legalizing recreational marijuana ( something " I do n't think you 'll see , " she said ) , on a " playing dead " Congress ( " It 's clear we 're not going to do more until we have a Democratic president . " ) , and on government bailouts for Bear Stearns and Freddie Mac ( " this relationship that we have now is not wholesome . " ) .
Digg CEO Jay Adelson led the interview , the first in a series called the Digg Dialogg , introducing questions that came from , and were selected by , the online communities at iReport.com and Digg.com .
Starting on Monday , users uploaded more than 1400 text questions to Digg.com and dozens more video questions to iReport.com , CNN 's user - generated news site .
The Digg community picked the questions for the interview in an online vote .
See all 1400 + questions on Digg.com
Adelson presented the questions to Pelosi verbatim , and in the order they 'd been ranked by the Digg community , with no follow ups and no rephrasing .
The entirely user - generated event took place just outside the Pepsi Center in Denver just minutes after Democrats officially nominated Sen. Barack Obama their candidate for president .
As you might expect in an interview driven by an online community , the top - ranked question had a decidedly tech bent : Digg user " maverick999 " used his question to test the Speaker , asking her to define Net neutrality .
It 's the " free exchange of ideas without having any gatekeepers or toll - takers on the information superhighway , " Pelosi answered , indicating her support for the idea .
" You 're either on the side of the future , or you 're in the past on this subject . "
Pelosi dismissed a question from Digg user " spkrcity , " who asked " Does your support for telecom immunity have anything to do with the fact that your husband has millions invested in AT&T ? "
" He does n't have millions invested in AT&T , " she said , and " I did n't support telecom immunity . "
One of the most common themes of the user - generated questions -- and one of the most discussed on iReport.com -- was about Pelosi 's stance on impeaching President Bush , but since none of them ended up at the top of the community 's list , the question went unanswered .
iReporter JanMarbol 's poses a question as a video essay >>
0:36 Intro .
Father 's medical care at the end of his life .
One thing to see statistics that suggest things are wrong with the American health care system , Hanson podcast , but quite another thing to see that up front .
Father diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus late last year ; political scientist , would n't live to the next election .
But he probably died from an infection contracted in the hospital .
Pain in ankle in early January , goes for x-ray ; fell and broke hip .
Emergency room ; pin put in .
Advised to walk around .
History of cardiac problems , so put there , kept flat on his back and developed bed sores ; died three months later .
Sent to many different units in the interim .
Incredible equipment , well - trained and caring people ; but system failure and break - down .
5:13 Specialization ; nature of health care system is that is not designed but it is tampered with .
In the modern hospital , well - informed specialists , but lack of a generalist -- someone in charge of the whole patient .
Family members end up playing the role of general advocate .
The specialization we observe is not particularly healthy and is not perhaps what we would observe in a less - interventionist system .
Hammergren and Harkins ' book quote : Doctors trained as individuals , rewarded for outcompeting classmates and colleagues , taught to be skeptical of others .
Does n't lend itself to team - oriented behaviors .
Do n't need team for broken leg or strep throat .
Complex patients such as those with diabetes or late stage cancers do .
Spontaneous order , corporate order , breakdown of order .
Gas station example : lots of people , still no wait , got gas .
Not a breakdown of order as in the late 1970s .
Find order on Public Choice Theory , could go to Concise Encyclopedia of Economics , David Henderson , ed. planned that ( corporate order ) .
Wikipedia , Google , unplanned ( spontaneous order ) .
In health care , the complexities are overwhelming the spontaneous order .
Body is a complex system .
Hayek observation : by spontaneous order we do n't mean a world with no planning -- planning often takes place within corporate structure -- the question is who does the planning .
In the U.S. we 've put up barriers that make it hard for the corporate order to work .
Feedback mechanisms make it so that you do n't get lemonade from the pump at the gas station -- could sue them , they could go out of business .
In hospital , no feedback if as a result of one specialist curing a heart attack he gives the patient an infection .
15:33 Simple business process level : people who have been in a business world .
Freddie Mac -- buys mortgages from lenders and issues securities .
Regional staff would sign contracts .
Years later it would turn out that Freddie Mac was supposed to receive a lot of money , but only the regional staff knew .
Ordinary business fixes this or the company goes out of business .
Felt by company though not the customers ; if customers feel it , they go somewhere else .
In health care , a business consultant would suggest all kinds of reorganizations , process changes , etc. that would produce better outcomes .
Why does n't this happen ?
This problem is relatively new .
Patients are older and there are more often multiple causes .
[ Podcast taped June 18 , Tim Russert passed away from a heart attack a few days ago . ]
Diabetes ; chronic illness ; more things people expect to be treated for -- child does n't sit still at school .
Lone wolf or specialized doctor , though , has n't changed .
Need for more team - oriented approach with patient at center .
Skyscraper has architect and project manager .
That role is missing in health care .
Could just be it's really hard .
Making a car is a complex process ; it 's become a more team experience with a goal of preventing defects .
Washington U. , St. Louis , excellent , research hospital , Chuck Knight , head of Emerson , emergent not top - down corporate culture .
Why is it that when you walk into a hospital today as an elderly person you do n't get an advocate - - a shepherd ?
Family member plays that role but is emotional and does n't know the hospital structure .
Maybe it's not productive or too expensive , patients wo n't pay for it .
Tradition is that a doctor should be in charge .
Would be very resource costly .
Who pays for it ?
Hospital administration consists of people making sure the hospital gets paid : Medicare or private insurance .
Customer is Medicare or the customer .
Medicare , Washington , DC , has other goals , does n't think .
Pay for performance : define what 's a good outcome and good procedures and reward hospitals and doctors for doing that .
Reporting problem .
Father 's death certificate lists esophageal cancer .
But he probably died of infections .
Hospital did n't want to get dinged .
Reports get manipulated when you try to manage from a long distance .
27:24 Political and economic interface : moral quandary .
Want people to be taken care of but the political process , either via the electorate or by special interests , we 've moved into an imperfect system .
How do you get from there to , say , a second - best , more effective solution ?
Basic moral quandary of health care : we instinctively want it to be free but we understand that the providers need to be paid .
Moral repugnance to charging someone money if he is in distress .
Usury laws developed from this .
Set up a layer of insulation .
In industrialized world , health care spending paid for by other parties .
Here about 40 % government .
Patient is not the customer for that portion .
Goal : remove some of that insulation .
Lasik surgery , typically not covered by insurance or welfare programs ; Lasik has gotten cheaper and better , profit motive , self - paid , advertising .
Does n't seem to be a powerful model that people have noticed has worked .
Also : doctors are kings in the current system ; main focus politically is to make sure they get paid .
One excuse people give for health care being different is that it is complex .
Computers are also complex ; there are devices that work -- competition , brand names , review articles .
Could work in health care but we do n't use them , not paying for it .
Neat to see how resistant people are to the notion of paying for health care .
A lot of the health care services we buy , such as Lasik or colonoscopy screening , are not in moments of distress .
Elective .
Even in distress you have more choices about how it can be dealt with .
Temptation to say health care demand curve is vertical .
People put off colonoscopy screenings because they are unpleasant ; turned out for Russ to not be so horrible , took pills not liquid .
Is it imaginable to get to a different world ?
Bootlegger and Baptist problem .
A lot of general propaganda saying that good health insurance covers more .
Economist would say it should cover less , just catastrophic insurance .
39:54 The uninsured .
You hear that they are at risk .
Employer - provided health insurance is unraveling , huge wage differentials , people who are healthy leave to become consultants and have more take - home pay .
Medicare , bankrupt .
Enormous structural deficits forecast as population ages .
Not much of a crisis in the sense that we 'll do something different - - lower benefits , raise tax rates .
The problem that looms is the political fight .
Stein 's Law : something can't go on forever .
Health care spending rising relative to GDP has to stop eventually if only on arithmetical impossibility .
Longevity is going up .
Most tempting way to resolve it is to keep clamping down on reimbursements to doctors under Medicare .
Net result is doctors are leaving the system .
Headed toward a two - tier system .
Question of how we get there .
People who use the government funds get poorer choices , fewer doctors ; others pay more and more and have more choices .
Medicare is government program deals with the elderly ; Medicaid deals with the non-poor elderly .
46:02 Most doctors do n't feel like kings .
Disillusioned , angry , bitter .
Medicare bureaucrat or lawyer suing them is the king .
Hammergren and Harkins ' book quote : Average physician statistics , burdensome system for doctors .
Why is it that we do n't have this shepherd or project manager in charge ?
Doctor does n't want to give up control .
Have to reconcile their desire to have a more sensible workload with the need to be in control , allow others to be in charge of , say , prescriptions .
Could have a doctor who is more of a generalist .
Everyone is within his own silo , his own unit .

Why You Should Check Your Credit Regularly
What ’s the big deal about credit scores ?
Since credit scores are recognized as predictors of future bill paying ability , the better your rating , the more financing options and terms that are made available to you : just think of all the situations your score enters the picture :
Who Checks On Your Credit ?
What Your Credit Score Affects Lenders Bank loans : a home mortgage , car loan , credit card , business loan are all much more expensive with poor credit .
You ’ll get faster credit approval with good credit .
Insurers Auto insurance premiums and rates , home insurance rates .
A good score can be responsible for lowering your premiums by 31 % than what it would normally be .
A bad score can raise premiums by 143 % .
Landlords
Your credit rating can be an indicator of how prompt you are about paying the rent .
Employers 35 % of employers check up on you to make sure your focus is on your job and not on your financial problems .
Utility Providers
Cell phone providers and other agents may offer less than optimal plans and rates to those with poor credit .
This way , providers manage the risk of payment default by customers .

So it ’s clear why we ’d want to stay on top of our credit profile : the more we know about it , the better we can manage it .
What ’s interesting is that informal polls have shown that almost half ( 49 % ) of those polled did not know the significance of these scores .
Tips On Getting Your Credit Score and Report
There are two elements to your credit profile and rating : your credit report and your credit score .
While credit reports can be obtained for free rather easily , you will typically need to pay for your credit score although free credit scores do exist with some caveats in their usage .
We ’ll expound on this further below .
Some general tips on securing your credit information :
# 1 Start out with free credit reports .
To get a good picture of your credit several times a year , you can order your reports from AnnualCreditReport.com , which is the central , official site from where you can conveniently obtain free credit reports .
# 2 Stagger your free credit report orders .
It ’s wise to stagger out your orders for these free reports so that you get one from each of the three bureaus every 4 months .
However , even though you can do this , you wo n’t get your credit score for free .
Unfortunately , what you get from AnnualCreditReport.com does not include that magic number called your credit score , so you ’ll have to determine whether you need to pay for that extra information .
# 3 Not all credit scores are equal .
Do n’t look now but you probably have many credit scores to your name :
You get a score for each credit bureau that makes the calculation .
Your score changes over time based on your financial habits .
Be aware that some scores used by lenders or insurers are based on estimates so by knowing your real scores , you can make the appropriate corrections and justifications when dealing with these agents .
Credit bureaus do n’t share their data with each other .
Lenders typically check all your scores when large loans are involved .
Just take a look at the various credit scores available to consumers .
The most widely used scores are the FICO scores :
Credit Score
Where To Buy
Range
FICO Score ( TransUnion ) myFICO 300 – 850 FICO Score ( Equifax ) myFICO 300 – 850 FICO Score ( Equifax ) Equifax Score Power 300 – 850 Experian Plus Experian 300 – 850 VantageScore Experian 501 – 990
( letter grade : A – F ) Credit Karma Score Credit Karma 300 – 900
Credit scores are calculated differently by the different credit reporting agencies .
Things can be confusing here since Credit Karma , TransUnion and Experian use their own proprietary algorithms while Equifax uses the most widely used credit score formula ( from Fair Isaac Corp or FIC ) called “ FICO ” .
The numbers themselves may not be equal but they may source the same credit report as the basis for their calculations :
Perhaps the most obvious difference among the scores is their ranges .
For example , Equifax uses FICO ’s credit - score range , from 300 to 850 .
But TransUnion uses a range from 400 to 925 ( I ’ve also seen it reported as between 150 and 934 ) , and Experian scores are reported with a range of 330 to 830 .
A FICO credit score of 790 from Equifax translates to a score of 868 from TransUnion and to a score of 776 from Experian .
But consumers could count on roughly equivalent scores so long as the underlying data on file with each credit - reporting agency are essentially the same .
Let me clarify that we ’re discussing proprietary TransUnion and Experian scores here , which you get by visiting the TU and Experian sites independently .
In actuality , FICO scores based on TransUnion and Experian credit reports do exist as well , which are scores that are calculated using the FICO formula .
You can find these scores in our table above .
If you ’re still confused , here is how to think of these scores :
Equifax score is strictly a FICO score .
It ’s available at myFICO .
TransUnion score can be proprietary if the TU non-FICO formula is used to calculate it .
But it ’s based on your TU credit report .
This may be available at the TransUnion site .
TransUnion score can be FICO if the FICO formula is applied to your TU credit report .
This is available at myFICO .
Experian score can be proprietary if a non-FICO score formula is used to calculate it , but it ’s based on your Experian credit report .
This may be available at the Experian site .
An Experian FICO score is no longer available .
Check our update on the Experian credit score and report story for more details .
# 4 Only pay for credit scores you need .
Some of us do n’t want to bother with the variety of scores that are generated in our name .
Some will want to know them all for their peace of mind , particularly to ensure that there are no glaring mistakes in the calculations done by the reporting agencies or to keep an eye out for fraud or ID theft .
At the very least , you ’ll avoid surprises if you get those scores that will be in use for any upcoming transactions you ’ll be involved in .
Lenders are likely to check all your scores if you ’re applying for major loans .
If you care about only one score , then you should stick with a FICO score that ’s available at myFICO .
# 5 Use a FICO score simulator .
It ’s not the real thing , but you can get an approximate idea of your credit rating by trying out a simulator tool like this .
To some degree , it may provide you an indication of your credit - worthiness .
You can also play with some variables to see how certain hypothetical events can affect your credit .
# 6 Watch out for “ Free Credit Score and Report ” scams .
There are other web sites out there that will purport to provide you free credit reports , free credit scores and free credit monitoring , but these are recognized as “ impostor sites ” by the Federal Trade Commission .
Here is what the FTC says about these so - called credit web sites :
Only one website is authorized to fill orders for the free annual credit report you are entitled to under law : AnnualCreditReport.com .
Other websites that claim to offer “ free credit reports , ” “ free credit scores , ” or “ free credit monitoring ” are not part of the legally mandated free annual credit report program .
In some cases , the “ free ” product comes with strings attached .
For example , some sites sign you up for a supposedly “ free ” service that converts to one you have to pay for after a trial period .
If you do n’t cancel during the trial period , you may be unwittingly agreeing to let the company start charging fees to your credit card .
Some “ impostor ” sites use terms like “ free report ” in their names ; others have URLs that purposely misspell AnnualCreditReport.com in the hope that you will mistype the name of the official site .
Some of these “ impostor ” sites direct you to other sites that try to sell you something or collect your personal information .
So be forewarned that in this case , “ free ” most likely will come with a catch .
Why You Should Check Your Credit Regularly
By law , you are entitled to free credit reports from the three credit reporting agencies ( Experian , TransUnion and Equifax ) once per year as dictated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) .
In many situations , that ’s all you ’ll probably need , but some establishments may prefer to review your credit score because it ’s the quick and easy way to gauge your financial standing .
Really , who wants to wade through credit report paperwork when a number can tell all ?
While your credit report is a record of all your credit - related activities , your score is the number that represents your credit health based on your report .
Through secret recipes closely held by the credit bureaus , pages of your credit report data are distilled and boiled down to this one number that ’s so much more convenient to digest and process .
Many businesses like using these scores because these numbers provide a way for the businesses to standardize their payment terms and policies .
THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY LAW .

Finely riding that razored edge between tragedy and comedy , the New York Times reports that not only did the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket lose its three satellites and fail to reach orbit during a recent launch , but it also destroyed the remains of actor James Doohan , best known as the original Star Trek 's Chief Engineer " Scotty . "
The actor 's ashes -- as well as those of over 200 others -- were being carried into orbit by the rocket when complications with the ship 's stage separation led to the ( assumed ) destruction of the craft .
This recent mishap puts a sad period on the end of the sentence that already included an earlier loss and eventual recovery of the remains .

Hardware hackers can soon start building their own Linux gadgets with a fresh batch of Lego - like building blocks from Bug Labs .
Bug Labs told The Reg it 's targeting " late September / early October " for a second release of BUGmodules , version 1.3 .
Bug Labs had said earlier this month it hoped for release this week , but also warned at the time things could slip .
Version 1.3 will see completely new modules offering GSM , WiFi and ZigBee wireless - along with an upgrade to the existing BUGbase unit that these and existing modules plug into .
The BUGbase is also adopting SD flash memory to provide capacity at a low price .
Blogged about and expected is a new build system - Poky replacing Linux Target Image Builder ( LTIB ) .
Poky is based on Open Embedded , which offers a large package library for those building systems on Bug Labs .
The Bug Labs team had tested the JamVM virtual machine as part of a move off phoneME mobile stack , but is sticking with PhoneME for the moment .
During a recent interview , Bug Labs member Ken Gilmer told us the plan is to supply a larger number of devices than it did during this spring 's first release , as these had quickly sold out .
Bug Labs is not saying how many units it sold then or how many it plans this time .
Gone , baby , gone : the first generation of Bugs
Bug Labs launched its initial modules with a view to letting people build their own hardware with a mix - and - match architecture .
Some have seen this as paving the way for DIY consumer gadgets , as the family included a monitor , digital camera , GPS receiver and motion detector .
While the hardware is fairly basic - and a world away from a finished consumer product - Gilmer said they have encouraged experimentation .
Gilmer claimed strong interest among those in academia and vertical sectors , and people using Java and the modular OSGi architecture .
The new batch is designed to reach a broad number of people including those working in web services and kernel development .
" We are trying to embrace a lot of people at the same time , " Gilmer said .
" In the Java world , people get it .
Most of the interest is at the Linux layer " . ®
Sometimes when I think about what to cook for dinner , my brain hurts .
There are just too many factors to consider , including : what ’s in the pantry , what I feel like , what needs to be used up , what my picky husband will actually touch , what I would actually prefer .
This is a result of living in a country where our choices and options regarding food are so mind - bogglingly vast for many of us .
It ’s terribly easy to fall into a rut of only eating five or six different dishes that you know you ’ll like , but that can get so tiring .
So what ’s a conscious cook to do when looking for fast , healthy , meal ideas ?
Find out , after the jump …
Your best bet is turning to the Web .
They do n’t call it the information superhighway for nothing .
But that superhighway has millions of cars .
Where to even begin ?
Thanks to StumbleUpon and my own obsession with food websites , I ’ve found four great resources to turn to when ideas ( and patience ) run dry .
They run the gamut from exhaustive lists to tools that will help you make something out of practically nothing .
SuperCook .
If you have n’t found this already , you ’re probably looking for it .
Type in what you ’ve got in the fridge and pantry , it spits out a list of recipes you can make .
There are a few of these out there ; I think this one ’s the best , because it ’s super user - friendly .
It even breaks up the generated recipes into courses .
This is a must - have for the home cook ’s online bookmarks .
The Urban Vegan ’s 101 Lists .
Even if you ’re not vegan , you ’re here at EatDrinkBetter , which leads me to believe you ’re open to meatless meals , no ?
Phildelphia ’s Urban Vegan is a meal - concept machine .
She ’s generated three unbelievable lists of 101 fast vegan meals for fall , summer , and picnics .
Seriously , I have no idea how she does it , but adapt her lists , and you ’ll easily be able to answer the question “ So what can a vegan eat ? ” Food Network .
I love the Food Network .
I really do .
But as little as two years ago , trying to find either healthy or meatless meals was darn near impossible .
I felt like I do when I go to restaurants where the only vegetarian option is the ubiquitous portabello sandwich : healthy , meat - free meals are an afterthought .
No longer .
They now have a vegetarian - friendly section that looks like they actually put time and effort into it .
They even have a < gasp > vegan section .
Real Simple Food .
There are several good things about Real Simple–mainly , that everything in the magazine is available online for free , along with exclusive online content .
In addition , their recipes ( of which there are tens of thousands ) mostly use whole foods ( i.e. real ingredients ) but are usually time - friendly for those in a hurry .
As far a comprehensive resource , Real Simple is the way to go for tips , lists , tool , and especially time - friendly recipes .
Add these four websites to your bookmarks and click away when fresh meal - planning ideas are few and far between .

Zimbabwe , torn by political and social strife , is the least happy , while the world ’s richest nation , the United States , ranks 16th .
Overall , the world is getting happier , according to the U.S. government - funded World Values Survey , done regularly by a global network of social scientists .
It found increased happiness from 1981 to 2007 in 45 of 52 countries analyzed .
“ I strongly suspect that there is a strong correlation between peace and happiness , ” said Ronald Inglehart , a political scientist at the University of Michigan ’s Institute for Social Research , who directed the study .
And , said Ingelhart , there is a strong correlation between happiness and democracy .
“ Denmark is the happiest country in the world in our ratings , ” Inglehart said in an audio statement released by the National Science Foundation , which paid for the analysis .
“ Denmark is prosperous -- not the richest country in the world but it is prosperous . ”
Puerto Rico and Colombia also rank highly , along with Northern Ireland , Iceland , Switzerland , Ireland , the Netherlands , Canada and Sweden .
“ Though by no means the happiest country in the world , from a global perspective the United States looks pretty good , ” Inglehart said .
“ The country is not only prosperous ; it ranks relatively high in gender equality , tolerance of ethnic and social diversity and has high levels of political freedom . ”
The survey , first done in 1981 , has kept to two simple questions :
“ Taking all things together , would you say you are very happy , rather happy , not very happy , not at all happy ? ”
And , “ All things considered , how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days ? ”
Writing in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science , Ingelhart ’s team said they have surveyed 350,000 people .
“ Ultimately , the most important determinant of happiness is the extent to which people have free choice in how to live their lives , ” Inglehart said .
JOINs are expensive and it most typical the fewer tables ( for the same database ) you join the better performance you will get .
As for any rules there are however exceptions 🙂
The one I ’m speaking about comes from the issue with MySQL optimizer stopping using further index key parts as soon as there is a range clause on the previous key part .
So if you have INDEX ( A, B ) and have a where clause A BETWEEN 5 and 10 AND B=6 only the first part ( A ) of the index will be used which can be seriously affect performance .
Of course in this example you can use index ( B, A ) but there are many similar cases when it is not possible .
I have described couple of solutions to this problem – using IN list instead of range or UNION which however require rather serious application changes and also can result in huge IN lists and suboptimal execution for large ranges .
Lets take a look at very typical reporting query which queries data for date range for multiple of groups ( these can be devices , pages , users …. etc )

As you can see from the EXPLAIN this query is expected to analyze over 300.000 of rows which is relatively fast for this ( in memory ) table but will become unacceptable as soon as you get to do random disk IO .
Note this is also interesting case of EXPLAIN being wrong – it shows key_len=7 which corresponds to the full key while only first key part is used .
Let us now replace the range with IN list in this query :

So we get same result but approximately 50 times faster .
In this report we had just one month worth of data – what if you would have a year ?
5 years ?
What if you get say thousands of groups at the same time ?
Performing such query MySQL has to build ( and do lookups ) for all combinations which is 31*10=310 in this case .
But if it gets to hundreds of thousands this method starts to break ( and newer MySQL versions will stop using this optimization method if there are too many combinations to check ) .
Instead you could use JOIN to get list of days matching range from some pre-generated table and use the join to retrieve the rows from original table :

As you can see it does not work while I know I used exactly this trick to optimize some nasty queries .
It looks like equality propagation is working here ( note the number of rows for second table in join is estimated same in original query ) and we get the range clause on “ info ” table instead nested loops join – exactly what we tried to avoid .
It is easy to block equality propagation by using some trivial function :
mysql > explain select sum( events ) from info , dl where myday between ' 2007 - 01-01 ' and ' 2007 -01 - 31 ' and d=date ( myday ) and group_id in ( 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100 ) \ G ***************************

So we stopped equality propagation but now have another problem – for some reason MySQL decides to only do “ ref ” on the date only instead of using range on day and list of groups for each join iteration .
This does not make sense but this is how it is .
I also tried to increase cardinality by having all rows to have different group_id and it still does not work .
The trick however does work if you have just one group_id ( and in this case you do not even need to trick around equity propagation to make it work )
mysql > explain select sum( events ) from info , dl where myday between ' 2007 -01-01 ' and ' 2007 -01 - 31 ' and d=myday and group_id in ( 10 ) \ G ***************************

For original query form with single group_id query was taking 0.95 sec .
The query with BETWEEN range replaced with IN list was instant 0.00 sec same as the query using join with day list table .
So we finally managed to get better performance by joining data to yet another table though why it does not work for multiple group remains question to check with MySQL Optimizer team 🙂
UPDATE : I just heard back from Igor Babaev saying it was designed this way ( because the first component can run through very many values ) .
The second component is simply not considered for range unless it is equality .
You always have something to learn about MySQL Optimizer gotchas 🙂
At the same time I figured out how to make MySQL Optimizer to do what we want to do – Just add yet another table to the join so the info table just has bunch of ref lookups :
mysql > select * from g ; +-----+ | gr | +-----+ | 10 | | 20 | | 30 | | 40 | | 50 | | 60 | | 70 | | 80 | | 90 | | 100 | +-----+ 10 rows in set ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > EXPLAIN SELECT sum( events ) FROM g , info , dl WHERE myday BETWEEN ' 2007-01-01 ' AND ' 2007-01-31 ' AND myday=d AND group_id=g.gr \G ***************************

3D Scanning 101 : Everything You Need to Know about 3D Scanners
The global 3D market currently stands at over $ 3.29 billion .
Scanning , like most 3D technologies , is experiencing a positive reaction in the market .
With these projections expected to increase steadily , the global 3D scanning market seems to be set for greater success in the future .
But how much do you know about 3D Scanning ?
A sizeable number of Americans have no idea how 3D Scanning works .
But do n’t worry .
You are in safe hands .
Do n’t be left out as the world makes strides towards embracing 3D technology .
Read on to learn everything about 3D scanners and their functionality .
What Is 3D Scanning ?
The 3D Laser Scanning technology is a non-contact approach that enables the digital capture of shape of physical objects .
This technology utilizes a line of laser light to accomplish this process in a non-destructive process where the exact size and shape of the image is captured .
The captured information is then used to generate a 3 - dimensional representation .
3D technology is best suited for the measurement of contoured surfaces .
Such models require a massive amount of data to ensure an accurate representation of the actual surface .
Laser 3D scanning is the most commonly used 3D scanning method currently .
Most of the fine details you notice in a representation of an original object are a result of laser light capture .
3D laser scanners can capture and offer representation even for the most complex geometries .
The process involves the conversion of data into a triangulated mesh , which then moves into a CAD model .
The Purpose of a 3D Scan
The need for a 3D scan is to create a 3 model of a real - life object .
You can notice certain critical similarities between a 3D scanner and a camera .
For instance , most 3D scanners have a field of view , which is cone - like ; this is similar to an area of view in a camera .
But the 3D scanner can use the point of view to collect critical distance information about the objects ’ surfaces utilizing this point of view .
But unlike a camera , a scanner requires multiple scans , to produce an accurate representation of the image .
The scans must then come into a point of alignment to ensure the creation of a precise model .
The technology has become an essential tool in many areas of research , such as in the process of site modeling or the freeway design process .
In most recent developments , 3D Scanning is being considered in ongoing preparation for the reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral .
Most engineers also utilize the functionality of 3D Laser scanners in the process of developing geographic information systems .
You may also notice an everyday use of 3D laser scanning in the process of coordinating product design .
The design process also utilizes the use of the 3D Laser scanners to increase the overall accuracy when working with complex shapes .
Some of the most recent application of 3D scanners is in the entertainment industry .
3D scanners are useful in the process of creating movies , video games , and other forms of virtual cinematographic representations in the entertainment industry .
These scanners make the process of building digital 3D models easy and highly accurate .
How 3D Scanning Works
With a clear definition of 3D scanners , it ’s easy to internalize how the process works .
The 3D scanning process is a faster and more natural technique to use when developing a 3D model .
Your purpose in such cases is to recreate a model out of an existing object .
Once you have achieved the desired 3D model , you can then proceed to add any other modifications you may deem as necessary .
The scanner begins by collecting the necessary information .
The scanner captures the images and sends the information to the 3D scanning software to undergo the processing process .
Once the information is received , it is processed to reproduce the 3D Scan .
Most 3D scanners have a unique capturing unit , which then relays the information to the 3D scanning software .
Your devices ’ scanning software then undertakes the process of calculating the measurements of the object to create a 3D scan .
Most of the scanners take one scan at a time of the object .
It would help if you got all the angles to the object first , before merging them into a complete 3D digital model .
If your 3D scanner is advanced enough , it can scan , clean , and combine multiple scans to create an incredible final design of your 3D image .
Once the final model is ready , you can export to other standard file formats that are useful in 3D remodeling .
The models also are compatible with any computer - aided inspection software .
Point Clouds
Once you have gone through the process of 3D scanning , the shape of the object often tends to give the impression of millions of points .
These resulting points are called the point clouds .
The laser moves around and captures the millions of points in a rather fast process .
In some of the most advanced scanners , these points may be as many as 750,000 points per second .
The design also shows incredible levels of precision with an accuracy rate of ±.0005 ″ .
This level of accuracy is the reason the technique has become useful when undertaking reverse engineering .
Over the last few years , laser scanning has become one of the most valuable methods in the reverse engineering process .
3D laser scanners offer highly accurate results and the fastest approach in the acquisition of 3D digital data .
This makes the process of reverse engineering highly dependent on the accuracy of this approach .
Eventually , the CAD model is used to make any necessary corrections on the 3D scans to produce complex solid prototypes .
The 3D Scanners Mechanism
While this may seem a bit technical , the scanner mechanism in most 3D scanners has three different forms of tools .
The first is a carriage system , which works best with flat profiles and shapes .
The second is scanner mechanism , which relates to an articulated arm with rigid bones .
This mechanism is common when probing into crevasses and interior places .
The articulated arm has a higher level of precision in the carriage system .
Finally , a specific scanning mechanism tends to combine both methods in a combination that heightens accuracy and provides fast outcomes .
What Are Some of the Advantages of 3D Scanning ?
Indeed , every technology has apparent pros .
The 3D Laser scanner has notable strengths .
The first is the ability to minimize manual interventions .
You do n’t need to manually dismantle an object to get the exact shape or measurements of such a purpose .
You ’ll also enjoy high levels of precision with a 3D scanner .
This extent of accuracy is observable due to the minimal room for errors notable in the process determining the exact measures .
Most of the users of the 3D scanning technique marvel at the extent of cost reduction they experience with this option .
BY re-designing the objects , it is possible to save on costs and avoid waste .
You may end up saving a considerable amount of money with this option while achieving incredible levels of accuracy .
One of the key reasons most people prefer the use of 3D Laser scanners is due to the level of versatility they present .
Most of the modern scanners are equipped with the necessary capabilities that make them easily compatible with various devices .
You do not have to deal with incompatibility concerns when undertaking the process of re-design .
A critical strength notable in most 3D scanners is the ease of re-design .
You ’ll notice the extent of ease of operation with this technique because of the reduced need to focus on the de-construction of images each time .
Based on these strengths , it is possible to experience greater extents of productivity within the company .
The Future of 3D Scanning Is in Handheld Devices
If you are looking for the latest advancements in 3D Scanning , then you ought to consider handheld laser scanners .
This option introduces an extent of portability that was uncommon when the first 3D scanners came into the market .
Some of the most modern handheld 3D scanners , such as the EinScan Pro 2X series , have a modular design that allows for the capture of the color and texture of the object .
As technology evolves , you ’ll now be able to experience super high - speeds , high levels of accuracy , and finer details in the final results .
Most modern handheld 3D scanners can combine data with passive , visible - light sensors .
These features are critical towards enhancing the capture of surfaces and textures .
The future of 3D Scanning will shift more towards portability and versatility in the future , and a handheld 3D scanner will be at the center of this transformation .
To Stay Relevant , You Must Evolve With Technology
The edge of 3D imaging has changed how many industries and sectors operate .
But with the emergence of 3D Scanning , these shifts are about to become even more appealing .
To be on the safe side , you need to get accustomed to the use of 3D Laser scanning .
It ’s impossible to swim against the tide of technology and make it out successfully .
To remain relevant in your business , it ’s high time you invest in handheld 3D scanners .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The federal government , in what will be its most far - reaching attempt yet to contain the financial crisis , is poised to establish a program to let banks get rid of mortgage - related assets that have been hard to value and harder to trade .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced the framework of the plan on Friday morning .
" The federal government must implement a program to remove these illiquid assets that are weighing down our financial institutions and threatening our economy , " said Paulson .
Many details of the plan remained unclear , but Paulson acknowledged the government would take on " hundreds of billions of dollars " in obligations .
Paulson and other officials expect to work through the weekend with congressional leaders to finalize details .
" We hope to move very quickly - time is of the essence , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . , late Thursday night .
Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said he believes legislation could be acted on next week .
On Friday morning , Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , who is the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee , told CNN that the latest plan from Treasury could cost $ 500 billion .
If so , combined with all the other monies committed by the Federal Reserve and Treasury in the form of loans and investments , that brings the headline figure on their attempts to stem the credit crisis to $ 1.3 trillion .
But that does n't mean that 's the cost to taxpayers .
( Here 's why . )
The announcement on Thursday is the latest stunning turn in an extraordinary six days that have rocked Wall Street .
A widening banking crisis has toppled two major firms - Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch - and prompted an $ 85 billion government loan to stem the sudden collapse of insurance giant American International Group .
Meanwhile , mainstay financial institutions are scrambling to raise cash or find merger partners - because of a freeze - up in lending and sinking investor confidence stemming from a collapse of the home mortgage market .
Talk of plan energizes markets
International and U.S. stock markets soared following news of the large government program on Thursday afternoon .
On Friday morning , U.S. stocks were close to 3 % higher .
The Treasury has been talking about the concept of an agency to take on bad debts of financial institutions " for several months , " a source with knowledge of discussions on the issue told CNN .
There 's precedent for the federal government taking on troubled assets from the private sector .
In the 1930s , the Home Owners Loan Corp. was set up to issue bonds to refinance borrowers .
Then during the S&L crisis Congress set up the Resolution Trust Corp. to sell assets of failed banks .
One way the agency under discussion could work is by setting up bulk auctions to buy mortgage assets from financial institutions .
The auctions would be for set dollar amount purchases .
Companies that want to offload the hard - to - sell assets from their balance sheets bid to sell to the government at a huge discount .
The company willing to sell at the lowest price wins .
The government would then be able to sell the assets back into the market when it wanted .
According to policy research firm the Stanford Group , such a setup would allow the government to refinance borrowers in the loans owned by the government , thereby lowering the risk of their defaulting and eventually boosting the price of the mortgage security in which those loans are packaged .
The agency and auction facility is one that House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd have supported .
Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst at the Stanford Group , said he believes there is bipartisan support for allowing the Bush administration to take short - term action to " get us through the immediate crisis . "
The expectation is that whatever program is decided on would only last through the presidential inauguration .
" You do n't want a program that will last for several years because that would limit what the next administration could do , " Seiberg said .
Candidates to weigh in
On Friday , both presidential nominees are expected to detail their own plans to address the crisis .
Not everyone supports the idea that the government should buy up assets that the market currently can't value and is n't trading .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , on Thursday proposed his own plan that would involve the government providing a cash infusion to financial institutions in exchange for stock in the companies and let the institutions offload their mortgage investments .
Banking consultant Bert Ely is skeptical about the government getting involved at all .
If the government chooses to " prop up the institutions or allows the institutions to offload asset onto a government entity , who 's going to take the losses ?
It 's financial insanity .
The markets have to clear .

Nelson Mandela was South Africa 's first post - apartheid - era president
US President George W Bush has signed a bill removing Nelson Mandela and South African leaders from the US terror watch list , officials say .
Mr Mandela and ANC party members will now be able to visit the US without a waiver from the secretary of state .
The African National Congress ( ANC ) was designated as a terrorist organisation by South Africa 's old apartheid regime .
A US senator said the new legislation was a step towards removing the " shame of dishonouring this great leader " .
' Rather embarrassing '
Under the legislation , members of the ANC could travel to the United Nations headquarters in New York but not to Washington DC or other parts of the United States .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had called the restrictions a " rather embarrassing matter that I still have to waive in my own counterpart , the foreign minister of South Africa , not to mention the great leader Nelson Mandela . "
South Africa 's apartheid government banned the ANC in 1960 , imprisoning or forcing into exile its leaders .
Mr Mandela , who turns 90 this month , was released in 1990 after spending 27 years in prison .
He then became the country 's first post - apartheid - era president , before retiring after serving one term in office .
Problem : Let .
Show that in .
If the notation is unfamiliar to you , read up on tensor products of modules .
What we are doing here is forming a - module comprised of sums of symbols of the form , where , subject to the condition that the map be - bilinear , that is , linear in each variable and satisfying for all .
It is possible to show that two different symbols represent the same element of .
A basic example is .
This illustrates an important thing about tensor products : in general , it is easy to prove that elements are equal and difficult to prove that they are not equal .
As in the previous article , the solution here is to approach this computation obliquely , through the universal property of tensor products , which we will describe briefly for commutative rings .
Suppose that is a commutative ring and and are - modules .
Then the tensor product is universal in the following sense : let be any - module and an - bilinear map .
Then there is a unique - module homomorphism such that the following diagram commutes :
( again , apologies for the poor diagram )
Here is simply the map .
This suggests a general line of attack for our problem : to construct a bilinear map from to some - module that maps and to different elements .
One failure would be to define by .
This map is - bilinear , but it does n’t distinguish between these two elements .
A better choice is , which sends to , and to .
By the universal property above , it follows that there exists a homomorphism such that and , and it follows that .
A mistake that I used to make when working with tensor products was to try to define homomorphisms like this directly .
In a proof you might write “ Define by . ”
But this is incorrect ; we do not know a priori that this is a real definition , that is a well - defined map .

Eighteen sailors on a Royal Navy warship have tested positive for a class A drug , the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) said today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The crewmen were caught during routine testing onboard HMS Liverpool , which is currently deployed in the South Atlantic .
An MoD spokeswoman said the drug involved was cocaine and internal disciplinary action was being taken against the 18 .
The drug bust is believed to be the biggest in the Navy 's history .
It comes after five soldiers from the King 's Troop Royal Horse Artillery were dismissed for taking cocaine - and eight from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers were found to have traces of cocaine and cannabis during a compulsory drug test in July .
HMS Liverpool is a Type 42 destroyer whose duties in the South Atlantic have included combating drug smuggling .
The MoD spokeswoman said the test had been carried out after the crew had a " run ashore " on a break in Brazil .
She said : " The Royal Navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is underway against all 18 individuals .
" Notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously , it has not affected the ship 's ability to do its job .
" These results must be understood in context .
Tests show that drug misuse is almost 20 times more common in civilian work places than it is in the Navy .
Positive test rates in the Navy last year averaged less than 0.4 per cent , compared with over 7 per cent in civilian workplaces .

" We are not complacent though and our compulsory drug tests will continue to expose those few that let the rest down . "
She continued : " The UK Ministry of Defence conducts Europe 's largest compulsory drug testing programme and this has significantly reduced drug misuse among service personnel . "
A senior Royal Navy source told The Sun : " The worst aspect of this scandal is that HMS Liverpool is supposed to be guarding the Falkland Islands and such a large drugs bust hardly does wonders for confidence .
" The idea of a coked - up rating on board a warship with access to such powerful weapons does not bear thinking about .
This is a total embarrassment for the senior service . "
MIT is in a twisted , propeller - capped knot this morning heralding a new discovery it says will unleash a solar revolution .
However , the " revolutionary leap " inspired by photosynthesis is not on the glamorous front - end of energy collection , rather , it 's related to a simple , highly efficient and inexpensive way to store that energy when the sun does n't shine .
" This is the nirvana of what we 've been talking about for years , " says Daniel Nocera , MIT neomaxizoomdweebie who with Matthew Kanan developed the unprecedented approach to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases using the sun 's energy .
The gases can then be recombined later inside a fuel cell .
The key components to the process are a pair of catalysts ( one consists of cobalt metal , phosphate , and an electrode ; the other , platinum ) which produce the O and H gases at room temperature and in neutral pH water ( i.e. , tap water ) .
While similar solutions exist for industrial use ( primarily ) , these are very expensive and require specialized environments .
" This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind , " said James Barber , a leader in the study of photosynthesis at Imperial College in London .
" The importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem . "
Nocera concedes that further engineering is required to commercialize the approach but hopes to see it implemented in household fuel cell systems within the next 10 years .

How would you like your environmental degradation ?

Whether it 's pesticides and fertilizers leaching out of croplands or marine fish stocks vanishing by the boatful , every food purchase carries increasingly visible ecological costs .
Against this backdrop , a growing cadre of academics , farmers and aquaculturists is working to refine and popularize a technique that could slash those costs for both fish and vegetable products .
The technique , dubbed " aquaponics , " integrates fish farming and hydroponic agriculture in a sort of closed , symbiotic loop — the fish serve as fertilizer factories , the plants as water purifiers .
The idea is to maximize food production while minimizing environmentally taxing inputs and potentially polluting outputs — a sustainable approach to growing healthy food .
At Cabbage Hill Farm in Mount Kisco , N.Y. , a sizable aquaponic greenhouse offers an established proof of concept .
Slide Show : Take a Guided Tour of the Cabbage Hill Aquaponic System .
Six cylindrical tanks ranging in size from 1,000 to 3,200 gallons ( 3,785 to 12,100 liters ) line the north side of the building , each home to hundreds of edible fish such as bass or tilapia .
As the fish respire , their gills excrete ammonia into the water .
Ammonia is a normal metabolic by - product but is toxic in sufficient concentrations , so it must be removed to keep fish healthy .
The key to aquaponics is that this waste is put to good use :
In a churning bioreactor resembling a giant blue cauldron , ammonia - laden water drawn from the nearby tanks is processed by colonies of two helpful bacteria , Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter .
The former turns ammonia into nitrite , which the latter then converts to nitrate , a potent fertilizer .
By using fish excretions to feed plants , " you do n't have to buy all these fertilizers that are made from petroleum products and that take energy " to produce and transport , says agricultural scientist James Rakocy of the University of the Virgin Islands ( UVI ) , a longtime proponent of aquaponics who has a demonstration facility at his institution .
" Our fertilizer would be a waste product ; instead we 're using it to grow plants . "
Growing food crops at Cabbage
Hill takes place in long , shallow tubs on the south side of the greenhouse , which are filled with newly nutritious water from the bioreactor .
On so - called rafts ( repurposed polystyrene insulation panels ) floating in the tubs , basil , bok choy and lettuce plants grow hydroponically — that is , without soil — their bare roots dangling through holes in the rafts to draw nutrients directly from the water below .
Stripped of its nitrate , the water is ready for return to the fish tanks , having essentially been filtered by the roots of fast - growing , edible , high - value plants .
Cabbage Hill 's resident aquaponic guru , Kevin Ferry , views the process as an extension of natural nutrient cycles .
" All we 're doing is speeding up nature — the bioreactor is just composting , " he says , comparing the churning aeration inside the cauldron with the turning of a compost pile .
As with any attempt to accelerate or enhance nature , aquaponics has costs and complications .
During a tour of Cabbage Hill 's facility , Ferry stops frequently to tinker with the systems — tossing handfuls of feed into a tilapia tank , adding lime to the bioreactor to bring up the water 's pH ( reduce its acidity ) , dipping his fingers into a bass tank and tasting the water to gauge its salt content ( about eight parts per thousand , his taste buds register ) .
" A place like this can't be left alone for very long , " he acknowledges .
Behind the building , a biodiesel generator and waste vegetable oil boiler , both dormant during the summer months , attest to the aquaponic system 's thirst for energy — the pumps , filters and bioreactor run year - round at a sometimes deafening whir , and the winter brings a need to heat the tanks and power overhead lights , as well .
These demands make it tough to compete with foreign and industrial - scale aquaculturists on the metrics of price and size alone .
( Luckily , the fast - growing vegetable crops are the primary moneymaker . )
Cabbage Hill 's customers are mainly local restaurants and markets that prize what Ferry refers to as " farm - to - table " relationships .
" These systems are fairly expensive , " Rakocy notes .
" So you have to raise really high - value crops and look for niche markets . "
Rakocy has sought to drive down the price of aquaponics by developing projects that run on waste energy .
UVI was part of a consortium that , with the help of a $ 150,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2001 , built a landfill gas–powered aquaponic facility at Rutgers University 's EcoComplex , a research center at the Burlington County , N.J. , landfill .
" In the future , " he says , " I could see aquaponics setups ringing landfills , " mining their waste gas to produce food .
Even in its present energy - hungry state , Rakocy points out , aquaponics has an advantage in the preservation of another precious resource : water .
Much of the irrigation water in traditional agriculture runs off the soil or evaporates before it reaches the roots .
In a recirculating aquaponic setup , by contrast , " the plants just take what they need , and the rest stays in the system and goes back to the fish , " he says .
In fact , the UVI system is so efficient that its occasional losses are entirely replenished by a rainwater catchment system , Rakocy adds .
Martin Schreibman , a biologist at Brooklyn College in New York City and an advocate for urban aquaculture , concedes that aquaponics poses myriad challenges but , like Rakocy , he sees the tank as half full .
" Every revolution had its own problems : the Industrial Revolution , the Green Revolution , the agricultural revolution , " he says .
" Now the blue revolution that people are talking about , sure it has problems , but you can get around them .
I think these are problems that are resolvable . "
In fact , Schreibman adds , adopting aquaponics near population centers could present solutions to other intractable problems .
" Natural fish stocks are all depleted , we have problems with tainted food coming in from abroad , we have unemployment here , we have a bad economy , " he says .
" This kind of urban aquaculture and urban aquaponics addresses these questions . "
Schreibman notes that criticism of the energy requirements for aquaponics plays down " the energy that 's used boating something from China or flying it up from Ecuador , " two of the primary importers of seafood into the U.S.
" So it 's a trade - off .
We 're not trucking it miles . "
As fuel prices for imports rise and more and more environmental issues linked to food production come to light , the level of interest in aquaponics is " increasing astronomically , " Rakocy says .
He leads a short course at UVI on aquaponic methods , for which he says attendance has more than doubled from 33 to 73 students in the past three years .
" This year we had to reject a bunch of people , " Rakocy says .
" I 've been getting so many inquiries saying , ' Put me down on the waiting list for next year . ' "

The magnitude 5.2 earthquake that rocked the Midwest on Friday was felt from Kansas to Georgia , and aftershocks could continue for months at this strange seismic zone at the nation 's center and even trigger another big quake , a geophysicist said .
The quake occurred on a northern extension of the New Madrid fault , about 6 miles north of Mt. Carmel , Ill .
The New Madrid fault was responsible for devastating quakes in the Mississippi Valley in 1811 and 1812 .
So the Friday quake and its aftershocks likely are raising the blood pressure of some residents and scientists .
For decades , scientists have debated whether and when the underlying fault could generate another temblor of similar and deadly strength .
" I think we saw a window to this possibility today in the Wabash Valley , " said geophysicist Allessandro Forte of the Université du Québec à Montréal , who has studied the region 's seismicity .
" It 's to the north of the New Madrid seismic zone , but given the strength of crust , the stress can be distributed great distances .
It 's not clear if we could see something in the next few years or even next few months , I would say . "
The last earthquake in the region to approach the severity of Friday 's temblor was a 5.0 magnitude quake that shook a nearby area in 2002 , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
An event actually surpassing today 's magnitude last occurred in 1968 , a magnitude 5.3 quake that was felt in 23 states , said Forte .
The magnitude scale is logarithmic so a change of 0.1 or 0.2 makes a big difference in terms of energy output .
The 1968 event was felt in Ontario and Boston .
" The $ 64,000 question is what this earthquake portends for the future , " Forte said .
" The answer is I 'm afraid it can go either way . "
Stress relief or hair trigger ?
One scenario predicts that some stress is relieved on the local faults where this earthquake occurred and will cool things down for a few decades .
The other scenario is not so happy .
" There is the possibility , and we can only see over next few months what will happen , that the redistribution of stress on neighboring faults might trigger further earthquakes , and we can only guess as to whether they 'll be equally large as today 's earthquake , " Forte said .
Aftershocks from the Friday quake will continue for several weeks , maybe months , he said .
Already , there have been many , of magnitudes in the range of 2 and 3 , radiating outward from the epicenter .
" If we are seeing a propagation outward of stress changes after today 's 5.2 , which was a big one , and those stress changes finally come up on a fault which is on a hair trigger and ready to go , those small changes are sufficient to generate another big one on a fault which is locked and ready to go , " Forte said .
How much risk ?
Recent estimates have downgraded the risk of a large earthquake on the New Madrid fault .
In the 1980s , scientists said there was a 90 percent chance of a magnitude 6 or 7 temblor occurring in this area within the next 50 years .
A 2007 USGS fact sheet , however , said there is only a 25 percent to 40 percent chance of a magnitude 6 or larger there in the next 50 years .
However , a team that includes Michael Ellis of the University of Memphis estimated in 2005 that the odds of another 8.0 event in the region within 50 years are between 7 and 10 percent .
These debates about the New Madrid fault are far from resolved , Forte said , with some saying the accumulated stress in area faults is weakening while others say it is not going to dissipate any time soon .
" This is not exactly a well - defined science as yet , " he said .
Forte is part of the latter camp , based on his research on an ancient , giant slab of Earth called the Farallon slab that started its descent under the West Coast 70 million years ago and now is causing mayhem and deep mantle flow 360 miles beneath the Mississippi Valley , where it effectively pulls the crust down an entire kilometer ( .62 miles ) .
" The stresses from the sinking Farallon slab are not going to disappear any time soon , " he said .
So , apparently , is J. David Rogers in the latter camp .
The geological engineer at Missouri University of Science and Technology says Midwestern earthquakes are potentially more powerful than California quakes .
Shakier situation Unique geology in the Midwest increases the shaking intensity of earthquakes because seismic energy moves through the dense bedrock at very high speeds , then becomes trapped in soft sediments filling river channels and valleys , Rogers said .
Rogers and some of his graduate students have been modeling synthetic seismic events in the New Madrid region .
Most of their scenarios are modeled after an 1895 earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 that was centered in Charleston , Mo .
The preliminary results are sobering , said Rogers .
Data indicates ground shaking would be magnified about 600 percent within the flood plain of the Missouri River , a development that would cause most of Missouri ’s existing long - span bridges to collapse .
" You do n't even need a really big earthquake to do significant damage in Missouri , " Rogers says .
" It could happen tomorrow . "
The relative quake risk of the New Madrid seismic zone is a great debate that might be driven in part by competition for grant money , Forte said .
Those scientists who work on West Coast quakes have an incentive to claim that the research money should be spent on that region , while the central continent - focused researchers obviously are more invested in funds coming their way .
LONDON , July 27 ( UPI ) --
Two former British military officials have not explained why they gave contradictory testimony on the use of torture in Iraq , a parliamentary committee says .
The Joint Select Committee on Human Rights claims former Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram and Lt. Gen. Robin Brims , former commander of British forces in Iraq , did not address its concerns about discrepancies in explanations about whether or when torture was approved for use on Iraqi prisoners , The Observer reported Sunday .

The committee also said Britain 's defense minister blocked its inquiries by refusing to explain why such senior figures appeared to be unaware of whether or not torture techniques may have been officially sanctioned , the British newspaper said .
" We have yet to receive an explanation from the MoD for the discrepancies in evidence given to the committee by Ingram in 2004 and Lieutenant General Brims in 2006 on the use of these illegal conditioning techniques , " committee Chairman Andrew Dismore said .

News Federal Cannabis Patient to Lead Medical Marijuana March Elvy Musikka Arrives for Wednesday March to Protest Federal Government 's Threat to Close Santa Barbara Dispensaries
At noon on Wednesday , August 27 , dozens of medical marijuana patients and proponents are expected to gather at the dolphin statue near Stearns Wharf and walk up State Street toward the County Courthouse .
They ’ll be protesting the recent threats by the federal government to punish Santa Barbara landlords who rent to state - and city - sanctioned cannabis dispensaries .
The federal crackdown in Santa Barbara is the latest battle in the long - simmering war over medical marijuana , a state ’s rights showdown in which voters and lawmakers from California and other states have deemed the drug legal for patients but the feds continue to consider it an illicit , medically useless substance .
Leading the charge on Wednesday will be Oregon ’s Elvy Musikka , one of the few Americans provided marijuana by the federal government for medical reasons .
Musikka , who ’s used the ancient herbal remedy to treat glaucoma for more than 25 years , is one of the most compelling cases cited by cannabis - as - cure advocates to show how the drug helps sick people .
And , explained march organizer , dispensary founder , and T - shirt manufacturer Mark Russell on Tuesday , Musikka and her tins full of government - grown marijuana cigarettes are also the best examples to show why the feds ’ crackdown on medical marijuana dispensaries is unwarranted , hypocritical , and harmful to patients .
Musikka brought one such tin – which held 230.74 grams of low - grade marijuana grown by the University of Mississippi and rolled into 300 or so joints – by The Independent ‘s offices on Tuesday , and argued that locally operating dispensaries are the best way for any patient to obtain medical marijuana .
The march comes at a crucial time for dispensaries in Santa Barbara .
Earlier this year , the City of Santa Barbara – whose citizens overwhelmingly voted in 2006 to make all marijuana enforcement the lowest police priority – followed the lead of other California cities in passing an ordinance to accommodate and regulate the numerous medical marijuana distributors that began setting up shop in town a couple years ago .
The shops are deemed legal by California law because in 1996 voters passed Proposition 215 to allow for sales of medical marijuana , a move that was further explained and strengthened by the State Assembly ’s passage of bill 420 in 2003 .
But earlier this month , representatives from the federal Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration met with the owners of buildings that house cannabis dispensaries and threatened to use federal racketeering laws to confiscate the properties if the cannabis dealers were not evicted .
Since then , most if not all of the dispensaries in Santa Barbara have received eviction letters and some are already clearing out .
Then on Monday , August 25 , the state ’s Attorney General Jerry Brown issued an 11 - page legal opinion on the statewide matter , giving guidelines to help California law enforcement and local governments determine which are legal cannabis dispensaries and which are not .
Brown said that he hoped these guidelines would also convince the federal government to stop their crackdowns , telling the L.A .
Times , “ Hopefully the feds will back off in instances where people are really following these guidelines . ”
But Brown ’s “ road map ” also explained that those dispensaries only in the business solely for profit – and not properly registered as caregiving collectives – are likely breaking the law .
It ’s unclear how that distinction would play out on the streets of Santa Barbara .
Wednesday ’s march takes place amid this ongoing state versus fed battle , and organizer Russell said he sent out a press release to more than 20 different media outlets .
He was hoping for as many as 500 marchers when he announced the march last week , but more realistically expects a number between 50 and 100 .
The protesters , who have promised to be nonviolent and follow traffic laws , will be carrying signs and wearing shirts that say “ I Am Not a Criminal ” on the front and “ No Access Is Not a Solution ” on the back .
They will also be collecting signatures and arranging a text message network to get the word out if the feds do raid a Santa Barbara cannabis club .
That way , Russell explained , the feds will know they ’re being watched if they start raiding state - sanctioned and city - approved dispensaries .
The march starts at noon on Wednesday , August 27 , at the dolphin statue at the foot of Stearns Wharf .

Caught in a wild and gyrating market , crude oil prices briefly returned to triple - digit territory on Thursday , but gave up most of their gains to fall below $ 100 a barrel by the end of the day .
Crude oil futures settled at $ 97.88 a barrel , up 72 cents for the day , after jumping above $ 102 when trading opened on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The rise followed a 6.6 percent jump on Wednesday when panicky investors fled the stock market to seek shelter in the perceived safety of commodities .
After spending six months above $ 100 , oil prices slumped earlier in the week because of concerns that the financial turmoil on Wall Street would slow economic growth and hurt oil demand .
Prices fell to $ 91.51 a barrel on Tuesday , but since then they have made up some of their losses .

Via Outside the Beltway , this McCain joke :
Presidential candidate John McCain , who once sang in jest about bombing Iran , on Tuesday reacted to a report of rising U.S. cigarette exports to the country by saying it may be “ a way of killing ‘ em . ”
McCain , known for acerbic comments and for sometimes firing verbally from the hip , was responding to a report that U.S. exports to Iran rose tenfold during President George W. Bush ’s term in office despite hostility between the two states .
A rise in cigarette sales was a big part of that , according to an Associated Press analysis of seven years of U.S. trade figures .
“ Maybe that ’s a way of killing ‘ em , ” McCain said to reporters during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh .
“ I meant that as a joke , as a person who has n’t had a cigarette in 28 years , 29 years , ” he added , laughing .
I am not going to join in on the McCain bashing being done on this off - the - cuff remark that Joyner highlights in his post ( a charity that right - wing bloggers would not afford the Democrats , I might note , as I observe today ’s manufactured controversy over Obama ’s foreign language remarks ) .
I will observe that had a left - leaning leader of a European nation quipped that “ Europe is going to export as much booze as we can to the United States so they can hopefully drink themselves to death , ” the freakout in certain quarters of the blogosphere would measure on the Richter scale .
Putting aside all that , I will say that I simply do not understand the mentality currently at work .
I understand that the leadership of Iran has said and ( most likely has done ) any number of odious things , and I understand that certain people who have an Israel first policy are going to have particular issues with Iran .
But what I do n’t understand is the apparent personal animus towards all thing Iran that the McCain quip seems to betray .
I have no beef with Iranians , and I thought that was the right - wing position - our agitation was towards the leadership , and if I am remembering correctly , all the rhetoric from Pipes and company was that we needed to aid the Iranian people and their pro-Democracy forces .
Maybe that was then , this is now , and the propagandists now need to paint Iran as a monolithic evil , and the rhetoric has changed .
It sure feels like over the past few months and years we are experiencing a hardening of positions against all things Iranian .
It does n’t make much sense to me .
Insomuch that Iran does things that are threatening , and even assuming they have fomented much of the violence in Iraq , hurting the occupation forces , I do n’t think this is a result of animus towards the United States on the part of the Iranian people , but machinations from the leadership that should have been expected given a large and overtly hostile nation had now projected a bulk of their military power right smack dab on their border .
In fact , I have frequently seen reports stating just the opposite - wherever you go , people LOVE Americans ( or at least they used to when the dollar bought you more than a bottle of water ) , but often times very much disliked American policy and the leadership in government .
Additionally , this sort of attitude does n’t seem to be much of a winner in regards to long - term global policy .
One would think the rising gas prices would clue some people in that there are a helluva lot of nations out there entering into a serious industrial era , and we are , from a population , and pretty soon probably from a military and manufacturing perspective , horribly outnumbered on the global stage .
Not only does blanket belligerence towards other nations seem to be simplistic and unhelpful , it seems downright dangerous .
I am not saying we are no longer a superpower , but I think the forecast is clear - we are n’t the only tough guy on the block anymore , and it might be wise to recognize that .
This is kind of rambling , but I just do n’t get the current mindset , in which it seems like we really are carving out large parts of the world and making them “ the enemy . ”
Certainly there are legitimate threats and certainly there are places where they do hate Americans , but I just do n’t think it is the norm and do n’t see the purpose in the kind of animus McCain displayed in his offhand remark .
Even if it was just a joke .
It sucked .
In this day and age of the internet , free Google 411 and a host of other paperless directory services , what use do the big , fat phone directories serve ?
I do n’t know about you , but when I get those large plastic bags filled with 3lb phone books , I usually put them straight in the recycling bin .
We never use them .
Now a website similar to the National No - Call registry is asking you to sign up and stop receiving these archaic books .
The facts speak loud and clear ; the massive amount of money and resources the phone directory industry sucks up is phenomenal .
This , from YellowPagesGoesGreen.org :
540 million directories are printed annually in the United States .
The average weight of each directory is 3.62 lbs .
1.79 directories are printed for every man , woman and child in the US .
The phone directory industry is worth over $ 13 billion in the US ( that figure doubles to $ 26 billion worldwide ) .
It takes 24 trees to make 1 ton of paper .
It takes over 19 million trees to make half a trillion directories .
It takes 380 gallons of oil to produce that ton of paper ( over 7.2 billion barrels per 500,000,000 books ) .
3 cubic yards of waste are taken up by one ton of paper ( that equates to 1.6 billion lbs per 500,000,000 books ) .
Over 270,000 cubic yards of landfill are taken up per 500,000,000
7,000 gallons of water go into the production of one ton of paper .
4,000 kilowatts of energy are also needed to make that ton of paper ( 3.2 billion KW hours / 500,000,000 books ) .
As a frugal shopper , I deplore waste ( the main image at the top of this article came from someone who spotted DOZENS of yellow pages in their apartment building 's dumpster ) .
And the idea that these millions and millions of directories are being printed so that at least 90 % of us can just put them into the recycling bin , well , that just burns me up .
So much money , so many resources , all for nothing .
Decades ago , there was a need for phone directories .
But that industry needs to face one hard fact ; it is going the way of the dinosaur .
And continually producing these books is merely prolonging the inevitable , but wasting precious time and money in the process .
However , if we all do something about it , maybe we can speed that process up .
Simply click on this link and you ’ll be directed to the opt - out page at YellowPagesGoesGreen.org , where you can opt out of both the yellow and white pages .
The website ’s mission statement is both clear and admirable :
Yellowpagesgoesgreen.org is an organization working to educate consumers and promote the green movement to eliminate the unsolicited delivery of Yellow and White Pages books .
This site is aimed at starting a national movement to solicit the White / Yellow Pages industry to proactively stop the delivery of books or to begin moving legislation to mandate the stoppage of this activity .
This movement should be similar to the National No - Call Registry that have stopped and / or decreased the number of unwanted solicitations telephone calls to consumers .
A college student who was renting a house in Liberty , Missouri founded Yellowpagesgoesgreen.org .
The number of telephone books delivered to the house was overwhelming and the work required to recycle them was daunting .
When he spoke with his neighbors they all told him they just threw them away .
Due to the use of technology , he felt these books were now outdated .
However , he understood that some people may still want them and felt the best way to limit this tremendous waste was to mimic the National No - Call Directory .
Additionally , he wanted this site to serve as a depository for information and educational issues concerning the green movement .
I put my name down this morning ; and unless you have a real need for these books , like in the video below from collegehumor.com , or maybe propping up a young child at the table , so that they can reach their chicken soup , I urge you to do the same .
It 's time to put the phone directories out of their misery .

Americans are asking for Political Asylum ...
Why do n't we hear about it ?
There is no country in the world that understands propaganda more than the United States .
Billions are spent at the Pentagon on what you hear and repeat .
The mainstream news is a psychotronic parade as the democrats bumble and the reporters comment as though they are on the Bush administration payroll .
The truth is not reported .
The public responds as a story of importance makes breaking news only to see it squahed in the next 72 hours .
Americans are asking for political asylum and you are not hearing about it .
The government is torturing American citizens who are Whistleblowers - myspace Darren Gelbard , youtube Monarch Katherine Moore , and DIA Topoff to see electronic warfare torturing a U.S. citizen in 2007 .
Or , for those of you who think these victims are conspiracy theorists , there are the ADS military tests on youtube , 60 Minutes , and CNN .
People being hit out of thin air by a ray beam .
For real !
Weapons that can harm or kill you from a distance , without leaving marks if the operator so desires , are being used on people in their homes .
There are interviews with U.S. citizens who are victims and with a Baghdad surgeon in which he states there are bodies in Iraq he and his team of ten Doctors have seen that are being killed by ...
" No bullets , no shots .. arms cut straight off ... we do n't know what kind of weapon it is . "
A Baghdad Orchestra player also stated he saw bodies where ...
" Only the face was burned , no eyes .. and the teeth .
The rest of the body was untouched .
The Washington Post released an article called Mind Games in which the victims of psychotronics and V2 K described what it was like to have someone mentally and physically torture you using communications and electronic warfare from a distance .
And Russia is trying to ban Space weapons after Congress changed the bill that would have banned psychotronics years ago .
This is the most dangerous game .
Weapons that no individual can defend themselves against .
Weapons that manipulate people .

In 1968 , Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich published The Population Bomb , a synthesis of scientific research and personal observations that offered a disturbing account of a world with too many people and too little food .
The book was a national bestseller .
Now 40 years later , Ehrlich , still at Stanford , and his wife , Anne , have come out with a new book , The Dominant Animal , in which they seek to explain how man 's rapid rise to dominance has spawned a series of interlinked woes : soaring energy demand , agriculture crises , and , above all , environmental degradation .
No longer , the Ehrlichs argue , can these issues be viewed as independent of one another , nor will a single response suffice as a remedy .
U.S. News recently spoke with Paul Ehrlich .
Excerpts :
Energy , food , and environment problems seem increasingly entangled .
We can't talk about one without talking about the others .
Where do we start ?
We 've got to dramatically revise the way people think about the world — and about our cultures .
You can get all the way through Stanford University and still think your food comes from supermarkets .
For example , people do n't understand the involvement of the transport system in agriculture , or the oil connection .
Obviously , there are huge problems with what 's happening to people who live on two bucks a day and can't afford food , but agriculture is also our single most important activity and generates our biggest environmental threats .
We can't go back to hunting and gathering .
We 've got to tackle the population issue , so ever more mouths do n't need to be fed .
There is also a consumption problem .
I just spent four weeks in Africa , and there and all over the world people want to eat the way we do , which of course means more beef and pork and much more production to feed animals .
The so - called new consumers in Asia have been cited as a big factor in the fuel and food crises today .
Who are they ?
People who have a little more money and education have , in China and India particularly , developed very rapidly the same consumptive attitudes as the average American and European .
That 's not necessarily bad :
Who can deny them wanting the stuff we have when we have n't shown the slightest interest in reducing our own impact on the environment ?
In 1972 , I cowrote an op - ed called " What if all the Chinese had wheels ? "
At that time , there were 500 million Chinese , and it looked like one day they might want cars .
Now , we have 1.3 billion Chinese , and we know damn well they want cars ; they 're buying them and manufacturing them .
Some estimates show the world population growing to about 9 billion people by 2050 .
Can the planet sustain that ?
Probably not without disaster .
If humanity put the effort in , we could end up with fewer people then .
We have already seen a trend toward smaller families and actual shrinkage of population in Europe .
It 's not written that everybody has to have huge families .
But in Africa , where the people are poor and have four , five , six kids , it will be tough .
Even the optimistic scenario of population falling to 7.5 billion in 2100 takes us through roughly a doubling of energy use , and energy use is the best single measure we have of damage we do to our life - support systems .
We do n't have a clue if we can hold society together through that .
What if these predictions are off — and population growth continues ?
Population growth will end sooner or later .
The big question is :
Will it end by a huge die - off , or will it end because low birth rates spread in Europe , Japan , and a few other places to the rest of the world ?
The actual limits depend on consumption patterns and technologies available and how environmentally benign they are , and what kind of lifestyle people want to live .
We can't all go back to being subsistence farmers .
We must make decisions about technologies and lifestyle .
If you 're rich , you can by a Van Gogh or you can buy a private jet .
Obviously , one of those consumption decisions has a very different impact on the environment than the other .
But how do you control consumption ?
There are no consumption condoms .
This problem is enormously complex .
What I am convinced of is that it is human behavior we have to change .
The discussion of key issues is limited to a tiny portion of a population .
We need to set up a system to keep these issues on the front burner ... They are all long - term issues .
The politicians , of course , have very little interest in them because solutions do n't give votes for the next election .
You say that our energy supply is adequate .
So what 's the problem ?
We 're not running out of fossil fuels — we 're running out of environment .
We could go a long time if we could just burn up fossil fuels and dump the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
We'd be in good shape at least for long enough to carefully consider our future .
But when you see what 's happening with the climate , you realize we can't do that .
One of my colleagues went to Norway recently .
She said it was horrendous to see global warming actually in action .
Almost all the lakes they used to ice skate across in summer are gone .
Everything is just melted .
We do n't have the time to continue what we 're doing now and hope to change later .
The same holds for the food supply ?
Unless we are extremely lucky , climate change will continuously alter the distribution of precipitation all over the planet .
It 's not that we 're just going to deal the cards once and some farms are going to be better off and others worse off .
Changes in water management will be required over centuries , for instance , switching from rain - fed to irrigation and maybe back .
It 's going to be extraordinarily expensive and disruptive , especially when we have a problem of how to feed ever more people .
Crude oil is at record prices .
What 's the first immediate step on energy ?
You really need an overall energy policy .
We have been reducing our energy research and development budget , not increasing it .
The quickest energy solution is efficiency .
Next is to stop population growth .
If we 'd stopped U.S. population growth in 1945 at half today 's size , guess how much less fuel we would need to buy from the Middle East .
Energy policy is a vast area we are not putting the right kind of thought into .
The whole launch into biofuels was done without any ecological analysis of what the actual climate gains and losses would be or what the environmental impact would be .
Can biofuels even be part of a real solution ?
It 's not necessarily an insane idea .
What was insane was not to very carefully look at it and get some more lead time .
There may be some place in a sensible world for use of biofuels .
It 's not crystal clear .
You hear , well , we 'll just do X and Y in wasteland .
I work in a laboratory in a beautiful mountain valley in Colorado .
All the land is classified as wasteland and could be used for biofuel production , which would just be destroying beauty and biodiversity .
It 's important to understand that when biodiversity is gone , we 're gone , too .
Brazil has a thriving biofuels industry based on converting sugar cane to fuel .
They are also cutting down big chunks of the Amazon .
We do n't know how much of the Amazon you can cut down before the whole thing goes , and what the effect on global climate will be .
Besides the loss of biodiversity , the resulting climate change could basically destroy us , and we 're probably not going to know in the near future until we 've run the experiment and find out .
Recently there 's been chatter about revisiting nuclear power .
Nuclear power , whether you are in favor of it or against it , is not a silver bullet .
It is another very complex issue .
There may be a place in our energy mix for nuclear power .
But it 's not going to solve this complex of problems .
What else might be in that mix ?
We could easily increase efficiency on energy use in buildings and transportation .
Let 's build only coal - fired power plants that can sequester carbon dioxide , or shift away from coal to natural gas and then various solar technologies .
There are lots of things we can do ; no single one of them is going to solve the problem .
You need action at the local level , at the state level , and the federal level , and the international level .
At the federal level , there is gridlock .
How can we speed up progress ?
Elect smart , informed people .
I get the impression that Congress thinks if it promotes wind power , in two years we could be getting 75 percent of our energy from wind .
Actually , we'd be lucky to be getting 10 percent in 30 years .
There is a huge time delay in deploying new energy technologies .
The only way to speed that up is basically to go to a WWII - type commitment .
The Manhattan Project took three or four years , but we put gigantic amounts of effort into it .
We need a Manhattan Project on energy and the environment , but we do n't yet even know what direction to go .
The presidential campaign , so far , has n't offered much guidance . <
Essentially none of this is in the campaign .
Sure , there are occasional statements on candidates ' websites about climate .
But what my colleagues and I are dealing with all the time and are scared witless about are not presidential campaign issues .
It 's sort of a wonderland .
Whatever you think about gay rights and what starlet is n't wearing her panties today , those are not critical issues for most of our society .
The international community is starting work on replacing the Kyoto Protocol , which was intended to decrease greenhouse gas emissions .
The U.S. never ratified it , and other countries have n't upheld their pledges .
Is there any reason to be optimistic this time ?

Armstrong , true to form , seems disappointed he did n’t win the charity race .
“ I did awful , ” he says , crestfallen .
“ But look at Harper .
He ’s in great shape .
He wrote the best Katrina song , ‘ Black Rain . ’
I asked him to play it at the end . ”
Every few minutes , rather healthy - looking women come over to give Armstrong platonic hugs .
“ I ’ve got to get to bed soon , ” he says , almost relieved at the concert ’s end .
“ Up tomorrow before dawn . ”
I ask him what he misses most now that he ’s in monkish training mode .
“ Salsa and chips , ” he says .
“ That ’s it . ”
Two days later , I sit in on an Armstrong workout session in his two - and - a - half - car home garage .
Even with the garage door open , it ’s 100 degrees .
The brown indoor - outdoor carpeting makes the setting seem like Wayne ’s World .
Free weights are all around .
Dressed in baggy green
Nike shorts , Armstrong , shirtless , runs through a sick set of pull - ups , medicine - ball exercises , and crunches , all executed at a rapid pace .
Conversation is clipped with grunts and groans .
I notice a scar on his upper chest where the catheter was inserted during cancer surgery .
The White Stripes are playing on the stereo .
You can feel that music is a fuel to him .
“ From Lyle Lovett to Led Zeppelin , ” he says of his musical tastes .
“ When I ’m in the garage , I put on satellite radio , like adult alternative .
Elvis Costello , great , you can train with that .
The next song might be Bob Dylan , great .
Next song might be Coldplay , great .
Next song might be Foo Fighters , great .…
I ’ve got 4,000 or 5,000 songs on my iPod . ”
Nearby , he has his separate bike garage , where cycles , including kids ’ bikes , hang from the wall in all shapes and sizes .
There ’s also a 1970 black GTO convertible .
He has me pick up a Madone 6.9 black cycle , a custom vehicle for riding around New York .
“ It ’s light as a feather , ” he says , admiringly , lifting it with ease .
“ Weighs about 13 or 14 pounds , due to the carbon - fiber fork . ”
Team Armstrong says their leader is asymmetrically negative ; that is , on a scale of 1 to 10 , if Lance wins the Tour de France , he ’ll only achieve the status of a two or three .
But if he loses , he ’ll be a minus 1,000 .
Worst of all , there is no guarantee that the Tour ’s mandarins at the A.S.O. will allow him to race .
Plagued by doping dilemmas , rider departures , team withdrawals , and chronic bickering between participants , the A.S.O. has become hyper - selective about who races .
If the A.S.O. balks , there ’s no telling how low he ’ll sink .
High on top of his bookshelves , in special alcoves , are his seven blue Tour trophies .
Desperately , he wants an eighth .
And if for some strange reason the A.S.O. does n’t “ invite ” Armstrong and his team to the Tour de France , he plans on pleading his case directly to the current French president , Nicolas Sarkozy .
“ I ’ve already put a call in to him , ” Armstrong says .
“ Look it up .
He ’s said strong things about me in the past . ”
A couple of hours later , I do look it up .
And , sure enough , Sarkozy has praised Lance Armstrong .
Back in 2003 , while serving as French interior minister , Sarkozy commented on how inspired he was that Armstrong had overcome cancer to repeatedly win the Tour de France .
Armstrong ’s courage moved him .
There are about eight million cancer deaths in the world annually , and Armstrong is leading the way to a new consciousness about the disease .
“ If we do n’t applaud and support him , ” Sarkozy once said , “ who should we applaud and support ? ”
“ I fear failure , ” Armstrong admits , during a quiet moment .
“ I have a huge phobia around failure .
And that ’s probably a good thing .
The thought of losing this thing — anything — I mean , it could be the Tour , it could be Proposition 15 .
We ’re down at the state capitol [ and ] these guys are debating it back and forth , amending the bill .
The thing looks like it ’s gonna die .
I mean , the tension was so high .
Doug [ Ulman ] looks at me and goes [ whisper voice ] , ‘ Man , this is fun ! ’
And I said ‘ Doug , it is only fun if we win . ’
And for me , I think a lot of that stems from just the illness and the diagnosis and the process there .
Because failure there is death .
Loss there is death .
And victory is living .
Which people just assume they ’re going to do .
I mean , most people — cancer survivors — do n’t always assume that .
But I was scared .
You know , from that point on , I associated loss with death .
And so I did n’t .
It was burned in my mind forever .
“ I do n’t like to lose in anything .
Anything . ”

Time - traveling to the 1900s and thinking you could buy your favourite t- shirt , a pair of LED shoes for your whining kids , and a bow tie for your kitten at the luxury of your home , would be more than a fantasy .
Tables have turned , seasons changed , bringing out the unthinkable possibilities of online marketing .
A move on your already wired fingers and a munch on that favourite chips of yours is all it takes to go online shopping .
Leisure
This is the biggest perk of all .
Sitting at your cosy cushion and going window shopping through all the online markets is a hell lot of leisure .
The markets never close and are open for both the morning larks and night owls .
With no more queues to tarry along and no cashiers to delay your purchase , online shopping offers you the best of shopping experience .
Diversity of purchase
With more online shopping platforms coming up in the context of the booming prospects , the variety offered is whopping .
You are brought in touch with the global market where you ’re acquainted with the latest trends and leading brands .
You can freely surf through all different collections of items from textiles , jewellery , stationaries , groceries , and whatnot .
This eases you off of the trouble of going from shop to shop to get your things done .
Online marketing also defies the boundaries of geography .
From the bamboo handicraft from Arunachal Pradesh to the intoxicating brew of Assam tea , Mysore silks from Karnataka to the miraculous spices of Kerala are all at your whim .
No compulsions , please .
It would be the experience of every shopper that you end up buying a whole lot more than what you intended in the first place .
In the process of your hunt for that stationary , you end up being persuaded by more than what you intend .
Online shopping dodges this chaos / havoc .
The customer need not be afraid of the luring of salesmen to their vested interests as well .
Ease of discrete purchases
If you are a tight - lipped person on discrete purchase of sleek lingerie , adult toys , and the link , disgusted at those awkward glances at malls and other venues , you are at the right place .
Online shopping offers you the privacy of shopping from home sans judgement .
Save your pennies challenge
With the high competition in the field of online marketing , sellers offer articles with higher quality and lesser prices to ensure the inflow of more customers .
This guarantees the buyer with a good bargain .
You are not therefore fooled by the low quality , discount policies of shopkeepers .
Online purchase also avoids the trouble of middlemen and even evade the higher taxes involved otherwise .
Saving the expense of gas and parking also adds up to the list .
Weigh up the options
Since the window in online marketing is wide open , the possibilities you are offered are also high .
For the same item , different marketing sites offer you alternatives , where the choices are left to the customer and not just be satisfied with whatever a shop offers .
Comparison of price is done by the buyer , pros and cons weighed and the decision is made at their leisure .
What more shopping experience can you be offered ?
Used products at lower rates
For those who prefer using items over brand new ones , there ’s no better niche than the online marketplace .
The customers get listings of all the available pre-owned items and the final condense can be done by the buyer .
Adieu to social phobia
Crowds can be an annoying factor to all peaceful purchasers .
They can get in the way of your shopping experience so much so that you may even lose your tranquility .
All of these epitomizes at the festive seasons when all are out in the streets and markets .
This can hamper your creature comforts .
Time spoilers , hell no !!
Saving time is one of the cornerstones in the consumer world .
When you are running against the clock , you ca n’t afford to lose your time waiting in lines , running around shops , or being slackened by the inert cashier .
All these troubles are saved in the online marketplace .
What more is valuable in this century than the clock .
McCain has no economic experience , other than running 1,000 or so banks into the ground as a result of his Keating Five scandal .
And let ’s not even talk about Sarah Palin taking over America ’s economic crisis should McCain die in office or have to step down should his melanoma return .
So what do you do when you have no economic experience while America faces an economic crisis ?
What do you do when your campaign manager made hundreds of thousands of dollars as a lobbyist charged with keeping regulators away from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the very problem that led to the crisis we face today ?
You lie .
Repeatedly .
And hope no one notices that your inexperience poses a danger to the country :
Obama has said he would raise taxes on people making over $ 250,000 a year and would cut taxes on the middle class .
McCain restated his claim that Obama had voted to raise taxes on people who make just $ 42,000 a year — a claim that has been widely debunked by nonpartisan fact check organizations .
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM :
At a time when the two - child norm of last century is scorned at across the country , the model state of family planning in India is contemplating punishment for couples with more than two children .
The Law Reforms Commission of Kerala headed by eminent jurist Justice V R Krishna Iyer has recommended a penalty of Rs 10,000 and withdrawal of free education and health care for anyone who goes for a third child .
The Church in Kerala has called it an import of the Chinese population policy by the Communist government .
The Kerala Family Planning and Control Bill seeks to promote family planning and birth control as methods of controlling population .
But what has stirred a storm is the suggestion for a penalty on any person who goes for a third child .
A family or person having more than two children should also be denied facilities and advantages like free education , health assistance , facilities for housing and other priorities including employment allowed under schemes or projects of the state , says the Bill .
Clause 7 of the Bill reads , " No person or institution shall use religion , region , sect , caste , cult or other inducements for production of more children than permitted . "
Once the law comes into force , " Any person or a public organization or institution associated with or carrying on the work of family planning and birth control " may approach a court against those found violating the provisions .
Predictably , the proposal has invited sharp reactions from the Church .
Only recently had the Kerala Catholic Bishop 's Council expressed " grave " concern at the fall in the birth rate among its followers .
What perturbed the Church was the swelling number of Muslims vis a vis falling population of Christians and Hindus in the state .

From thehill.com on May 28 , 2008 :
“ Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla . ) said that the House Judiciary Committee would be willing to arrest Karl Rove if the former White House official does n’t testify about his role in the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 . ”
Previously , on the smack - talking channel :
Just off the House floor today [ May 15 , 2008 ] , the Crypt overheard House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers tell two other people : “ We ’re closing in on Rove .
Someone ’s got to kick his ass . ”
Asked a few minutes later for a more official explanation , Conyers told us that Rove has a week to appear before his committee .
If he does n’t , said Conyers , “ We ’ll do what any self - respecting committee would do .
We ’d hold him in contempt .
Either that or go and have him arrested . ”
Conyers said the committee wants
Rove to testify about his role in the imprisonment of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , among other things .
“ We want him for so many things , it ’s hard to keep track , ” Conyers said .
MOST people drink about 2 litres of water a day , but consume 3,000 a day if the water that goes into their food is taken into account .
Rich countries use more as their consumption of meat , which is far more water - intensive than grain , is higher .
Around 1.2 billion people live in places that are short of water , and it is running out in others such as northern China and western America .
Meanwhile , the world 's population is growing and more water will be needed to feed it .
Farming , which accounts for some 70 % of human water consumption , offers the best opportunity for thrift .
Repairing leaks and better irrigation in poor countries could help reduce wastage by up to 70 % , as could switching to less thirsty crops in arid regions .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Amazon.com
Inc has sued the state of New York , challenging a new statute requiring Internet retailers based elsewhere to collect New York sales taxes .
Amazon , the world ’s largest Internet retailer , said in a complaint filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York on April 25 that the new law , passed by the state legislature in early April , was unconstitutional , vague and overly broad .
Through its “ Associates Program , ” the company pays unaffiliated Web site operators around the country a commission if they advertise Amazon on their sites .
Those ads often allow consumers to click through from the advertiser ’s Web site to Amazon.com .
The new law presumes that this amounts to solicitation of business in the state , a claim Amazon denies .
Amazon has no “ substantial ” physical presence in the state , and independent advertisers are not authorized to act as Amazon ’s agents , according to the company ’s complaint .
Furthermore , Amazon claims the lawsuit unfairly singles out the company .
Seattle - based Amazon wants the law be declared invalid and to be awarded costs of the legal proceedings .
Besides newly appointed New York Governor David Paterson , Amazon also named the commissioner of New York ’s state department of taxation and finance as a defendant in the case .
Amazon.com said it had no further comment on the case .
Between the YouTube owners , Chen was more eager to sell .
" Chad kept saying , ' We 're going to take this as far as we can take it . '

The Internet has had an enormous impact on people 's lives around the world in the ten years since Google 's founding .
It has changed politics , entertainment , culture , business , health care , the environment and just about every other topic you can think of .
Which got us to thinking , what 's going to happen in the next ten years ?
How will this phenomenal technology evolve , how will we adapt , and ( more importantly ) how will it adapt to us ?
We asked ten of our top experts this very question , and during September ( our 10th anniversary month ) we are presenting their responses .
As computer scientist Alan Kay has famously observed , the best way to predict the future is to invent it , so we will be doing our best to make good on our experts ' words every day .

Using the following illustrations as a guide , consider these as the best method for the application of your dog ’s patent pending Dog Condom™ .
There are a few different “ right ways ” to apply it , but many more “ wrong ways ” , and it ’s our goal to help you keep that red rocket firing straight ahead .
After all , when it comes to the red rocket , it kind of is rocket science .
Do n’t Put Dog Condom™ on Dog Balls –
It sounds pretty basic , but if you make this mistake it will ruin the experience for your dog , and may even ruin his testicles .
As handy a fastener as the furry chestnuts make for , if you roll the condom all the way down the penis , onto and over the testicles , it may cause serious long term damage to your dog , both physically and emotionally .
Do n’t Apply by Mouth – Many dogs resist their owners putting their hands down in the business sector , so you may need to get creative to earn compliance .
If Fido resists , consider rolling it down with gentle , tender stroking motions .
Do n’t use your mouth to apply it .
Although that may have served you well in college ( regardless of gender ) , dogs find interspecies contact of this sort demoralizing , and even those that accept it find their regret so great they ’re three - times as likely to wander into traffic thereafter .
Non-Petroleum Lubricate As Needed –
If your dog does n’t get his partner going , and needs that extra bit of juice to make the magic happen , consider the use of a non-petroleum - based lubricant .
Vaseline , motor oil and fuel injector cleaner are all examples of lubricants that will corrode the condom , reducing its effectiveness , perhaps entirely .
Instead use Pam cooking spray , which is natural , safe , and has a buttery deliciousness that most dogs find to be an aphrodisiac .
Carefully Remove After Completion – Just like with humans , it ’s important to carefully remove the dog condom after use .
Do not unroll it , but rather slide it off in a single motion , squeezing tight around the base to capture all wayward spermicles that may try to find other ways to get to the bitch hole .
You can throw this in the garbage , but since it ’s a bio - hazard , you may wish to first rinse it in the sink .
Do not wash it in the dishwasher or clothes washing machine , and never re-use the same condom .
If you ca n’t bear the thought of parting with your puppy - chowder , you can always wring it into a container , such as a one - ounce plastic bullet , like they use for the sweet & sour sauce you get from Chinese takeout , and save it in the freezer .
Cloning technology is n’t here yet , but in the next ten to twenty years it may become cost effective to use that seed to clone your dog and bring him back for seconds , but not sloppy seconds !
Exclusive to STR
July 30 , 2008
As the economy predictably crumbles , bankruptcies and business closings will increase , and businesses and individuals will find themselves in financial straits , with little hope of economic salvation .
Many families are in danger of losing their homes , and there seems little , short of a miracle , that can be done about it .
It seems to me that this is n't necessary , presuming logic and truth play any role in our financial system -- which may be debatable .
Why do we read daily of businesses failing , or on the brink of failure ?
Why do we see ad after ad on TV for firms offering financial assistance and guidance for individuals faced with economic disaster ?
Because people and companies are neck - high in debt , which they can no longer expect to repay .
And to whom are they indebted ?
Generally , to banks , but ultimately , all debt is to banks , since banks are the sole source of our ' money , ' which is created for borrowers with the stroke of a pen , and requires the borrower to repay more than was borrowed .
Since banks are the only source of money , the situation is analogous to returning to the only well in town more water than was taken from it , year after year .
That 's obviously impossible in the case of a well , but it works -- at least for a while -- with banking , because money , unlike water , is intangible , and banks can create it in unlimited amounts , to enable borrowers to return more than they borrowed , with the money loaned to pay interest provided -- at interest !
You can see that the situation , once embarked upon , is bound to end in catastrophe .
Let 's look at bank borrowing .
Do banks lend the funds they have on deposit from their customers ?
Heavens , no !
If they did that , the money supply would n't be increasing exponentially .
When they lend , they simply create the funds .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York puts it succinctly : ' Commercial banks create checkbook money whenever they grant a loan , simply by adding new deposit dollars to accounts on their books in exchange for a borrower 's IOU . '
It 's a staggering admission that , I suspect , the bank was only willing to make because it realized that few would read it , ( in its little booklet ' I Bet You Thought , ' ) and fewer still would consider what it really meant .
The bank tells us that WHENEVER ( no exceptions noted ) banks ' grant ' a loan , they simply create checkbook money ' i.e. , a bank deposit -- to the borrower 's account .
In other words , customer deposits do not create bank funds , but rather , bank funds create customer deposits !
Every dime in every bank account got there because , ultimately , in the dim forgotten past , perhaps , someone borrowed it !
You may never have borrowed from any bank , but , if you have a bank account , the money in that account was borrowed by somebody .
Now let 's look at those bank deposits .
This time we 'll get our information from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago , in its booklet Modern Money Mechanics .
Here 's what we read on page 3 : ' The actual process of money creation takes place in commercial banks .
As noted early , demand liabilities of commercial banks are money .
These liabilities are customers ' accounts .
They increase when the customers deposit currency and checks and when the proceeds of loans made by the banks are credited to borrowers ' accounts . '
Did you get that ?
The bank is telling us that your bank account consists of the bank 's liabilities .
The bank 's liabilities increase when you deposit cash or checks , or ' when the proceeds of loans -- are credited to borrowers ' accounts . '
Let 's put it all together .
You go into the bank to borrow a million dollars .
The bank agrees to make the loan .
As a result , the number 1,000,000.00 is added to your account .
Where did the million come from ?
It 's just a number !
Some clerk added it to your account .
What is the nature of this number ?
It is a liability of the lending bank .
In other words , the bank has created a liability on itself , in your favor .
Simply put , in granting you the loan , the bank has obligated itself to you for one million dollars , as evidenced by the bank 's addition , of 1,000,000.00 to your account .
It does this , as the Chicago Fed told us ( I Bet You Thought , p. 19 ) ' in exchange for a borrower 's IOU . '
So : the bank loaned you its liabilities totaling 1,000,000.00 .
It may not be technically correct to refer to bank liabilities ( i.e. , checkbook money ) as ' IOU 's , ' but close enough .
You , in return , tendered your IOU for a million .
You know , that looks like a pretty even swap , does n't it ?
Of course , the bank , as well as common ( non ) sense , asserts that the bank 's liabilities are ' money . '
Your own liabilities , of course , are simply - - liabilities .
But by what law is bank credit money ?
How can the liabilities of one private firm be ' money , ' while those of another ( Chrysler Corporation , for instance ) be simply evidence of debt ?
Is there some definition of ' money ' somewhere that defines bank credit as money ?
Maybe , but I have n't found it .
And if bank credit is , by some permutation of law , actual money , then by what law may a private firm , such as your local bank , create a nation 's money ?
Questions abound , although it seems to me that they 're rarely , if ever , asked , and when they are , never answered .
If the bank actually paid off its liabilities , by tendering you a million units of whatever is defined as a dollar quantity of money , that would be another matter altogether .
You would then have an obligation to repay .
But that has n't happened , and wo n't happen , because if money were to be some tangible substance , banking would be little more than warehousing , and where 's the profit in that ?
( I calculated a few years ago that the interest earned on the national debt is about a billion dollars per working day ) .
The actual transaction was , in effect and , I believe , in fact , an exchange of IOUs .
So who owes whom anything ?
You should lose your home to such a transaction ?
A final note : bank deposits constitute a bank 's liabilities .
As you can see in the quote above , from the Federal Reserve of Chicago , increasing your bank deposits increases the bank 's liabilities .
So if , in the example we 've been discussing , you managed to accumulate a million dollars to deposit with the bank ( of course , the interest would still be due , but you could borrow that !! ) you would be increasing the bank 's liabilities .
Are there many companies that will sue you if you fail to increase their liabilities ?
If modern banking is an abomination , it is because modern money is an abomination .
Of course , the law ( i.e. , the Constitution ) does n't permit modern ' money , ' but who pays any attention to that old anachronism ?
Give up your home , your automobile , go on the dole , and quit complaining !
In the book Language Myths , edited by Laurie Bauer and Peter Trudgill ( Penguin , 1998 ) , a team of leading linguists set out to challenge some of the conventional wisdom about language and the way it works .
Of the 21 myths or misconceptions they examined , here are six of the most common .
The Meanings of Words Should Not Be Allowed to Vary or Change
Peter Trudgill , now an honorary professor of sociolinguistics at the University of East Anglia in England , recounts the history of the word nice to illustrate his point that the " English language is full of words which have changed their meanings slightly or even dramatically over the centuries . "
Derived from the Latin adjective nescius ( meaning " not knowing " or " ignorant " ) , nice arrived in English around 1300 meaning " silly , " " foolish , " or " shy . "
Over the centuries , its meaning gradually changed to " fussy , " then " refined , " and then ( by the end of the 18th century ) " pleasant " and " agreeable . "
Trudgill observes that " none of us can unilaterally decide what a word means .
Meanings of words are shared between people -- they are a kind of social contract we all agree to -- otherwise , communication would not be possible . "
Children Can't Speak or Write Properly Any More
Though upholding educational standards is important , says linguist James Milroy , " there is , in reality , nothing to suggest that today 's youngsters are less competent at speaking and writing their native language than older generations of children were . "
Going back to Jonathan Swift ( who blamed linguistic decline on the " Licentiousness which entered with the Restoration " ) , Milroy notes that every generation has complained about deteriorating standards of ​literacy .
He points out that over the past century general standards of literacy have , in fact , steadily risen .
According to the myth , there has always been " a Golden Age when children could write much better than they can now . "
But as Milroy concludes , " There was no Golden Age . "
America Is Ruining the English Language
John Algeo , professor emeritus of English at the University of Georgia , demonstrates some of the ways in which Americans have contributed to changes in English vocabulary , syntax , and pronunciation .
He also shows how American English has retained some of the characteristics of 16th - century English that have disappeared from present - day British .
American is not corrupt British plus barbarisms .
. . .
Present - day British is no closer to that earlier form than present - day American is .
Indeed , in some ways present - day American is more conservative , that is , closer to the common original standard , than is present - day English .
Algeo notes that British people tend to be more aware of American innovations in language than Americans are of British ones .
" The cause of that greater awareness may be a keener linguistic sensitivity on the part of the British , or a more insular anxiety and hence irritation about influences from abroad . "
TV Makes People Sound the Same
J. K. Chambers , a professor of linguistics at the University of Toronto , counters the common view that television and other popular media are steadily diluting regional speech patterns .
The media do play a role , he says , in the spread of certain words and expressions .
" But at the deeper reaches of language change - - sound changes and grammatical changes -- the media have no significant effect at all . "
According to sociolinguists , regional dialects continue to diverge from standard dialects throughout the English - speaking world .
And while the media can help to popularize certain slang expressions and catch - phrases , it 's pure " linguistic science fiction " to think that television has any significant effect on the way we pronounce words or put together sentences .
The biggest influence on language change , Chambers says , is not Homer Simpson or Oprah Winfrey .
It is , as it always has been , face - to - face interactions with friends and colleagues : " it takes real people to make an impression . "
Some Languages Are Spoken More Quickly Than Others
Peter Roach , now an emeritus professor of phonetics at Reading University in England , has been studying speech perception throughout his career .
And what has he found out ?
That there 's " no real difference between different languages in terms of sounds per second in normal speaking cycles . "
But surely , you 're saying , there 's a rhythmical difference between English ( which is classed as a " stress - timed " language ) and , say , French or Spanish ( classed as " syllable - timed " ) .
Indeed , Roach says , " it usually seems that syllable - timed speech sounds faster than stress - timed to speakers of stress - timed languages .
So Spanish , French , and Italian sound fast to English speakers , but Russian and Arabic do n't . "
However , different speech rhythms do n't necessarily mean different speaking speeds .
Studies suggest that " languages and dialects just sound faster or slower , without any physically measurable difference .
The apparent speed of some languages might simply be an illusion . "
You Should n't Say " It Is Me " Because " Me " Is Accusative
According to Laurie Bauer , professor of theoretical and descriptive linguistics at Victoria University of Wellington , New Zealand , the " It is I " rule is just one example of how the rules of Latin grammar have been inappropriately forced on English .
In the 18th century , Latin was widely viewed as the language of refinement -- classy and conveniently dead .
As a result , a number of grammar mavens set out to transfer this prestige to English by importing and imposing various Latin grammatical rules -- regardless of actual English usage and normal word patterns .
One of these inappropriate rules was an insistence on using the nominative " I " after a form of the verb " to be . "
Bauer argues that there 's no point in avoiding normal English speech patterns -- in this case , " me , " not " I , " after the verb .
And there 's no sense in imposing " the patterns of one language on another . "
Doing so , he says , " is like trying to make people play tennis with a golf club . "
OLYMPIC MAIN PRESS CENTER -
As the games come to a close here this weekend , I know many fans will dwell on medal numbers .
But there 's another set of numbers that really sticks with me .
Of the 149 people - nearly all Chinese citizens - who submitted nearly 80 applications to protest in designated parks during the Olympics , none - zero - were approved by the government .
These rejections come after the government had authorized this application process , at the suggestion of the International Olympic Committee .
It was designed to keep protests - about everything from Tibet and domestic land seizures - orderly and away from the Olympic sites .
According to the state 's news agency this week , of the 77 applications , 74 were withdrawn because the problems cited were " addressed " by the relevant authorities , two were suspended because of incomplete information , and one was rejected because it was " in violation of China 's laws on demonstrations and protests . "
This leads to the obvious question for any thinking person :
Were the " protest parks " a charade to fool the Chinese people - and the media ?
As a parting act , I am taking up the Chinese government on a different application process introduced during the Olympics .
As part of its vow of greater openness with the foreign media about a range of issues related to the games , they have made available an official " application form of accredited journalists " to facilitate interview and informational inquiries .
Like the 149 people who took advantage of the protest zone process , I 'm here as a journalist to give this one a try .
My written request ( written in English and Chinese to facilitate communication ) asks the Beijing Public Security Bureau to tell me the home province of each of the petitioners , and what each grievances was about .
Wanting to be as reasonable as possible , I have asked for a response within 10 days , and given my Boston contact information so they can respond when I return to the U.S .
Perhaps the Chinese will see this request as part of the " biased " foreign media - a term used just yesterday by Wang Wei , spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Committee , during a testy press conference here .
He had fielded one too many questions about isolated detentions of Westerners who had unfurled Tibetan flags .
And inquiries about the pair of elderly Chinese women sentenced to " reform through labor " when they protested their forced removal from their homes .
He wanted the media to focus more on the near - flawless operation of the Olympics -- that some 10,000 athletes competed in 28 different sports in 37 competition venues that gave inspiration - and entertainment - to millions and millions of spectators all over the world .
T.V. Olympic viewership globally and domestically reached all - time highs .
Wang went on to say to reporters , " Tell the true story , please . "
Surely that is a goal that many journalists here share .
I 'm hoping for an answer to my inquiry .
New Zealand Earthquake Near Beautiful Kermadec Islands ( Photos )
A powerful earthquake of 7.3 magnitude struck off the remote Kermadec islands of New Zealand early Tuesday morning according to the US Geological Survey .
There have been no reports of major damage or casualties .
The quake struck at a depth of 22 miles under the seabed at 3:09 a.m .
An hour later a second 5.3 magnitude aftershock struck .
Such activity can generate a local tsunami that can be extremely destructive to the island coastlines .
The USGS has not issued tsunami warnings thus far .
Earthquakes and volcanic activity are common in New Zealand , where continental plates meet in what is known as the Pacific ' Ring of Fire ' .
We 've included some picturesque photos of the region .

Yuval Ginbar is a scholar and human rights activist , and has recently written a book for us called Why Not Torture Terrorists ? : Moral , Practical and Legal Aspects of the “ Ticking Bomb ” Justification for Torture .
In the post below he gives his opinions on the Israeli academics who support the use of torture in the “ war on terror ” and are seeking its legitimization .
Apologies .
What follows are not sensational revelations about Israel ’s secret involvement in torture worldwide ( though there have been some reports to that effect ) .
I am referring to a possibly less exciting phenomenon , which is all in the public domain .
To me , however , it is no less worrying : Israel has produced a surprising yield of academics who support torture and seek its legitimization , if not legalisation .
Publishing widely , including in the most prestigious journals and publishing houses , they advocate the use of interrogational torture in the “ war on terror ” .
There are variations , of course .
One favours torture to be authorized by a “ public committee ” – a variant of Alan Dershowitz ’ “ torture warrants ” idea .
Others propose allowing “ only ” methods that are “ short of torture , ” including one who attempts to show Americans how some forms of “ coercive interrogation ” would accord with their Constitution .
However , the methods that the “ torture lite ” academics recommend , such as sleep and sensory deprivation , become by all accounts – legal , “ common sensical ” and factual – full torture , at least over time .
No – guidance on how interrogators would know when to stop are not attached .
Nor are any examples of how such methods were used without becoming torture .
This is because no such examples exist .
But perhaps the speciality of pro-torture Israeli academics is devising schemes which would , they say , enable an absolute legal prohibition on torture to co-exist with allowing its use in “ ticking bomb situations ” – a “ relativized ” absolute prohibition , as one of them ( seriously ) quipped .
Some have proposed that while torture should be prohibited by law absolutely , if a leader orders torture in extreme situations , his act would later undergo “ ex post - facto ratification ” .
Others propose a modification of deontological morality so as to allow torture in extreme situations , as long as it is not “ officialized ” .
However heavily endowed with academic titles the writers are , however extensive and thorough their research is , and however rich their essays and books are with references , cases and footnotes , the results are invariably absurd , as the very combination they seek is self - contradictory .
In my book I analyse several of these “ have - your - cake - and - eat - it ” solutions .
Actually , perhaps a more apt – and updated - description would be the “ yeah - but - no - but ” approaches to torture .
They ultimately make as much sense as Little Britain ’s Vicky Pollard .
All this could all have been quite amusing were it not for the fact that such scholars – and other , non - Israeli ones , of course – are advocating that our officials be allowed , through one moral or legal scheme or another , to inflict excruciating pain on helpless prisoners , demolishing in the process an international legal and moral consensus it took humanity hundreds of years to achieve .
And were it not for the fact that a “ yeah - but - no - but ” torture system , which most of the Israeli academics are in effect modelling their proposals on , is actually in operation – you guessed it – in Israel .
In 1999 Israel ’s Supreme Court prohibited issuing the General Security Service ( GSS ) with instructions on how to inflict what was euphemistically called “ moderate physical pressure ” on Palestinian detainees , as had been the custom until then , and ruled that GSS agents cannot be authorized to inflict such “ pressure ” .
The Court cited the absolute prohibition on torture in international law .
So far so good .
However , when it comes to “ ticking - time bomb ” situations , the Court ruled that the case of a GSS interrogator who tortures ( the Court too preferred a euphemism : “ applied physical interrogation methods ” ) would then be considered by the Attorney - General , and if need be by the courts , where “ his potential criminal liability shall be examined in the context of the ‘ necessity ’ defence ” – a criminal law defence which , as currently held in Israeli law , justifies actions in extreme situations if they produce the “ lesser evil ” .
The result has been predictable .
Within a couple of years the GSS itself was admitting it was torturing – oops !
– euphemism time again : using “ exceptional interrogation measures ” – in dozens of cases annually .
All were cases of “ ticking bombs ” , of course .
Figures from human rights NGOs , such as the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel , have been much higher .
Number of GSS interrogators convicted of torturing ( or any other offence ) ?
Zero. Prosecutions ?
Zero. Criminal investigations ?
Zero .
Once introduced as a means of legitimizing torture , the “ ticking bomb ” and its legal corollary , the “ necessity defence ” , have overwhelmed the system .
Israel is not the focus of my book , but of the four “ models of legalized torture ” described and analysed there , two have , unfortunately , been in operation in Israel , in one form or another .
Then there is the “ torture warrants ” model .
The fourth is , of course , the US model .
But what about the big questions ?
Is ‘ waterboarding ’ or ( perhaps more importantly ) other , less blatant interrogation techniques considered torture under international law ?
Does international law allow the use of painful techniques falling short of torture , or the use of the “ necessity defence ” to exonerate torturers ?
What happens to a state , morally and practically , once it allows anti-terrorist torture ?
And – maybe the biggest question – would it not be morally justifiable to torture terrorists in order to save many innocent lives in “ ticking bomb situations ” ?
In other words – Why Not Torture Terrorists ?
I 'm sitting outside a trendy Brooklyn café chatting with friends .
I glance to my left and notice a huge telephoto lens peeking around the corner of the building .
The actress Keri Russell is known to hang here , but she 's nowhere in sight .
That paparazzo is hounding me .
And it 's no wonder — I paid him to do it .
We live in the age of the candid snapshot .
People do n't want to pose for glamour photos ; they want artful images that look unstaged and off - the - cuff , like a party pic from TheCobrasnake.comor a tousled cover model on Vice magazine .
But calculated spontaneity is hard to pull off without the help of a professional .
And I wanted some pics of me that say " I look awesome even when I 'm not trying . "
That 's where Izaz Rony comes in .
The 22 - year - old , who credits YouTube , Flickr , and Facebook as inspirations , does guerrilla - style photo shoots for $ 500 an hour and up .
It 's like hiring a stalker for a day .
After setting up a shoot with Rony , I email him some recent snapshots so he 'll recognize me .
I also supply a vague itinerary of my plans for the following Sunday , leaving it fairly open — I want to act the part of a harried celeb with TMZ on my trail .
When the day arrives , I 'm a mess .
What do you wear to be photographed by your very own paparazzo ?
I do n't want to look like I 'm going to the Oscars , but I can't rock my everyday grungy freelancer garb .
I try on 15 different outfits before settling on the right pair of jeans , then I make sure my hair has that perfect slept - in look .
I finally make it out of the apartment , and it's not long before I catch that glimpse of my stalker .
I suddenly become hyperaware of myself .
Do I look authentic ?
Am I being spontaneous enough ?
My nose is running , but I 'm afraid to wipe it ; a shutter - click at the wrong moment might look like I 'm picking my nose or nursing a huge coke habit .
Will my friends warn me if I have a latte - foam mustache ?
Do I make funny faces when I talk ?
Do Lindsay and Britney spend every waking moment worrying about this stuff ?
I leave the coffee shop with Rony trailing unobtrusively .
I 'm beginning to understand why celebrities go nuts , shave their heads , and bounce in and out of rehab ; I would , too , if I had relentless photographers on my tail 24/ 7 .
When I stop to peruse a pair of shoes at an outdoor stall , Rony snaps away at me through a rack of dresses , startling a fellow shopper .
" Sorry , " I sheepishly explain .
" That 's , uh ... my photographer . "
I do n't feel like a celebutante hounded by the media anymore ; I feel like the lamest lame -o in Phonytown .
And I 've had enough of it .
I call off the shoot .
For days , I 'm afraid to look at the disc that Rony burns for me — 60 images in all .
But surprisingly , I end up liking them .
I actually look like my authentic self .
They may not be worthy of the cover of Us Weekly , but they are perfect for posting on MySpace .
I can only hope that people who visit my profile do n't pick up on the $ 500 - an - hour fee and stress - filled day of paranoia and humiliation .

Memo to the Next President
Obama has a cyber security plan .
It ’s basically what you would expect : Appoint a national cyber security advisor , invest in math and science education , establish standards for critical infrastructure , spend money on enforcement , establish national standards for securing personal data and data - breach disclosure , and work with industry and academia to develop a bunch of needed technologies .
I could comment on the plan , but with security the devil is always in the details — and , of course , at this point there are few details .
But since he brought up the topic — McCain supposedly is “ working on the issues ” as well — I have three pieces of policy advice for the next president , whoever he is .
They ’re too detailed for campaign speeches or even position papers , but they ’re essential for improving information security in our society .
Actually , they apply to national security in general .
And they ’re things only government can do .
One , use your immense buying power to improve the security of commercial products and services .
One property of technological products is that most of the cost is in the development of the product rather than the production .
Think software :
The first copy costs millions , but the second copy is free .
You have to secure your own government networks , military and civilian .
You have to buy computers for all your government employees .
Consolidate those contracts , and start putting explicit security requirements into the RFPs .
You have the buying power to get your vendors to make serious security improvements in the products and services they sell to the government , and then we all benefit because they ’ll include those improvements in the same products and services they sell to the rest of us .
We ’re all safer if information technology is more secure , even though the bad guys can use it , too .
Two , legislate results and not methodologies .
There are a lot of areas in security where you need to pass laws , where the security externalities are such that the market fails to provide adequate security .
For example , software companies who sell insecure products are exploiting an externality just as much as chemical plants that dump waste into the river .
But a bad law is worse than no law .
A law requiring companies to secure personal data is good ; a law specifying what technologies they should use to do so is not .
Mandating software liabilities for software failures is good , detailing how is not .
Legislate for the results you want and implement the appropriate penalties ; let the market figure out how — that ’s what markets are good at .
Three , broadly invest in research .
Basic research is risky ; it does n’t always pay off .
That ’s why companies have stopped funding it .
Bell Labs is gone because nobody could afford it after the AT&T breakup , but the root cause was a desire for higher efficiency and short - term profitability — not unreasonable in an unregulated business .
Government research can be used to balance that by funding long - term research .
Spread those research dollars wide .
Lately , most research money has been redirected through DARPA to near - term military - related projects ; that ’s not good .
Keep the earmark - happy Congress from dictating how the money is spent .
Let the NSF , NIH and other funding agencies decide how to spend the money and do n’t try to micromanage .
Give the national laboratories lots of freedom , too .
Yes , some research will sound silly to a layman .
But you ca n’t predict what will be useful for what , and if funding is really peer - reviewed , the average results will be much better .
Compared to corporate tax breaks and other subsidies , this is chump change .
If our research capability is to remain vibrant , we need more science and math students with decent elementary and high school preparation .
The declining interest is partly from the perception that scientists do n’t get rich like lawyers and dentists and stockbrokers , but also because science is n’t valued in a country full of creationists .
One way the president can help is by trusting scientific advisers and not overruling them for political reasons .
Oh , and get rid of those post - 9/11 restrictions on student visas that are causing so many top students to do their graduate work in Canada , Europe and Asia instead of in the United States .
Those restrictions will hurt us immensely in the long run .
Those are the three big ones ; the rest is in the details .
And it ’s the details that matter .
There are lots of serious issues that you ’re going to have to tackle : data privacy , data sharing , data mining , government eavesdropping , government databases , use of Social Security numbers as identifiers , and so on .
It ’s not enough to get the broad policy goals right .
You can have good intentions and enact a good law , and have the whole thing completely gutted by two sentences sneaked in during rulemaking by some lobbyist .
Security is both subtle and complex , and — unfortunately — does n’t readily lend itself to normal legislative processes .
You ’re used to finding consensus , but security by consensus rarely works .
On the internet , security standards are much worse when they ’re developed by a consensus body , and much better when someone just does them .
This does n’t always work — a lot of crap security has come from companies that have “ just done it ” — but nothing but mediocre standards come from consensus bodies .
The point is that you wo n’t get good security without pissing someone off :
The information broker industry , the voting machine industry , the telcos .
The normal legislative process makes it hard to get security right , which is why I do n’t have much optimism about what you can get done .
And if you ’re going to appoint a cyber security czar , you have to give him actual budgetary authority .
Otherwise he wo n’t be able to get anything done , either .

Sawing Off The Wings : What ’s That Sound Beneath The Plane ?
As I was sitting patiently in Long Beach waiting to exit the plane and listening to that weird sawing sound that I hear every time I fly on an Airbus A320 , I was wondering two things :
1 ) Why does it sound like Paul Bunyon is attacking my plane with a drywall saw , and
2 ) Who is going to be the first person to make some stupid joke , like “ Oh no , Paul Bunyon is attacking our plane with a drywall saw ! ”
Would it be the young woman to my right in 20D — we ’ll call her “ Cathy ” — with whom I was fiercely trying not to make eye contact for the duration of the flight , for fear that I would be not only subjected to the inordinate flow of words streaming from her mouth , but also socially obliged to smile and nod at the relevant pauses in her soliloquy ?
Or would it be the entrepreneur five rows back in 25D with whom I — by virtue of sitting within five rows of him — was forcefully included as an eavesdropper in his conversation in which he reminded the listeners several times that , for a guy like him , $ 2 million dollars was not a lot of money ?
I was betting it would be him .
But it turns out I was wrong .
It was the guy in 16 C who looked far too discerning to make such an unbecoming joke .
I was a little mad that it was 16C .
I really wanted it to be 25D ; I wanted to say silently to myself — in a cold , measured voice as if I were discovering the identity of Batman for the first time — “ I knew it would be you , ” when the ostentatiously affluent entrepreneur took it upon himself to be “ that guy . ”
By the way , $ 2 million dollars is not a big deal for 25D .
So in an attempt to rid Airbusses everywhere from the same overused charades in which the actor comically drives his hand forward - and - back in time with the sawing sound , and in which he thinks he is the first passenger ever to do this , I called Airbus to find out what exactly was happening to cause this sound .
( Do n’t worry , it ’s a perfectly normal sound ) .
The plane has a system called the “ Power Transfer Unit ” ( PTU ) that maintains hydraulic pressure in the two primary hydraulic systems .
The sound , it turns out , is unique to the Airbus A320 family of planes .
Airlines all over the world — including British Airways , easyJet , jetBlue , Lufthansa , and US Airways — all use this plane .
So chances are you ’ve heard this sound , and chances are you ’ve heard the same jokes that I have …maybe even in German or British !
Banter !
The first woman I spoke to at Airbus , who sounded like she was working in a 1950 ’s office cooled with a dusty chrome oscillating desk fan somewhere along Route 66 in Texas , was noticeably alarmed by my question .
Ironic , considering Airbus is a European aerospace consortium that is a world leader in a pretty technical field of engineering .
“ Someone was trying to saw the wings off ! ? " she asked with dismay as if I had just told her that the Mayan calender was in fact correct and the the world would end in 2012 .
" Did you report it to the captain ?
Maybe you should report it to the airline ! "
I could almost see the concern and confusion in her face over the phone .
“ No , ” I kindly clarified , “ It just sounded like they were trying to saw the wings off .
I think it is just a normal sound and I ’m just trying to find out what it really is . ”
She transferred me to a man in another office far away from Route 66 , who was more than happy to give me a detailed explanation : " It typically happens when you ’re doing a single - engine taxi , because there is only one hydraulic pump running on one engine , but it has to power both sides .
You ’ll also hear it if you ’re powering things like the landing gear on the approach , since the landing gear is powered by only one hydraulic pump . "
When you hear the sawing , the PTU is cycling to make sure that there is equal pressure on either side .
Since the landing gear is powered by one hydraulic system , and the other one is sitting idle , the pressure will drop on one , triggering the PTU to go on and pressurize both systems .
If you ’re sitting over the wing , it ’s the loudest , because the PTU is right underneath the wingbox .
So now I ’ll wait with eager anticipation to give my calculated yet cheeky retort to the first person who thinks about making a joke about the maintenance crew sawing off the wings of the A320 : “ Actually the sound , unique to the Airbus A320 family of planes including not only the A320 , but also the 318 , 319 , and 321 , emanates from the Power Transfer Unit , a system which equalizes the hydraulic pressure between each of the two primary hydraulic units … but good joke !
I ’ve never heard that one before ! ”
Flying sometimes puts me in a bad mood .
The general idea
Way back when , the earth cooled , the dinosaurs appeared , and I decided it was time to add a Fuzz box to my effects chain .
I had n't played a fuzz in a long time , and was yearning for that wooly , buzzy , sustain for days type of sound .
So I went on the usual pilgrimage to Guitar Center to try out the stock mass - marketed assortment .
Unsatisfied , I then proceeded to a couple of the local small shops , which had a variety of new and used fuzz boxes from different manufactures .
Resplendent Red
I tried the ZVex Fuzz Factory , a FuzzFace re-issue , a couple of the EHX units , a FullTone fuzz ( the 1969 I think ) and various other fuzz pedals .
Most of them sounded good , but to get the versatility I wanted out of a fuzz pedal , I would have ended up buying multiple pedals , spending lots of money ( not a behavior popular with my then wife ) and mucking about with patch cables , tweaking , etc .
I returned from my Fuzz quest empty - handed .
After some thinking , I realized that what I really wanted was the ability to try lots if different circuits , and add modifications at various levels .
I wanted some of the classic pedals and the ability to switch mods on and off and to see how the different fuzz designs interact with each other .
Basically what I wanted was the ultimate fuzz tweaker toolkit , all in one monster pedal with lots of knobs , switches , meters and other twiddly bits .
No commercial outfits have offerings that come close to what I wanted , so it sounded like a cool ( and ambitious ) DIY project .
Das Landgericht Berlin hat am heutigen Mittwochabend den wegen seiner Abmahnungen bekannt gewordenen Rechtsanwalt Günter Freiherr von Gravenreuth zu einer Haftstrafe von 14 Monaten ohne Bewährung verurteilt .
Damit folgte das Gericht genau dem Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft .
In dem Berufungsverfahren sah es der Vorsitzende Richter als erwiesen an , dass sich von Gravenreuth in einer zivilrechtlichen Auseinandersetzung mit der Berliner Tageszeitung taz des versuchten Betrugs schuldig gemacht hat .
Von Gravenreuth war vor einem Jahr vom Amtsgericht Berlin - Tiergarten wegen eben dieses versuchten Betrugs zu einer Haftstrafe von einem halben Jahr ohne Bewährung verurteilt worden .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm nachgewiesen , dass er ohne nachvollziehbaren Grund die Domain der Zeitung taz .de hatte pfänden lassen .
Von Gravenreuth hatte seinerzeit insistiert , kein Geld aus einem Rechtsstreit mit der Zeitung erhalten zu haben .
Er habe auf den Kostenfestsetzungsbeschluss noch keine Zahlung erhalten , hatte Gravenreuth laut taz damals erklärt .
Dies allerdings hatte sich nach einer Durchsuchung der Kanzleiräumlichkeiten des Anwalts als unwahr herausgestellt .
Dort hatte die Polizei Unterlagen gefunden , die die Kenntnis des Geldeingangs bestätigten .
Der Beschuldigte wollte in der heutigen Strafverhandlung über seinen Verteidiger nachweisen lassen , dass seine Kanzlei im Tatzeitraum so chaotisch organisiert gewesen sei , dass er den Überblick verloren habe .
Mehrere ehemalige Angestellte , die als Zeugen benannt waren , bestätigten zwar diese Darstellung , was die Postablage angeht , betonten aber laut Prozessbeobachtern , dass in Sachen Geldeingang immer strenge Ordnung geherrscht habe .
Insofern war der Vortrag des Münchner Rechtsanwalts offenbar für den Vorsitzenden Richter wenig glaubwürdig .
Im April 2008 hat von Gravenreuth bereits in einer anderen Strafsache eine Haftstrafe von elf Monaten erhalten , die zur Bewährung ausgesetzt ist .
In jener Berufungsverhandlung vor dem Landgericht München I ging es um die Veruntreuung von Mandantengeldern sowie um eine Vorstrafe wegen sechzigfacher Urkundenfälschung .
Die Haftstrafe floss in die Strafbemessung des Berliner Landgerichts ein .
Inwieweit sich das heute ergangene Urteil auf eine mögliche Entziehung der Anwaltszulassung auswirken wird , ist bislang offen .
Das Urteil ist noch nicht rechtskräftig .
Von Gravenreuth hat nun sieben Tage Zeit , dagegen einen Revisionsantrag beim Kammergericht als nächst höhere Instanz zu stellen .
Zur Begründung dieses Antrags bleiben ihm vier Wochen ab Zustellung des schriftlichen Urteils .
Ob der verurteilte Rechtsanwalt von dieser Option Gebrauch machen wird , war bislang nicht in Erfahrung zu bringen .
Verzichtet er darauf , dürfte er bald nach Zustellung des Urteils eine Vorladung einer Justizvollzugsanstalt im Münchner Raum erhalten .

It is not typically my style to write editorials or news stories about religion .
Religion typically inspires people to emotional reactions rather than intellectual thought , however this time I have a point about America 's political and corporate leadership that requires me to examine what the Bible said and how loyally the Republicans and Right - Wingers have followed the dictates of Jesus Christ .
You see , the Republicans of my lifetime ( 1966 up until present day ) have been very fond of claiming that the Christian God is on their side and that they 're doing the Lord 's work .
George W. Bush even went so far as to claim that his favorite philosopher was Jesus Christ .
But really , when you read the words of Jesus Christ how well do the Republicans walk the walk ?
What would Jesus Christ say about Republicans such as Pat Robertson , Jerry Falwell , Ronald Reagan , George W. Bush or Rush Limbaugh ?
In our search for answers , let us look to the book of Matthew .
In chapter 19 we see a rich man ask Jesus what he needed to do in order to inherit eternal life .
Jesus advised the rich man that he would need to sell all of his possessions , give his money to the poor and then follow Jesus .
The rich man refused to do this and Jesus indicated that it is very difficult for a rich man to enter heaven , making his famous quote that it easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God .
In Matthew Chapter 26 Jesus 's disciples indicate that they have a a habit of raising money so that they can give it to the poor .
What does this all tell us so far ?
Well , obviously Jesus was very concerned about the welfare of the poor and the less fortunate .
He encouraged those who wanted to be his followers to recognize their obligation to assist the poor and needy people in society .
When the rich man in Matthew Chapter 29 refused to give money to the poor , Jesus indicated that his chances of getting into heaven were either slim or non-existent .
However the most famous leaders of the Republican party take the opposite view .
According to them , giving money or assistance to the poor is " socialism " or " communism " .
And even pointing out the disparity between the rich and poor is " class warfare " .
While liberals , Democrats and labor unions work hard to help the poor and the unfortunate , the Republicans and the Right - Wingers have worked hard to protect the wealthy and worked hard to keep the poor voiceless , powerless , exploited and unprotected .
So , the Republicans do the OPPOSITE of what Jesus said to do , and yet the Republicans take credit for being the party of Jesus Christ and Christianity .
How do they get away with that ?
It gets worse when we look at the book of John .
In John Chapter 2 we see that a group of greedy capitalists is in the Jewish Temple selling oxen , sheep , doves and changing money .
This pissed Jesus off and he chased the greedy capitalists out of the temple with a scourge of small cords ( a whip basically ) , overturned their tables , spilled their money out onto the floor and screamed at them for turning a house or worship into a place for making money .
And ... is n't that really what Republicans like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson have done ?
Taking advantage of the tax breaks that churches receive in America , Pat Robertson has bought up real estate , a law school , invested in diamond mines and gold mines , sold books and health drinks on his TV show and ( of course ) begged his viewing audience for money .
Jerry Falwell has used his preaching to become a millionaire and Pat Robertson is said ( he wo n't release his financial information ) to be a billionaire .
What would Jesus ( who angrily chased greedy capitalists out of the temple ) have to say about Falwell and Robertson using Christianity to get rich ?
2000 years ago people like Falwell and Robertson were described as " money lovers " , who " devoured the houses of the widows " and were more concerned about keeping their traditions than caring for the aged or the needy .
Jesus had no respect for men like Falwell or Robertson .
He would have gladly chased either one of them with a whip and banned them from any house of worship .
If the Jesus of the gospels were to come to America today , the Republican Party would label him as a " liberal " and a " socialist " and a " communist " .
He would be insulted and attacked by Fox News and the White House Press Secretary .
Rush Limbaugh would accuse him of " class warfare " for Jesus 's attempts to act as an advocate for the poor and would call Jesus a " communist " and " un-American " .
Jesus was never an advocate for the rich .
He was an advocate for the poor , the unfortunate and the voiceless .
So why do people like George W. Bush ( advocates for the millionaires and billionaires ) get away with claiming that Jesus guides them in everything they do ?

Obama aides and supporters , on a conference call , declined to nudge Clinton out of the race .
Clinton wo n't quit ; Obama does n't care
CHICAGO – As Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton made a last - minute trip to West Virginia and declared her intent to stay in the race , aides to Sen .
Barack Obama signaled Wednesday that he would move towards a general election strategy over the next month .
The contrasting game plans underscore the fundamental shift in the presidential campaign following Obama ’s decisive victory Tuesday in North Carolina and narrow loss in Indiana .
Advertisement
Obama has accumulated a lead in pledged delegates that is all but insurmountable – a point that Clinton campaign officials acknowledged Wednesday in a conference call with reporters .
That pushes the campaign largely into political backrooms , as both candidates made plans to meet privately Wednesday and Thursday with uncommitted superdelegates in Washington .
On the campaign trail , Obama is expected to continue pressing the message of party unity that he rolled out Tuesday in Raleigh , N.C. , while increasingly turning his attention to presumptive Republican nominee Sen .
John McCain and gearing his travel schedule toward general election states .
Aides to Obama , who spent Wednesday in Chicago with his family , said the Illinois senator would campaign in the remaining primary states and Puerto Rico .
He heads to Oregon , which votes May 20 , on Friday for a two - day trip and travels Monday to West Virginia , which votes May 13 .
But before the results in Indiana results were even confirmed Tuesday night , chief strategist David Axelrod told reporters traveling on the campaign plane from Raleigh to Chicago that Obama had “ multiple tasks . ”
“ Senator McCain has basically run free for some time now because we have been consumed with this , ” Axelrod said .
“ Everybody is eager to get on with this .
We are not going to take anything for granted .
But we are also going to spend time addressing broader issues .
I mean , I do n’t think we are going to spend our time solely in primary states . ”
When asked whether Obama would campaign over the next month in general election states , Axelrod said : “ I guess you can infer that from what I said . ”
Campaign manager David Plouffe was less direct Wednesday on this point .
“ We have to continue to fight as hard as we can to secure this nomination and that 's our first , second and third goal , ” Plouffe said .
“ Obviously , you know , we also do n't want to wake up the morning of June 4th or June 10th or whenever this is gonna end and not be prepared so we 're gonna do the things we can in kind of our off hours to be ready . ”
Obama aides and supporters , on a conference call , declined to nudge Clinton out of the race , going out of their way to show deference to the New York senator .
“ It would be inappropriate and awkward and wrong for any of us to tell Senator Clinton when it is time for the race to be over , ” said Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) .
“ This is her decision and it is only her decision .
We are confident that she is going to do the right thing for the Democratic nominee .
We are confident that she will help , work hard to unite our party . ”
Clinton ’s campaign set out Wednesday with a diminished goal :
To show that she ’s alive .
With a deliberately cheery conference call and a single campaign stop , the candidate and her staff gave no public indication that Tuesday ’s election would derail her campaign .
She did , however , unilaterally disarm , dropping a key aspect of her underdog ’s campaign : Sharp attacks on the frontrunner .
Clinton did not mention Obama during her visit to Shepherdstown , W.Va .
– a late addition to her schedule , located just 80 miles from Washington , D.C .
While she delivered a familiar message focused on the bread - and - butter economic frustrations of working voters , she dropped the central contrasts that had driven her stump speech in the closing days of the Indiana and North Carolina primaries :
Attacks on Obama ’s position on home foreclosures , healthcare , and the gas tax holiday , and the accompanying implication that he is “ out of touch ” with their views .
“ Next Tuesday , I hope you will give me a chance to be your president , ” she said .
She based her case not on contrasts of policy or character , but on the contours of her coalition of working class whites , women , and Hispanics — crucial swing voters in the general election .
“ The base I 've put together in this primary is a stronger place to start from , ” she told reporters in Shepherdstown .
Clinton ’s aides , too , drew no contrasts on matters of issue or character with Obama in a morning conference call with reporters .
Instead , they gave an unusually explicit nod to the racial calculus of electability .
“ We lost the white electorate in Virginia , started even in North Carolina among the white electorate just two weeks ago , and ended [ with ] a very significant win of 24 points among those voters , ” said Geoff Garin , Clinton ’s chief strategist , acknowledging that among black voters , Clinton “ did not do as well as we would want or need . ”
Clinton ’s campaign touted the endorsement of one superdelegate , North Carolina Heath Shuler , who kept a pledge to follow the voters of his North Carolina district .
But Obama received four superdelegate endorsements , including one who switched from Clinton , Jennifer McClellan of Virginia .
Clinton also heard lukewarm words from key Senate supporters .
“ I , as you know , have great fondness and great respect for Sen. Clinton and I ’m very loyal to her , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein , ( D - Calif . ) .
“ Having said that , I ’d like to talk with her and hear her view on the rest of the race and what the strategy is . ”
Clinton ’s New York colleague Sen. Charles Schumer declined to offer a vote of confidence when asked if Clinton should stay in the race .
“ It 's her decision to make and I 'll accept what decision she makes , ” he said .
Who is she ?
Why was she picked ?
Her news is here .
Last Friday 's letter was about the fact that it is not just Freddie and Fannie .
There are other problems .
The Weekend Edition and today 's Wall Street Journal are filled with stories about the problems with Freddie and Fannie .
The assumption in so many quarters is that they will soon need government assistance .
The only questions seem to be when and in what form ?
Can this wait until a new president is in place ?
Congress is leaving town soon .
Can it wait until the lame duck session ?
As I have been writing for well over a year , the credit crisis is going to be deeper and take longer to correct than the main stream media and economists think .
Losses at banks are going to be much larger , and they are going to bleed for a long time .
That means we are going to see more banks failing .
Bennet Sedacca , who I quoted in last week 's letter , sent out a new letter this morning , providing a list of stocks he thinks may also be in trouble , his " Dead Men Walking " list .
He also notes several banks that will be the beneficiaries of the crisis as they gobble up weak competitors .
Caveat : I am not a stock guy , and can't comment on any of the specifics of what Bennet writes about , but I thought it is important for my readers to understand that this crisis is not going to be over when Freddie and Fannie are nationalized .
There are still some whales out there left which are coming to the surface .
Warning : this is not pleasant reading .
Bennet is the president of Atlantic Advisors in Winter Park , Florida .

Dead Men Walking
Dead Man Walking - Originally , a phrase in a poem by Thomas Hardy in 1909 , but later in a work of non-fiction by Sister Helen Prejean , A Roman catholic nun and one of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille .
Prejean later wrote ' Dead Man Walking ' , which became a hit movie in 1995 .
The title comes from the traditional exclamation " dead man walking , dead man walking here " used by prison guards as the condemned are led to their execution .
Death Row -
A term that refers to the section of a prison that houses individuals awaiting execution .
It is also used to refer to the state of awaiting execution , even in places where a special section does not exist .
As of 2008 , there were 3,263 prisoners awaiting execution in the United States .
The Last Mile - " I guess sometimes the past just catches up to you , whether you want it to or not .
Usually death row is called ' The Last Mile ' .
We call ours ' The Green Mile ' - the floor was the color of faded limes . " - Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb in ' The Green Mile ' .
Are There Corporations that are " Dead Men Walking " ?
The title of this piece sums up how I feel about the current credit markets .
When I first started in the industry in 1981 we were worried , but only about one company - the Chrysler Corporation .
Prior to that , Continental Illinois was in the forefront .
Later in my career , in 1998 , it was Long Term Capital Management , the hedge fund founded by John Meriwether that captured our attention .
Then we had Enron / WorldCom , and by early 2008 Bear Stearns became a worry and then a problem that needed fixing .
All of these events were isolated , dealt with , often with either direct assistance from Uncle Sam or an effort coordinated by our benevolent / socialist government financial authorities .
Markets would become unnerved , fear would grow , and then the Government would step in to make sure that the systemic risk that had finally come to the surface did n't melt the entire planet .
But this is where it is " different this time " .
Not only is it different , I think it may be unprecedented in nature .
When I look at my Bloomberg monitor each day that contains my 100 most important indices , companies , commodities , bonds , bond spreads , preferred shares , etc , I shudder .
The reason I shudder is that my screen does n't have just one " problem child " .
It looks like a screen that contains many " dead men walking " .
The Failed Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac Experiment
I recently wrote a piece entitled The Tale of Two Markets , where I talked about the " Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac Experiment " .
That experiment has now clearly failed and a bailout / privatization / nationalization of Fannie and Freddie is now being planned .
While I have been expecting nationalization for quite a while , I am intrigued along with my peers and colleagues as to why the bailout is taking so long to accomplish .
This is where it gets interesting and dangerous from a systemic point of view .
My hunch is that the reason for the delay is that the Treasury Department is " peeling back the onion " on Fannie / Freddie and finding out just how much of a mess the two of them are in .
At last count , Freddie had Level 3 Assets of $ 151 billion while Fannie had $ 65 billion , for a not - so - paltry sum of $ 216 billion .
When Freddie announced their results a couple of quarters back , they disclosed that most of their Level 3 Assets were of the " sub - prime " variety ( the type of assets that started the whole Credit Crisis in the first place ) .
They are also littered with Alt - A mortgages and are leveraged to the hilt .
Just how bad is the news at Fannie / Freddie ?
On Friday morning , Moody 's downgraded their outstanding preferred stock 5 notches from A1 to Baa3 ( a slight gradation above junk ) and their Bank Financial Strength Ratings ( BSFR ) to D+ from B- ( one / half notch above D , which is reserved for companies in default ) .
According to Moody's , " the downgrade of the BFSR reflects Moody 's view that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's financial flexibility to manage potential volatility in its mortgage risk exposures is constricted ..... in particular , given recent market movement , Moody 's believe these companies currently have limited access to common and preferred equity capital at economically attractive terms . "
" Dead men walking " defined .
Moody 's went on to say , " The GSE 's more limited financial flexibility also restricts their ability to pursue their public mission of providing liquidity , stability and affordability to the US housing Market .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently make up approximately 75 % of the mortgage market in the US .
A reduction in the capacity of these companies to support the US mortgage market could have significant repercussions for the US economy .
In an effort to thwart broader economic effects , Moody 's believes the likelihood of direct support from the United States Treasury has increased . "
Let me put it this way .
" We the people " are about to become owners in Fannie and Freddie , whether we like it or not .
The capital markets have shut on them both as their stocks trade in the $ 2 - 5 range , down from the $ 70 - 80 level just a year ago .
And the yield on the outstanding preferred shares hovers in the 18 - 23 % range , quite the bargain if they keep paying , but also it is the market 's way of saying " beware the value trap " , as the preferred shares may pay another dividend or two , but that is about it .
When the Treasury peels back the onion , I believe they will find a hornet 's nest .
I think we will see an initial bailout of $ 100 billion or so , with 2/3 - 3/4 going to Fannie ( as it is a larger organization ) .
The scenario I foresee however , just as happened at Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley , is that they came to the financing window expecting to have borrowed enough , but then find they have to keep coming back repeatedly until the buyers go away or until " We The People " have thrown at least $ 500 billion at Fannie / Freddie to get them back on their feet again .
This will also likely take an Act of Congress to raise the Treasury 's Debt ceiling quite dramatically .
I will now identify who might be the other " Dead Men Walking " .
More Dead Men Walking - Is There a Pattern ?
What strikes me the most about impaired companies , whether they are automakers , airline companies , banks , brokers or GSE's , is that they seem to sing the same tune , or have the same pattern of behavior .
This is how I have attempted in the past to identify what would be in trouble in the future ( whether that was just to avoid their stocks and bonds from the long side or to try to profit from their missteps on the short side ) .
It is a pattern that is not terribly dissimilar from the emotion charts I like to focus on so much .
In the graphic below , I will offer my " recipe for disaster " for a bank or brokerage firm .
I would like this cycle to be called , " The Dead Man Walking Cycle " .
The first tip - off or " tell " is when a company releases earnings or some sort of positive announcement and the stock falls .
Another important tell is the credit spreads of the debt as the company begins to widen .
Then , the company will usually announce that " all is well " and is so great that they will buy back stock and not " cut the common dividend " .
After this comes the " acceptance " phase and write - offs / write - downs are announced and then some Sovereign Wealth Fund or Private Equity firm will inject capital or that a company within the same group will buy a " strategic stake " .
After a brief pop in the stock and short covering rally , the stock begins to fall further and credit spreads begin to blow out and preferred shares get hammered .
Then , uh - oh , more write - downs and more write - offs and yes , another capital raise and finally a dividend cut to ' preserve capital ' .
Sound familiar yet ...?
All of this goes on for quite some time , until your stock price is so low that you would have to issue so many shares in a secondary offering that you dilute your shareholder base until it is unrecognizable .
With this new share offering your credit , while still rated investment grade , trades like junk , and your preferred shares rise to double digit yields .
Further , the former strategic buyers , Sovereign Wealth Funds and Private Equity firms have taken such a beating that there are no further buyers .
Yet the write - downs and write - offs continue unmercifully as the economy slows and credit is all but cut off .
Eventually , dividends go to zero and you are a " Dead Man Walking " .
There are only a few things that can happen to the companies that are walking " The Green Mile " .
Either you make it to the electric chair ( in the movie " The Green Mile " it was called " Old Sparky " ) and cease to exist or you are eventually forced into the arms of a better capitalized institution .
Over time , I expect a bit of both but mostly of the latter .
Keep in mind that if too many are allowed into the arms of Big Sparky " , it will have a systemic effect as all the institutions are so intertwined because when one group of institutions are forced to mark their bonds to market , others are forced to do the same , ending in an ugly daisy chain .
I think the chain has formed and that many are about to " walk the mile " .
In the end , perhaps years from now , many banks and brokers will be merged into an international list of " good banks " or " Live Men Walking " .
Who are the Live Men Walking ?
They are likely Bank of America , Bank of New York , JP Morgan Chase , Northern Trust , State Street , US Bancorp , ABN Amro , Deutsche Bank , BNP Paribas , Royal Bank of Scotland , Barclays , Allianz and a few others .
The following cycle is how the cycle goes from good bank to ' Dead Man Walking ' .
The " Dead Man Walking " Cycle
Who Are the Dead Men Walking ?
Above , the cycle begins with denial , and ultimately ends up in despair .
At first , the company denounces that anything is wrong , but Mr. Market has a way of sniffing out who is imitating Pinocchio .
Ultimately , the company ends up in despair when they need / want to raise capital to just be able to function normally , but alas , they cannot because the window of opportunity to raise capital has shut .
Let 's use Lehman Brothers as the poster child of this sort of behavior .
I wrote a piece last week that singled out National City , Washington Mutual and Lehman Brothers .
Before the credit crisis started , Lehman , at the time known for its savvy timing , suddenly came to market for $ 5 billion of long - term bonds when they did n't need capital - or did they know something was awry as I suspect ?
Last year , with the Credit Crisis in its infancy , Lehman announced a $ 100,000,000 stock buyback .
The shares , as you would expect , popped on the news , but of course no stock was ever re-purchased .
As the stock began to sell off , they kept saying that capital was not needed .
Then , on June 9 , 2008 they sold 143,000,000 shares at $ 28 per share .
As hedge fund manager David Einhorn said , " They 've raised billions of dollars they said they did n't need to replace losses they said they did n't have . "
In between was an enormous preferred stock deal - 75,900,000 shares at $ 25 per share at a rate of 7.95 % .
Those shares now change hands at $ 15 per share for a yield of 13.1 % .
Its pretty hard to turn a profit when your cost of capital is greater than 10 % .
During this time , in January , the company actually raised its common dividend by 15 % year - over - year .
They have written off north of $ 8 billion since the Credit Crisis began and when they release earnings ( or lack thereof ) next month , estimates are for another round of $ 2 - 4 billion of write - downs .
They have reportedly been trying to shop $ 40 billion of impaired real estate and they are mired in all sorts of Alt A , sub - prime , CMBS and CDO 's and CLO's .
The best part is that they said they " shrank their balance sheet " when in fact they were sold to an " off balance sheet subsidiary " that they own part of .
The bonds were n't sold , they were just " relocated " .
I sure wish I could do that when I make a mistake .
And lets not forget that the Federal Reserve opened up the discount window to primary / dealers so that they could off - load a bunch of nuclear waste on to the Fed 's balance sheet , which now looks like one big hedge fund in drag .
And then the SEC temporarily changed short selling rules for ' the Group of 19 ' ( the GSE 's and Primary Dealers ) for a few weeks , resulting in a short squeeze , but their shares still hobble along at recent lows .
On Friday , there was a rumor that the Korean Development Bank would buy Lehman , but again that turned out to be hogwash .
And if they wanted to raise debt , like they say , " lotsa luck " .
Their bonds trade around +500 basis points to treasuries but my guess is that even if they could get deal done , they would have to come in the 10 % range , again , uneconomic .
So now we have the recipe and an example for " Dead Men Walking " :
Common stock too low to issue new shares .
Preferred stock yield too high to issue new shares economically .
Issuing debt is uneconomic .
More write - offs coming in days to come .
Business trends are awful .
Denial .
Now that we have identified the " poster child " , let 's find a few more ...
Or sadly , more than a few .
Zions Bancorp
Equity has traded down from $ 75 to $ 25 .
Tried to issue a $ 200 million preferred stock offering at 9.5 % but only was able to sell $ 47 million .

Who are in the " Limping but Not Dead Man Walking Crowd " ?

They include :
Citi
Merrill Lynch
Morgan Stanley
Suntrust
Legg Mason
Capital One
AIG
MetLife
Prudential
Summary - This is NOT Shaping Up to be a Pretty Couple of Years
I am certain that I have missed a bunch of names on the " Dead man Walking List " , but the pattern is rather easy to discern .
As I stated early on , when we have one or two firms in trouble , we can deal with it .
But when we add rising unemployment , explosive debt growth in recent years and non-performing assets to many hobbled financial institutions with trillions of dollars of exposure , it is hard not to be concerned .
For this reason , we remain cautious towards credit , expect a hard sell - off in stocks into 2010 , consolidation in the financial services industry and some pain , like it or not .
I am just not sure where the capital will come from to bail everyone out simultaneously .
And even if the capital showed up , it would likely come at a cost that is uneconomic and would likely be dilutive for many years to come .
It is why we expect much lower than consensus earnings across the board and lower stock prices ahead .
In the meantime , we sit with our historically cheap GNMA 's at the widest spreads in 20 years and continue to add to that position .
In the meantime we position our portfolios so that if we are wrong , the most we can lose is opportunity , not precious capital .

The perils of visceral voting
One could almost envisage John McCain ’s cheshire grin as his strategists whispered into his ear : “ Voters are basically stupid .
It ’s not about substance ; it ’s about style .
It ’s not about knowing the issues ; it ’s about appealing to the worst in human nature , while pretending you ’re appealing to the best . ”
The perils of visceral voting
“ Think about it John !
Voters have elected movie and television stars to governorships , to Congress , and even to the presidency .
Oftentimes , if those stars die while in office , voters elect their spouses , as if osmosis gives the wives and husbands of deceased elected officials some bizarre form of political acumen .
Even people who helped others steal elections have won elections themselves ! ”
“ As the ‘ good - old - boys ’ in West Virginia have shown , you ’re already guaranteed a number of votes simply because your opponent is African - American .
And a bigot ’s vote counts as much as the vote of a person with honor .
What you need to do now is market yourself to those voters who are disgruntled over the defeat of Hillary Clinton .
You can do that by picking a woman as your running mate .
She can be as diametrically opposed to Hillary Clinton ’s political views as George W. Bush is to sanity , and it wo n’t matter . ”
While the author of this article cannot truly claim that the above discourse took place , when I first heard that John McCain had selected Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate , I did immediately ask myself , “ Is he really so cynical , or so naïve , that he does n’t think voters will see through his transparent attempt to exploit the gender card ? ”
A few days later , I discovered that my thoughts were being echoed by Pulitzer Prize winning commentator Leonard Pitts , of the Miami Herald .
In his column , Pitts also noted the “ irony ” of McCain choosing Palin , since the political party McCain represents “ has spent years inveighing against so - called ‘ identity politics . ’ ”
In fact , during his campaigns , George W. Bush incessantly pandered to the twin evils of racism and sexism by denouncing affirmative action policies — designed to remedy discrimination against minorities and women — as “ preferential treatment . ”
Obviously far too many voters were oblivious to the fact that Bush , through his family ’s wealth and influence , benefited from “ preferential treatment ” his entire life .
As I ’ve often stated in previous Pravda .
Ru articles , Bush is not adverse to “ preferential treatment , ” as long as he , and his wealthy white supporters , are the preferred .
A few days after McCain ’s announcement , polls appeared to indicate that his strategy was working .
Suddenly a plethora of “ undecided ” voters , white women in particular , threw their support behind the McCain / Palin ticket .
A prominent feminist even claimed that women have endured worse discrimination than African - Americans , because African - American men were granted the right to vote decades before women were .
While this is chronologically correct , it is nonetheless a specious argument .
It is true that African - American men were constitutionally given the right to vote in 1870 , whereas women were not allowed to vote until 1920 .
In reality , however , the voting rights of all African - Americans , male and female , especially in the postbellum South , were nullified in 1877 after Rutherford B. Hayes , to win a disputed presidential election , agreed to remove Northern troops from the former Confederate States , dooming African - Americans who resided there to a system of segregation and disfranchisement that cartoonist Thomas Nast described as “ worse than slavery . ”
This disfranchisement lasted for almost a century , and evidence of its power , and the racism it engendered , can still be seen by looking at the history and current makeup of the United States Senate .
Nineteen women have served in the Senate , and sixteen are serving today .
By contrast , only three African - Americans have ever been elected to the Senate , and only one , Barack Obama , is currently serving .
Undoubtedly many will argue that there is nothing wrong with supporting Palin solely because of her gender , since African - Americans are supporting Barack Obama solely because of his race .
But this ignores that fact that many African - Americans do not support African - American politicians when these politicians act adversely to their interests .
This was evident in the 2006 gubernatorial race in Ohio , where African - Americans resoundingly rejected John Kenneth Blackwell .
Blackwell , an African - American and supporter of George W. Bush during the 2004 election , was suspected , in his capacity as Secretary of State , of wrongfully disfranchising minority voters so he could deliver Ohio ’s electoral votes ( and , as it turned out , the election ) to Bush .
Of course , many voters are claiming it is not Palin ’s gender that persuaded them to support the McCain / Palin ticket , but her other attributes :
It was her speech at the Republican Convention ; it ’s her “ family values ; ” it ’s her “ faith . ”
One woman even said that , as a woman , Palin could more readily identify with the pain of losing a child in combat in Iraq , while an idiot on the Faux “ News ” Channel tried to argue , with a straight face , that Palin has “ international political experience ” because of Alaska ’s proximity to Russia , which apparently means everyone residing in Washington D.C. has presidential experience since they live near the White House .
But television shows and movies have shown that any moderately skilled person can effectively deliver a scripted speech .
Actors on medical dramas like House and ER routinely rattle off medical terminology with unwavering proficiency .
But this does n’t make them doctors , nor does Palin ’s well - rehearsed speech make her qualified to potentially run a country that is arguably the most powerful on earth .
Palin’s “ family values ” are also questionable .
Although there were vociferous right - wing condemnations of the media for revealing the pregnancy of Palin ’s seventeen - year - old daughter Britney , many reporters correctly pointed out that Palin ’s self - serving political ambitions were primarily responsible for catapulting her daughter ’s situation into the international spotlight .
Recently The Daily Show ’s Jon Stewart exposed the hypocrisy of Palin apologists who contend that Britney ’s pregnancy is a “ private ” matter .
One of these apologists is Faux “ News ” Channel ’s sexually harassing blowhard , Bill O’Reilly .
Now suddenly concerned about preserving the Palin family ’s “ privacy , ” O’Reilly did not hesitate , a few months earlier , to label the parents of Jamie Lynn Spears “ pinheads ” after it was revealed that the sixteen - year - old actress and singer was pregnant .
Voters who are now failing to make any distinction between Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin should ask themselves :
What would these right - wing Palin apologists have said if an unmarried Chelsea Clinton had become pregnant during the latter years of Bill Clinton ’s presidency ?
It ’s a sure bet that all the current “ respect ” for privacy would be nonexistent .
In its stead would be twenty - four - hour images of Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones flashing across television screens , while the hypocritical “ family values ” crowd pontificated about how “ immorality breeds immorality . ”
As far as Palin ’s alleged “ faith ” is concerned , and the speeches she ’s delivered concerning it , I suppose if God is some vengeful warrior , and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are God ’s “ holy ” crusade , then one could dub her a “ believer . ”
Yet it should be remembered that those opposing the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan attribute the very same characteristics to God that Palin does .
Given how easily many voters were swayed by Palin , I began to wonder what motivates them in the first place .
Factoring in the gender and racial overtones of the upcoming election , my hypothesis is that most voters choose candidates who appeal to their basest instincts , then look for ways to rationalize their choices .
For example , I recall an instance where a woman announced she would n’t vote for Obama because “ She did n’t like what he stood for . ”
But when asked what he stood for , she could n’t give an answer .
Why ?
Because her honest answer would have been , “ I ’m not voting for Obama because he ’s black . ”
An inherent problem with visceral voting is it degenerates the democratic process into something ludicrously hypocritical .
The mantra of the day becomes , “ Even though it is wrong for my opponent , it is not wrong for me . ”
This is why the allegations that “ sexism ” is the impetus behind the criticism of Sarah Palin ring hollow .
After all , many of the people making these claims have relentlessly attacked Hillary Clinton over the years , and then justified their attacks by asserting that a woman in politics should not expect special treatment just because she ’s a woman .
Another problem with visceral voting is it creates and elevates “ people without principles , ” who do and say anything to attain political office .
This , in turn , eliminates any possibility of an honest and visionary leader ever getting elected .
In 1968 , for example , Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was being encouraged to run for president on a third - party ticket .
But he never would have won .
In addition to the aversion most voters have to candidates outside the two - party system , King ’s devotion to non-violence , his advocacy for the poor and his tendency to speak the truth would have doomed him .
Contrast this with John McCain , who voted against the creation of the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday in 1983 .
Not surprisingly , Arizona , the state McCain then represented ( and currently represents ) , was also one of the last to recognize the King holiday , and even then , many critics contend , this recognition was more intended to encourage the National Football League ( NFL ) to play its preeminent game , the Super Bowl , in Arizona than to honor Dr. King .
Now that McCain has presidential ambitions , he has predictably conceded that his vote against the King Holiday was a “ mistake . ”
But if there were no King Holiday in America would he still consider his vote to be a “ mistake ? ”
Regardless of who wins the presidential election of 2008 , the loser is evident .
It is America , a nation still deeply divided along the lines of race and gender , a nation where the color of one ’s skin or the shape of one ’s genitalia is apparently more relevant to voters than qualities like honesty , integrity , altruism or the hope for a better world .

Whole Foods ( WFMI ) is down almost 20 % this morning after an atrocious Q3 ( do n't say we did n't warn you ) .
WFMI reported downside to both EPS ( $ 0.24 vs. $ 0.31 consensus ) and revenue ( $ 1.8 billion vs. $ 1.9 billion consensus ) .
' The premium food retailer also said , due to a weak economy , it would suspend its quarterly dividend and curb expansion plans .
Whole Foods ' guidance was awful , too .
WFMI forecasted a profit of $ 0.13 to $ 0.15 a share for Q4 and $ 0.93 to $ 0.95 cents a share for the full year .
The Street expected $ 0.27 a share for Q4 an $ 1.15 a share for the year .
Now , Wall Street is jumping ship :
Citi maintains HOLD , target cut from $ 32 to $ 20 .
" WFMI reported comps of 2.6 % , below the 5.7 % trend seen in the first 4 weeks of the qtr due to weak economic conditions , competition , and cannibalization from new stores .
We think investors were probably expecting 4 - 5 % comps for the Q. "
" Given updated guidance and weak margin and comp sales trends , we are lowering our ’ 08 - ’10 estimates by 21c , 51c , and 47 c , respectively .
Lowering tgt px by $ 12 given lower estimates and target multiple . "
Credit Suisse maintains NEUTRAL , target cut from $ 30 to $ 15 .
" Disappointing is an understatement ... Whole Foods reported an extremely disappointing quarter and provided a sobering outlook , as the combination of a weakening consumer and mismanagement continues to plague the company . "
" Liquidity is developing into a potential issue .
WFMI generates $ 8 billion in sales , is junk rated and has only $ 130 million available under its revolver .
We estimate that the company will burn cash of $ 75 + million in Q4 and be free cash neutral in '09 only after eliminating its $ 100 + million dividend , reducing new store openings to 15 from 25 - 30 , and cutting non-growth discretionary capex by 50 % .
We believe the company may need to raise capital if it fails to achieve its EPS guidance ( a realistic possibility ) or ultimately reaccelerates store growth . "
ThinkPanmure downgrades from Accumulate to SOURCE OF FUNDS , target cut from $ 26 to $ 19 .
Q3 was " disappointing . "
MidWest downgrades from Buy to NEUTRAL .
Q3 results were " weak " and outlook was " disappointing . "

These breakfast burritos are not fancy .
These breakfast burritos are not gourmet .
These breakfast burritos are not haute Tex - Mex cuisine .
These breakfast burritos are exactly that : breakfast burritos , and I often make them for my husband and kids when they ’re at the pens working cattle at breakfast time .
They ’re as simple as it gets … and you know what ?
SO AM I !
Yep , that ’s me — simple .
Just give me a remote control , a laptop , a pedicure , a manicure , a deep tissue massage , a pint of Coffee Haagen Dazs , an unlimited shopping spree at B & H , a Toni Collette movie , and a stack of Archie comic books and I ’ll stay out of your hair for at least eight minutes .
See ?
I ’m as simple as they come .
My point is , if you ’re looking for fancy chipotle - asiago - chorizo - poblano - fancy - o breakfast burritos this morning … you ’ve come to the wrong wife and mother .
And I ’ve tried that route ; believe me , I ’ve tried it .
The problem is , my family — my husband and four spawn — are n’t jiggy wit ’ chipotle - asiago - chirozo - poblano - fancy - o stuff .
They want it straight up and Middle - Americano , without a lot of adornment .
But the great thing about this recipe is , it ’s basic .
And you can use the basic method to create whatever degree of amped - up breakfast burrito you ’re in the mood for .
As the recipe proceeds , I ’ll let you know the things I ’d add to the mix if I were living in a tiny apartment in Chicago by myself , just to give you some more ideas .
Let ’s hurry this along — they ’ve got to be horseback by dawn !
The Cast of Characters : Flour Tortillas , Browned Breakfast Sausage , Breakfast Potatoes , Monterey Jack Cheese , Eggs , Chives , Seasoned Salt , Pepper , and whatever else you want to throw in there .
Let ’s rewind for just a second ; we need to make the make some breakfast potatoes .
Follow my basic recipe for those , except this time we ’re going to add in some red and green bell peppers .
( You can also use frozen diced potatoes if you ’d like , but I never have things like that in my freezer when I need ’em . )
Basically , I sautee coarsely chopped red and green bell pepper over high heat …
… Until the peppers get a tiny bit black .
Remove them from the pan , then dice some cooked ( I boil them until tender but still a bit firm ) red or russet potatoes .
Throw those in the same pan and cook until brown …
Then add in the peppers and onions .
Cook for about ten minutes , or until nice and golden brown , then set aside .
Hello , Breakfast Potatoes .
I love you …and I always will .
Just sit tight for a moment , okay ?
Your life ’s purpose shall be revealed very shortly .
Now , in the same dadgum skillet ( we ranch wives like to use the same dadgum skillet ) , brown a pound of breakfast sausage .
When I say “ breakfast sausage , ” I mean pork sausage that ’s typically cut into patties and fried .
For breakfast .
Think Jimmie Dean .
Think J.C. Potter .
Think that stuff band geeks sell .
Oh , how I love band geeks .
They ’re my life .
NOTE : You can use whatever sausage makes your skirt fly up .
Chorizo !
Chorizo would work swimmingly .
When it ’s browned , drain off the grease .
I know , I know … that ’s not like me .
But do n’t worry .
I ’ll make up for it .
IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE :
When you ’re cooking with your friend , Hyacinth , and her seven - year - old boy brings a frog into the kitchen , do n’t panic .
And DON ’T throw it in the skillet with the breakfast sausage .
You ’ll regret it .
DON ’T DO IT !!!!
Now , crack about a dozen eggs into a bowl , or whatever ol ’ thing is clean .
And please do n’t panic : THIS RECIPE CAN BE HALVED .
Not everybody eats as much as my family … I ’m trying to remember that .
Whisk the eggs , then add in a bunch of chopped chives , some seasoned salt , some black pepper , and plenty ( at least a cup , but more is better ) of grated Monterey Jack .
NOTE : Feel free to also add cayenne pepper , Tabasco , Picante Sauce , cilantro , and / or another kind of cheese .
Caciotta cheese is quickly becoming my favorite , but my family quickly forms a picket line if I add anything weird .
Okay — back to the skillet !
Throw some breakfast potatoes in with the drained sausage …
Stir well to combine over low heat .
Now pour the egg / cheese mixture over the top .
Now , THE KEY HERE is not to overstir / overmesswith .
Particularly if you use homemade breakfast potatoes , the potatoes will fall apart and become mushy if you stir it around too much .
( Frozen diced potatoes hold their shape better . )
Just keep the eggs cooking over low heat ( so they wo n’t brown ) , and turn them occasionally to cook .
A few minutes later , this is what you ’ll have !
As always , check the seasoning to make sure it ’s scrumptious enough .
Add in more salt , pepper , or picante sauce , if that suits you .
The point is to have everything already inside , so The Hungry can simply unwrap ’em and eat ’em .
I like to add a ton more cheese at this point .
But that ’s just me .
To assemble , simply spoon a generous portion of the egg mixture into a warm , soft flour tortilla .
And if it were me , I ’d throw on some more picante or Pico de Gallo , for goodness sake .
And because I ’m rebellious , I ’d spoon on some green salsa and maybe even a bit of sour cream .
But these were for my family .
So I left them well enough alone .
To roll them up ( I can hear you saying “ DUH ” .
You do n’t know I can hear you , but I do ! ) just tuck in the sides …
And roll ’em up , trying to keep them as tight as possible .
Then , I just wrap the little sweethearts in individual sheets of foil and , if I ’m just walking to the pens by our house , I ’ll place them in a napkin - lined basket .
Then I ’ll adjust my hair ribbon and tie a chiffon scarf around my just - fixed hair .
Then I ’ll wake up .
Another thing you can do if you ’re transporting these to a hungry crowd is to simply place them , toasty and warm , in a small cooler .
They ’ll keep one another warm in the process .
Enjoy !
Invisibility cloak now within sight : scientists Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This PARIS ( AFP ) -
The age - old fantasy of making yourself invisible has taken a step toward reality , with scientists saying they have created three - dimensional materials that can bend visible light .
For the moment , the vanishing act takes place on a nanoscale , measured in billionths of a metre .
But there is no fundamental reason why the same principles cannot be scaled up one day to make invisibility cloaks big enough to hide a person , a tank or even a tanker , the scientists say .
The groundbreaking experiments , led by Xiang Zhang at the University of California at Berkeley , were reported simultaneously Sunday in the British journal Nature and the US - based journal Science .
Recent advances have created other so - called metamaterials , artificially engineered structures with optical properties that bend light in unnatural ways .
But previous attempts had three serious limitations .
One was that they only worked on the microwave range of the light spectrum , bending wavelengths much too long to be visible to the human eye .
The earlier technology was also limited to two - dimensional systems no thicker than a single layer of atoms .
Finally , a large portion of the light was absorbed rather than refracted , a form of energy loss that reduced the " invisibility " factor .
The new material , by contrast , produces the negative refractive needed to work within a visible light spectrum and in three dimensions .
Negative refraction -- or " left - handed " -- materials deflect light in a way that breaks the standard " right - handed " rules of electromagnetism .
Unhindered , light will travel in a straight line .
But it will change pathes when it travels from one medium to another .
A pencil sticking out of a glass of water , for example , appears to bend slightly starting at the interface of air and liquid .
But with metamaterials , light travels opposite the direction it would normally when it hits that interface -- the pencil now seems to bend backwards , out of the water , an optical effect that does not occur in nature .
The most immediate application of this new technology will be the construction of special lenses for optical microscopes that can focus on things as tiny as molecules .
" There is a significant need in biology to be able to image at high resolution , " Jason Valentine , a graduate student at Berkeley and lead author of the Nature paper , explained in an e-mail .
The resolution of traditional high - powered tools such as the electron microscope cannot exceed half of a wavelength of light , and have a tendency to cause damage to living cells , he said .
" Metamaterials would be a better optical imaging method since it would be non-invasive , " Jie Yao , lead author of the Science article , told AFP .
But the holy grail of metamaterial research has become the kind of magic shroud of invisibility that has fired the human imagination from H.G. Wells ' " Invisible Man " to the adventures of Harry Potter .
" In the case of such cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock , " Zhang said .
" An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it , making it seem to disappear . "
The United States military , which funded the research , is especially keen to develop materials that could usher in an entire new generation of stealth technology .
But it is n't going to happen overnight .
" To scale up such a material to sizes visible to the naked eye will be very time - consuming and very costly , " said Yao .
One of the two metamaterials developed by Zhang and his colleagues has a multi- layered fishnet structure composed of alternating layers of silver and magnesium fluoride .
" The fish - net structure is counter - intuitive because , as we stack the material in layers , the energy loss is reduced instead of increased , " Yao said .
Previous experiments has shown that the bulkier the material , the higher the loss .
The second material , reported in Science , is composed of silver nanowires grown inside a porous aluminium matrix .

Most developers do n’t know about — or do n’t care enough about — binding in JavaScript .
Yet this single issue is responsible for a sizeable portion of the questions on most JavaScript - related support channels , and thousands — if not millions — of hairs being tortured away from developer heads every single day .
Yet with a little attention to this oft - overlooked subject , you can avoid wasting your time , energy , and patience and move on to more powerful , efficient scripting .

Why should we care about binding ?
#section2
Almost no major object - oriented programming ( OOP ) languages force you to consider binding .
That is , they do n’t require you to explicitly qualify access to the current object ’s members ( methods and properties ) with a reference such as this or self .
If you ’re calling a method on no particular object , you ’re usually calling it on the current object .
The same goes when you ’re passing a method around for later invocation : it will retain its current object .
In short , for most OOP languages , binding is implicit .
This is true in Java , C# , Ruby , Delphi , and C++ , to name but a few .
PHP and JavaScript do require you to explicitly state which object you ’re accessing , even if it ’s the current one .
( And that is about as far as I ’m willing to put PHP and JavaScript in the same basket . )
Of course , neither PHP nor JavaScript are actually object - oriented in the traditional sense .
In the case of PHP , object support was added , rather slapdash , as an afterthought ; even in PHP5 , functions are not first - order values , and many OOP features are lackluster .
JavaScript is very dynamic and relies on “ prototypal inheritance , ” which is a significantly different paradigm than class - based inheritance .
Such distinctions do not immediately relate to binding issues , but demonstrate that traditional object - related syntaxes and behaviors were of little importance to the designers of JavaScript .
In JavaScript , binding is always explicit , and can easily be lost , so a method using this will not refer to the proper object in all situations , unless you force it to .
Overall , binding in JavaScript is not a difficult concept , but it is far too often ignored or glossed over by JavaScripters , which leads to confusion .
Let ’s step in it #section3
Consider the following , innocuous - looking examples , and how their actual behavior can seem unpredictable .
var john = { name : ' John ' , greet : function ( person ) { alert ( " Hi " + person + " , my name is " + name ) ; } };john.greet ( " Mark " ) ; // =>
" Hi Mark , my name is "
Okay , that ’s weird .
Where did the name go ?
Well , we were guilty of a binding assumption here : our method just refers to name , which JavaScript will look for in the several valid levels of variables , ending up with the properties of the window object .
Of course our window does have a name property , but it ’s empty by default , so no name shows up .
Let ’s try it out :
name = ' Ray ' ; //
Or explictly : window.name = ' Ray ' ; var john = { name : ' John ' , greet : function ( person ) { alert ( " Hi " + person + " , my name is " + name ) ; } };john.greet ( " Mark " ) ; // =>
" Hi Mark , my name is Ray "
Well , that ’s just dandy , but useless .
What we want is our object ’s name property , not the one in window !
Here is where explicit binding is important :
var john = { name : ' John ' , greet : function ( person ) { alert ( " Hi " + person + " , my name is " + this.name ) ; } };john.greet ( " Mark " ) ; // =>
" Hi Mark , my name is John "
Notice how we prefix our reference to name with the keyword this : that ’s explicit binding .
And indeed it works !
Or does it ?
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
var john = { name : ' John ' , greet : function ( person ) { alert ( " Hi " + person + " , my name is " + this .name ) ; } };var fx = john. greet ; fx ( " Mark " ) ; // =>
" Hi Mark , my name is " ( or " Hi Mark , my name » is Ray " depending on where you 're trying it )
Perhaps you ’re not familiar with languages that treat functions as first - order values , in which case the line var fx = john. greet ; may seem weird .
This does not call the greet method , but creates a reference to it — an alias of sorts , if you will .
Hence , calling fx ends up calling the greet method .
However , we ’re apparently in some trouble all of a sudden : we ’re explicitly using the this keyword , yet it does not use John .
What gives ?
This is the single most important issue with JavaScript binding — something I ’ll refer to as “ binding loss . ”
It happens whenever you ’re accessing a method through a reference instead of directly through its owner object .
The method loses its implicit binding , and this stops referencing its owner object and goes back to its default value , which in this case is window ( so if window had a name property by then , it would be used ) .
Recognizing binding - sensitive code patterns #section4
Binding - sensitive code patterns involve passing method references , which usually happens through two possible means : either you ’re assigning a method as a value , or you ’re passing a method as an argument ( which is essentially the same thing , when you think about it ) .
Consider the following simple class definition ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
function Person ( first , last , age ) { this .
first = first ; this .
last = last ; this .age = age ; } Person. prototype = { getFullName : function ( ) { alert ( this .
first + ' ' + this .last ) ; } , greet : function ( other ) { alert ( " Hi " + other .
first + " , I'm " + » this .
first + " . " ) ; } } ;
Let ’s try it out ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
var elodie = new Person ( ' Elodie ' , ' Jaubert ' , 27 ) ; var christophe = new Person ( ' Christophe ' , » ' Porteneuve ' , 30 ) ; christophe.greet ( elodie ) ; // =>
" Hi Elodie , I'm Christophe . "
Looking good so far .
Let ’s push ahead :
function times ( n , fx , arg ) { for ( var index = 0 ; index < n ; ++index ) { fx(arg ) ; } }times ( 3 , christophe.greet , elodie ) ; // =>
Three times " Hi Elodie , I 'm undefined . " times ( 1 , elodie.getFullName ) ; // => " undefined undefined "
Whoa — we ’re in trouble !
What ’s with the undefined ?
We lost our binding when we passed greet and getFullName as arguments , so their this reference points to the window object , which does not have the first and last properties .
Boom .
When you do all your JavaScript heavy lifting by hand , as we just did , you ’re usually more aware of such issues .
But when you rely on a framework to handle the basics , binding can elude you , leaving you writing simple code that just borks .
Consider the following Prototype - based snippet :
this.items.each(function( item ) { // Process item this.markItemAsProcessed ( item ) ; } ) ;
This code will trigger an error stating that the markItemAsProcessed method is undefined .
Why is that ?
Because you just passed each a reference to an anonymous function , so this in there refers to window , not to what it was outside each .
This is a very common mistake , and makes up a fair share of the questions on the framework mailing lists .
Binding explicitly #section5
So how do we fix it ?
We bind explicitly — that is , we explicitly state to what this will point to within the method when it gets called .
And how do we do that ?
JavaScript provides us with two options : apply and call .
Apply within#section6
Every JavaScript function is equipped with an apply method that allows you to call that function with specific binding ( a specific this , if you will ) .
It takes two arguments : the binding object , and an array of the arguments to be passed to the function .
Here ’s an example based on our previous code :
var fx = christophe.
greet ; fx.apply ( christophe , [ elodie ] ) ; // =>
" Hi Elodie , I'm Christophe . "
The nice thing with an array is , you do n’t need to know in advance which arguments the function you ’ll call apply on will take .
You can write code independent of the actual argument list — just construct the array any way you want , and pass it on .
You can also take an existing array of arguments and tweak it to your heart ’s content before passing it along .
Call now #section7
When you do know exactly which arguments you want to pass , call may feel nicer , as it takes the arguments themselves , not an array of them :
var fx = christophe.
greet ; fx.call ( christophe , elodie ) ; // =>
" Hi Elodie , I'm Christophe . "
However , with call you lose the flexibility of an array .
It all depends on your particular situation : aside from this difference , apply and call have identical semantics and behavior .
Note , by the way , that the method does not actually need to belong to the object you ’re binding it to : as long as it uses this in ways that are compatible with its binding ( read : with members that exist in its bound object ) , we ’re in the clear .
Such flexibility is possible because JavaScript is a dynamic language that resolves member access at runtime — when the access happens — a feature sometimes referred to as “ late binding . ”
You ’ll also find late binding in just about every scripting language ( e.g. , Perl , Ruby , Python , PHP ) and , incidentally , OLE Automation .
Losing the shackles #section8
It ’s nice to have a way to specify binding , but the problem is , you can only specify it at invocation time .
You can’t , say , specify it in advance and then let some other code invoke your properly bound method when it sees fit .
This is a major problem , because when we pass method references around , we ’re doing just that : letting other code choose when to invoke methods .
So what we want is a way to persistently bind a method , so that we get a bound method reference , so to speak .
The only way to achieve this requires us to wrap our original method in another one , that will perform the apply call .
Here ’s a stab at it :
function createBoundedWrapper( object , method ) { return function ( ) { return method.apply ( object , arguments ) ; } ; }
If you ’re not too keen on JavaScript , the code above may confuse you a bit .
The idea here is that calling createBounded Wrapper with a given object and method ( which , presumably , belongs to said object ) will produce a brand new function ( the anonymous one we ’re returning ) .
That function , when called , will take our original method and invoke apply on it , passing :
the original object ’s binding ( the variable named object ) , and whatever arguments were provided at call time , as an array .
( Every function has an automatic arguments variable that behaves as an array of all the arguments that were passed to it . )
Let ’s try it out ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
var chrisGreet = createBoundedWrapper( christophe , » christophe.greet ) ; chrisGreet ( elodie ) ; // " Hi Elodie , I'm Christophe . "
Ah -ha !
It works !
We created a bound method reference based on christophe and its greet method .
JavaScript frameworks do it #section9
Our createBounded Wrapper function is neat , but may prove a bit unwieldy .
If you ’re smart about your JavaScript work , you ’ll probably rely on a framework to smooth out browser incompatibilities , ease DOM access , and enhance JavaScript .
So let ’s have a look at how a few popular JavaScript frameworks deal with method binding .
Prototype has long equipped functions with a bind method that lets you do just that :
var chrisGreet = christophe.greet.bind(christophe ) ; chrisGreet ( elodie ) ;
Far too few people know that bind also allows you to do “ partial application ” — that is , pre-filling one or more arguments .
For instance , let ’s say you have a method that toggles the active status of a feature :
var coolBehavior = { // ... toggle : function ( enabled ) { this .
enabled = enabled ; // ... } , // ... } ;
You can easily define two shortcuts — enable and disable — in the following way ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
coolBehavior.enable = coolBehavior.toggle.bind » ( coolBehavior , true ) ; coolBehavior.disable = coolBehavior.toggle.bind » ( coolBehavior , false ) ;// And then : coolBehavior.enable ( ) ;
A note on proper usage : sometimes , bind was used for pre-filling only , without interest in the binding .
Something like the following may be seen in code :
function times ( count , fx ) { for ( var index = 0 ; index < count ; ++index ) { fx ( ) ; } } // ... var threeTimes = times. bind ( null , 3 ) ; // ... threeTimes ( someFunction ) ;
So as a side note , with Prototype 1.6 , if you ’re only interested in pre-filling , prefer curry — it preserves the current binding and focuses on argument pre-filling :
var threeTimes = times.curry ( 3 ) ;
Ext JS#section11
The Ext JS library tailors binding through a method added to functions , called createDelegate .
The syntax goes like this ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
method.createDelegate( scope[ , argArray ] » [ , appendArgs = false ] )
First , note that the extra arguments you may specify are provided as an array , instead of inline : myMethod.createDelegate(scope , [ arg1 , arg2 ] ) , not myMethod.createDelegate( scope , arg1 , arg2 ) .
Another important nuance is that these arguments will replace whatever arguments you pass at call time , instead of resulting in partial application .
If you want the latter , you need to pass true ( which will append the argument array , when Prototype would prepend them instead ) or an insert position as a third argument ( typically , using zero will prepend ) .
Here ’s an example lifted from the API documentation ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
var fn = scope.func1.createDelegate( scope , » [ arg1 , arg2 ] , true ) ; fn( a , b , c ) ; // => scope.func1 ( a , b , c , arg1 , arg2 ) ; var fn = scope.func1.createDelegate( scope , » [ arg1 , arg2 ] ) ; fn(a , b , c ) ; // => scope.func1(arg1 , arg2 ) ; var fn = scope.func1.createDelegate( scope , » [ arg1 , arg2 ] , 1 ) ; fn( a , b , c ) ; // => scope.func1 ( a , arg1 , arg2 , b , c ) ;
The Dojo toolkit also caters to method binding with the humorously named hitch function .
The syntax is :
dojo.hitch(scope , methodOrMethodName[ , arg … ] )
Interestingly , the method can be passed either directly , or using its name .
Extra arguments , if any , are passed before actual , call - time arguments .
Here are a few examples :
var fn = dojo. hitch ( scope , func1 ) fn(a , b , c ) ; // => scope.func1 ( a , b , c ) ; var fn = dojo. hitch ( scope , func1 , arg1 , arg2 ) fn(a , b , c ) ; // => scope.func1 ( arg1 , arg2 , a , b , c ) ;
Dean Edwards ’ superb Base2 library acts as a least common denominator of sorts to all JavaScript libraries by ironing out all the annoying differences in JavaScript implementations .
It acknowledges a binding facility is needed and provides a simple bind function :
base2.bind ( method , scope [ , arg ] ) ;
Note the scope object comes second , not first .
Aside from that , the semantics are strictly equivalent to Prototype ’s bind or Dojo ’s hitch :
var fn = base2.bind ( func1 , scope ) fn(a , b , c ) ; // => scope.func1 ( a , b , c ) ; var fn = base2.bind ( func1 , scope , arg1 , arg2 ) fn(a , b , c ) ; // => scope.func1 ( arg1 , arg2 , a , b , c ) ;
j Query does not provide such a binding facility .
The library ’s philosophy favors closures over binding and forces users to jump through hoops ( that is , manually combine lexical closures and apply or call , much as other libraries do internally ) when they actually need to pass along a piece of code referring to “ instance members . ”
Should you even bind ?#section15
Now that we ’ve been through the details of binding , it ’s only fair to stress that sometimes , binding is overkill .
Specifically , there ’s a code pattern in which binding can be replaced , with significant performance profit , by using the lexical closure .
( If you ’re not clear on a what a closure is , do n’t panic . )
Here ’s the pattern : some code within a method relies on an anonymous function passed by reference to work .
That anonymous function needs to access the surrounding method ’s this keyword .
For instance , assuming for a minute we have the each iterator within arrays , consider the following code again :
// ... processItems : function ( ) { this.items.each(function ( item ) { // Process item … this.markItemAsProcessed ( item ) ; } ) ; } , // ...
The issue here is that the anonymous function holding the actual processing code is passed as an argument to each , and therefore loses the current binding .
When it attempts to call this .
markItemAsProcessed , it crashes because window has no such method .
Many developers are quick to fix that with binding .
Using Prototype , for instance , they would add the following tweak :
// ... processItems : function ( ) { this.items.each(function( item ) { // Process item this.markItemAsProcessed ( item ) ; }.bind ( this ) ) ; } , // ...
Notice the trailing call to bind .
However , such code is not as good an idea as it may seem .
We saw that achieving such a “ bound reference ” requires us to wrap the original method within an anonymous function , which means calling the bound method reference results in two method calls : our anonymous wrapper , and the original method .
And if there ’s one thing true of just about any language , it ’s that method calls are costly .
In this situation , we have access to the original , desired this keyword in the same code location where we define and call the faulty function ( the anonymous method we ’re passing as an argument to each ) .
We can simply save the proper this reference in a local variable , and use that inside our iteration function :
// ... processItems : function ( ) { var that = this ; this.items.each(function( item ) { // Process item that.markItemAsProcessed ( item ) ; } ) ; } , // ...
Look , Ma !
No binding !
This code uses a language feature called “ lexical closure . ”
In short , closures let code at point A access identifiers declared in scopes surrounding A . Here , our anonymous function has access to variables in the surrounding function — our process Items method .
Such a closure will be maintained by the JavaScript runtime no matter what , so there is no extra cost to using it .
Even if there were , I ’m fairly confident that it would be far less than the cost of an extra function call at every turn of the loop .
Be cautious about your bindings : sometimes closures provide a simpler , shorter , and better way .
( Which is , I believe , precisely why jQuery decided to “ force ” its users to think about the best option for each situation by having them deal with binding manually . )
While closures do have their own set of problems — ill - employed , they can result in memory leaks for certain browsers — the usage I recommend here is pretty safe .
Takeaway points #section16
To recap :
Any member access must be qualified with the object it pertains to , even when it is this .
.
Any sort of function reference ( assigning as a value , passing as an argument ) loses the function ’s original binding .
JavaScript provides two equivalent ways of explicitly specifying a function ’s binding when calling it : apply and call .
and .
Creating a “ bound method reference ” requires an anonymous wrapper function , and a calling cost .
In specific situations , leveraging closures may be a better alternative .
And now , with the help of this article , you ’ll have no trouble in binding situations !

Melting Cathedrals & Fairytale Houses
Article by our guest writer M. Christian ( from " Meine kleine fabrik " ) .
M. Christian writes about odd , weird , and wonderful things - most of them are , just like life itself , as unexpected as possible
I thought I was on drugs .
Not that I knew what being on drugs was like , you understand .
I was , after all , a pretty clean - cut , mostly - normal , teenager spending a fairly - uneventful summer bumming around Europe : London , Paris , Berlin , Amsterdam , Athens , and so on in no particular order .
Then I turned a corner in Barcelona -- and was sure someone at the hostel the night before had slipped me something .
What other explanation was there ?
A building was melting for God 's sake !

The rest of the street was Spanish normal : warm brick facings , black toothed iron railings , arched windows , bursts of flowers on balconies , but right in the middle of average , of ordinary , of common , of commonplace was a building that sagged , that drooped , that arched , that ... well , that looked like it had been designed with vines and leaves in an orchard instead of with a T - square in a boxy office , planted from a seed and cultivated instead of having been mathematically assembled brick by stone cold brick .

I 'd heard of Antoni Gaudí , of course , but for some strange reason I either had n't made the connection between the eccentric architect and his hometown , or , more than likely , had n't a clue how brain - throbbingly amazing his work was .
But , drugs or no drugs , standing slack - jawed in front of the flowing glory of Casa Batlló on 43 Passeig de Gràcia , I decided I 'd spend the next few days seeing as much Gaudí genius as I could .
" A Nut , or a Genius ? "
Barcelona has become Gaudí's city , which is ironic since Gaudí did n’t start out as the city ’s cultural icon .
Far from it : for a long time his only real supporter was the very - rich Eusebi Güell .
It was only much later that the city , and Gaudí 's critics , finally began to understand what he was doing .
Park Güell -
Just look at his Park Güell ( named after you know who ) , just a short walk from Casa Batlló , up on el Carmel hill : everything in the park … flows -- like the concrete he used had been trapped , mid-liquid , as it cascaded down toward the city .
Benches are part of fountains which are part of walls which are part of stairs which are part of terraces which are part of columns -- Güell created a run-on architectural dream , an organically shaped wonderland for the city .

Before continuing in my footsteps , here ’s a bit more about Gaudí : an average student at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona , supposedly his instructor signed his architecture diploma saying " Who knows if we have given this diploma to a nut or to a genius .
Time will tell . "
While time certainly did tell , Gaudí at first did n’t have an easy time of it .
Fortunately for the world , Güell took those early risks with the eccentric architect and gave Gaudí a chance to put into reality the brilliance growing in his mind .
Casa Milà -
Just look at his Casa Milà ( aka La Pedrera ) : nothing about it looks assembled , or built .
Instead it looks like Gaudí plopped it there as a huge mountain of slippery clay then dug his thumbs and fingers into it to make windows , doors , balconies , and even chimneys .

The Unfinished Cathedral
These days green is the buzzword and organic is the phrase - of - the - moment : designers and builders from Berlin to Saudi Arabia are putting down their angles and degrees for sea shells and bird ’s wings , but all of them owe their biological inspiration to Gaudí .
Here ’s the man himself on the subject : “ The architect of the future will build imitating Nature , for it is the most rational , long - lasting and economical of all methods . ”
There ’s one very important detail I left out of my very short bio of Gaudí .
To fill that in let ’s go back in time to when his Park Güell was finished : the men are dapper in their black suits and high waistcoats , the women are splendid in their flowing skirts and elaborate hats , and the streets flow with horses ( because automobile has n’t been invented yet ) .
( image credit : Arutha )
Sure , green is on everyone ’s lips today , but Gaudí was creating mad masterpieces of organic shapes , living forms , and natural contours starting in 1883 ; Park Güell was finished in 1907 .
One more stop , one more building -- even though Gaudí has grown lots more in Barcelona .
Believe me , though , this one is worth the wait .
By the time he began working on the Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família , Gaudí was a legend but by his 40th year of working on it , both Barcelona and Gaudí had fallen on hard times .
According to some , Gaudí had grown so eccentric , so raggedy , that cabs refused to pick him up , assuming he was a tramp .
( image credit : Santiago Cer )
Gaudí never saw the Sagrada Família finished .
In fact no one has because , to this day , it ’s still a work in progress .
When Gaudí died in 1926 , after being hit by a streetcar no less , the Sagrada Família had only just begun to show its potential .
There ’s only one way to describe the Sagrada Família , what was to be -- and one day will be -- Gaudí ’s masterpiece : it ’s a cathedral .
( image credit : Stjepan Felber )
( image credit : Truus Stotteler , new sculptures designed after Gaudi's death by Josep Subirachs )
Sitting in the center of Barcelona , the Sagrada Família is a drip - sand castle , a towering bone - ribbed , seashell - vaulted , tower 170 meters tall ( about 500 feet for us Americans ) .
An ardent Catholic , Gaudí envisioned his cathedral to be his final statement , a perfect combination of natural shapes with inorganic materials , a crowing celebration of the beauty of living things .

Here is a great photo set , showing how the Sagrada Familia looks inside .

And a rather impressive manipulated rendition :

It ’s amazing to realize Gaudí did what he did at the turn of the last century , but it ’s absolutely stunning when you realize that this architect ’s masterpiece , if all goes as planned , will be finished in 2026 .
As Gaudí said it : “ My client is not in a hurry . ”

Dark Roasted Blend 's Photography Gear Picks :
U.S. citizens are twice as likely to land in New Jersey 's prisons as legal and illegal immigrants , according to new data that counter some of the most widely perceived notions about the link between immigration and crime .
Non-U.S. citizens make up 10 percent of the state 's overall population , but just 5 percent of the 22,623 inmates in prison as of July 2007 , according to an analysis of New Jersey Department of Corrections and U.S. Census data by The Star - Ledger .
As part of the federal government 's attempt to fix an immigration system that has allowed deportable criminals to go back on the streets , federal agents started scouring the inmate rolls of New Jersey 's state prisons last year .
The goal was to identify criminal aliens so they could be deported once they finished their sentences .
That effort yielded another dividend : the first - ever snapshot of the non-U.S. citizen population in New Jersey 's state prisons .
The statistics fall directly in line with several other new studies by sociologists that consistently have found the immigrant incarceration rates equal or lower to that of U.S. citizens .
The findings contradict one long - held conception about immigrants and crime .
The New Jersey statistics also come to light at a significant juncture , as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seeks to give local police departments a greater role in enforcing immigration laws in New Jersey and across the country .
" I first got into this because I heard all these terrible complaints that immigrants were a big part of the crime problem , " said Anne Morrison Piehl , an economics professor at Rutgers University who has researched incarceration rates among immigrants in California .
" When you look at incarceration rates , you find immigrants much less likely than the native born to be incarcerated , " Piehl added .
" Once you control for the fact that immigrants are generally younger and less educated , then the data you find is even more surprising . "
Advocates of tougher enforcement say the numbers do nothing to lessen the need to crack down on immigrants who commit crimes , including using local police to do it .
" I do n't want anyone to think the illegal immigrant population in general causes any more crime than the legal population , " said Morristown Mayor Donald Cresitello , who has applied to a federal program to deputize the town 's police officers as immigration agents .
" That 's not my position and statistics show that .
But we already have enough of our own criminals and we do n't have to invite criminals in . "
MYTH OR REALITY ?
Immigrant advocates say the numbers are proof that the " illegal immigrant crime wave " touted by anti-immigration groups on television and the internet is more myth than reality .
Several high - profile crimes committed by illegal immigrants , including the slaying of four college students in a Newark schoolyard last August , have fueled such misperceptions , they added .
" It 's popular fiction -- and the important word is fiction , " said Shai Goldstein , Executive Director of the New Jersey Immigration Policy Network .
" It has no foundation in reality as do most of the anti-immigrant arguments which are based on either misperceptions or outright bigotry and sometimes both . "
Under tougher immigration laws passed by Congress in 1996 , any immigrant , legal or illegal , who is convicted of an aggravated felony may be deported when his or her criminal sentence is completed .
But for years , understaffed federal immigration agencies could not keep up and that pushed many deportable criminals back onto the streets after they got out of jail or prison .
While there is still work to be done in the state 's county jails , ICE officials say their efforts to fix the problem in state prisons have been more successful .
From July 2002 to July 2007 , the number of state inmates subject to immigration detainers , or holds , more than doubled , from 570 to 1,195 , according to data from the New Jersey Department of Corrections .
Detainers , essentially notices that an inmate is not to be released without being turned over to ICE , are issued for both illegal immigrants and legal immigrants who may be stripped of their legal status because of their crimes .
" We 've got a handle on the state prisons , " said Scott Weber , Newark district director of ICE 's Office of Detention and Removal .
" I 'd be surprised if we were missing people . "
Despite the debate over what the data means , it provides the first snapshot of the criminal alien population in New Jersey 's 14 state prisons .
Many of them have rap sheets that vividly illustrate the huge holes in the system that allowed criminal aliens to avoid deportation despite repeat arrests and convictions .
Still , in almost all categories of crime , they are less likely to be imprisoned than their U.S. - born counterparts .
They account for 86 , or 5 percent , of the 1,670 murder charges against state inmates ; 27 , or seven percent , of the 360 aggravated sexual assaults ; and three percent of all drug - related charges .
Since many inmates are charged with more than one crime , the number of total convictions exceeds the inmate total .
Non-U.S. citizens account for 11 percent of all sexual assault convictions -- one of the only crimes for which they were equally , or slightly more likely , to be imprisoned than U.S. citizens .
Researchers say the New Jersey statistics fall squarely in line with numerous studies performed in recent years .
A study released earlier this year by Washington - based nonprofit Immigration Policy Center found that U.S. - born men ages 18 to 39 are five times more likely to be incarcerated than are their foreign - born peers .
And , while the number of illegal immigrants in the country doubled between 1994 and 2005 , violent crime declined by nearly 35 percent and property crimes by 26 percent over the same period .
Piehl , the Rutgers professor , cited several theories behind the statistics .
The process of immigration , which requires motivation and personal sacrifice , she said , may self - select types of people who are less likely to commit crimes .
Once they get here , the harsher penalties immigrants face , namely deportation , also prevents lawbreaking .
Immigration critics say the data paints only part of the picture of the relation between immigration , especially illegal immigration , and crime .
Steven Camarota , research director at the Center for Immigration Studies , a conservative think tank in Washington , D.C , called the New Jersey stats " good news " but cautioned they paint an incomplete picture .
He cited U.S. Border Patrol statistics showing that 15 percent of the illegal border crossers it apprehends have criminal records .
He also noted studies that show incarceration rates rise sharply among the children of immigrants .
" There seems to be this silly notion among politicians and researchers that if the incarceration rate is proportional , then that settles the debate , " Camarota said .
" It is n't just a question of proportionality , it 's a question of outrage that people who should not even be in the country and could have been weeded out for previous crimes are here at all . "

FOR all the undoubted wit of their neuroscience - inspired concept album , “ Heavy Mental ” — songs include “ Mind - Body Problem ” and “ All in a Nut ” — The Amygdaloids are unlikely to loom large in the annals of rock and roll .
Yet when the history of economics is finally written , Joseph LeDoux , the New York band 's singer - guitarist , may deserve at least a footnote .
In 1996 Mr LeDoux , who by day is a professor of neuroscience at New York University , published a book , “ The Emotional Brain : The Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life ” , that helped to inspire what is today one of the liveliest and most controversial areas of economic research : neuroeconomics .
Illustration by Otto
In the late 1990s a generation of academic economists had their eyes opened by Mr LeDoux 's and other accounts of how studies of the brain using recently developed techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) showed that different bits of the old grey matter are associated with different sorts of emotional and decision - making activity .
The amygdalas are an example .
Neuroscientists have shown that these almond - shaped clusters of neurons deep inside the medial temporal lobes play a key role in the formation of emotional responses such as fear .
These new neuroeconomists saw that it might be possible to move economics away from its simplified model of rational , self - interested , utility - maximising decision - making .
Instead of hypothesising about Homo economicus , they could base their research on what actually goes on inside the head of Homo sapiens .
The dismal science had already been edging in that direction thanks to behavioural economics .
Since the 1980s researchers in this branch of the discipline had used insights from psychology to develop more “ realistic ” models of individual decision - making , in which people often did things that were not in their best interests .
But neuroeconomics had the potential , some believed , to go further and to embed economics in the chemical processes taking place in the brain .
Early successes for neuroeconomists came from using neuroscience to shed light on some of the apparent flaws in H. economicus noted by the behaviouralists .
One much - cited example is the “ ultimatum game ” , in which one player proposes a division of a sum of money between himself and a second player .
The other player must either accept or reject the offer .
If he rejects it , neither gets a penny .
According to standard economic theory , as long as the first player offers the second any money at all , his proposal will be accepted , because the second player prefers something to nothing .
In experiments , however , behavioural economists found that the second player often turned down low offers — perhaps , they suggested , to punish the first player for proposing an unfair split .
Neuroeconomists have tried to explain this seemingly irrational behaviour by using an “ active MRI ” .
In MRIs used in medicine the patient simply lies still during the procedure ; in active MRIs , participants are expected to answer economic questions while blood flows in the brain are scrutinised to see where activity is going on while decisions are made .
They found that rejecting a low offer in the ultimatum game tended to be associated with high levels of activity in the dorsal stratium , a part of the brain that neuroscience suggests is involved in reward and punishment decisions , providing some support to the behavioural theories .
As well as the ultimatum game , neuroeconomists have focused on such issues as people 's reasons for trusting one another , apparently irrational risk - taking , the relative valuation of short - and long - term costs and benefits , altruistic or charitable behaviour , and addiction .
Releases of dopamine , the brain 's pleasure chemical , may indicate economic utility or value , they say .
There is also growing interest in new evidence from neuroscience that tentatively suggests that two conditions of the brain compete in decision - making : a cold , objective state and a hot , emotional state in which the ability to make sensible trade - offs disappears .
The potential interactions between these two brain states are ideal subjects for economic modelling .
Illustration by Otto
Already , neuroeconomics is giving many economists a dopamine rush .
For example , Colin Camerer of the California Institute of Technology , a leading centre of research in neuroeconomics , believes that incorporating insights from neuroscience could transform economics , by providing a much better understanding of everything from people 's reactions to advertising to decisions to go on strike .
At the same time , Mr Camerer thinks economics has the potential to improve neuroscience , for instance by introducing neuroscientists to sophisticated game theory .
“ The neuroscientist 's idea of a game is rock , paper , scissors , which is zero-sum , whereas economists have focused on strategic games that produce gains through collaboration . ”
Herbert Gintis of the Sante Fe Institute has even higher hopes that breakthroughs in neuroscience will help bring about the integration of all the behavioural sciences — economics , psychology , anthropology , sociology , political science and biology relating to human and animal behaviour — around a common , brain - based model of how people take decisions .
Mindless criticism
However , not everyone is convinced .
The fiercest attack on neuroeconomics , and indeed behavioural economics , has come from two economists at Princeton University , Faruk Gul and Wolfgang Pesendorfer .
In an article in 2005 , “ The Case for Mindless Economics ” , they argued that neuroscience could not transform economics because what goes on inside the brain is irrelevant to the discipline .
What matters are the decisions people take — in the jargon , their “ revealed preferences ” — not the process by which they reach them .
For the purposes of understanding how society copes with the consequences of those decisions , the assumption of rational utility - maximisation works just fine .
But today 's neuroeconomists are not the first dismal scientists to dream of peering inside the human brain .
In 1881 , a few years after William Jevons argued that the functioning of the brain 's black box would not be known , Francis Edgeworth proposed the creation of a “ hedonimeter ” , which would measure the utility that each individual gained from his decisions .
“ From moment to moment the hedonimeter varies ; the delicate index now flickering with the flutter of the passions , now steadied by intellectual activity , low sunk whole hours in the neighbourhood of zero , or momentarily springing up towards infinity , ” he wrote , poetically for an economist .
This is “ equivalent to neuroeconomics ' brain scan , ” notes David Colander , an economist at Middlebury College in Vermont , in an article last year in the Journal of Economic Perspectives , “ Edgeworth 's Hedonimeter and the Quest to Measure Utility ” .
Later economists such as Irving Fisher , Frank Ramsey ( who proposed a utility - measuring machine called a “ psychogalvanometer ” ) and Friedrich von Hayek would discuss the role of the complex inner workings of the brain .
Hayek cited early advances in neuroscience to explain why each individual has a unique perspective on the world .
The reason why economists in the late 19th century and much of the 20th put the rational utility - maximising individual at the heart of their models was not that they thought that economics should avoid looking into the brain , but because they lacked the technical means to do so , says Mr Colander .
“ Economics became a deductive science because we did n't have the tools to gather information inductively .
Now , better statistical tools and neuroscience are opening up the possibility that economics can become an abductive science that combines elements of deductive and inductive reasoning . ”
The big question now is whether the tools of neuroscience will allow economics to fulfil Edgeworth 's vision — or , if that is too much to ask , at least to be grounded in the physical reality of the brain .
Studies in the first decade of neuroeconomics relied heavily on active MRI scans .
Economists ' initial excitement at being able to enliven their seminars with pictures of parts of the brain lighting up in response to different experiments ( so much more interesting than the usual equations ) has led to a recognition of the limits of MRIs .
“ Curiosity about neuroscience among economists has outstripped what we have to say , for now , ” admits Mr Camerer .
A standard MRI identifies activity in too large a section of the brain to support much more than loose correlations .
“ Blood flow is an indirect measure of what goes on in the head , a blunt instrument , ” concedes Kevin McCabe , a neuroeconomist at George Mason University .
Increasingly , neuroscientists are looking for clearer answers by analysing individual neurons , which is possible only with invasive techniques — such as sticking a needle into the brain .
For economists , this “ involves risks that clearly outweigh the benefits , ” admits Mr McCabe .
Most invasive brain research is carried out on rats and monkeys which , though they have similar dopamine - based incentive systems , lack the decision - making sophistication of most humans .
One new technique being used by some neuroeconomists is transcranial magnetic stimulation , in which a coil held next to the head issues a low - level magnetic pulse that temporarily disrupts activity in a certain part of the brain , to see if that changes the subject 's preferences — for example , for a particular food and how much he is willing to pay for it .
However , this tool , too , has only limited applicability , as it cannot get at the central temporal node of the brain where much basic reward activity takes place .
Still , Mr Camerer is confident that neuroeconomics will deliver its first big breakthroughs within five years .
Likewise , Mr McCabe sees growing sophistication in neuroeconomic research .
For the past four years , a group of leading neuroeconomists and neuroscientists has met to refine questions about the brain and economic behaviour .
Researchers trained in both neuroscience and economics are entering the field .
They are asking more sophisticated questions than the first generation “ spots on brains ” experiments , says Mr McCabe , such as “ how these spots would change with different economic variables . ”
He expects that within a few years neuroeconomics will have uncovered enough about the interactions between what goes on in people 's brains and the outside world to start to shape the public - policy agenda — though it is too early to say how .
The success of neuroeconomics need not mean that behavioural economics will inevitably triumph over an economics based on rationality .
Indeed , many behavioural economists are extremely pessimistic about the chances that brain studies will deliver any useful insights , points out Mr Camerer with regret .
However , Daniel Kahneman , a Princeton University psychologist who in 2002 won the Nobel prize in economics for his contribution to behavioural economics , is an enthusiastic supporter of the new field .
“ In many areas of economics , it will dominate , because it works , ” says Mr Kahneman .
Even so , “ we are nowhere near the demise of traditional neoclassical economics , ” he argues .
Instead , insights from brain studies may enable orthodox economists to develop a richer definition of rationality .
“ These traditional economists may be more impressed by brain evidence than evidence from psychology , ” he says ; “ when you talk about biology either in an evolutionary or physical sense , you feel they have greater comfort levels than when you start to talk about psychology . ”
In this respect , Mr Kahneman 's Princeton colleagues and neuroscience - bashers may be making a mistake in bundling behavioural economics — soft mind science — and neuroeconomics — hard biology — together .
“ It is far easier to argue for mindless economics than for brainless economics , ” he says .

Development : Colorado university to lead mission to Mars
What it means : NASA just gave the University of Colorado at Boulder its largest research contract ever - to lead the mission that will launch an orbiting probe to Mars in 2013 .
The benefits of the nearly half - billion - dollar project are many : Every dollar spent on space exploration has an eightfold economic benefit ; studying other planets helps us better understand our own ; space expeditions are the 21st century equivalent of Columbus ' voyages .
And NASA 's $ 16 billion annual budget is a drop in the bucket compared with the $ 10 billion a month we spend in Iraq .
Still , a half - billion dollars could help with some urgent problems down here on Earth .
The National Priorities Project estimates that it could provide a year of health care for 165,000 people , or power 830,000 homes with renewable energy for a year , or build 2,200 affordable housing units .
But the study of Mars may still prove useful to Westerners :
Our arid southern Utah desert is already used for Mars simulations , and that lifeless , dusty planet might foreshadow what 's in store for the rest of our region as the climate warms and dries .

Development : Firefighting mistakes lead to prosecution
What it means : The Thirtymile Fire killed four young firefighters in north - central Washington on July 10 , 2001 .
Five years later , Ellreese Daniels was indicted on 11 felony charges , including four counts of involuntary manslaughter .
It was the first criminal prosecution of a Forest Service incident commander for negligence on the fire line , absent malice .
Every responsible firefighter believes in accountability on the fire line ; that is how safety lessons are learned .
But fire is dangerous , sometimes fatally so .
Being jailed for having a bad day at work is an intimidating prospect .
In April , Daniels pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges and admitted trying to blame the fallen firefighters for his own mistakes .
On Aug. 20 , Judge Fred Van Sickle sentenced him to three years of probation and 90 days of work release , and ordered him never to fight fires again .
Daniels was clearly at fault , but his prosecution may have unfortunate consequences .
Firefighters who know they could be jailed for making mistakes may be less aggressive in attacking fires , and few will want to become incident commanders .
And that could lead to even worse mistakes .

Today ’s release of current unemployment rates may be more unwelcome news reminding us of a rickety economy , but the skies could grow darker still .
Goldman Sachs forecasts that the U.S. unemployment rate will peak at 6.4 percent late in 2009 before improving , meaning the painful process of shedding jobs may be only half - way done .
The Labor Department Thursday reported the national unemployment rate stayed at 5.5 percent in June , and nonfarm payrolls shed 62,000 jobs , marking the sixth straight month of job losses .
Some other numbers worth noting :
In May , the current nemployment rates climbed one - half of a percentage point , the biggest one - month jump in 22 years .
Some economists had said the jump was a statistical fluke .
Over the last year , the national unemployment rate increased a full percentage point .
In terms of industries , job losses in June continued in construction , manufacturing , and employment services , while health care and mining added jobs .
Overall , nonfarm payrolls have fallen by 438,000 in the first half of the year , an average of 73,000 per month .
The news follows Congress ’s approval last week of a measure providing an unemployment extension to the approximately 1.55 million unemployed workers who exhaust their regular 26 weeks of unemployment benefits .
President Bush earlier this week signed the bill that includes the unemployment extension of an additional 13 weeks .
What Does the Currrent Unemployment Rate Say About our Economy ?
The report was mostly in keeping with forecasts from economists , who had been expecting employers to reduce payrolls by around 60,000 jobs in June and for the current unemployment rates to slip a notch to 5.4 percent .
But television news reports showed some experts saying the report was weaker than expected , while others were saying the report was n’t terribly grim , and the market would breathe a sigh of relief .

David Leonhardt , a New York Times Columnist who writes about economics and business , offers a different take .
He suggests that layoffs and unemployment are being touted as a symbol of everything that ’s wrong with our economy – but it ’s nothing more than a myth .
In his column yesterday , Leonhardt says layoffs have “ very little to do with the economy ’s problems . ”
In 2007 , companies actually cut far fewer jobs than they did during the boom in the late 1990s .
Unfortunately , gross job gains — the new jobs created — have fallen more sharply than job losses .
Companies have gone on a “ hiring strike , ” notes Ed McKelvey , a Goldman Sachs economist .
Existing firms are n’t expanding much , and not enough new firms are starting .
The country is suffering from an innovation deficit .
The problems plaguing our economy , he suggests , are too complicated to be explained away by current unemployment rates or job losses–and solving them will require “ some real work . ”
EXCLUSIVE : FAA Tapes Reveal Drama of Obama Jet Incident
The audio contradicts the FAA account of " no emergency . "
August 14 , 2008  --
The incident involving Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign plane last month was much more serious than the airline or the Federal Aviation Administration said , according to FAA control tower tapes obtained by ABC News .
At the time , an FAA spokesperson said the pilot did not declare an emergency and the airline owner , Midwest Airlines , said safety " was never an issue . "
The tapes , broadcast Thursday on ABC News ' " World News with Charles Gibson , " show otherwise .
Just 41 seconds after discovering he no longer had full control of the plane 's up and down movements , the pilot told an FAA air traffic controller " at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have CFR [ crash equipment ] standing by in St. Louis . "
An FAA spokesperson acknowledged today that its statements at the time of " no emergency " were wrong , based , the spokesperson said , on erroneous reports from FAA air traffic managers .
" We later learned there was an emergency declared , " FAA spokesperson Elizabeth Cory said .
The FAA had not publicly corrected the record until today , after being contacted by ABC News .
Obama 's plane , an MD - 81 chartered from Midwest , was diverted to St. Louis , shortly after takeoff from Chicago on July 7 .
Over the plane intercom system , the pilot told Obama and campaign staff and reporters there was " a little bit of controllability issue in terms of our ability to control the aircraft in the pitch , which is the nose up and nose down mode . "
In contrast , the FAA tapes reveal the pilot reported he no longer had 100 per cent control , with only " limited pitch authority " of the aircraft .
A few minutes later , the pilot formally declared an emergency situation .
( click here to listen to an edited version of the audio )
Asked by the St. Louis tower controller which runway he wanted to land on , the pilot responded , " Well , which one is the longest ? "
The pilot then reported , " We have Senator Obama on board the aircraft and his campaign . "
Unbeknownst to the pilot , an emergency evacuation slide had inflated inside the tail of the jet , affecting control cables there .
As tension mounted and the pilot rapidly descended from 32,000 feet , he was asked how many were on the jet .
" 51 souls on board , " he responded .
Then , at 10,000 feet , the pilot suddenly regained control .
" Ah , sir , we had a pitch authority problem .
Now that we 've come down to a lower altitude , it seems to have rectified itself .
We do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time , " the unnamed Midwest pilot reported to the St. Louis control tower .
As the jet landed safely in St. Louis , Sen .
Obama called his wife and , apparently unaware of the drama in the cockpit , tried to laugh it off .
" Just thought we 'd spice things up a little bit today , " he told reporters .
Asked if he was afraid , Obama said , " Anytime a pilot says , you know , that something 's not working the way it 's supposed to , then you know , you make sure you tighten your seat belt . "
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident .
In a preliminary report , the NTSB said it detected " marks consistent with rubbing of elevator control cables " and a broken railing that " impinged upon elevator control cables . "
A spokesperson for Midwest said the company would not comment on the incident while the NTSB investigation is underway .
The Obama campaign had chartered the MD - 81 from Midwest while its current campaign plane , a Boeing 757 chartered from North American Airlines , was being reconfigured .
It was put into use on July 20 .
The McCain campaign also debuted a new plane last month , a Boeing 737-400 , chartered from Team Jet .
A spokesperson , Brian Rogers , said he was unaware if the incident with the Obama plane had led to any safety evaluations of Senator McCain 's campaign plane .

COURIC : You ’ve cited Alaska ’s proximity to Russia as part of your foreign policy experience .
What did you mean by that ?
PALIN : Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country , Russia , and , on our other side , the land - boundary that we have with Canada .
It ’s funny that a comment like that was kinda made to …I do n’t know , you know …reporters .
COURIC : Mocked ?
PALIN : Mocked , yeah I guess that ’s the word , mocked .
COURIC : Well , explain to me why that enhances your foreign - policy credentials .
PALIN : Well , it certainly does , because our , our next - door neighbors are foreign countries , there in the state that I am the executive of .
And there …
COURIC : Have you ever been involved in any negotiations , for example , with the Russians ?
PALIN : We have trade missions back and forth , we do .
It ’s very important when you consider even national - security issues with Russia .
As Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America , where do they go ?
It ’s Alaska .
It ’s just right over the border .
It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , Russia , because they are right next to , they are right next to our state .
What if I told you that a prominent global political figure in recent months has proposed : abrogating key features of his government 's contracts with energy companies ; unilaterally renegotiating his country 's international economic treaties ; dramatically raising marginal tax rates on the " rich " to levels not seen in his country in three decades ( which would make them among the highest in the world ) ; and changing his country 's social insurance system into explicit welfare by severing the link between taxes and benefits ?

Canada ’s Green Party leader , Elizabeth May , is taking Canadian broadcasters to court over their decision to exclude her from the party leader debates ahead of Canada ’s federal elections on October 14th .
Canada ’s media consortium decided to exclude her from the televised leader debates after the other participants supposedly threatened to boycott the debates if she was included .
Canada ’s Green Party is running candidates in 307 of Canada ’s 308 ridings , has one sitting member of parliament , and in a recent poll , has a national support level of 7 % .
For sharp - eyed readers , note that the Bloc Quebecois only has a national support level of 8 % , runs candidates only in Quebec ( 75 out of 308 ridings ) , and its party leader will be participating in the October 1st and 2nd televised debates ( both the English and the French ) .
In the last federal election , Canadian broadcasters barred the Green Party from participating in the televised debates because it did not have an elected member of parliament .
However , independent MP Blair Wilson joined the Green Party , giving it its first ever member of parliament , as well negating the position of the consortium of CBC , Radio - Canada , TVA , Global and CTV .
Sound off in the comments : do you think it should be up to party leaders to decide who gets to participate in the televised debates ?
Is being prevented from participating in the debates truly an
“… anti-democratic , closed - door , back - room decision making by four national party leaders who are all men , and five television executives who are all men , to keep out the one woman leader of a federal political party … ” ?

The inventions featured in this article are NOT included in the book and represent a new material for DRB .
Awesome Innovations from the Underdeveloped Male Mind
There are over 7 million patents registered in the United States , a great number of which describe practical inventions designed for use by everyday , ordinary human beings .
Then there 's the " guy " stuff , ideas so lunkheaded and irrational they could only have come from that tiny portion of a guy 's brain not dedicated to scratching himself .
The following inventions have received actual patents from the United States government - proof positive that heavy drinking is not being discouraged at the patent and trademark office .
The illustrations are those submitted by the inventors themselves , whose surnames have been withheld as an act of mercy .
Fred ’s Helium - Filled Sun Shade
( Patented 1991 )
If you happen to be an outdoorsman , you surely realize the importance of protecting yourself from the sun .
With the continued erosion of the ozone layer , even moderate exposure can leave you looking like an extra in a George Romero film .
Unfortunately , sunscreen lotions are messy and inconvenient while umbrellas are cumbersome and require the use of at least one hand to operate .
Outdoorsmen just hate this .
Well , Fred has come up with a solution that ’s perfect for anyone who weighs over 300 grams and possesses a set of armpits .
It ’s his revolutionary Sun Shade , which he describes as a flat Mylar “ balloon ” that , once filled with helium , “ maintains the sun shade in position above the individual ’s head , while keeping both of the individual ’s hands free for other activities ” such as grabbing hold of a tree trunk when a gust of wind hits .
Note : Depending on the level of outdoorsman you are , you may choose to inhale a bit of the helium , thereby allowing you to converse with chipmunks and other small , woodland creatures .
Kathy ’s Automatic Clothing Selector
( Patented 2002 )
Although the vast majority of inventions highlighted in these articles are the result of male ingenuity , every once in a while someone like Kathy comes along and reminds us that women , too , can suffer from a lack of blood flow to the brain .
After exhaustive study and painstaking research , Kathy has come to the following apparel - related conclusions :
1 . “ Shorts may be appropriate clothing on a hot day , and a coat may be appropriate clothing on a cold day . ”
2 . “ If a coat is worn on a hot day , a person might suffer from heat exhaustion .
If shorts are worn on a cold day , a person might suffer from hypothermia . ”
And , potentially most disturbing …
3 . “ The person may have to change clothes later in the day … resulting in a delay which can cause a person to be late for an engagement . ”
With the seriousness of the threat identified , how best , then , to eliminate such costly clothing blunders ?
As a sentient being , you have four basic options :
1. Check your local weather report .
2 . Stick your head out a window .
3 . Hire a professional contractor to install one of Kathy ’s Automatic Clothing Selectors in which a roof - mounted sensor ( 16 ) determines the current outside temperature and sends a signal to a closet - mounted indicator ( 13 ) , which then flashes a colored light ( 14 ) corresponding to the hanger color ( 12 ) which holds clothing ( 18 ) appropriate for that particular temperature .
4. Move to the Arctic Circle .
Summer Specials
Try as we might , some of us just are n’t good swimmers .
And it is n’t for lack of effort .
It ’s because our bodies possess the buoyancy characteristics of anvils .
Over the years , America ’s best and brightest have worked to develop solutions to this problem .
Unfortunately , so have these guys .
John ’s Swimming Device
( Patented 1920 )
Some of us would give our right leg to be able to swim better , which would probably be a better option than what John has come up with .
He claims his swimming device “ will assist in causing the arms and legs to be moved in the proper manner and relation to each other when learning to swim . ”
Then again , he also claims that his invention “ provides a device … which is comparatively simple in its construction ” , so take that for what it ’s worth .
Nick ’s Swimming Appliance
( Patented 1932 )
Nick ’s contribution to enhanced swimwear is a conglomeration of flaps , straps and buckles that he insists “ will give to the swimmer the means a fish has ” and “ make swimming more enjoyable to those who wear it . ”
I do n’t know about that , but it will definitely make swimming more enjoyable to those who watch someone else wear it .
Nick further states that an individual wearing his device will have the advantage of swimming “ with less effort than will be required of a swimmer not wearing my device . ”
Of course , the individual not wearing the device will have a few advantages of his own , including retaining his dignity .
Note :
In case you were wondering , Nick refers to the lower left hand illustration as a “ rear view ” of the swimmer .
John and Manuel ’s Swimming Apparatus
( Patented 1911 )
Drowning is a horrific , terrifying , painful experience resulting in death for the victim and untold grief for his family and friends .
But can it really be any worse than wearing this ?
In describing their apparatus , John and Manuel state that “ the flexible cord connections between the anklets ( 15 ) and the wings ( 17 ) , afford powerfully enhanced means of propulsion through the water … inspiring confidence and aiding the wearer in acquiring the natural art of swimming . ”
“ Within a short time ” , they continue , “ any beginner using our appliance will naturally fall into the same positions and actions when deprived of the appliance as when it is being worn . ”
We can only assume these actions include curling up in a fetal ball of shame .

Jack Cafferty is the only person I 've seen on TV so far to make this incredibly important point :
If George Bush and John McCain had their way with privatizing Social Security , millions of seniors would be totally screwed right now .
Download Download
" Luckily we have the safety net of Social Security to fall back on …for now .
You may remember just four years ago President Bush made a big push to partially privatize Social Security …
You know so we could individually invest our future with the great minds on Wall Street .
It failed back then , but that concept could still become a reality .
See John McCain also supports supplementing Social Security with private investment accounts .
His opponent Barack Obama does not . "
HuffPo's John Neffinger writes :
This is something Americans understand : social security is secure , and the stock market is anything but .
There are few more personal or dramatic ways to illustrate McCain 's terrible judgment than to imagine the nightmare scenario so many Americans would face if McCain and Bush had gotten their way on this -- or if McCain were to get his way as President .
When Wall Street 's woes are the top story , this should be our top talking point .
Dead on .
Not only is Social Security a winning issue with seniors , it illustrates perfectly how John McCain is walking in lock - step with George Bush .
Every sentence spoken this week about Lehman and AIG should be capped off with the line " your SS would be as worthless as they are right now if John McCain had his way . "

Folks at the University of Kitakyushu have created a Sea Bream or Red Snapper robot .
Hand painted scales round out this completely realistic looking fish .
The fish can be outfitted with various sensors and fit right in with other fish without disturbing them .
The robot weighs 15.4 lbs and swims and floats just like real fish do .
The engineers claim it is easy to mass produce the robot .
Watch out as swimming with robotic fishes will soon be the next attraction at Disneyland .

Along with other past and present administration officials , Attorney General Michael Mukasey supports lawlessness and police state justice .
Weeks after the Supreme Court ’s landmark ( June 12 ) Boumediene ruling , he addressed the conservative , pro-war American Enterprise Institute ( on July 21 ) and asked Congress to overrule the High Court — for the third time .
His proposal :

authorize indefinite detentions of Guantanamo and other “ war on terror ” prisoners ( including US citizens designated “ enemy combatants ” ) ; and
deny them habeas rights , due process , and any hope for judicial fairness .
Since June 2004 , the ( conservative ) High Court made three landmark rulings .
Twice Congress intervened , and Mukasey wants a third time .
In Rasul v. Bush ( June 2004 ) , the Court granted Guantanamo detainees habeas rights to challenge their detentions in civil court .
Congress responded with the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) of 2005 subverting the ruling .
In June 2006 , the Supreme Court reacted .
In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , it held that federal courts retain jurisdiction over habeas cases and that Guantanamo Bay military commissions lack “ the power to proceed because ( their ) structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions ( of ) 1949 . ”
In October 2006 , Congress responded a second time .
It enacted the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) — subverting the High Court ruling in more extreme form .
In its menu of illegal provisions , it grants the administration extraordinary unconstitutional powers to detain , interrogate , torture and prosecute alleged terrorist suspects , enemy combatants , or anyone claimed to support them .
It lets the President designate anyone anywhere in the world ( including US citizens ) an “ unlawful enemy combatant ” and empowers him to arrest and detain them indefinitely in military prisons .
The law states : “ no ( civil ) court , justice , or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause for action whatsoever … relating to the prosecution , trial or judgment of … military commission (s ) … including challenges to ( their ) lawfulness … ”
On June 12 , 2008 , the High Court again disagreed .
In Boumediene v. Bush , it held that Guantanamo detainees retain habeas rights .
MCA unconstitutionally subverts them , and the administration has no legal authority to deny them due process in civil courts or act as accuser , trial judge and executioner with no right of appeal or chance for judicial fairness .
On July 21 , Mukasey responded , and immediately the ACLU reacted in a same day press release headlined : “ Attorney General Wants New Declaration of War Allowing Indefinite Detention and Concealment of Torture . ”
It called Mukasey ’s speech “ an enormous executive branch power grab … authoriz ( ing ) indefinite detention (s ) through a new declaration of armed conflict . ”
He asked Congress to redefine habeas through legislation “ that will hide the Bush administration ’s past wrongdoing — an action that would undermine the constitutional guarantee of due process and conceal systematic ( lawless ) torture and abuse of detainees . ”
Like his two predecessors , Mukasey mocks the rule of law and supports harsh police state justice .
He wants Congress to “ expand and extend the ‘ war on terror ’ forever ” and let the president detain anyone indefinitely without charge or trial .
ACLU ’s Washington Legislative Director , Caroline Fredrickson , called this “ the last gasp of an administration desperate to rationalize what is a failed legal scheme ” — that the Supreme Court thunderously rejected three times .
Mukasey proposes lawlessness and cover - up , “ but there is no reason to think that Congress will assist him . ”
It “ wo n’t fall for this latest ( scheme ) to ( suppress ) its wrongdoing . ”
Besides , the House Judiciary Committee is now investigating whether high - level administration officials authorized torture and abuse .
Mukasey wants to hide it and is asking Congress to “ bury the evidence . ”
The ACLU is righteously outraged by this latest attempted power grab .
It rejects Mukasey ’s lawlessness and states there is “ no need to invent yet another set of legal rules to govern the detention and trial of prisoners held on national security grounds , and the rules that ( Mukasey ) is proposing are fundamentally inconsistent with ” constitutional and international law .
The Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) Responds
After Mukasey ’s September 17 , 2007 nomination for Attorney General , CCR issued the following November 1 , 2007 statement :
“ Michael Mukasey is not fit to be Attorney General because he supports torture , illegal spying on Americans , and limitless powers for the Executive Branch . ”
As the “ country ’s highest law enforcement official , ” he ’s obligated “ to enforce the law ” — not make excuses for the government when it ’s in violation .
CCR stands “ firmly against Mukasey ’s nomination …
Our country cannot afford to make compromises to our laws , our morals , and our humanity any longer . ”
The Senate must reject Attorney General candidates who ’ll “ undermine American justice and shred the Constitution . ”
CCR expressed equal outrage on July 21 .
Its Executive Director , Vincent Warren , denounced Mukasey ’s proposal in the following excerpted statement :
“ What Mukasey is doing is a shocking attempt to drag us into years of further legal challenges and delays .
The Supreme Court has definitively spoken ” in Boumediene v. Bush and its two prior rulings .
“ For six and a half years , ” the administration and Congress “ have done their best to ( deny due process ) and prevent the courts from reviewing the legality of the detention of the men in Guantanamo .
Congress should be a part of the solution this time by letting the courts do their job . ”
For the past six years , CCR litigated for Guantanamo detainee rights and continues to do it .
It organized and coordinated over 500 pro bono lawyers for everyone held there illegally .
Most recently , it represented plaintiffs in the landmark Boumediene v. Bush case — argued on December 5 , 2007 and ruled on June 12 , 2008 .
The Wall Street Journal Reports and Editorializes
Its July 22 article states : “ Mukasey Seeks Law on Detainees — Congress Is Urged to Limit Rights of Terror Suspects … in light of a rebuke by the Supreme Court . ”
It quotes Mukasey wanting :
legislative “ principles ” for “ practical ” limits on the right of detainees to challenge their incarceration ;
Congress to give the administration freedom to detain combatants “ for the duration of the ( ‘ war on terror ’ ) conflict ; ”
a “ reaffirmation of something that was enacted in legislation after September 11 , 2001 ” ( a menu of harsh repressive laws ) ;
no “ enemy combatants ” released in ( or brought to ) the US ( even to appear in civil court ) ;
no intelligence ( or harsh interrogation ) methods revealed ( so evidence of torture and abuse is suppressed ) , and
military officers ( and intelligence officials ) to be excused from testifying ( because what they know is damning ) .
On its editorial page , the Journal is supportive .
It called Mukasey ’s proposal “ modest ” on a “ difficult ” issue over which “ different judges even on the same court will disagree . ”
Mukasey wants congressional “ guidance ” because there ’s risk of “ inconsistent rulings and considerable uncertainty . ”
According to the Journal , Mukasey “ was right in stepping forward to say that someone has to take responsibility for the consequences of the Supreme Court ’s 5 – 4 ” Boumediene ruling .
It wants “ Congress ( to ) give one court jurisdiction over ( all detainee ) cases ” and not let the process “ bog down into a Babel of conflicting procedural and legal rulings . ”
Mukasey is “ right ” to ask Congress to settle the issue , ( regardless of three landmark High Court rulings ) .
In other words :
Dodd bill more aggressive than Treasury plan
Banking Committee Chairman Christopher
Dodd is taking much more aggressive approach to the Treasury bailout plan , demanding foreclosure assistance , limits on executive compensation and profit sharing for taxpayers if the Treasury begins to make money back on the bad debt it plans to purchase .
Dodd 's legislation , obtained this morning by Politico , has just started to circulate among Senate legislative directors .
His plan addresses many of the concerns raised by Democrats and Republicans who are concerned about handing over $ 700 billion blank check to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
While the Treasury would receive much of the authority that it wants to buy up distressed assets , Dodd 's add - ons have many of the populist ideas that will appeal to skeptical Democrats .
His plan is also broader than the one unveiled by House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , so there will be significant negotiations in the days ahead between the House and Senate if Congress is to pass a bill by the end of the week .
Among the major provisions Dodd is adding :
* Authority for bankruptcy judges to restructure mortgages for homeowners facing foreclosure .
This was considered a poison pill in a housing bill that passed Congress earlier this summer , but it has gained much more currency now that Washington wants to bail out Wall Street .
* A provision that would require the Treasury to take a 65 percent portion of 20 percent any profits it makes from the newly purchased assets and put it into the federal government 's HOPE program , an affordable housing program .
* An oversight board that not only includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the SEC , but congressionally appointed , non-governmental officials .
* Limits on executive compensation .
This is a major stumbling point for Paulson in his negotiations with Congress , but cracking down on Wall Street executive salaries will be a major selling point for lawmakers .
Dodd and Frank have put in place what 's known as a " claw back " provision aimed at revoking compensation that executives received based on fraudulent claims .
* An independent inspector general to investigate the Treasury asset program , appointed by the president .
She is the not the first woman to auction her virginity for a large sum .
An 18 - year - old US student in San Diego , Natalie Dylan , recently told the Howard Stern show she would have sex for the first time for $ 1 million to pay her college fees .
__1925 : __John Scopes , an unassuming high school biology teacher and part - time football coach , is found guilty of teaching evolution in schools , in violation of Tennessee law .
Scopes agreed , after some persuading by the American Civil Liberties Union and others , to serve as the guinea pig in an attempt to challenge the law on constitutional grounds .
Famed attorney Clarence Darrow led Scopes ’ defense team in what the press quickly dubbed the Monkey Trial .
William Jennings Bryan , three - time Democratic nominee for president and a paradoxical blend of progressive conservatism , represented both the state and the fundamentalists who opposed Darwin ’s theories .
The trial took eight days in the sweltering Tennessee summer .
National newspapers covered it in detail , including dramatic confrontations between Darrow and Bryan both in and out of the courtroom .
Whether Scopes actually taught evolution to his biology class remains unclear .
Although he told the court he had done it and would do it again , he later admitted to a newspaper reporter that while he used a textbook that included a chapter on evolution , he skipped the chapter .
Darrow expected a guilty verdict and stood ready to appeal the decision to a higher court .
The jury did not disappoint him .
Scopes was found guilty and fined $ 100 ( about $ 1,200 in today 's money ) .
The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the constitutionality of the statute but overturned Scopes ’ conviction on a technicality .
Bryan , meanwhile , died only five days after the conclusion of the Monkey Trial .
The Butler Act , as the anti-evolution law was known , remained on the books in Tennessee until its repeal by the state legislature in 1967 .

You do n't have to spend several dollars per gallon driving somewhere to buy your food .
That 's one big benefit
An increasing number of Americans are turning to home hydroponics gardening to offset high gasoline , petroleum , energy and food prices .
According to hydroponics industry leaders Michael Straumietis , Robert C. Higgins and Gino Yordanov , more and more Americans are growing their very own fresh fruit and vegetables to save money , time and transportation costs .
Straumietis , Higgins and Yordanov are founders of a Seattle - based hydroponics nutrients company called Advanced Nutrients ( http://www.advancednutrients.com).
The company manufactures and distributes a wide range of professional hydroponics products worldwide .
" Americans are sick and tired of paying high gas prices , driving to grocery stores , and paying high food prices too , " Michael Straumietis explains .
" They 're tired of high energy prices .
So they 're turning to home - based farming , and it 's paying off . "
According to Advanced Nutrients co-founder Robert C. Higgins , Americans are finding out that hydroponics gardening combines with traditional gardening techniques to produce quality food at a fraction of the cost of buying it from grocery stores .
" You use hydroponics nutrients to pump up the yield , quality and taste of your home crops , " he says .
" You can grow year - round using outdoor gardens in warmer weather and indoor gardening during winter .
That way , you 've got a supply of fresh fruits and vegetables 365 days a year .
You 've also got a fun hobby that the whole family can engage in . "
Advanced Nutrients founder Gino Yordanov says the cost of producing vegetables , fruits , and herbs at home is far less than the cost of buying them from commercial producers .
" You do n't have to spend several dollars per gallon driving somewhere to buy your food .
That 's one big benefit , " Yordanov explains .
" You get total control over the quality of what you eat , because you grow it yourself .
You get a higher yield than with regular gardening .
And it's a form of self - sufficiency . "
Michael Straumietis , Robert C. Higgins and Gino Yordanov are united in their commitment to helping Americans save money on gas , energy , and food prices .
" You 're going to see more and more Americans turning to home gardening as a survival tool , " Straumietis emphasizes .
" Prices for petroleum , food , gasoline and energy are going way up and they 'll keep going up .
Pretty soon , it 's going to be a matter of necessity that you have your own garden so you can ensure a continuous supply of healthy fruits and vegetables for your family . "

Instead of trying to get the site closed down he has thrown his weight behind a new book that will publish his originals and Walsh ’s versions side - by - side .
Sept 10 ( Reuters ) - Former Bear Stearns Chief Executive Alan Schwartz has joined European investment bank Rothschild after deciding not to take a role at JP Morgan Chase JPM.N , the New York Post said citing sources .
Schwartz ’s move to Rothschild ’s New York office seems to be temporary , the Post reported .
Schwartz ’s long - time associate , Richard Metrick , who was formerly was a Bear senior managing director , has also taken an office at Rothschild .
Schwartz had been weighing a number of options , the Post had earlier reported , after he was forced to sell Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase .
He shot to Wall Street fame advising on large M&A deals , such as Disney ’s 1996 acquisition of Capital Cities / ABC Inc for $ 19 billion .
Rothschild was not available for comments .

fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:00:44 PM ) : What are you doing tonight ?

fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:00:56 PM ) : Good girl .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:01:24 PM ) : Which one are you ?

The girl is actually 11 . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:01:25 PM ) : nothing .
talking to you if you want to talk to me
sadlilgrrl ( 2:01:27 PM ) : in pink
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:01:38 PM ) : Cute , is your mother working ?
( He 's on topic and does n't want to be distracted .
What came next , however , helped to make this one of the most disturbing chats I 've ever read or had . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:01:43 PM ) : you 're very handsome
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:01:46 PM ) : Thank you .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:01:56 PM ) : Do you have any sexual experience ?
( Testing the waters , seeing how far he can go . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:02:35 PM ) : i guess i kind of do .
i got punished for stuff a lot .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:02:43 PM ) : Oh ?
What have you done ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:03:17 PM ) : my dad used to get mad at me and do stuff to me ( That 's right .
She just admitted she was beaten and sexually abused by her father . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:03:25 PM ) : Like what ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:03:47 PM ) : like spank me and stuff
sadlilgrrl ( 2:03:54 PM ) : and sometimes he'd use his belt
sadlilgrrl ( 2:03:59 PM ) : or a coathanger ( This is clearly beyond the boundaries of regular punishment .
She does n't want to talk about the ' stuff , " but he wo n't stop asking . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:03:59 PM ) : Stuff as in ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:04:03 PM ) : And , I use a whip ...
( Her father beat her with a coathanger and a belt , and he explains that he uses a whip . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:04:40 PM ) : he 'd make me hold him in my mouth
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:04:47 PM ) : His cock ?
( She 's clearly not comfortable here .
One word answers .
No elaboration . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:05:01 PM ) : yes
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:05:09 PM ) : Did you suck or just hold ?
( Yet he keeps pushing . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:05:21 PM ) : i sucked
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:05:28 PM ) : And , is that all ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:05:36 PM ) : As , I will have you suck me as well .
( Not only is he clearly enjoying this , but he tells her he will make her do the same things to him . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:06:31 PM ) : he made me get on top of him once
sadlilgrrl ( 2:06:34 PM ) : it hurt a lot ( Her father raped her .
His reaction ? )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:06:41 PM ) : So you are not a virgin ?
Good .
( This is one of the single most chilling lines I 've ever read . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:06:51 PM ) : And , what is your phone number , girl ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:06:59 PM ) : A phone your mother will not answer ?
( He 's pushing for connection already .
He wants that number , and he 's openly demanding of it .
He knows he has her hooked . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:07:26 PM ) : there is n't one .
i can call out but she has incoming calls go to her cell .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:07:32 PM ) : im sorry
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:07:44 PM ) : I see ... NP ...

fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:09:26 PM ) : Elmhurst ...
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:09:31 PM ) : Let me check something ...
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:10:00 PM ) : I may have you come to me today , if you want ...
( He 's in a hurry for this .
As you 'll find out , though , this actually goes on for days . )

sadlilgrrl ( 2:10:23 PM ) : yes
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:10:31 PM ) : Are you sure you want to do this ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:10:46 PM ) : yes
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:10:53 PM ) : You are not a cop , right ?
( He again knows it 's illegal .
He knows her age . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:10:53 PM ) : could i talk to you on the phone first ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:10:59 PM ) : no !
sadlilgrrl ( 2:11:01 PM ) : lol
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:11:10 PM ) : I am near where I write & I do not have a phone here .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:11:26 PM ) : oh .

fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:11:41 PM ) : What is your adress in elmhurst ?
( He 's trying to use her need to please him to find out all her information . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:12:40 PM ) : i know im supposed to do what you tell me but i really want to hear your voice first before i tell you .
im sorry , im just kind of nervous
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:12:45 PM ) :
If you want this , I will let you come over ...
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:13:04 PM ) : Because your mother will get the phone call if I call you ...
And , I do not have a phone , here .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:13:21 PM ) : but if you could get to a phone couldnt i call you ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:13:31 PM ) : A pay phone , yes ...
sadlilgrrl ( 2:13:44 PM ) : oh i see
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:14:08 PM ) : I use this area to write , I do n't have a TV , a VCR , anything but a radio & a bed .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:14:35 PM ) : do you have a number i could call and listen to your voice or anything ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:14:45 PM ) : Sure , hold on while I get it ...

sadlilgrrl ( 2:15:54 PM ) : yes
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:16:12 PM ) : Good ...
The number is 773-847-9588
( Here I checked the index of the Payphone Project to see if this was a listed payphone .
Obviously , if he was calling from a payphone , we could not trace him .
At this time , this was still being treated as a normal ' bust . " )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:16:27 PM ) : Call me in 5 minutes .
I will log off & then call me , understand ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:16:33 PM ) : ok i will
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:16:40 PM ) : Good girl ...

fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:20:13 PM ) : Did you call me ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:20:17 PM ) : i had a minute left til i did
sadlilgrrl ( 2:20:21 PM ) : i watched it and timed it
sadlilgrrl ( 2:20:30 PM ) : im sorry
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:20:34 PM ) : OK , I will wait for you then .

sadlilgrrl ( 2:24:41 PM ) : i let it ring 10 times but there was no answer
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:25:27 PM ) :
The phone here does n't get incomming calls , girl .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:25:38 PM ) : SOrry about that , but I am still willing to meet you ...
( This was clearly an issue . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:25:41 PM ) : oh is that why it just rang ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:25:51 PM ) : Yeppers , I did n't hear a ring here .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:26:23 PM ) : i have a stupid question
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:26:27 PM ) : Ask it .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:26:29 PM ) : is ur name really jaime ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:26:38 PM ) : im kristen
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:26:40 PM ) : No , it is Paul .
Jaime is a nickname .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:26:44 PM ) : I know , kristen .
( Notice that he does not capitalize her name , but does capitalize his own .
Another small blow to her self - identity .
Another step in making her his slave . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:26:59 PM ) : If you are willing to still meet , I am .
( Notice he holds this out like it 's a privilege . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:27:00 PM ) : oh
sadlilgrrl ( 2:27:16 PM ) : okay hold on i have to call my mom and make sure of her schedule okay ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:27:31 PM ) : My grandmother wanted me to be named Jaime , but my father named me Paul .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:27:32 PM ) : SUre .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:27:35 PM ) : I can wait .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:28:07 PM ) : okay .

fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:28:11 PM ) : NP .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:29:19 PM ) : Waiting .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:29:28 PM ) : im talking to her now .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:29:35 PM ) : OK , good .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:30:30 PM ) : she may be getting off early today at 3:30
sadlilgrrl ( 2:30:44 PM ) : but then she'd have to work til 3 am tomorrow
sadlilgrrl ( 2:30:50 PM ) : she 'll know in half an hour ( I was trying to find out what we could do without a verified number . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:30:52 PM ) : I see .
Well , find out ...
If you cannot , you cannot .
If you can , you can .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:30:53 PM ) : OK ...
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:31:10 PM ) : I can wait for a little bit .
Of course you could ask your mom if you can go out for a bit ...
sadlilgrrl ( 2:31:28 PM ) : if shes home she wants me to be there so i can do what she wants me to
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:31:48 PM ) : I see . NP ...
Find out ...
If we can meet , I would enjoy starting your training .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:31:50 PM ) : ok i have to call her back at 2 to find out if shes working or not
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:32:01 PM ) : OK ...
Are you excited about this ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:32:10 PM ) : yes
sadlilgrrl ( 2:32:12 PM ) : a little nervous
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:32:16 PM ) : Why ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:32:17 PM ) : but i trust you
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:32:21 PM ) : You can .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:32:25 PM ) : i do
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:32:34 PM ) : Good ...
And , you know I may tie you up ...
sadlilgrrl ( 2:32:37 PM ) : if shes coming home is there anyway that we could meet tomorrow instead ?
( This was to give us time to get a back - up plan into place . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:32:42 PM ) : Sure .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:33:03 PM ) : could i call you tonight and talk to you ?
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:33:08 PM ) : I am not doing anything tommorrow other than sleeping & writing .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:33:25 PM ) : I do not have a phone where I am at , right now .
I am here to write .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:33:37 PM ) : oh
sadlilgrrl ( 2:33:40 PM ) : i didnt know if youd go home
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:33:52 PM ) : No , I am planning on writting for a week here .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:33:54 PM ) : Maybe more .
sadlilgrrl ( 2:33:57 PM ) : oh wow ( Notice that she 's talking about the writing , but he redirects it right back to . . .)
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:34:14 PM ) :
So do you like the thought of me training you as a sex - slave for me ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:34:23 PM ) : yes ( Notice that she 's back to one word or short answers . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:34:31 PM ) : Does the thought make you wet ?
sadlilgrrl ( 2:34:47 PM ) : a little bit
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:35:17 PM ) : Oh ?
Good ...
And , you do understand that if you do come , you will be fucked & I may start training you for anal sex , along with other service .
( He 's going to fuck this abused , molested 13 year old and start training her for anal sex . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:35:57 PM ) : ive never tried that
sadlilgrrl ( 2:36:00 PM ) : does it hurt ?
( She expresses concern . )
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:36:06 PM ) : I know , but I will go slow with you .
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:36:13 PM ) : It can if I do not go slow .
( He reassures her . )
sadlilgrrl ( 2:36:24 PM ) : okay .
whatever you want .
( She acquiesces , and in reward . . .)
fleet_captain_jaime_wolfe ( 2:37:04 PM ) : Good girl ...

Libertarian Bob Barr Campaigns in Manchester New Hampshire
Poor ole John McCain , he can’t catch a break .
First he has to deal with the Obamagasms of the main - stream media as President Obama tours the middle east , and now as he visits New Hampshire the headlines are stolen by Bob Barr , the former Republican turned Libertarian presidential candidate .
Oh well .
Bob Barr is polling in New Hampshire at 10 % , the highest in the nation , so he decided to visit Manchester .
It just happened to be on the same day as the turncoat McCain visited New Hampshire .
So this distracts from the local coverage on McCain ’s return from the state .
This article from the Union Leader stole some of McAmnesty ’s headlines .
Although the Union Leader , who endorsed McCain during the primary , tries to discount Bob Barr ’s potential influence in the presidential race .
The truth is , the New Hampshire Republican party is scared to death of Bob Barr and the havoc he will reek once he is included on the ballot .
Independent thinking , libertarian type voters will flock to Barr .
Does he have any chance of winning ?
No , but he definitely will cost McCain the ( 4 ) electoral votes that New Hampshire has .
If the 10 % polling results hold up John McCain has no shot of winning no matter how Fergus Cullen , Chairman of the NHGOP , tries to spin it .
“ Libertarians in New Hampshire have always had a home in the Republican Party , ” Cullen said .
New Hampshire Republicans , like myself , are fed up and are going to give serious thought to casting a vote for Bob Barr .
I know I am .
Bob Barr sums up my feelings in this paragraph :
his calls for small government and personal freedom , and nodded agreement to his notion that the country ’s two major political parties are headed in the same direction .
John McCain is trying to take the Republican party too far to the left .
Headed in the same direction ?
Yes , I think that both parties are headed in the same direction and I do not like the destination .
John McCain is going to pick a VP candidate that he hopes can bring conservatives to him , that is how far he is headed in the wrong direction .
He is ignoring conservatives to woo the Democrat voters , so yes both parties are headed in the same direction .
Bob Barr continues :
“ Americans have this sense about them — that we can take advantage of in this election cycle — that the system is not serving them well , ” said Barr
That is exactly how I felt after the New Hampshire primary , I felt as if the system was n’t serving me and I still feel that way .
I have been disenfranchised by the national party .
I decided after John McCain became “ my party ’s ” nominee that I would vote in the state and local elections but that I would blank the presidential box on the ballot .
I am now thinking about changing that tactic .
I might throw my vote to Bob Barr .
Union Leader be damned , while you try to delegitimize him , and anyone else that dares to oppose your precious John McCain , there are many conservatives that are as pissed off as I am at the state of the national party and are thinking along the same lines I am .
I can not be alone .
Can I ?

I care about the licensing of the software I use , not because of some philosophical principle , but because I got sick and tired of having the thumbscrews put on me by proprietary software companies .
The latest row over at Ubuntu about licensing shows that plenty of other people feel the same way .
End users are n't licence agnostic ; they know that the licensing of the products they use is important .
Concerns over licensing are not the preserve of a few whacko freetards , but of ordinary users .
Ubuntu is , after all , one of the most popular and least techie Linux distributions .
Many years ago , I switched from Apple to Suse Linux after having been shafted by Steve Jobs .
I was also not sure whether Apple would survive as a company and therefore not sure whether I 'd soon have access to my data if I switched platforms .
I felt then that Linux would offer me protection as even if SuSE went bust , free software would mean I would n't be trapped .
I found that , at the time , SuSE had an upgrade cycle worse than Microsoft's .
I quickly got sick of this and researched other distributions .
I moved to Debian for a number of reasons , but the clincher was the social contract , which I regarded then and still regard now as a guarantee of freedom - freedom to access my data and freedom to do what I want with my computer .
I have never regretted the move to Debian .
Other reasons to like Debian are :
Debian releases upgrades when they 're ready not because they need a new revenue stream
The Debian project takes freedom ( that means my freedom ) seriously .
This means I can rely on having access to my data
Debian is safe and secure and offers different distributions depending on your expertise level and your needs
I understand how some people can get frustrated when Debian refuses to include useful proprietary software .
I think , however , that this modus operandi is right .
It means that I , the computer user , decide when I want to cross the line from free to non-free .
It means that I decide when I want to risk having my data tied up in a closed proprietary format , because I know when I 've installed non -free software .
This knowledge is important .
The current argument over the Firefox EULA shows that it 's important to others too .
Incidentally , Debian has already solved this by rebranding Firefox as Iceweasel .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have linked 32 genetic variations to Crohn ’s disease , a bowel disorder , highlighting the complexity of many common diseases and the difficulties facing researchers seeking treatments .
Scientists said on Sunday that new research had tripled the number of genetic regions implicated in Crohn ’s , the most common form of inflammatory bowel disease , and many more were probably still undiscovered .
“ These explain only about a fifth of the genetic risk , which implies that there may be hundreds of genes implicated in the disease , each increasing susceptibility by a small amount , ” said Jeffrey Barrett from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford , who led the research .
Scientists have known for years that genes , along with environmental factors , play a role in increasing the risk that people will develop many common problems like asthma , high blood pressure , rheumatoid arthritis , cancer and heart disease .
But they are still trying to work out which parts of the genome -- the 3 billion sub-units of DNA in our cells -- are actually responsible .
One way to find out is to conduct genome - wide association studies , in which genetic markers from thousands of volunteers are analyzed in order to identify genetic differences between diseased and healthy individuals .
The latest picture to emerge for Crohn ’s , which was reported in the journal Nature Genetics , represents the most complete picture yet assembled of the genetic influences on risk of a common disease .
Significantly , three of the individual genes that have been implicated in Crohn ’s have previously been shown to influence risk of type 1 diabetes and asthma , suggesting a possible common genetic mechanism underlying these disorders .
Crohn ’s disease affects between one in 500 and one in 1000 people in the industrialized world , causing inflammation , pain , ulcers and diarrhea .
Modern biotech drugs like Abbott Laboratories ’s Humira , UCB ’s Cimzia and Johnson & Johnson ’s Remicade can help , but many patients end up needing surgery .
By pinpointing genes linked to the condition , researchers hope to find fresh targets for new drugs .
One of the most promising is thought to be the CCR6 gene , which is believed to be part of the signaling machinery that causes white blood cells in the gut to become over - active , leading to inflammation .
The same white blood cells are also present in inflamed joints , implying that CCR6 may play a role in rheumatoid arthritis as well , making it of added interest to the pharmaceutical industry , Barrett and colleagues said .

There are a number of causes of atheism :
1. Mankind 's sinful nature :
The history of the atheist community and various studies concerning the atheist community point to moral decline being a causal factor for atheism . [ 2 ]
See : Atheist population and immorality and Atheism and morality
The Christian Post reports about the Christian philosopher James S. Spiegel 's book The Making of an Atheist :
“ Spiegel , who converted to Christianity in 1980 , has witnessed the pattern among several of his friends .
Their path from Christianity to atheism involved : moral slippage ( such as infidelity , resentment or unforgiveness ) ; followed by withdrawal from contact with fellow believers ; followed by growing doubts about their faith , accompanied by continued indulgence in the respective sin ; and culminating in a conscious rejection of God . [ 3 ] ”
See also : Atheism and unforgiveness
In addition , there is the historical matter of deceit being used in a major way to propagate atheism from the time of Charles Darwin onward ( see : Atheism and deception and Atheism and historical revisionism ) .
The Bible indicates that atheists are morally depraved .
The psalmist David declared : " The fool has said in his heart , ' There is no God . '
They are corrupt , they have done abominable works , there is none that doeth good . " — Psalms 14:1 ( KJV ) .
The prophet Jeremiah wrote : " The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked : who can know it ? " - Jeremiah 17:9 ( KJV )
See also : Atheism and foolishness
Francis Thompson wrote : " Maybe the atheist cannot find God for the same reason a thief cannot find a policeman . "
Moral depravity is certainly one of the prime causes of atheism .
See also : Atheism and morality and Atheism and moral intelligence and Atheism and hedonism and Atheist hypocrisy
2. Hatred towards God. Angry and bitter and attacks on Christianity and Christians by atheists are most often due to hatred towards Jesus Christ and the Bible . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
See also : Atheism and hatred of God
3. Atheistic upbringing .
However , in 2012 , a Georgetown University study was published indicating that in the United States only about 30 percent of those who grow up in an atheist household remain atheists as adults . [ 6 ]
A notable example , of a person raised in an atheistic household who later became a Christian is William J. Murray .
Mr. Murray was raised by Madalyn Murray O'Hair who founded the organization American Atheists .
In addition , Christianity is experiencing rapid growth in atheistic communist China and has experienced rapid growth in former communist countries . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
See also : Atheism and its retention rate in individuals
4. Atheistic society / environment .
See also : Atheism and groupthink and Atheism and open - mindedness
5. Pride / Rebellion : Atheism stems from a choice to ignore the reality of God 's existence . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
The atheist Friedrich Nietzsche wrote : " But now God is dead .
You superior men , this God was your greatest danger .
Only since he is in the grave , have you risen again .
Only now comes the great noontide ; only now the superior man will be – Lord ! " . [ 13 ]
Atheists have also given themselves pretentious monikers such as freethinker and rationalist ( see also : Atheists and pretentious monikers ) .
The Christian apologist Tom Gilson , after citing cases where atheists hold to views without sufficient evidence , quotes the prominent atheist Thomas Nagel who declared :
“ I want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well - informed people I know are religious believers .
It is n’t just that I do n’t believe in God and , naturally , hope that I ’m right in my belief .
It ’s that I hope there is no God !
I do n’t want there to be a God ; I do n’t want the universe to be like that . [ 14 ] ”

6. Narcissism .
See : Atheism and narcissism
7. Immaturity . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
In 2012 , a Georgetown University study was published indicating that only about 30 percent of those who grow up in an atheist household in the United States remain atheists as adults . [ 19 ]
A 2012 study by the General Social Survey of the social science research organization NORC at the University of Chicago found that belief in God rises with age , even in atheistic nations . [ 20 ]
See : Atheism and its retention rate in individuals and Atheism and immaturity
In the United States , the ages 14 – 17 are very influential in terms of an individual adopting atheism . [ 23 ]
Of those who do embrace unbelief in the United States , many do so in their high school years . [ 24 ]
Vox Day writes about immaturity being a causal factor for atheism : " the age at which most people become atheists indicates that it is almost never an intellectual decision , but an emotional one .
( This is why most self - identified atheists are angry , bitter , and immature .
The anger , bitterness , and immaturity are usually the cause of the atheism , they are not , as many Christians erroneously suppose , the effects ) . [ 25 ]
8. Anger and bitterness .
( see : Atheism and bitterness ) [ 26 ]
See also : Atheism and anger
Various studies found that traumatic events in people 's lives has a positive correlation with " emotional atheism " . [ 27 ]
See also : Atheism and the problem of evil and Atheism and suffering and Militant atheism
9. Hedonism . [ 28 ]
The Apostle Paul wrote that in the end times , men would be lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ( 2 Timothy 3:1 - 4 ) .
See also : Atheism and hedonism and Atheism and lust
The infamous pornographers Hugh Hefner and Larry Flynt are both atheists . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]
Engaging in overseas evangelism / outreaches in poor countries often requires significant hardships / persecution and western atheists by in large have been unwilling to endure such hardships in order to spread atheistic ideology - especially when compared to Christianity ( see : Western atheists have not done a significant amount of outreach to poor countries ) .
See also : Atheism and uncharitableness
10 . Naiveté / Gullibility : Many atheists have embraced a number of far fetched , unworkable , and errant notions and ideologies such as communism , abiogenesis , and evolution despite abundant evidence of their falsity .
It is often said , " A man who wo n’t believe in God will believe in anything . " [ 32 ]
See : Atheism and naiveté / gullibility and Rebuttals to atheist arguments and Causes of evolutionary belief and Atheist cults
11 . Irrational thinking : A comprehensive study by Baylor University found that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations , tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience than evangelical Christians . [ 33 ]
Also , as noted above , a 1980 study published in the magazine Skeptical Inquirer found irreligious college students to be by far the most likely to embrace paranormal beliefs , while born again Christian college students were found to be the least likely . [ 34 ]
See : Atheism and irrationality and Atheism and logic
12 . Superficiality : Noted ex-atheist and psychologist Dr. Paul Vitz has stated that he had superficial reasons for becoming an atheist such as the desire to be accepted by his Stanford University professors who were united in disbelief regarding God . [ 35 ]
13 . Error : Some argue that atheism partly stems from a failure to fairly and judiciously consider the facts [ 38 ]
14 . State churches :
In regards to the causes of atheism , rates of atheism are much higher in countries with a state sanctioned religion ( such as many European countries ) , and lower in states without a sanctioned religion ( such as the United States ) .
Some argue this is because state churches become bloated , corrupt , and / or out of touch with the religious intuitions of the population , while churches independent of the state are leaner and more adaptable .
It is important to distinguish " state - sanctioned churches , " where participation is voluntary , from " state - mandated churches " ( such as Saudi Arabia ) with much lower atheism rates because publicly admitted atheism is punishable by death . [ 39 ]
15 . Decline of family in a culture - Mary Eberstadt , a research fellow at Stanford University ’s Hoover Institution , found the decline of family values leads to a rise in secularization . [ 40 ]
16 . Socialism / Communism [ 41 ] [ 42 ]
See also : Atheism and communism and Atheism and socialism and Atheism and politics
According to the University of Cambridge , historically , the " most notable spread of atheism was achieved through the success of the 1917 Russian Revolution , which brought the Marxist - Leninists to power . " [ 43 ]
Vitalij Lazarʹevič Ginzburg , a Soviet physicist , wrote that the " Bolshevik communists were not merely atheists but , according to Lenin 's terminology , militant atheists . " [ 44 ]
Communist China has the largest atheism population in the world and a significant percentage of Chinese are atheists ( see : China and atheism ) .
Most atheists in the world are likely East Asians ( See : Asian atheism ) .
However , as noted above , China is seeing an explosive growth of Christianity ( see : Growth of Christianity in China ) .
However , prior to this , the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution established an atheist state , with the official ideology being the Cult of Reason ; during this time thousands of believers were suppressed and executed by the guillotine . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ]
The atheism in communist regimes has been and continues to be militant atheism and various acts of repression including the razing of thousands of religious buildings and the killing , imprisoning , and oppression of religious leaders and believers . [ 48 ]
The Acton Institute states concerning atheism and socialism :
“ ... a growing body of research reveals that as the welfare state grows , the church shrinks .
Adam Kay of Duke University discovered that church and state have a “ hydraulic relationship ” : Events “ that lower faith in one of these external systems ( e.g. , the government ) lead to subsequent increases in faith in the other ( e.g. , God ) . ”
Another study found that increased welfare spending “ in a specific year predicted lower religiosity one to two years later . ”
It concluded , “ The power and order emanating from God can be outsourced to the government . ” ... ... faith in the transcendent gets crowded out by faith in socialism ’s utopian promise of equality - of - outcome on earth .
This path transformed Michael Harrington from a daily communicant volunteering in the Catholic Worker movement to the atheistic founder of the Democratic Socialists of America . [ 49 ] ”
Eric Kaufmann , an academic who specializes in demography as it relates to religion / politics , wrote :
“ Worldwide , the march of religion can probably only be reversed by a renewed , self - aware secularism .
Today , it appears exhausted and lacking in confidence ...
Secularism 's greatest triumphs owe less to science than to popular social movements like nationalism , socialism and 1960s anarchist - liberalism .
Ironically , secularism 's demographic deficit means that it will probably only succeed in the twenty - first century if it can create a secular form of ' religious ' enthusiasm . " [ 50 ] ”
17 . Simplistic view of science combined with secular leftist utopianism . [ 51 ]
James W. Jones wrote at the Oxford University Press 's website :
“ Many of today ’s “ New Atheists ” reprise a nineteenth century argument about the “ warfare of science with theology ” ( to use the title of one of the most well - known books of this genre by A.D. White published in the 1870s ) .
There is a great deal of evidence that this cliché has little historical validity .
For example , R. L. Numbers & K. Kampourakis question the idea that religion has obstructed scientific progress : many of the early pioneers of natural science were deeply religious ; ...
Stephen LeDrew ’s
The Evolution of Atheism shows that atheism is not just the denial of belief in God but is itself a system of belief in a “ secular ideology ” with a particular cultural and political agenda , an agenda powered by a simplistic view of science and a rationalistic utopianism that “ exhibits some totalitarian tendencies with respect to the use of power . ”
If religion no longer binds society together and undergirds morality , state power must take over . [ 52 ] ”
18 . Scientism : Science has in many ways become a new god . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]
Scientism is self - refuting .
William Lane Craig wrote : " Scientism tells us that we should not believe any proposition that cannot be scientifically proven .
But what about that very proposition itself ?
It can not itself be scientifically proven . " [ 56 ]
See also : Atheism , scientism and the limitations of science and Atheism and naturalistic intelligence
19 . Self - deception [ 57 ]
20 . Satanic deception [ 58 ] ( see also : Atheism and satanic deception )
21 . Division in religion : According to Sir Francis Bacon , atheism is caused by " divisions in religion , if they be many ; for any one main division addeth zeal to both sides , but many divisions introduce atheism . " [ 59 ]
22 . Ignorance .
The ex-atheist C.S. Lewis wrote : " In reading Chesterton , as in reading MacDonald , I did not know what I was letting myself in for .
A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading .
There are traps everywhere - -" Bibles laid open , millions of surprises , " as Herbert says , " fine nets and stratgems . "
Sir Francis Bacon wrote : " A little philosophy inclineth man 's mind to atheism , but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion . "
See also : Christian apologetics
Individuals such as Calvin Smith of Creation Ministries International have reported leaving atheism after finding out the falsehood of evolutionary pseudoscience and the evidence for biblical creation . [ 60 ]
The ex-atheist Lee Strobel in his book " The Case for Christ " indicates how he used his journalist skills and legal training to discover the truth of the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
See also : Christian legal apologetics
For more information see : Atheism and education
23 . Indoctrination and ease of life : Francis Bacon argued that atheism was partly caused by : " Learned times , specially with peace and prosperity ; for troubles and adversities do more bow men ’s minds to religion . " [ 61 ]
See : Atheism and economic prosperity
In addition , see please see : Atheist indoctrination and Atheism and historical revisionism and Atheism / Christianity and economic diversity and Atheism and economics
In addition , Jewish columnist Dennis Prager has stated that a causal factor of atheism is the " secular indoctrination of a generation . " [ 62 ]
Prager stated that " From elementary school through graduate school , only one way of looking at the world – the secular – is presented .
The typical individual in the Western world receives as secular an indoctrination as the typical European received a religious one in the Middle Ages . " [ 63 ]
In 2013 , an study found that academia was less likely to hire evangelical Christians due to discriminatory attitudes . [ 64 ]
Atheists have focused considerable efforts on the public schools in order to indoctrinate young people into atheistic beliefs . [ 65 ] [ 66 ]
In addition , in communist countries ( such as the former Soviet Union ) atheistic indoctrination occurred in the educational system through such venues as schools , atheist museums , and clubs . [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
Atheists and secularists rarely point out that universities such as Harvard , Princeton , Oxford , Cambridge , and many others were founded by Christians . [ 69 ] [ 70 ]
Although the United States with its tradition of religious freedom and a strong work ethic has experienced high levels of prosperity and religiosity , often prosperity is inversely proportional to religious belief due to men's arrogance when they become wealthier . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]
Vox Day has pointed out that arrogant and godless nations have often eventually experienced significant hardships . [ 73 ]

Countries with higher rates of Darwinism also have higher rates of atheism . [ 74 ] [ 75 ]
Biblical creationists , such as advocates of the Question evolution !
campaign , assert that evolutionism is an ideological " air supply of atheism " and that reducing Darwinism will reduce the prevalence of atheism . [ 76 ]

30 .
In cultures not receptive to atheism , atheists appear to be more likely to be social outcasts ( see : Atheism and social outcasts ) .
In short , in certain cases , namely where atheists are already social outcasts , they have less negative social consequences by becoming atheists .
According to an international study done by William Bainbridge , atheism is common among people whose interpersonal social obligations are weak and is also connected to lower fertility rates in advanced industrial nations ( See also : Atheism and fertility rates ) . [ 78 ]
31 . Rigid and limited thinking .
See : Atheism is an unnecessarily limiting view of the world
32 . Denialism ( See : Atheists and the fallacy of exclusion and Atheism and historical revisionism ) .
33 .
Atheists often have a poor understanding of the various types of evidence to determine the validity of various matters and how to weigh evidence ( see : Atheism and evidence ) .
34 . Nick Spencer , author of Atheists : The Origin of the Species , wrote : " modern atheism was primarily a political and social cause , its development in Europe having rather more to do with the ( ab) use of theologically legitimized political authority than it does with developments in science or philosophy " . [ 79 ]
35 . Genetics
Urbanization and separation from nature as a causal factor for atheism
See also : Atheism and wonder
An Eastern Orthodox website indicates :
“ As a mass phenomenon , atheism has come to existence over the last two hundred years .
It is the result of separation of humans from direct contact with nature , which occurred when significant amounts of population started to move from countryside to towns ...
In the past people used to be closer to nature , and an atheist was a rare bird .
It is a common knowledge that since pre-historic times the idea of a supreme being has been widely spread among people at all stages of development .
" Look at the face of the earth , " wrote Plutarch ( 1st century AD ) , — and you will see townships without fortification , sciences or hierarchy , you will see people without permanent dwelling , not knowing money , having no idea of the fine arts , but you will not find any one human community without a belief in a Divinity . " [ 80 ] ”
Professor Rabbi Justin Jaron Lewis at the University of Manitoba states :
“ Light pollution is the cause of the increase in atheism .
This is my conclusion after spending some time this summer at cottages and cabins far from city lights .
The sight of the Milky Way and all the stars around , filling the sky with daubs of light , filled my heart with wonder – as they would anyone .
That kind of wonder has often been expressed in religious feelings and prayers .
The Bible tells us that in ancient times the stars themselves were worshipped .
In Judaism , the common term for idolaters is ovdei kokhavim , “ worshippers of the stars . ”
Even in Jewish tradition , the stars are seen as alive – as the bodies of angels .
They are the “ hosts of heaven ” – hosts meaning “ armies ” or “ multitudes ” – who praise the Creator and do God ’s will .
The Christian author C.S. Lewis embraced this vision as well .
In one of his stories about the magical world Narnia , the children meet a majestic old man who is introduced to them as a star from the sky .
A skeptical child says , “ A star is a huge ball of flaming gas ! ” and the old man replies , “ Even in your world , that is not what a star is but only what it is made of . ”
Of course , it is possible to think of the stars strictly in accordance with modern science , and still be overwhelmed with awe and delight on seeing them . [ 81 ] ”
Rural Americans tend to be more religious .
Annie Laurie Gaylor , co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation indicates : " It ’s still lonely being an atheist in rural America . " [ 82 ]

Prominent historical figures , parental loss and atheism
See also : Psychology of atheism and Atheism and poor relationships with parents
The atheist philosopher Michael Martin declared in the Cambridge Companion to Atheism :
“ Continuity and discontinuity in any identity may be a function of interpersonal networks , especially involving intimate relations .
Apostasy and conversion can both be seen as a rejection of parental identity and parental beliefs .
It “ might well be symptomatic of familial strain and dissociation ... apostasy is to be viewed as a form of rebellion against parents ” ( Caplovitz and Sherrow , 1977:50 ) . [ 83 ] ”
In 2012 , a Georgetown University study was published indicating that only about 30 percent of those who grow up in an atheist household remain atheists as adults . [ 84 ]

A troubled / non- existent relationship with a father is theorized to influence a person to become an atheist . [ 85 ]
The Daily Mail reported that a study conducted by Public Religion Research Institute in partnership with the Religion News Service found that " children raised by divorced parents are more likely than children whose parents are married to be non-religious as adults . " [ 86 ]
Dr. Paul Vitz wrote a book entitled Faith of the Fatherless in which he points out that after studying the lives of more than a dozen leading atheists he found that a large majority of them had a father who was present but weak , present but abusive , or absent . [ 87 ] [ 88 ]
Dr. Vitz also examined the lives of prominent theists who were contemporaneous to their atheist counterparts and from the same culture and in every instance these prominent theists had a good relationship with his father . [ 89 ]
Dr. Vitz has also stated other common factors he observed in the leading atheists he profiled : they were all intelligent and arrogant . [ 90 ]
Vitz argues that the defective / absent father theory as a cause of atheism best fits cases where people are militant / intense atheists and that his theory applies in at least 50 % of these instances ( Vitz does believe in free will and therefore a person with a defective father is not necessarily going to become an atheist ) . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ]
The book Atheist Persona : Causes and Consequences by John J. Pasquini , Th.D. indicates that many of the prominent atheists ( and prominent practical atheists ) who had dysfunctional / absent fathers that he lists in his book also had dysfunctional / absent mothers . [ 94 ]

The General Social Survey ( GSS ) data on atheism uses a broad definition of atheism which can include agnostics . [ 95 ]
The abstract for journal article An Assessment of the Role of Early Parental Loss in the Adoption of Atheism or Irreligion by Frank L. Pasquale indicates :
“ Early parental loss or trauma has been proposed by some as a significant factor in the adoption of atheist , non-theist , or irreligious worldviews .
Relevant empirical data , however , have been limited , impressionistic , methodologically questionable , or limited to historically prominent figures .
Survey data from the GSS and a study of affirmatively non-theistic and irreligious secular group affiliates in the U.S. do not provide evidence of disproportionately high rates of early parental loss among individuals who describe themselves as “ atheist ( ic ) ” or “ anti-religious , ” reject belief in God , or express strong anger about religion .
Loss of a parent or other loved may play a role in turns toward , as well as away from , God and religion for some .
There is also evidence of comparatively high rates of parental loss in the lives of historically prominent figures , both religious and non-religious .
Present results , however , do not support the hypothesis that early loss is a disproportionately frequent experience in the lives of ( “ ordinary ” ) atheistic or irreligious people . [ 96 ] ”
As far as Pasquale 's study and his conclusions , as noted above , Vitz indicates that his defective / absent father theory best fits intense atheists and that his theory is not universally applicable to all atheists .
Errant notion that atheism is the result of higher intelligence
See also : Atheism and intelligence and Atheism and education and Rebuttals to atheist arguments
A common errant notions among atheists is the mistaken belief that atheism is the result of higher intelligence .
This belief often the result of excessive pride , the foolish nature of atheists and self - deception .
For more information , please see : Atheism and intelligence .
Also , due the lack of evidence for atheism and the great amount of evidence for Christianity , atheism is not a respectable intellectual position .
For example , God 's creation plainly points to the existence of God [ 97 ] ( see also : Atheism and its retention rate in individuals ) .
Brain researchers and social scientists have conducted a number of studies focusing on the differences between atheist / theists within Western World countries ( See : Atheism and the brain ) .
Nevertheless , the decision to follow God is ultimately a moral / spiritual concern .
Sigmund Freud 's view of religion
See also : Sigmund Freud 's view of religion and Atheism and health
Psychologist Sigmund Freud was a proponent of atheism who argued that theism was detrimental to mental health . [ 98 ]
Oxford Professor Alister McGrath , author of the book The Twilight of Atheism , stated the following regarding Freud :
“ One of the most important criticisms that Sigmund Freud directed against religion was that it encourages unhealthy and dysfunctional outlooks on life .
Having dismissed religion as an illusion , Freud went on to argue that it is a negative factor in personal development .
At times , Freud 's influence has been such that the elimination of a person 's religious beliefs has been seen as a precondition for mental health .
Freud is now a fallen idol , the fall having been all the heavier for its postponement .
There is now growing awareness of the importance of spirituality in health care , both as a positive factor in relation to well - being and as an issue to which patients have a right .
The " Spirituality and Healing in Medicine " conference sponsored by Harvard Medical School in 1998 brought reports that 86 percent of Americans as a whole , 99 percent of family physicians , and 94 percent of HMO professionals believe that prayer , meditation , and other spiritual and religious practices exercise a major positive role within the healing process . [ 98 ] ”
Freud remains popular among postmodern literary academics , who use his anti-Christian pseudoscience as a basis for their own anti-Christianity and moral relativism , even though his theories were disproved decades ago .
Factors which impede the spread of atheism
See also : Causes of desecularization
Atheism is in decline worldwide , with the number of atheists falling from 4.5 % of the world 's population in 1970 to 2.0 % in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8 % by 2020 . [ 99 ]
On December 23 , 2012 , Professor Eric Kaufmann who teaches at Birbeck College , University of London wrote : " I argue that 97 % of the world 's population growth is taking place in the developing world , where 95 % of people are religious " .
[ 100 ]
There are a number of factors which impede the spread of atheism and are causing a global resurgence of religion ( see : Causes of desecularization ) .

" The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door and deny Him by their lifestyle .
That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable . " - Brennan Manning [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ]

Former Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta answered questions from members of 9/11 Truth Seattle.org about his testimony before the 9/11 Commission report .
Mineta says Vice President Cheney was " absolutely " already there when he arrived at approximately 9:25 a.m. in the PEOC ( Presidential Emergency Operations Center ) bunker on the morning of 9/11 .
Mineta seemed shocked to learn that the 9/11 Commission Report claimed Cheney had not arrived there until 9:58 -- after the Pentagon had been hit , a report that Mineta definitively contradicted .
Norman Mineta revealed that Lynn Cheney was also in the PEOC bunker already at the time of his arrival , along with a number of other staff .

US swimmer Michael Phelps made history yesterday when he scooped a record - breaking 11th Olympic gold medal .
He has now topped the podium five times in Beijing .
After his latest victory , he revealed the secret behind his six - days - a - week , five - hours - a - day training regime : an extraordinary 12,000 - calorie daily diet , six times the intake of a normal adult male .
This is a typical day :
Breakfast
Phelps kick starts his day and his metabolism with three fried - egg sandwiches , but with a few customised additions : cheese , lettuce , tomatoes , fried onions and , of course , mayonnaise .
Amuse - bouche out of the way , he throws back two cups of coffee and sits down to an omelette - containing five eggs - and a bowl of grits , a porridge of coarsely ground corn .
He 's not finished yet .
Bring on the three slices of French toast , with powdered sugar on top to make sure there 's no skimping on the calories .
And to finish : three chocolate chip pancakes .
Lunch
With breakfast wearing off and the hunger pangs biting , Phelps downs half a kilogram - ie a whole packet - of enriched pasta and two large ham and cheese sandwiches .
On white bread with loads of mayo on top .
To remove any chance that his body will run out of fuel , he washes this down with about 1,000 calories of energy drink .
Dinner
Time to load up on carbs for the next day 's training .
Another half kilo of enriched pasta goes down the hatch with a chaser of an entire pizza and another 1,000 calories of energy drinks .
And so to bed .
As Phelps told US television channel NBC yesterday : " Eat , sleep and swim , that 's all I can do . "

He was not the first to raise the issue .

BofA has officially acquired Countrywide Financial – but not without taking on a surprisingly large amount of risk in times like these .
It ’s official : Bank of America has acquired Countrywide Financial , marking the completion of an audacious rescue of one of the most troubled lenders in the United States .
The deal will expand Bank of America ’s reach in the mortgage business — but , in the current environment of rising defaults and delinquencies among American homeowners , the expansion obviously comes with serious risks .
Countrywide was among the largest lenders in California and Florida , two states hit especially hard by the housing downturn .
Both states have sued Countrywide alleging it engaged in unfair and deceptive lending practices .
What ’s more , Countrywide has a big portfolio of home equity lines of credit , which some fear will be hit with a rash of defaults as borrowers run short of cash .
Some analysts had urged Bank of America to abandon the deal .
And judging from the swings in Countrywide ’s stock in the six months since the deal was announced , the markets have been questioning Bank of America ’s commitment to buying it .
And yet Kenneth Lewis , Bank of America ’s chief executive , has been resolute that the purchase would go through .
One of the biggest problems is that while Bank of America has said that the combined mortgage branch will no longer originate subprime mortgages and stop making Option ARM loans ( which can be deadly ) , the amount of those existing loans it absorbs from Countrywide put BofA at considerable risk .
Wachovia recently made an unexpected announcement that they were removing the pre-pay penalty from ALL Option ARMs implying that they see the massive liability to be great enough to forgo profits that can be made on it .
It may seem like a small step , but it ’s a rather significant one for a bank like Wachovia .
With BofA mum on any details of it doing the same , we ’re lead to believe that they ’re chasing the dollar , even if the dollar is veering every close to that gigantic cliff off in the distance .
Bank of America might be wise to consider evaluating its footing before getting too close .
The tremors from the existing banking and economic crisis are enough to move giants and it ’s not a time to be caught with your pants down .
Bank of America is assuming that losses from lawsuits , now worthless Home Equity Lines of Credit , and Option ARMs , will be much less than they can make for the bank , so we ’ll see if their bet pays off .
The Democratic Congress passed and Bush signed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 ,  legalizing the presidents longstanding illegal wiretapping program .
The law allows broad warrantless surveillance of Americans in the United States , so long as the call or e-mail is thought to be international .
Eavesdropping on domestic communications is legal for a week before court papers even have to be filed .
The telecom companies that cooperated with Bush are immune from civil lawsuits .
Most important , the administrations illegal conduct has been retroactively approved and future administrations have wider powers than ever to spy on Americans .
The Democratic leadership and virtually all Congressional Republicans approved the law .
In a complete reversal of his campaign promise , so did Senator Barack Obama .
Last October , his campaign announced ,  To be clear : Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies .
Instead , he voted to prevent a filibuster and then he voted for the bill .
Democrats and Obama supporters defend the betrayal with hollow claims that the law actually protects civil liberties .
Why then was Bush so eager to sign it ?
Missouri Republican Senator Christopher Bond , a leader in this compromise ,  says  the White House got a better deal than even they had hoped . 
Two years ago , the Democrats seemed outraged after we learned Bush had ordered the National Security Agency  a military outfit to spy on Americans without warrants , in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Now they control Congress with good odds at the presidency .
Power and the hope for more power corrupt .
As Salon.com civil liberties expert Glenn Greenwald notes , in 2006 , when the Congress was controlled by [ Republicans ] , the administration tried to get a bill passed legalizing warrantless eavesdropping and telecom amnesty , but was unable .
They had to wait until the Congress was controlled by [ Democrats ] Steny Hoyer , Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to accomplish that . 
Both parties have long been at war with the Fourth Amendment .
In 1978 , after the Senates Church Committee reported decades of intelligence abuses , President Carter signed FISA to regulate foreign surveillance .
It created a secret court within the Justice Department with unpublished decisions that went on to grant warrants for every one out of thirteen thousand requests up until 9/11 .
FISAs standards were already much lower than the Constitutions .
Almost all Republicans and Democrats voted for the Patriot Act in 2001 to amend FISA more to Bushs liking .
Supposedly , FISA had obstructed investigations of such terror suspects as twentieth hijacker  Zacarias Moussaoui .
In reality , the FBI agents could have gotten a warrant for him had they understood the law .
In 2002 , after the FISA court unanimously rejected the administrations attempt to revamp it for law enforcement , the Justice Department , under John Ashcroft , successfully appealed to a special , secret FISA Appeals Court and got the new powers they wanted .
Despite all this capitulation to the administration , for years the NSA has been ignoring FISA altogether to wiretap calls within the United States .
We do not know the extent of Bushs extrajudicial surveillance .
But in 2004 , even John Ashcroft and other Justice Department officials considered his spying program illegal , refused to sign off on it , and threatened to resign over it , according to former Deputy Attorney General James Comeys testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee last year .
And now Obama and the Democratic leadership have approved the extrajudicial activity that even Ashcroft considered outrageously illegal .
This is no surprise , actually .
Democratic presidents since Wilson and FDR have long abused intelligence powers , spying on large groups of peaceful Americans and political opponents .
Under Republicans like Eisenhower and Nixon , the abuses continued .
Carters approval of FISA was itself an abandonment of the Fourth Amendment and Bill Clinton widened stealth surveillance of the citizenry far more than any president before him .
Now Bush has set new precedents in extrajudicial spying and the Democrats give every indication the trend will continue .
Having broken his promise to oppose the new law , Obama now promises to monitor the program closely  as president  but who will monitor him ?
The Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect us from an unchecked executive , no matter the president , no matter the party .
The Fourth Amendment offers little comfort and trust toward would - be rulers .
No wonder the feeling is mutual .
An ingenious study just published in the Journal of Consumer Research has provided a striking demonstration that taste perceptions and product preferences are strongly influenced by our personal values – to the point where people who believe in the importance of social authority perceived a sausage roll labelled as vegetarian as far inferior to a ‘ meat ’ version , even though they ate the same sausage roll on both occasions .
The same result appeared whether the participants actually ate meat or vegetarian sausage rolls , and the participants could n’t reliably distinguish the two in any condition .
The study , led by psychologist Michael Allen , is a neat demonstration of how our product preferences are influenced by an interaction of our personal values , the cultural meaning of the product and its physical properties , along the lines of an earlier study that found that wine described as more expensive tastes better , even when it was no different from the same wine described as being cheaper .
Of relevance to this study is that fact that red meat has been consistently associated with social power while grains , fruits and vegetables with social equality .
What this new study suggests is that these social meanings interact with our own values to affect our perception .
If you think this effect might be specific to sausages , the study conducted a similar experiment with brands of cola , finding that people who endorsed the values linked to Pepsi ( excitement , enjoyment , social power and recognition ) perceived a cola labelled as Pepsi as tasting better , regardless of whether it actually was the genuine article , or whether it was a budget supermarket brand .
As we ’ve discussed previously , perhaps what ’s most interesting is that most consumers tend to think that they select products primarily on the basis of physical properties , despite plenty of evidence to the contrary .
This is the ‘ psychological blind spot ’ which most marketing is targeted at .
Indeed , I ’ve always suspected that it ’s the people who say “ advertising does n’t affect me ” who are the marketers ’ dream consumer , largely because they lack insight into the inescapable effects of marketing .
The study is well worth reading in full , or failing that , just the first few pages , as the introduction is a fascinating review of the psychology of product symbolism and how it affects decisions and preferences .
This research suggests that products have important social meanings that much product preference is driven by a need to manage our social appearance and identity .
It ’s not that people who strongly identify with the importance of social power and eat red meat , or people who identify with excitement and drink Pepsi , just say they taste better .
The taste is genuinely different for them , but only when they think they are consuming these products .
Assuming the products are similar to a certain degree , a significant slice of our perception is actually driven by what we want to be the case because of the values we already hold .

In the ongoing battle to let us eat dinner in peace without being interrupted by amazingly annoying telemarketer blather and in this case the even more infuriating recorded telemarketing drivel , the Federal Trade Commission today basically outlawed such calls .
Specifically , the FTC changed its venerable Telemarketing Sales Rule ( TSR ) to prohibit , as of Sept. 2009 , telemarketing calls that deliver prerecorded messages , unless a consumer has agreed to accept such calls from a given caller / seller .
Between now and 2009 , telemarketers must provide an obvious , easy and quick way for consumers to opt - out of any call , the FTC said .
Such an opt - out mechanism needs to be in place by December 1 , 2008 .
The change will not affect your ability to continue to receive calls that deliver informational prerecorded messages - notifying you , for example , that your flight has been cancelled , or that you have a service appointment .
Such purely " informational " calls are not covered by the TSR because they do not attempt to sell the called party any goods or services , the FTC said .
However for those who have called on the FTC to help eliminate the other phone scourge - political robocalls - the new rule will not help .
Calls from political campaigns are considered protected speech an FTC representative said .
Ultimately consumers may get some help from state legislatures as many are regulating or looking to pass laws for more control over automated or robocall computer - generated phone - calling campaigns .
One group , the National Political Do Not Contact Registry is campaigning to outlaw political robocalling altogether .
Meanwhile , the FTC also adopted a regulation changing the way telemarketers use the phone .
No doubt if you have received an unsolicited telemarketing call , there is a delay in the time when you pick up and say " hello " and the response on the other end .
Sometimes no one answers at all .
This situation is called " call abandonment " by the FTC and it has tweaked its enforcement of such delay or non-responses .
The TSR in fact requires that at least 97 % of a telemarketer 's calls be answered in person and get connected to a salesperson within two seconds after a consumer answers .
Call abandonment is a side - effect of very efficient telemarketing equipment called predictive dialers .
Predictive dialers place calls in anticipation that a salesperson will become available by the time one of the numbers called is answered , the FTC said .
Here though the FTC is making a more subtle change .
While retaining the 97 % requirement , it will now calculate call abandonment over a 30 - day period , rather than on a daily basis as is now the case .
The change will permit the use of smaller calling lists than before without an appreciable increase in call abandonments , the FTC claims .
It will let all sellers target their calling campaigns to consumers most likely to be interested in their offer , and will benefit small businesses that have smaller customer lists in particular , the FTC said .
The modified method for measuring the maximum allowable rate of call abandonment will become effective on October 1 , 2008 .
The new rules come in part from over 14,000 comments the agency received on the subjects since it last changed or proposed changes to the rules in 2006 .
Who needs to learn how to read ?
After all , we all learned how to read fairly early in life , usually in elementary school , right ?
But do you know how to really read ?
More importantly , are you really reading ?
Reading can make you a better writer , as long as you ’re paying attention and actually leaving time to write .
What we ’re talking about here is what you say , rather than how you say it .
If you have n’t noticed , competition in the world of online content is fierce .
Anyone playing to win is searching high and low for information that others do n’t have , which for many means subscribing to a ridiculous number of sites .
While seeking out novel information from a wide variety of sources is admirable , it does n’t necessarily give you an advantage .
The ancient Greeks had a label for those who were widely read but not well read — they called them sophomores .
As in sophomoric … not a second - year college student .
( I suppose there ’s not really much of a distinction . )
Scanners and pleasure seekers
We know that people do n’t read well online .
They ruthlessly scan for interesting chunks of information rather than digesting the whole , and they want to be entertained in the process .
This is the reality that online publishers deal with , so we disguise our nuggets of wisdom with friendly formatting and clever analogies .
But that does n’t mean you should read that way .
If you ’ve been publishing online for even a small amount of time , you ’ve seen someone leave a comment that clearly demonstrates they did n’t read or understand your content .
It ’s even more painful when someone writes a responsive post that clearly misses the entire point of the original article .
While it happens to all of us from time to time , you do n’t want to consistently be one of these people .
Credibility is hard enough to establish without routinely demonstrating that you fail to grasp a topic you ’ve chosen to write about , whether in an article or a comment .
Plus , if you ’re doing nothing but scanning hundreds of headlines and reading purely to be entertained , you ’re at a disadvantage .
Someone in your niche or industry is likely reading books and reading deeper to become a higher authority .
Or they will after they read this article .
Information vs. understanding
People often think of learning as an information - gathering and retention process .
But being able to recall and regurgitate information is low - level learning compared with insightful understanding .
We ’ve all come across bloggers who are big on regurgitation .
These cut - and - paste creatives add value to the world through a mash - up of sources , right ?
Maybe .
But without the ability to understand and communicate what it all means for the reader , you ’re simply passing on your reading obligations to others , and that ’s not giving people what they look for in a publication .
On the other hand , if you understand everything you read upon a casual once over , are you truly learning anything new ?
The material that gives you an edge in the insight department is the stuff that ’s harder to understand .
In other words , the writer is your superior when it comes to that particular subject matter , and it ’s your job to close the expertise gap by reading well .
You do that by moving beyond learning by instruction , and increasing your true understanding by discovery .
For example , you read a challenging book full of great information , and you understand enough of it to know that you do n’t understand all of it .
At that point , you can dive into the book again and read more carefully .
You can go to supplemental resources .
You can read other books .
All that matters is you do the work rather than asking someone , and I guarantee you ’re really learning in the process .
So , next time you read a challenging blog post and you ’re not clear on a point , your first inclination might be to ask a question in the comments .
Instead , read the post again .
If it ’s still not clear , go do some research on your own to see if you can figure it out .
Then when you finally do ask a question , you ’re on an entirely different level of understanding and can likely engage in a meaningful dialogue with the author .
Instruction is important and beneficial .
But true understanding comes from your own exploration and discovery along the path .
The four levels of reading
Back in 1940 , a guy named Mortimer J. Adler jolted the “ widely read ” into realizing they might not be well read with a book called How to Read a Book .
Updated in 1972 and still relevant today , How to Read a Book identifies four levels of reading :
Elementary
Inspectional
Analytical
Syntopical
Each of these reading levels is cumulative .
You ca n’t progress to a higher level without mastering the levels that come before .
1. Elementary reading
Aptly named , elementary reading consists of remedial literacy , and it ’s usually achieved during the elementary schooling years .
Sadly , many high schools and colleges must offer remedial reading courses to ensure that elementary reading levels are maintained , but very little instruction in advanced reading is offered .
2. Inspectional reading
Scanning and superficial reading are not evil , as long as approached as an active process that serves an appropriate purpose .
Inspectional reading means giving a piece of writing a quick yet meaningful advance review in order to evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience .
There are two types :
1. Skimming
This is the equivalent of scanning a blog post to see if you want to read it carefully .
You ’re checking the title , the subheads , and you ’re selectively dipping in and out of content to gauge interest .
The same can be done with a book — go beyond the dust jacket and peruse the table of contents and each chapter , but give yourself a set amount of time to do it .
2. Superficial
Superficial reading is just that … you simply read .
You do n’t ponder , and you do n’t stop to look things up .
If you do n’t get something , you do n’t worry about it .
You ’re basically priming yourself to read again at a higher level if the subject matter is worthy .
Stopping at inspectional reading is only appropriate if you find no use for the material .
Unfortunately , this is all the reading some people do in preparation for their own writing .
3. Analytical reading
At this level of reading , you ’ve moved beyond superficial reading and mere information absorption .
You ’re now engaging your critical mind to dig down into the meaning and motivation beyond the text .
To get a true understanding of a book , you would :
Identify and classify the subject matter as a whole
Divide it into main parts and outline those parts
Define the problem (s ) the author is trying to solve
Understand the author ’s terms and key words
Grasp the author ’s important propositions
Know the author ’s arguments
Determine whether the author solves the intended problems
Show where the author is uninformed , misinformed , illogical , or incomplete
You ’ll note that the inspectional reading you did perfectly sets the stage for an analytical reading .
But so far , we ’re talking about reading one book .
The highest level of reading allows you to synthesize knowledge from a comparative reading of several books about the same subject .
4. Syntopical reading
It ’s been said that anyone can read five books on a topic and be an expert .
That may be true , but how you read those five books will make all the difference .
If you read those five books analytically , you will become an expert on what five authors have said .
If you read five books syntopically , you will develop your own unique perspective and expertise in the field .
In other words , syntopical reading is not about the existing experts .
It ’s about you and the problems you ’re trying to solve , in this case for your own readers .
In this sense , the books you read are simply tools that allow you to form an understanding that ’s never quite existed before .
You ’ve melded the information in those books with your own life experience and other knowledge to make novel connections and new insights .
You , my friend , are now an expert in your own right .
Here are the five steps to syntopical reading :
1. Inspection
Inspectional reading is critical to syntopical reading .
You must quickly identify which five ( or 15 ) books you need to read from a sea of unworthy titles .
Then you must also quickly identify the relevant parts and passages that satisfy your unique focus .
2. Assimilation
In analytical reading , you identify the author ’s chosen language by spotting the author ’s terms of art and key words .
This time , you assimilate the language of each author into the terms of art and key words that you choose , whether by agreeing with the language of one author or devising your own terminology .
3. Questions
This time , the focus is on what questions you want answered ( problems solved ) , as opposed to the problems each author wants to solve .
This may require that you draw inferences if any particular author does not directly address one of your questions .
If any one author fails to address any of your questions , you messed up at the inspection stage .
4. Issues
When you ask a good question , you ’ve identified an issue .
When experts have differing or contradictory responses to the same question , you ’re able to flesh out all sides of an issue , based on the existing literature .
When you understand multiple perspectives within an individual issue , you can intelligently discuss the issue , and come to your own conclusion ( which may differ from everyone else , thereby expanding the issue and hopefully adding unique value ) .
5. Conversation
Determining the “ truth ” via syntopical reading is not really the point , since disagreements about truth abound with just about any topic .
The value is found within the discussion among competing view points concerning the same root information , and you ’re now conversant enough to hold your own in a discussion of experts .
This is what the “ online conversation ” was supposed to look like according to early bloggers , and sometimes , it does .
But mostly , online conversation looks like the unqualified , unsubstantiated opinions of the ill - informed , and you ’re not looking to be part of that scene .
Be a demanding reader for the win
Reading , at its fundamental essence , is not about absorbing information .
It ’s about asking questions , looking for answers , understanding the various answers , and deciding for yourself .
Think of reading this way , and you quickly realize how this allows you to deliver unique value to your readers as a publisher .
If you think all of this sounds like a lot of work , well … you ’re right .
And most people wo n’t do it , just like most people will never write their own content in the first place .
That ’s why your readers need you .
They need you to do the work for them , because they do n’t want to become an expert .
So , it ’s your job to understand the complex and grasp the essentials , then make it simple , easy to read , and entertaining .
You ’re on it , right ?
In recent years our papers have brought you a great deal of information the White House never intended for you to know — classified secrets about the questionable intelligence that led the country to war in Iraq , about the abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan , about the transfer of suspects to countries that are not squeamish about using torture , about eavesdropping without warrants .
As Robert G. Kaiser , associate editor of The Washington Post , asked recently in the pages of that newspaper : " You may have been shocked by these revelations , or not at all disturbed by them , but would you have preferred not to know them at all ?
If a war is being waged in America 's name , should n't Americans understand how it is being waged ? "
Government officials , understandably , want it both ways .
They want us to protect their secrets , and they want us to trumpet their successes .
A few days ago , Treasury Secretary John Snow said he was scandalized by our decision to report on the bank - monitoring program .
But in September 2003 the same Secretary Snow invited a group of reporters from our papers , The Wall Street Journal and others to travel with him and his aides on a military aircraft for a six - day tour to show off the department 's efforts to track terrorist financing .
The secretary 's team discussed many sensitive details of their monitoring efforts , hoping they would appear in print and demonstrate the administration 's relentlessness against the terrorist threat .
How do we , as editors , reconcile the obligation to inform with the instinct to protect ?
Sometimes the judgments are easy .
Our reporters in Iraq and Afghanistan , for example , take great care not to divulge operational intelligence in their news reports , knowing that in this wired age it could be seen and used by insurgents .
Often the judgments are painfully hard .
In those cases , we cool our competitive jets and begin an intensive deliberative process .
The process begins with reporting .
Sensitive stories do not fall into our hands .
They may begin with a tip from a source who has a grievance or a guilty conscience , but those tips are just the beginning of long , painstaking work .
Reporters operate without security clearances , without subpoena powers , without spy technology .
They work , rather , with sources who may be scared , who may know only part of the story , who may have their own agendas that need to be discovered and taken into account .
We double - check and triple - check .
We seek out sources with different points of view .
We challenge our sources when contradictory information emerges .
Then we listen .
No article on a classified program gets published until the responsible officials have been given a fair opportunity to comment .
And if they want to argue that publication represents a danger to national security , we put things on hold and give them a respectful hearing .
Often , we agree to participate in off - the - record conversations with officials , so they can make their case without fear of spilling more secrets onto our front pages .
