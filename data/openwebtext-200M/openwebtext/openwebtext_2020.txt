Confusion over the chocolate - covered teacake - a dome of marshmallow on a biscuit swathed in milk chocolate - could cost the British government £ 3.5 m after an EU court adviser said the retailer Marks & Spencer should get a refund of the tax it paid during the decades that tax authorities insisted they were biscuits .
The European court of justice 's advocate general said in an opinion - which is not binding on the court but is often followed in final rulings - that a company had the right to a full refund of any sales tax wrongly charged .
Marks & Spencer is challenging British tax authorities ' refusal to pay out the £ 3.5 m wrongly charged on chocolate - covered teacakes from 1973 to 1995 .
Britain saw the error of its ways in late 1994 , agreeing that the items were cakes and should not be charged any value - added tax .
But it would give Marks & Spencer only a fraction of the tax paid in 1997 : £ 88,440 .
The EU court 's adviser , Juliane Kokott , said Britain was wrong to refuse the refund by claiming that such a large payment would be " unjust enrichment " - offering a profit to the retailer when it had passed on the extra tax charge to customers .
" The objection that Marks & Spencer has been enriched cannot be invoked as long as it offends the principle of equal treatment , " she said , criticising the British tax system for not applying unjust enrichment rules across the retail chain .
When the court rules on the issue , its recommendations will be passed to the House of Lords , which will decide on the details of the chain 's appeal .
No , the Obama campaign did not embrace Che Guevera
The far - right sure does find some odd things to get excited about .
If you ’ve perused the major conservative blogs over the 12 hours or so , you ’ve no doubt seen the major - league freak - out about the Obama campaign allegedly opening an office in Texas with a Che Guevera flag .
Ed Morrissey , who is usually a little less unhinged than some of his cohorts , got the ball rolling yesterday .
Oh , my .
Barack Obama may want to call his new Houston office and suggest some decorating ideas .
Take a look at the flag flying in the office at the moment :
No , that ’s not a Texas state flag with a picture of Obama on it .
It ’s the flag of the Castro - led Cuba regime , with Che Guevara ’s face superimposed on the side .
A
Fox report from Houston captured this image as it showed Obama supporters celebrating his momentum after Super Tuesday .
And with that , they were off and running .
James Joyner put together a quick collection of clips :
* Charles Johnson : “ Che Guevara Flags in Obama ’s Houston Office ”
* Red State : “ Texas Communists For Obama ( Apparently They Were Out of Himmler ) ”
* Matt Bramanti : “ Obama office adores psychotic Marxist thug ”
* Ed Driscoll : “ Sixties Radical Chic , Frozen In Amber ”
* Curt@Flopping Aces and Don Surber weigh in with “ Che Obama ”
* Michael Goldfarb : “ Che You Can Believe In ”
Let ’s just take a moment to nip this in the bud , shall we ?
This started with a report run by the Fox affiliate in Houston .
As the station ’s report makes clear , “ The office featured in this video is funded by volunteers of the Barack Obama Campaign and is not an official headquarters for his campaign . ”
So , right off the bat , every far - right blogger who said the Obama campaign ’s official Houston office features a Che / Castro flag is mistaken .
The reality is , a volunteer found office space in advance of actual campaign staffers arriving in Houston .
One of these volunteers put up the flag , presumably taken from some dorm - room wall .
When actual , paid campaign aides show up — they ’re due by the end of the week — one can safely assume the flag will be gone .
As scandals go , this one barely passes the yawn test .
That so many conservatives immediately seized upon it suggests a certain unattractive desperation .
Oddly enough , Morrissey adds that it ’s incumbent on Obama to “ renounce any affinity for Che and the Fidel Castro regime . ”
Seriously , Ed ?
Is this what it ’s come to ?
Some random volunteer gets filmed by a Fox affiliate with a dumb flag and it becomes necessary for a sitting U.S. senator and leading presidential candidate to publicly renounce Communists ?
As Joyner concluded , “ The suggestion that Americans need to start swearing loyalty oaths … is light years beyond irritating . ”
As long as we ’re on the subject , though , Robert Farley notes that if we want to talk about crazy political ideas from partisans in Texas , we should take a closer look at the official state Republican Party platform .
* The Party calls for the United States monetary system to be returned to the gold standard .
Since the Federal Reserve System is a private corporation , has no reserves , and is not subject to taxation or audit , we call on Congress to abolish this institution and reassume its authority , enumerated by Article I , Section 8 of the United States Constitution , for the coinage of money .
*
The party opposes the decriminalization of sodomy … .
We publicly rebuke judges Chief Justice Murphy and John Anderson , who ruled that the 100 year - old Texas sodomy law is unconstitutional , and ask that all members of the Republican Party of Texas oppose their re-election .
*
We urge that the IRS be abolished and the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution be repealed .
A constitutional tax , collected and controlled by the States , must generate sufficient revenue for the legitimate tasks of the national government .
*
The Party believes the minimum wage law should be repealed .
*
The Party believes it is in the best interest of the citizens of the United States that we immediately rescind our membership in , as well as all financial and military contributions to , the United Nations .
* The Party urges Congress to support HJR 77 , the Panama and America Security Act , which declare the Carter - Torrijos Treaty null and void .
We support re-establishing United States control over the Canal in order to retain our military bases in Panama , to preserve our right to transit through the Canal , and to prevent the establishment of Chinese missile bases in Panama .
These are n’t the wacky opinions of some random campaign volunteer ; this is the official platform of the Texas Republican Party .
If it behooves Obama to renounce Che , would it also behoove McCain to renounce the Texas GOP ’s lunacy ?
Giuliani ’s Top 10 ‘ Shag Fund ’ excuses — and why they ’re wrong
So , after a very tough week , are things getting better or worse for everyone ’s least - favorite scandal - plagued presidential candidate ?
Take a wild guess .
In the fall of 2001 , city cops chauffeured Rudy Giuliani ’s then - mistress , Judith Nathan , to her parents ’ Pennsylvania home 130 miles away on the taxpayers ’ dime .
Records show that city cops refueled at an ExxonMobil station down the road from Nathan ’s childhood home in Hazleton on Oct. 20 , 2001 , while Giuliani stayed behind in New York attending 9/11 funerals .
A similar receipt pops up at a different Hazleton gas station two months later , when Nathan apparently went home for a pre-Christmas visit with her parents .
The records show that – in addition to using City Hall funds to take Giuliani and Nathan to 11 secret trysts in the Hamptons , as has been previously reported – taxpayers were paying to ferry Nathan on long - distance trips without Giuliani , now a Republican contender for President .
Indeed , this scandal has produced several entertaining headlines over the last half - day or so .
Giuliani ’s campaign aides have begun bullying reporters , there was a new report showing that when the city comptroller initially raised questions about Giuliani ’s highly suspicious billing practices he was stonewalled repeatedly , and we also learned that Giuliani made an unusual $ 400,000 pre-payment to American Express in 2001 , which “ adds weight to the theory that the Giuliani administration was using accounting gimmicks to obscure his office ’s travel expenditures . ”
Taking a step back , however , one sees that the former mayor and his aides have come up with a variety of rationalizations to justify Giuliani ’s conduct and dubious decisions .
I ’ve put together a list , with the explanations ranging from merely unpersuasive to transparently ridiculous .
Indeed , I ’ve come up with a Top 10 list .
1 . The story “ is n’t true ” — At Wednesday ’s debate , Giuliani said Smith ’s article “ is n’t true . ”
There ’s been no follow - up to explain why he does n’t think the story is true ; he simply wants to assert it .
2 . The premise of the story is n’t true — Giuliani adviser Anthony Carbonetti said yesterday that the “ premise of the original story has been proven false . ”
I ’m not exactly sure what this means , but both the story and its “ premise ” remain very much intact , and Team Giuliani has n’t offered a shred of evidence to the contrary .
3. Giuliani was trying to help the NYPD —
Why did Giuliani hide his Shag Fund bills in the budgets of the Loft Board and the Office for People With Disabilities ?
According to Giuliani , to help the cops get paid faster .
New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has debunked this argument completely .
4 . This is “ old news ” — Yesterday , Giuliani aides said these revelations are “ old news , ” which necessarily minimize their significance .
First , the billing scandal made headlines on Wednesday , which is pretty “ new ” news .
Second , Giuliani is running for president based on what he did in office .
If he wants us to consider his record , are we really supposed to overlook the scandalous parts ?
By that logic , are n’t his accomplishments from NYC also “ old news ” ?
Besides , this defense might have been more effective if Giuliani had answered questions when they first arose in 2001 and 2002 , instead of stonewalling investigators .
5 . “ We ’ve already explained it ” —
As the questions become more intense , Giuliani would only tell reporters yesterday , “ We ’ve already explained it . ”
If that were true , there would n’t be so many questions .
( Note to Rudy : nonsensical rationalizations that have already been debunked do not count as an “ explanation . ” )
6 . The story is a “ hit job ” —
Funny thing about this scandal , the messenger and the message are equally hard to attack .
The evidence is based on incontrovertible NYC billing records .
That someone found them and started making connections does not a “ hit job ” make .
7 . The money was “ reimbursed ” — Both Giuliani and his campaign are emphasizing that the various city agencies were eventually reimbursed for the expenses .
That ’s probably true , but utterly irrelevant .
Josh Marshall explained that the whole argument is “ basically a distraction .
The issue was why they were paying these bills out of these obscure accounts in the first place .
Reimbursement or not , it still has the effect of hiding what Rudy was doing . ”
8. Everybody does it —
Giuliani ’s campaign argued that the scandalous billing practices are common in NYC and have been utilized by a variety of other NYC mayors .
The campaign then reversed course a few hours later and admitted their claim is completely wrong .
9 . Everything was “ transparent ” — Giuliani and his aides have insisted that the expenses were handled “ openly ” and “ honestly , ” and that the billing was “ transparent . ”
NYC Comptroller Bill Thompson has no idea what Giuliani is talking about : “ That ’s not the way that we operate these days , and it would not be the preferred way of doing business .
In the end , it ’s a very convoluted way of getting things done .
If anyone hoped that no one would notice , they were being foolish . ”
10 .
There was no “ cover - up ” — Giuliani ’s spokesperson was reduced to this pathetic response : “ I do n’t understand when it started .
I do n’t understand why it started .
But I do know one thing :
It was consistently done … in no way shape or form did it imply a cover - up . ”
First , when you hide unrelated billing records in the Office for People With Disabilities , it looks like a cover-up .
Second , when auditors have questions about billing records , and Giuliani and his aides refuse to cooperate or answer any questions , it looks even more like a cover-up .
Usually , when a political scandal breaks , the accused manages to come up with some kind of talking points for supporters to use .
So far , Giuliani & Co. are completely stuck , bouncing from one debunked claim after another .
It ’s not a good sign .
Here ’s an interesting question that I got yesterday :
My husband and I are currently sitting on the sofa , enjoying our day off and writing down our goals for 2008 .
While doing so , my husband has brought up the topic of work .
Here is his statement in a nutshell : I think you are very angry about work in general and need professional help .
In searching for “ help , ” I came across your website .
Here ’s my question : after being laid off in September and being forced to change careers from the mortgage industry to a more secure industry is there “ help ” out there for dealing with the anger I now have because I was forced to change careers at 39 years old and what can I do in the meantime so that my “ anger ” does n’t spill into my new career ?
Thank You ,
Yvonne
This question is interesting for many reasons , most notably because this is obviously making Yvonne unhappy at work in her new job .
If it ’s come to the point where her husband believes she needs professional help , it ’s probably also affecting her at home .
Also , Yvonne is far from alone .
A lot of people face major changes at work .
When they are laid off , when their company is bought by a competitor or when major reorganizations fundamentally change their working conditions .
Large scale change has become a fact of corporate life and many of us react to it by getting mad .
Below you ’ll find my top 5 tips for dealing with anger when when you ’re going through major change at work .
I apologize in advance for venturing maybe a little too close to therapy - land in this post .
I honestly do n’t want to go all Dr. Phil on you guys , but dealing with anger is not possible without taking a look at what goes on inside your head .
OK ?
OK !
5 steps for dealing with anger at work
Step 1 : Accept that being angry is perfectly natural
When we ’re faced with large changes in life and at work , we all have to go through the grief cycle , which has the following stages :
Denial :
The initial stage : “ It ca n’t be happening . ”
Anger : “ Why me ?
It ’s not fair . ”
Bargaining : “ Just let me live to see my children graduate . ”
Depression : “ I ’m so sad , why bother with anything ? ”
Acceptance : “ It ’s going to be OK . ”
I ’m honestly not sure how scientifically established this model is , but I certainly find it very useful in the work I do with organizations that are going through major change .
Last year , I did some work with a branch of the Danish Tax Authority – an organization that has gone through enormous change and reorganization in the last year .
When I presented a simplified version of this model to them , I could see people breathing sighs of relief .
One participant even exclaimed “ NOW you tell us ! ”
Many of them had been angry or depressed about these changes , but nobody had told them that this is normal .
Consequently , many of them felt bad about what they were feeling – which of course only made them more angry or depressed .
It ’s important to accept your own anger as perfectly OK .
Being angry is hard enough .
Being angry while telling yourself “ I really must n’t be angry ” is infinitely worse :o )
This does not give you blanket permission to throw tantrums right and left – it just means that being angry is OK , not that every display of anger is allowed .
Step 2 : Find out what your anger does for you – good or bad
What does being angry do for you ?
Think back to previous situations where you have been angry at work and ask yourself how it affects eg. :
You Your relationships with co-workers
The quality of your work Your energy Your well - being and health How you feel outside of work Your relationships with friends and family
For each of these , include both the good and the bad .
Maybe being angry gives you a lot of clout and influence on the job … but it also means that co-workers tend to avoid you .
Maybe being angry feels stressful … but it also saves you from being taken advantage of at work .
And here is a crucial question :
What other emotions , questions and doubts are you free from dealing with because you ’re angry ?
When your anger consumes you , which other painful or difficult considerations are you free from thinking about ?
What would you have to feel / think about / deal with / do something about if you were not angry ?
Step 3 : Find out what makes you angrier and less angry
What makes you angrier ?
Which thoughts , situations , people , conversations set you off ?
Conversely , what makes you less angry ?
I ’m sure you ’re not angry every second of every day :o)
What gives you peace – or at least distracts you from the anger ?
Find out – then start doing less of what makes you angry and more of the things that calm you down .
Step 4 : Focus on gratitude
What are you grateful for ?
As I mentioned above , anger is part of the grief cycle which is associated with loss .
Gratitude is the polar opposite of loss , because it obviously comes from the good things you have in your life .
It ’s simple .
Every evening , sit down with a piece of paper ( and maybe a glass of wine ) and make two gratitude lists :
3 things I was grateful for at work today 3 things I was grateful for in life today
It can be big things or small things – obvious stuff or weird stuff .
Whatever makes you feel happy and grateful .
If you need some inspiration , check out Scott Nutter who has been doing daily gratitude posts on his blog for 334 days running now .
Step 5 : Shift your focus from “ What was done to me ” to “ What I can do ”
I know , I know – this is the basic staple of all self - help advice .
As in “ When life gives you lemons make lemonade . ”
As in “ Life is 10 % about what happens to you and 90 % about how you deal with it . ”
As in “ You must take responsibility for your own situation , rather than be a victim of . ”
That kind of advice can get pretty nauseating .
But that does n’t make it any less true .
3 things NOT to do
There are also some things you should avoid doing .
1 : Do n’t vent
Common knowledge holds that when you ’re angry , you should vent to get it off your chest .
Interestingly , studies indicate that venting just makes us even angrier .
2 : Do n’t try to justify your anger
When you ’re feeling angry do n’t waste time and energy justifying it – either to yourself or others .
Well that guy was a jerk at the staff meeting and the way I was treated in the last reorg was totally unfair and my manager still has n’t apologized and some guy cut me off in traffic on the way home and …
You ’re angry , that ’s enough .
You do n’t have to list all the reasons why you ’re angry .
Again , that just makes you even angrier .
3 : Do n’t stay trapped in your job
There is an amazing amount of peace and calm to be found in the simple fact that “ I ’m free to leave and find another job . ”
Conversely , knowing that you ’re trapped in your current job makes everything much worse .

Your take
What about you ?
Have you tried being really angry because of major changes in your work life ?
How did it affect you ?
How did you handle it ?

On May 3 , 2007 , MSNBC hosted a debate for the GOP presidential candidates at the Reagan Library in California .
Near the end of the program , moderator Chris Matthews asked the candidates , “ I ’m curious , is there anybody on the stage that does not agree , believe in evolution ? ”
Three hands went up , one of them belonging , naturally enough , to Mike Huckabee .
Ron Paul , however , kept his hand down .
At a November 1 meeting of the Spartanburg ( SC ) GOP Executive Committee , Ron Paul was asked about this incident .
Here ’s a link to his reply .
Speaking as an evolutionist , Andrew Sullivan , who has a well - read blog at The Atlantic , wrote of Paul ’s response , “ I want to look away . ”
But the truth is that Sullivan never had the opportunity to look in the first place .
His link went to the page of an atheist writer , whose video of Paul ’s remarks was heavily edited .
Here is the full transcript of Congressman Paul ’s remarks , with the deleted sections in brackets :
“ Well , at first I thought it was a very inappropriate question , you know , for the presidency to be decided on a scientific matter , and I think it ’s a theory , a theory of evolution , and I do n’t accept it , you know , as a theory , but I think [ it probably does n’t bother me .
It ’s not the most important issue for me to make the difference in my life to understand the exact origin .
I think ] the creator that I know created us , everyone of us , and created the universe , and the precise time and manner , I just do n’t think we ’re at the point where anybody has absolute proof on either side .
[ So I just do n’t . . . if that were the only issue , quite frankly , I would think it ’s an interesting discussion , I think it ’s a theological discussion , and I think it ’s fine , and we can have our . . . if that were the issue of the day , I would n’t be running for public office . ” ]
As you can see , half of Paul ’s words were censored .
His real message was , “ We ’re fighting for freedom and ca n’t afford to be split over a debate about fossils . ”
The purpose of the censorship was obviously to encourage exactly such a split .
With the prospect of such a split in mind , now might be a good time for all of us who care about freedom to remember what the Ron Paul Revolution is all about .
Certainly , it ’s about stopping a war that has killed over a million innocent people and has destroyed America ’s reputation throughout the world .
Certainly it ’s about gaining control of our national finances before we become impoverished .
Yet more important than the war and the economy , the dominant issue of our age is the question of whether America will continue to be a free country , or will it descend into tyranny .
As anyone who follows the news knows , the trends are against liberty .
The worst example of the deterioration of our rights is in that we now live in a country where torture is accepted as standard interrogation procedure .
In defiance of the Constitution ’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment , the President claims the right to arrest anyone — not just foreigners — and hold them indefinitely , and torture them as he pleases .
Clearly , the intent of this initiative is not just to allow FBI agents to beat the truth out of terrorists so as to keep cities from being vaporized in the next ten minutes , because people have been tortured for years now though not a single city has ever come close to vaporization .
Clearly , what the President cares about is not the safety or security of American cities , but that the Unitary Executive have the supreme power to torture anyone for any reason , and never have to account for his actions .
There is only one purpose for that policy , and it ’s not to catch terrorists .
It ’s to intimidate dissidents through the practice of state terror against the citizenry .
To combat a handful of foreign terrorists , the government will create an army of domestic terrorists , bankrolled by your own taxes , and given bonuses and promotions based on how well they frighten you and your fellow citizens into silent compliance with presidential edicts .
Extrapolating the trends of the past few years , it ’s not hard to imagine a nightmare vision of America over the course of the next Presidential Administration .
It begins with the issuance of national ID cards and proliferation of government security cameras everywhere .
Then one day a government agent appears at your door , asking questions which indicate that your private e-mails and phone calls have been monitored .
Then you make a nervous joke — perhaps about how the government spends too much time going after innocent protestors and not real terrorists — and next thing you know , you ’re arrested .
Why ?
They do n’t need to tell you .
Habeas corpus has already been suspended .
They do n’t even have to tell anyone that you have been arrested .
You are now what is known in totalitarian regimes as a " non-person . "
You will learn over the long period of your incarceration , non-persons do n’t have rights .
And then one day , they lead you into a room where screams have been coming from , and inside you see a board and a jug of water . . . am I being sensationalist here , or am I paraphrasing sworn testimony made before Congressional Committees ?
You would think that the prospect of imminent tyranny would scare some sense into libertarians and make them realize that we have to stay united .
For now , though , certain Christian and atheist libertarians would rather have the pleasure of bashing one another .
Internet flame wars must be powerfully addicting , given that one of Sullivan ’s readers abandons all moderation to write : “ Ron Paul ’s religious AND constitutional fundamentalisms are anti-historical , and consequently anti-literate , as all forms of fundamentalism are . ”
Hmm , now how did a certain obstetrician get through medical school , let alone deliver four thousand babies , if he ca n’t even read ?
Oh well , forget facts or logic — what matters is that we have our little coffee house debate , as heatedly as possible , while outside the paramilitaries gather and charge their tasers .
I ’m not trying to choose sides here , but I ’m puzzled that any atheist libertarian in America can possibly think that he can combat omnipotent government without the help of Christians .
Polls show that eighty - five percent of the American people believe in God , and over fifty - one percent disbelieve the theory of evolution , so how do atheist libertarians think they ’re going to win an election if they openly mock Christians ?
Maybe it ’s time we asked ourselves , “ What would Thomas Jefferson do ? ”
In forming a coalition between libertarian - minded deists and Christians for the fateful presidential election of 1800 , the secularist Thomas Jefferson wrote in a widely publicized letter : ” . . . for I have sworn upon the altar of God , eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man . ”
He was a literate man who was indeed concerned with the ideas that people put into their minds — but note , his stated oath was to fight first for the right of minds to be free .
Though a sincere Christian , Ron Paul has expressed that sentiment many times now .
It ’s something that both Christians and atheists should agree with as well , for while the debate over origins is important , there wo n’t be any debate at all if tyranny comes , for tyranny will shut down all such metaphysical debates , demanding instead that all worship be directed to the State .
Christians and atheists alike should ask themselves , whose mind and soul will be saved then ?

The Best of Joe Schembrie
For those of us wondering who the Republican whispering sweet nothings into Joe Klein 's ear , it was right - wing Republican and top- tier Bush apologist Rep. Pete Hoekstra .
Today , Hoektstra went to National Review to defend his good friend , " liberal pundit " Joe Klein , in what Hoekstra called the " venomous debate [ that ] has raged between Time columnist Joe Klein and his far - Left critics . "
As always on the pro-Bush Right , those who believe in the radical instrument called " search warrants " are deemed to be " far leftists . "
Hoekstra pronounces Klein correct in everything he said , and then confesses that he was " one of Klein 's sources for the complex technical and legal points that seem to be in contention . "
So , in other words , it was Hoekstra -- one of Washington 's most partisan GOP operatives -- who lied to Klein by claiming that the House Democrats ' bill requires warrants for every foreign terrorist 's call and that the bill thus gives the same rights to foreign Terrorists as American citizens .
That 's a real surprise .
And Klein
The Journalist then mindlessly wrote down Hoekstra 's smears without bothering to check if they were true , and Time printed them as fact .
Democrats in DC think Klein is an ally , to the point where you have the likes of John Kerry " craving " his approval , yet he 's no more than a dishonest shill -- quick to accept bullshit spin without taking the time or effort to understand what he writes .
When called on his inaccuracies , he begs , off claiming that his tedious job of writing a column a week keeps him from , you know , understanding and verifying the words he writers .
And Time rallies around him without regard to its ethical obligations as a major American news outlet .
Compare Time 's refusal to play do the right thing and admit Klein 's error to the Chicago Tribune 's correction after it ran an excerpt from Klein 's column on its op / ed pages :
CORRECTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS
A
Time magazine essay by Joe Klein that was excerpted on the editorial page Wednesday incorrectly stated that the House Democratic version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act would require a court approval of individual foreign surveillance targets .
It does not .
You'd think that would n't be so hard , but apparently Time is vested in the fiction that Klein is infallible .
Bizarre .
When I turned in both my columns to Newsweek , editors demanded I justify every single line of the pieces .
Every one of them .
They even forced me to rewrite portions that might be construed the wrong way by readers , even if my words were still technically correct .
Maybe Newsweek is n't that diligent with pieces written by their in - house columnists ( like George Will or whoever ) , but you 'd hope they would be .
And if not ?
They 'll get the similar treatment .
As for Time , it 's clear they have nowhere near that level of control over Klein -- he says what he wants , when he wants to , and the magazine wo n't hold him accountable when he blows it .
In fact , they 'd rather have their entire publication publicly embarrassed than force Klein himself to suffer a little personal embarrassment .
And Klein , ever the profile in courage , would rather see his publication take the lumps for his f ' ups than engage in a little personal accountability .
Of course his Republican puppetmasters are applauding in the background .
Mission accomplished !
And DC Democrats , still desperate for his approbation and approval , remain mostly silent lest he -- what ? -- not invite them to his next cocktail party ?
Lest he not call them as a source for his next anti-Democratic hit piece ?
Klein represents most of what 's wrong with the beltway media today .
And the general Democratic silence in response ( except for the one response by Rep. Rush Holt ) , is quite indicative of the general Democratic timidity in a hostile media and political environment .
How many times can you beat that abused puppy without it fighting back ?
With Beltway Democrats , the abuse they 'll tolerate is apparently endless .
New observations from NASA 's Voyager 2 spacecraft , which launched from Earth 30 years ago , show that the solar system is asymmetrical and not spherical , scientists said Monday .
The discovery comes after the U.S. space agency ' sprobe crossed a threshold in the solar system called the " termination shock " on Aug. 30 , 2007 , almost three years after its twin , Voyager 1 , reached the same milestone .
The termination shock is 13.5 billion kilometres from the sun , or 90 times more distant from the sun than the Earth is .
It marks the beginning of a region of space called the heliosphere where the charged particles from the sun — called the solar wind — collide with a mix of particles that act as a buffer zone between our solar system and high - energy particles emanating from other stars in the galaxy .
Voyager 2 was also almost a billionkilometres closer to the sun when it crossed the shock than Voyager 1 was , suggesting that the heliosphere is not spherical but instead asymmetrical in shape .
Scientists said the shape of our heliosphere was likely because the interstellar magnetic field is pitched at an angle to the plane of the Milky Way .
" The magnetic field is disturbing an otherwise spherical surface , " said Voyager mission scientist Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco .
Earlier in December , scientists at the University of California Riverside created a computer model that suggested Voyager 2 would cross the threshold sometime in late 2007 or early 2008 .
UC - Riverside physics professor Gary Zank said Voyager 2's passage through the threshold was significant because , unlike Voyager 1 , it still had a working instrument to make direct measurements of speed and temperature .
The probe , he said , would also provide a window into the origins and characteristics of cosmic rays .
Only a tiny fraction of cosmic rays reach the Earth from outside the solar system because the particles collide with , and are redirected by , the solar wind , he said .
Voyager 2 launched in 1977 and flew by Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune between 1979 and 1989 .
Like Voyager 1 , it carries with it a gold record containing pictures , sounds and information from Earth .
The nuclear power sources on the two spacecraft should last until 2020 .
The two probes are expected to reach the heliopause , which marks the end of the solar system , in about a decade .

Update to this post with new information and new questions :
Theme Marketplace : Update and Rundown
So it has been announced that Automattic will create a WordPress Theme Marketplace .
I have to admit , that I am not happy about this idea , at all .
No Sponsored Themes
When Matt Mullenweg decided to fight against sponsored themes , did he already have his marketplace planned ?
Even if he did n’t , does n’t the idea of a marketplace where themes are being sold go against some of the principles that he was trying to defend ?
Creating such a marketplace , to me , is basically saying that no themes can make money , unless Matt is getting a cut of the proceeds , and that does n’t seem right .
How can he continue to say that sponsored themes are so horrible , and then turn around and profit from themes himself ?
I know he never said that he was stopping people from making profit from their themes , but that is effectively what he did by banning sponsored themes from anything controlled by Automattic .
My thought on this is that he saw how much traffic Themes .
WordPress.net was bringing in , and has a decent idea of how many people are running Brian Gardner ’s Revolution theme , and said to himself that he would like to find a way to make money from themes .
All of this is after Matt Mullenweg used the defense , during the whole Sponsored themes fiasco , that it would be unfair for theme creators to make money from their work when plugin authors do n’t get to .
Money
So Automattic is going to make 50 % off of every theme sold through the marketplace .
While I can understand needing to take a percentage based on the fact that the service will have to be coded by some amazing coders , and maintained by some powerful servers , does 50 % really sound right to anyone else ?
While a theme author is going to maybe make hundreds of dollars , Matt and team stand to make thousands off of other people ’s hard work .
I know some designers that spend hours mulling over each detail of their theme , and coding it to perfection , and to then give half that money away to Automattic ?
I think that ’s a bit of a rip - off .
I know people will do it though because it can be quite difficult to promote a WordPress theme these days , and Matt will be able to offer something that no one else can easily add , “ Update notifications ” .
While there are some themes that can let users know there is an update , those types of themes are few and far between , but just like Automattic did with WordPress plugins , it would be simple for them to expand that system into their marketplace of paid themes , making sure you always know when a new version of your paid theme is uploaded to the marketplace .
While this is brilliant , it also bothers me because I feel that Automattic is in control of everything relating to WordPress more than ever before , and this type of control , only breeds more control .
I have watched as dozens of great plugin directories have more or less died , due to the WordPress.org version , and now I fear that many WordPress theme repositories are going to die as well .
Unanswered Questions
The last thing I want to talk about is the number of unanswered questions relating to this idea .
Who will set the price ?
So far it looks like Automattic will decide the value of the theme you upload .
Does this really seem fair ?
What will they value your hard work at ?
Would they have valued the Revolution theme at between $ 60 and $ 250 ?
And if it is the theme author that eventually gets to decide a theme ’s value , will costs be inflated to compensate for Automattic getting their 50 % share ?
If I wanted $ 60 per theme sale , I would have to sell my theme at $ 120 each .
Does that seem fair for someone looking to buy a theme ?
Will they require exclusivity ?
If I want to put my theme on the WordPress Marketplace , will I be unable to market it elsewhere ?
What if another marketplace is created taking only a 20 % cut of my theme price ?
What kind of rules will be put in place about marketing my theme elsewhere ?
Conclusion
My fear is that WordPress is changing from a fun community , into a business , and while Matt tries to calm our fears , this trend seems to be moving faster and faster , and it is not fueled by the community as much as it comes from Matt and Automattic .
Will people really give their themes away for free if they can even just make a dollar per download ?
Will plugin authors continue to work towards monetizing their efforts as well ?
While I feel safe in saying that there wo n’t be a paid version of WordPress any time soon , I would n’t be surprised if every other feature and addition to WordPress required spending money .
Is that the type of WordPress community you want to be part of ?

Before Ron Paul can get elected , he has to be nominated by delegates at the Republican National Convention which will take place in St. Paul , Minnesota .
September 1 - 4 , 2008 .
We have to get elected as delegates to the convention .
Electoral college delegates have to be constitutionalists because they elect the president by casting their vote .
Those who support Ron Paul must begin the process now of getting elected as a delegate to the convention or it's all over and the GOP faithful will get the shadow government 's choice shoved down their throats - again .
The power players behind the scenes will orchestrate the show and the people will be the losers - again .
The same applies with getting nominated as an electoral college delegate because America got a good lesson in civics during the 2000 pretend election regarding the popular vote vs the electoral college system .
A word to the wise : if you present yourself as a supporter of Ron Paul , you will never get elected as a delegate .
Wave the flag , shout power to the GOP , rah , rah , rah , get elected and then begin your campaign to get Ron Paul nominated .
Now , some might say this type of stealth is n't right .
Here 's what 's not right : back room deals and big money giving the American people no choice in these elections and anyone who thinks this is n't how the process has been working for the past century is in a state of denial .
Get together with your friends or people you know and plan your strategy now and work to get elected as a delegate .
Time is quickly slipping by , every minute counts .
Several states including FL , SC and Iowa are planning to move their state Primaries to early December 2007 in order to prevent Ron Paul from garnering enough support financially and geographically .
GOP Primaries are generally held on EVEN numbered years and it's not a mere coincidence that changes are being initiated and that Ron Paul just so happens to be running .
So how do I become a delegate ?
1 ) First and foremost , be a member of the Republican Party and register as a Republican if you live in a
2 ) It starts in your state at the local level : to the Republican National Convention at your state primaries ( NOT your state party convention ) ;
They 'll be more than happy to give you the specifics ( provided you do n't tell them you 're a Ron Paul supporter ) .
For most states , it starts at your local precinct , then county , then senatorial district , then state and finally the Rep. National Convention :
It 's a long journey . :)
3 ) The 2008 Primary Process First and foremost , be a member of the Republican Party and register as a Republican if you live in a closed primary state such as New York .
I do n't want to be part of them either but Ron Paul 's sacrificing a lot too .
It starts in your state at the local level : Click here to see your state delegate process with instructions .
If your state is n't listed , please contact your state Republican party : http://www.gop.
com/states and ask how to be a delegate ( NOT your state party convention ) ;
They 'll be more than happy to give you the specifics ( provided you do n't tell them you 're a Ron Paul supporter ) .
For most states , it starts at your local precinct , then county , then senatorial district , then state and finally the Rep. National Convention :
It 's a long journey . :)
In general , it 's a step - by - step process in becoming a delegate .
For example , to become a delegate in Texas ( open primary state ) :
Vote in the 2008 Texas State Primary Election ( March 4 ) and you are then eligible to be a delegate to your precinct .
Your first convention will take place at your precinct 's election day polling place within two hours after the polls close at 7:00 p.m .
Most of these " precinct conventions " are very poorly attended , and typically there are more delegate / alternate places than people to fill them , so it 's usually easy to get elected as delegate at the precinct level .
WE CAN ORGANIZE AND PLAN for all this in JANUARY with plenty of time .
( continued )
It 's critical that we become delegates or all our hard work will be in vain .
Become a delegate and we 'll get to hear Dr. Ron Paul giving his Inaugural Address in 2009 .

Webb : Bush using ' fear tactics ' for more war funding David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Sunday December 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Senator Jim Webb ( D - VA ) went on the offensive over the delay of supplemental funding for the war in Iraq , dismissing recent comments by President Bush saying delays in funding puts troops in harms way as " fear tactics . "
Appearing on the program Meet The Press , Webb also suggested that the issue at the heart of the current fight over war funding is how long American troops will be deployed in Iraq .
" The problem with the administration 's approach to [ war funding ] is that they constantly use fear tactics , " Webb said , citing the President Bush and Congressional Republicans defeat of his amendment to give troops longer breaks between deployments .
" If President Bush had said to do it they'd be saluting and doing it . "
" There 's no one in the Congress who 's going to interrupt funding that goes to the ability of the military to take care of the present responsibilities , Webb said .
He said that by engaging in scare tactics , Bush and his Republican allies in Congress avoid debate over the length of the American mission in Iraq .
" The elephant in the bedroom for this entire time period is how long are we going to be in Iraq ?
What are we funding implicitly as well as implicitly , and we do n't get to have this debate , " Webb said , expressing concerns that President Bush wishes to establish permanent bases in Iraq using the American presence on the Korean peninsula as a model .
Later in the interview , host Tim Russert pressed Webb on his party 's plan for funding the war .
" There are some Democrats who have said they want to stop funding the war period , " Russert said .
" And I think that 's just not a winning formula , " Webb responded .
The following video is from NBC's Meet the Press , broadcast on December 2 , 2007 .
See link below .
the music
It was probably this video that did the job .
Though only eight tracks long , Amplive 's Rainydayz Remixes is the best real internet music album since DJ Danger Mouse 's Grey Album mash - up of Jay - Z's The Black Album and the Beatles ' White Album .
And up until two days ago , it was unavailable .
But as of today , Radiohead having given the album their official seal of approval , Rainydaze Remixes is now available for download .
[ Initially , news of the release was posted around the internet along with tracks by an excited / ambitious fanbase of the DJ / producer Amplive including this doctored photo ...... which no doubt contributed to the initial news reports / added fuel to the fire .
The stroy was that by forwarding a receipt of purchase of Radiohead 's notoriously - successful In Rainbow album , listener 's could get a copy of Rainydaze Remixes .
The problem was this took place without Radiohead 's approval or awareness .
Eventually ( what with the publicity and all - 1 3 ) , it came to Radiohead 's attention .
That 's when Radiohead 's publisher put a quash on he project .
Rainydaze Remixes suddenly was buried .
Fortunately , cooler heads prevailed .
Partially due to a heart - felt YouTube plea from Amplive himself as well as a grass - roots fan campaign that supported Amplive ( his work with artists such as mainstream successes such as Linkin Park and Goapele , as well as underground legends the Grouch and Akon , have earned the producer a sizable following ) , cooler heads prevailed , and Radiohead listened to the project and have now the group and their management and publishing company have all given the Rainydaze Remixes their seal of approval .
Here 's the video from Amplive pleading with Radiohead to " please listen " to the music :
And here is Amplive after getting the good news : Quite a difference !
And a success for music - lovers everywhere .
Though it took all of this to get to , this is yet another step in the right direction for music and technology .
In addition to encouraging experimentation and artistic freedom , by combining mainstream superstar success with ear - to - the - street underground savvy , Amplive and Radiohead are making real modern headway for human relations ... by showing what we all share in common .
In the past , the major record labels would have stamped a label on this kind of synthesis , petrifying it in order to sell it out before it had a chance to develop any further .
Yet this is just another step in the evolution of music and web economics that has major labels left stunned and reveals their model as being hopelessly outdated .
To the record labels this is about peanut - butter and chocolate equaling something that could have been marketed as Reese's .
But to 21st Century , this is about the developing of something so great it does n't even have a name but that is globally - loved all the same .
Best of all , the music is amazing .
So thanks to Amplive for making the tracks .
And thanks to Radiohead for yet another contribution to this developing modern artistic culture that has the means of production and distribution in its own hands but doesnt have ( or need ) a name .
Plus ?
Yet another opportunity for Del Tha Funkee Homosapien to show his knack for picking winners !

Claudia Mitchell became the first woman to receive a bionic arm
By rerouting the remaining nerves from their lost limbs to their chests , the patients said they could feel their missing arms and hands in their chests .
When heat or pressure was applied to the chest , the patients said they felt as if their hand was being touched .
The results appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Dr Todd Kuiken , who led the research , said it could pave the way to providing amputees with the ability to feel what he touches with a prosthetic hand as if it were his own hand .
HOW A BIONIC HAND CAN FEEL 1 .
Arm nerves connected to chest muscles after amputation .
2 . Skin sensory nerves begin to regain some feeling .
3 . Muscles containing re-activated skin sensory nerves send messages to the arm resembling original control signals .
4 . When areas of the chest are touched the feeling is reflected on the hand .
Different nerves relate to different areas of the hand .
The patients involved are believed to be a man and a woman who were the first recipients of " bionic " arms which they could control by thought alone .
Claudia Mitchell , a former US marine , was given the new arm last year after losing hers at the shoulder in a motorbike accident .
Double amputee Jesse Sullivan received his in 2001 .
Using these arms , the two are for instance able to fold clothes , eat bananas and do the washing up .
Exciting advance
Electrodes attached to a harness on the shoulder of each patient were able to detect messages from the brain to the chest muscle , and forward them to the arm .
This next step opens the door to a sense of touch , the lack of which is currently seen as a major limitation on the efficacy of prosthetic limbs .
The two involved were able to differentiate between sensation in their actual chest , and one which they attributed to their hand .
In some cases they were able to pinpoint exactly where on the hand the sensation was being felt .
Dr Sellaiah Sooriakumaran , a consultant in rehabilitation at Queen Mary's , said this was an important next step .
" Making the new arm in the first place was a major breakthrough , and this is a very exciting advance on that . "
" Giving prosthetic arms a sensory ability would dramatically improve their functionality and their acceptance by the patient . "
Last week , we ran a feature on how Canada 's line - sharing rules allowed an ISP co-op to spring into existence .
We wo n't be seeing any Wireless Nomads in the US anytime soon , however , as the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has issued a decision ( PDF ) upholding the Federal Communications Commission 's 2002 and 2005 decisions deregulating cable and DSL Internet services .
The FCC 's orders classified cable and DSL as information services , and therefore subject to deregulation .
The companies that own the lines ( usually a dominant local telecom like AT&T or Verizon , or cable company like Comcast ) were no longer required to lease them to competitors at nondiscriminatory rates .
The ruling had the effect of reducing the amount of competition between DSL providers , as the telecoms were free to set their line - leasing rates as high as they wanted , making it difficult for other DSL providers to offer reasonably - priced services .
It was the FCC 's contention that the regulations imposed " significant costs " on the companies and hindered investment in new technologies , infrastructure , and service .
ISPs which found themselves effectively frozen out of the broadband market by the ruling — like AOL — argued that the FCC 's orders had the effect of slashing competition , therefore reducing consumer choice when it comes to broadband providers .
In its opinion , the Appeals Court ruled that the analysis done by the FCC was " both reasonable and consistent " and that the Commission 's decision was in full compliance with the Communications Act .
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin praised the Court 's decision .
" I am pleased that the Court affirmed the FCC 's decision to remove outdated , decades - old regulations from today ’s broadband services , " said Martin in a statement .
" By removing such regulations , the Commission encouraged broadband investment and fostered competition .
As a result of the Commission 's deregulatory policies , broadband adoption has increased and consumers have benefited in the form of lower prices and improved broadband service . "
Adoption may be up — although the FCC 's own broadband data is not terribly useful — but the US still suffers from a dearth of meaningful broadband competition .
Martin 's vision of broadband competition between modes of broadband delivery rather than between providers has left much of the US faced with broadband duopolies or monopolies .
The FCC 's regulatory scheme is a big part of why the FCC has such high hopes for the upcoming 700MHz spectrum auction and next spring 's launch of Sprint 's WiMAX network .
If wireless broadband becomes widely available and works as advertised , then the competitive broadband situation in the US will improve past its current dismal state .
Even then , when compared to the plethora of inexpensive broadband providers users in other countries have to choose from , US consumers will still be lacking for options .
Forcing telecoms and cable companies to share their lines have paid off in other countries , but it 's not going to happen in the US .
George Soros listens to a questin following his keynote address at the InterAction 2007 forum in Washington , April 18 , 2007 .
Soros forecast on Monday that the U.S. economy is " on the verge of a very serious economic correction " after decades of overspending .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Billionaire investor George Soros forecast on Monday that the U.S. economy is “ on the verge of a very serious economic correction ” after decades of overspending .
“ We have borrowed an awful lot of money and now the bill is coming to us , ” he said during a lecture at the New York University , also adding that the war on terror “ has thrown America out of the rails . ”
Asked whether a recession was inevitable , Soros said : “ I think we are definitely in for a slowdown that I think will be a bigger slowdown than ( Fed Chairman Ben ) Bernanke is seeing . ”
Famous for his speculative attack on the Bank of England that made him more than $ 1 billion , Soros declined to nominate which currencies are more vulnerable currently .
He also declined to comment specifically on the dollar .
“ I know exactly where the currencies are going to but I ’m not going to tell that to you , ” he told the audience .
Last week , investment guru Jim Rogers , who co-founded the Quantum Fund with Soros in the 1970s , recommended selling the dollar as well as U.S. investment banks and U.S. housing stocks .
Soros said that , for now , China is the “ absolute winner ” in economic terms , and will continue to see its economy soaring during the next few years .
“ Now it is going through this fantastic transformation but in 10 years time I think you may well have a financial crisis in China , ” he said .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Politicians in Washington deserve praise for quickly cobbling together a stimulus package to try and rejuvenate the foundering economy .
Too bad the plan , which relies mainly on tax rebates , wo n't do much to significantly boost the economy .
Now do n't get me wrong .
The $ 150 billion stimulus plan is a welcome start .
Many Americans are struggling and need the cash .
But at best , this may only provide a temporary boost to consumer spending , not a major jolt as some would argue .
America can't spend its way out of a recession , if that 's what this rough patch winds up becoming .
In a research report from Monday , Merrill Lynch analyst David Rosenberg pointed out that consumer spending picked up only " modestly " in the third quarter of 2001 , the quarter when most Americans received their tax rebate checks .
What 's more , Rosenberg noted that the retailers that seemed to get the biggest benefit from the rebates in 2001 were book stores , restaurants , drug stores and toy sellers .
People also spent more on lotteries .
( You 've got to be in it to win it ! )
Meanwhile , consumers did not spend significantly more on bigger ticket items such as autos , furniture and appliances .
Rosenberg expects a similar scenario this year .
Consumers will spend more , but not that much more , and they will do it over a brief period .
" Since the rebate checks to individuals likely wo n't be mailed out until May or June , the lift to consumer spending is probably going to be a shortlived third - quarter event , " he wrote .
When all is said and done , Rosenberg said the economy may wind up posting 1 percent growth in gross domestic product this year because of the stimulus , up from an earlier projection of 0.8 percent growth .
In other words , the tax rebates will have a negligible impact .
Still , that is n't stopping retailers from trying to do their best to jumpstart the economy as well .
In what has to qualify as one of the more absurd headlines for a press release in recent memory , Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) announced what it called its " Economic Stimulus Plan for U.S. Shoppers . "
The company said it was cutting prices on thousands of health care and household products and other items between 10 percent and 30 percent ahead of this Sunday 's Super Bowl .
I can only hope that this is meant to be tongue - in - cheek but Wal - Mart actually said in its press release that " against a backdrop of continued talk of a credit squeeze , Wal - Mart is concentrating on savings on the items customers need to buy at this time of year - unbeatable prices for the big game . "
So rest assured , consumers .
You do n't need to wait for your tax rebate check .
Go splurge today on Pepsi 12 - packs , Tostitos Scoops and Hillshire Farms Cocktail Smokies .
You 've got to be kidding me .
Getting people to spend more is only one way to fix the economy 's woes .
To really get the economy back on track , what 's needed is an overhaul of the mortgage lending process in order to protect borrowers from overzealous banks pushing exotic loans that the borrowers really cannot afford .
In addition , stimulus that actually promotes investing and not just spending would be welcome .
It 's worth pointing out that the dividend tax changes in 2003 did more to boost the economy and market since they encouraged more companies to start paying dividends or boost existing ones .
Many investors used the income from dividends not just for spending , but more importantly , to reinvest in the market .
In turn , businesses used the money invested in them for capital spending , hiring and other measures that can boost the economy .
" Politically , the rebate makes people feel better .
Consumers may have a little more confidence so it's a good thing , " said John Derrick , director of research for U.S. Global Investors , a money management firm based in San Antonio .
" But encouraging investment by consumers and corporations would be more helpful . "
Thanks !
Finally , hats off to everyone who responded to Monday 's debut Morning Buzz .
I 'm glad to see that the column struck a nerve with readers and I think it 's fantastic that so many people posted their thoughts about what they think the Fed should be doing .
( 340 comments so far and counting ! )
There was a healthy mix of people who agreed with me that the Fed needs to stand up to Wall Street as well as those who believe the Fed is making the right moves to cut rates aggressively .
Anyway , keep the comments coming .
What do you think ?
Will the tax rebates keep the economy from recession ?
Bush redefining Iraq role , next president must pay for it RAW STORY
Published : Thursday January 24 , 2008

Print This Email This
While planning a redefinition of the US role in Iraq , the White House is n't seeking the funds to pay for it , leaving an unknown and potentially onerous situation for President Bush 's successor to navigate .
The White House has confirmed that its new budget , to be submitted in February , will reverse last years policy of providing a full year of funding for the war in Iraq , leaving the next president and Congress to confront major cost questions soon after taking office in 2009 ,  the Politico reported on Wednesday .
Last years budget , unveiled soon after Democrats took control of Congress , was explicit in requesting a full years worth of funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The new budget , the Politico notes , returns to the adminstrations prior practice of " request[ing ] only incremental bridge funding ,  and wont sustain the military through the full length of the fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 , 2009 . "
President Bushs term in office ends on Jan. 20 , 2009 .
This reversal in requesting war funding is concurrent with an effort by the White House to remake the terms of the US military commitment in Iraq .
The Washington Post reported on Thursday on a Democratic pushback against the " White House plan to forge a new , long - term security agreement with the Iraqi government , " with key Democrats including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama " complaining that the administration is trying to lock in a lasting U.S. military presence in Iraq before the next president takes office . "
The proposed security agreement would replace the current United Nations mandate authorizing the US presence in Iraq , which is set to expire on December 31 , 2008 .
According to conservative scholar Michael Rubin , in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday , the details of the proposed security agreement " remain unclear . "
Rubin said , " The proposed agreement could take many forms and , indeed , could be a package of multiple agreements , ranging from a Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) to economic development packages to basing agreements , to a formal defense treaty . "
Less unclear are estimates by Congressional staffers of both parties that the bridge - funding  request will total " between $ 70 billion and $ 80 billion  less than half the annual spending in recent years , " according to the Politico . " [ B ]y failing to spell out a full - year funding request , the administration will be effectively leaving office without ensuring the money is in place to sustain that U.S. commitment , " the Politico reported .
Rep. Bill Delahunt ( D - MA ) convened a hearing on Wednesday on the proposed force agreement .
" He dismissed the contention that the proposal is routine , " The Post reported , " Saying that administration officials declined to explain themselves before his Foreign Affairs subcommittee .
" ' We do n't trust this administration , ' he said , suggesting that at first glance , the scope of the proposed agreement goes well beyond that of a standard status - of - forces agreement . "
A team of researchers , including Herman Pontzer , Ph.D. , assistant professor of physical anthropology in Arts & Sciences , has determined through analysis of the earliest known hominid fossils outside of Africa , recently discovered in Dmanisi , Georgia , the former Soviet republic , that the first human ancestors to inhabit Eurasia were more primitive than previously thought .
A team of researchers , including Herman Pontzer , Ph.D. , assistant professor of physical anthropology in Arts & Sciences , has determined through analysis of the earliest known hominid fossils outside of Africa , recently discovered in Dmanisi , Georgia , the former Soviet republic , that the first human ancestors to inhabit Eurasia were more primitive than previously thought .
The fossils , dated to 1.8 million years old , show some modern aspects of lower limb morphology , such as long legs and an arched foot , but retain some primitive aspects of morphology in the shoulder and foot .
The species had a small stature and brain size more similar to earlier species found in Africa .
" Thus , the earliest known hominins to have lived outside Africa in temperate zones of Eurasia did not yet display the full set of derived skeletal features , " the researchers conclude .
The findings , published Sept. 20 in the journal Nature , are a marked step in learning more about the first human ancestors to migrate from Africa .
The lead author of the paper is David Lordpkipanidze , director of the National Museum of Georgia .
Collaborators on the study include Pontzer and researchers from Georgia , Switzerland , Italy and Spain .
The new evidence shows how this species had the anatomical and behavioral capacity to be successful across a range of environments and expand out of Africa , said Pontzer , who studies how the musculoskeletal anatomy of an animal reflect its performance , ecological niche and evolutionary history .
" This research tells us that the limb proportions and behavioral flexibility which allowed this species to expand out of Africa were there at least 1.8 million years ago , " Pontzer said .
Dmanisi is the site of a medieval village located about 53 miles southwest of Tbilisi , Georgia on a promontory at the confluence of the Mashavera and Phinezauri rivers .
Archaeological exploration of the ruins began in the 1930s , but systematic excavations were not undertaken until the 1980s .
Pontzer has been studying the site for more than six years .

Scientists have known for some time that most major groups of complex animals appeared in the fossils record during the Cambrian Explosion , a seemingly rapid evolutionary event that occurred 542 million years ago .
Now Virginia
Tech paleontologists , using rigorous analytical methods , have identified another explosive evolutionary event that occurred about 33 million years earlier among macroscopic life forms unrelated to the Cambrian animals .
They dubbed this earlier event the " Avalon Explosion . "
The discovery suggests that more than one explosive evolutionary event may have taken place during the early evolution of animals .
The Cambrian explosion event refers to the sudden appearance of most animal groups in a geologically short time period between 542 and 520 million years ago , in the early Cambrian Period .
Although there were not as many animal species as in modern oceans , most ( if not all ) living animal groups were represented in the Cambrian oceans .
" The explosive evolutionary pattern was a concern to Charles Darwin , because he expected that evolution happens at a slow and constant pace , " said Shuhai Xiao , associate professor of geobiology at Virginia Tech .
" Darwin 's perception could be represented by an inverted cone with ever expanding morphological range , but the fossil record of the Cambrian Explosion and since is better represented by a cylinder with a morphological radiation at the base and morphological constraint afterwards . "
Darwin reckoned that there should be long and hidden periods of animal evolution before the Cambrian Explosion , Xiao said .
But paleontologists have not found such evidence , and recently scientists have learned that biological evolution has not been moving on a smooth road .
" Accelerated rates may characterize the early evolution of many groups of organisms , " said Michal Kowalewski , professor of geobiology at Virginia Tech .

To test whether other major branches of life also evolved in an abrupt and explosive manner , Virginia Tech graduate students Bing Shen and Lin Dong , along with Xiao and Kowalewski , analyzed the Ediacara fossils : the oldest complex , multicellular organisms that had lived in oceans from 575 to 542 million years ago ; that is , before the Cambrian Explosion of animals .
" These Ediacara organisms do not have an ancestor - descendant relationship with the Cambrian animals , and most of them went extinct before the Cambrian Explosion , " said Shen .
" And this group of organisms -- most species -- seems to be distinct from the Cambrian animals . "
But how did those Ediacara organisms first evolve , Shen asked .
Did they also appear in an explosive evolutionary event , or is the Cambrian Explosion a truly unparalleled event "
" We identified 50 characters and mapped the distribution of these characters in more than 200 Ediacara species .
These species cover three evolutionary stages of the entire Ediacara history across 33 million years , " said Shen .
The three successive evolutionary stages are represented by the Avalon , White Sea , and Nama assemblages ( all named after localities where representative fossils of each stage can be found ) .
The earliest Avalon stage was represented by relatively few species .
Surprisingly , however , as shown by Shen and colleagues , these earliest Ediacara life forms already occupied a full morphological range of body plans that would ever be realized through the entire history of Ediacara organisms .
" In other words , major types of Ediacara organisms appeared at the dawn of their history , during the Avalon Explosion , " Dong said .
" Subsequently , Ediacara organisms diversified in White Sea time and then declined in Nama time .
But , despite this notable waxing and waning in the number of species , the morphological range of the Avalon organisms were never exceeded through the subsequent history of Ediacara . "
Kowalewski said their research team had not anticipated the discovery .
" Using the scientific literature , we were trying to create a more rigorous reconstruction of the morphological history of Ediacara organisms , " he said .

The process involved adapting quantitative methods that had been used previously for studying morphological evolution of animals , but never applied to the enigmatic Ediacara organisms .
" We think of diversity in terms of individual species .
But species may be very similar in their overall body plan .
For example , 50 species of fly may not differ much from one another in terms of their overall shape -- they all represent the same body plan .
On the other hand , a set of just three species that include a fly , a frog and an earthworm represent much more morphological variation .
We can thus think of biodiversity not only in terms of how many different species there are but also how many fundamentally distinct body plans are being represented .
Our approach combined both those approaches , " said Kowalewski .
" In addition , the method relies on converting different morphologies into numerical ( binary ) data .
This strategy allows us to describe , more objectively and more consistently , enigmatic fossil life forms , which are preserved mostly as two - dimensional impressions and are not understood well in terms of function , ecology , or physiology , " Kowalewski said .
Scientists are still unsure what were the driving forces behind the rapid morphological expansion during the Avalon explosion , and why the morphological range did not expand , shrink , or shift during the subsequent White Sea and Nama stages .
" But , one thing seems certain -- the evolution of earliest macroscopic and complex life also went through an explosive event before to the Cambrian Explosion , " Xiao said .
" It now appears that at the dawn of the macroscopic life , between 575 and 520 million years ago , there was not one , but at least two major episodes of abrupt morphological expansion . "
The article , " The Avalon Explosion : Evolution of Ediacara Morphospace , " by Shen , Dong , Xiao , and Kowalewski , appears in the Jan. 4 issue of Science .
Shen and Dong have graduated .
Dong is at British Petroleum and Shen at Rice University , both in Houston .
Her legs and face are swollen , and with each slight movement she winces in pain .
Lying on a hospital bed in the Ghanaian capital of Accra , there are moments when Ama Sumani appears incoherent .
Then it all becomes too overwhelming and tears roll down her cheeks .
' I wish I was still in Cardiff , ' she says quietly .
' Why could they not have kept me there ?
Why could they not have treated me and then sent me back ? '
It 's more than two weeks since Ama , a 39 - year - old widowed mother of two , was taken in a wheelchair from a Cardiff hospital by three immigration officials , flown to Accra , then dumped in a city she had visited just once before in her life .
Suffering from malignant myeloma , for which she was receiving dialysis treatment at the University Hospital of Wales , it was a journey many condemned at the time as nothing short of a death sentence for a woman whose crime was to have overstayed her visa .
With no funds to cover the £ 50 - a - day cost of dialysis in Accra , without which she would die , her future seemed bleak .
Anonymous well - wishers have since contributed to the cost of her treatment , but just for three months .
And after that ?
She looks up , as the tears begin again .
' After that , I am in God 's hands , ' she replies .
Ama is terminally ill .
The cancer has damaged her kidneys and she needs dialysis three times a week if she is to prolong her life .
But , though aware her visa was out of date , she still finds it difficult to understand how she ended up here , in the treatment room at Korle - Bu Hospital , in a city she had spent just one day in - and that was on her way to the UK to pick up her visa in 2003 .
' The doctors were trying to save me , but the people who made me leave are trying to kill me , ' she tells The Observer .
' The doctors told me that if I was without treatment for two weeks , I would die .
I said to the people who took me : " Why are you doing this ?
Why are you sending me to die ? "
' How long will I live ?
What are my chances ?
I can not say .
I have no one here with me , to lead me through such questions , to speak to the doctors for me . '
Her bewilderment is all the more acute because she knows no one in this city .
She comes from the north of Ghana , many hours away .
Her family are there still and thus unable to help her , and no hospital there is equipped for dialysis .
' When I leave the hospital I can not walk .
I am so tired , so dizzy , my blood pressure is too high , ' she says .
' I tried to make some soup , but I was too weak .
I need to pay somebody to look after me , but I do not know people in Accra .
I do not know who to trust .
I just pray that someone will help me .'
Ama , who went to Britain on a student visa five years ago , appealed in vain against her removal .
She first came to the UK as a visitor in 2003 , then was granted a student visa .
But her poor English prevented her from studying and she took paid work which contravened her visa .
In 2005 , she returned to Ghana to attend a memorial for her dead husband , but on re-entering the UK her student visa was revoked and she was given temporary admission .
She became ill in 2006 .
The fact that she was removed , rather than deported , means in theory that she can apply to return to the UK in future .
Campaigners in Wales are still fighting for her return .
The decision to remove her was strongly criticised by church leaders and the medical profession .
The Lancet called it ' an act of atrocious barbarism ' .
When the immigration officers who had accompanied her on her flight returned to Britain , she was left alone .
With no money , she checked out of the hotel where they had put her up for one night , taking with her the two suitcases and large plastic bag full of winter coats that she had brought with her .
' They put me in a hotel and paid for one night but it was so expensive .
I needed help to find somewhere to stay .
I needed to have treatment at this hospital .
But they would not take me unless I paid .
I had only enough for two days ' treatment , ' she says .
' And they wanted three months ' treatment paid in advance . '
With the recent donation Amu has been able to start the treatment .
Each Monday , Thursday and Friday finds her trudging to the rundown hospital building and through the unit 's entrance beneath a fading sign proclaiming ' Department of Medicine ' .
Once that money runs out , her future is uncertain .
But , as she faces it , she is thankful for what she has received from the British people .
' They helped me so much .
All I can say is God bless them . '
The Border and Immigration Agency has said that though it feels ' personal sympathy ' in her case , it is not enough to ' make it unique or to give this individual the right to a different process ' .

Bureaucrats get EBay fever / State sells penknives confiscated at airports at online auction
A hacksaw is merely one of the many confiscated " Carry - On " items confiscated at one Northern California airport .
The items are being sorted at the State of California Surplus Warehouse in Sacramento and will be auctioned off on Ebay on Thursday , February 20 , 2003 .

That pocketknife you surrendered to airport security screeners might now be tucked away in someone else 's pocket -- someone who bought it on EBay .
Under the handle CaliforniaGold2000 , the state is using the Internet auction house to convert scores of confiscated items to cash .
So far , $ 16,281 has been made selling objects taken from passengers at Oakland and Sacramento airports -- the only ones in Northern California to participate in the state program .
Among the oddest items confiscated and sold were at least three circular saws , hatchets , curtain rods and a little girl 's baton , said Robb Deignan , spokesman for the surplus property disposal program , a division of the California Department of General Services .
Also sold : 5,364 pocketknives , 350 pounds of scissors , 594 corkscrews and 309 leatherman tools .
The Transportation Security Administration , which employs most airport screeners , allows airports to decide how to get rid of the mountains of items collected , said spokesman Nico Melendez .
They are too numerous to return to their owners , Deignan said .
Since November , when the program started , 2,400 pounds of objects have been delivered from the Sacramento airport , and 2,250 pounds from Oakland .
In cash - strapped , tech - savvy California , someone in the state 's surplus property program thought up the idea of selling the things on EBay , Deignan said .
California may be the only state in the country that has employed EBay for the purpose .
" We 're putting items that are reusable back in the hands of people , " Deignan said .
" On EBay , it 's egalitarian .
It opens the bidding to the world . "
In Southern California , Los Angeles International , John Wayne and Ontario airports participate in the surplus program .
Meanwhile , airport officials in San Jose and San Francisco say they will continue to dispose of the mostly metal items by hiring haulers to take them to recyclers .
The state had been selling other surplus items , such as electronics taken in police raids , on EBay for several years , and already operated two public sales warehouses -- in Sacramento and Fullerton , Deignan said .
The scissors , knives and tools taken by airport screeners are perfect for EBay because they are relatively valuable and easy to transport , he said .
As the effort to sell the confiscated airport items online has progressed , employees have become more knowledgeable about what EBay buyers want , and how best to sort the lots .
Most of the things for sale online are of the garden - variety pointy type : " 10 collector knives , Gerber , " " 200 money clips , lots of styles and brands " and " mountains of miscellaneous used hand tools . "
Bidding starts at $ 9.99 , with the most expensive auction so far bringing $ 835 for 350 pocketknives .
The proceeds are divided between the state and federal governments .
The state uses its share to offset the cost of the program , Deignan said .
He said he has heard no complaints about the program -- aside from the state employee who told him that the EBay descriptions should be more poetic .
But when some airline passengers who had unwittingly donated items to the cause were informed of the program , they were n't too pleased .
" As far as the concept is concerned , I think it 's ridiculous , " said Bernard Wormgoor , who was flying out of Oakland with his wife when she was asked to relinquish a pair of nail scissors that her mother had given her some 40 years before .
" They do n't own it .
They took it away -- that does n't mean you relinquish ownership , " he said .
" I do n't want to use the word ' theft , ' but it starts smelling like it . "
Nicola Place of Danville agreed .
Flying out of Oakland on a business trip , she lost a Swiss Army knife her dad had given her more than 20 years ago .
" It broke my heart , " she said .
" It had been everywhere with me . "
Thinking about it ending up on EBay , she said , " It makes me sad .
. . .
It irks me that they can take it away and make money off us .
It 's bad enough they take it away . "
On the other side of the virtual auction block , however , are a number of satisfied customers .
In fact , CaliforniaGold2000 boasts an admirable EBay rating , with just one negative comment out of 310 sales in the past six months .
The lone complaint came from user Squishypig , who claimed the item purchased was not as described , horribly packaged and that a refund was difficult to obtain .
CaliforniaGold2000 replied , in part , " there 's no pleasing everybody . "
Among the successful , satisfied bidders was Nevada City businessman Greg Cook , owner of Friar Tuck 's Restaurant and Wine Bar , which burned down last March .
Cook is preparing to reopen the joint this spring , and he was in the market for corkscrews .
Never having bought an item off EBay in his life , he dipped his toe in the bidding in the last hours of an auction for 42 wood handle corkscrews -- and got them , $ 36 for the lot .
" They 're $ 20 ones .
They 're beautiful , I 've been showing them to everyone , " Cook said .
" We do a big wine business .
The wood handle ones are nicer because when you work all night , they 're nicer on your hands .
" I 'm real happy , " he said .

Keyboard vs. The Mouse , pt 1
Originally published in the AppleDirect , August , 1989
Republished as Chapter 6 , in Tog on Interface
Dear Tog : Id like to pose a few questions for you to examine .
My main concern is pretty basic but fairly important .
Im worried that the command - key is breaking down as a valid method to communicate instructions .
There is very little consistency between programs these days and I really have too many functions to address with a small set of commands .
So here goes :
The basic life or death question of command keys : is command - P Print ... or Plain ?
How do you feel about three key command sequences ( i.e. shift - command - c ) ?
They have often been restricted to " system " functions as opposed to editing functions .
Is this my imagination or a good rule ?
How about user configurable command keys ( a la Quark Style sheets ) ?
With one level of undo , command z undid , command z again re-did .
With multiple levels of undo could you propose a key for re-do ?
I would like the current list of suggested command keys to be expanded .
Command K is used as a delete function in some programs , yet it initiates something in others ( AppleLink ) .
A separate but related issue would be a tutorial on ordering items on the menu bar and within menus .
I used to order functions in workable groups , but found the programs easier to use if the functions were grouped with the most used towards the top .
How do you feel about this ?
 Aaron Rosenbaum
Tog Responds : Frankly Aaron , I mainly feel saddened that you , a pillar of the software community , would have the audacity to accuse me , a Cupertino - renowned evangelist , of pontificating .
But I will lay all that aside ( particularly since I am sadly lacking in a defense ) , and answer your question .
Weve done a cool $ 50 million of R & D on the Apple Human Interface .
We discovered , among other things , two pertinent facts :
Test subjects consistently report that keyboarding is faster than mousing .
The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding .
This contradiction between user - experience and reality apparently forms the basis for many user / developers  belief that the keyboard is faster .
People new to the mouse find the process of acquiring it every time they want to do anything other than type to be incredibly time - wasting .
And therein lies the very advantage of the mouse : it is boring to find it because the two - second search does not require high - level cognitive engagement .
It takes two seconds to decide upon which special - function key to press .
Deciding among abstract symbols is a high - level cognitive function .
Not only is this decision not boring , the user actually experiences amnesia !
Real amnesia !
The time - slice spent making the decision simply ceases to exist .
While the keyboard users in this case feels as though they have gained two seconds over the mouse users , the opposite is really the case .
Because while the keyboard users have been engaged in a process so fascinating that they have experienced amnesia , the mouse users have been so disengaged that they have been able to continue thinking about the task they are trying to accomplish .
They have not had to set their task aside to think about or remember abstract symbols .
Hence , users achieve a significant productivity increase with the mouse in spite of their subjective experience .
Not that any of the above True Facts will stop the religious wars .
And , in fact , I find myself on the opposite side in at least one instance , namely editing .
By using Command X , C , and V , the user can select with one hand and act with the other .
Two - handed input .
Two - handed input can result in solid productivity gains ( Buxton 1986 ) .
Command - Key Illusion .
Since users do experience the illusion that keyboarding is faster , there is market pressure to supply them with " shortcuts . " even when using " shortcuts " will actually slow them down .
What I generally recommend is supplying as many " shortcuts " as demanded by the market the real market , not the programmer in the cubicle next to you .
But only if these " shortcuts " are not to the detriment of the user of the Macintosh visual interface .
This leads to two important guidelines :
Guideline :
The keyboard interface must not dictate the design of the visual interface .
Guideline :
The work to design and build the keyboard interface should not sap resources that are needed for the creation of the visual interface .
In other words , dont rape the primary interface for the benefit of so - called " power - users , " who may well end up achieving lower productivity by using the keyboard interface anyway .
This is a major problem right now .
( Thank heavens I gave up pontificating ! )
And now on to your specific questions :
1 ) P stands for ....
At the time this column was written , at Apple , P stood for Plain , the command that would make bold , italic , or otherwise styled text into unstyled text .
Unfortunately , everywhere else in the civilized world like in all our developers software P stood for Print .
I wrote in this column , in no uncertain terms , that P still stood for Plain .
I also began a dialog inside Apple the led to changing it .
I was helped in that effort by letters from the readers demanding a change .
The result ?
P now stands for Print .
2 ) Multiple - key commands ( e.g. , option - command - shift - 9 ) started out only applied to system functions , but they have certainly proliferated beyond that .
At this point , there are no rules for how many keys can be used beyond common sense : the more keys required , the slower the action and the fewer the people who will have the dexterity to use them .
Again , because the so - called power user is rocking away at high speed on the keyboard is no evidence that he or she is being more productive ; it only means he or she is having to work really hard to accomplish the task .
3 ) User - specified command keys are the best solution to the current problems , leading to the following guideline :
Guideline :
All command - keys should be user - specifiable .
The developer can and should supply an initial set , but the user should be able to overrule those choices .
In the early ( pre-release ) days of Lisa , we had command keys instead of pull - down menus .
One of the primary reasons we abandoned command keys was the difficulty of coming up with fixed definitions that could be easily transported from application to application .
Users were constantly confused .
I remember one mainframe company in the sixties that came up with the following command - key guidelines :
Use the first letter of the command word
If the first letter is already used , use the last letter
If the last letter is already used , use the second letter
If the second letter is already used , use the second - to - the - last letter
etc .
A real power - user paradise !
Users are better able to remember disconnected data when they are the source for that data : they can remember shortcut keys far better if they assigned them .
This fact was the basis for our decision to enable users , not applications , to control the programming of F1 through F15 on the USS Saratoga I mean , extended keyboard .
( USS Saratoga was our code name during development of the extended keyboard because of its eerie resemblance to the popular aircraft carrier .
Not so much the shape as the size . )
Specifiable command keys also enable the handicapped who cannot use the mouse access to applications without burdening the rest of us with cluttered menus and the siren song of improved productivity where none exists .
4 ) " With one level of undo , command z undid , command z again re-did .
With multiple levels of undo could you propose a key for re-do ? "
How about Command - Shift - Option - Control - Help - Triple click ?
Oh , its been used ?
On September 19th , MacWeek will be hosting InterfaceDesign 89 , a conference in San Francisco on the Macintosh interface .
This will be a working conference where you developers can tell us what you want .
We expect to incorporate many of your suggestions into the Guidelines .
Let us know what key you think should be used for re-do .
I would also hope that we might be able to hammer out some more standard Command key equivalents , although for the life of me , I cannot imagine why Command K would mean delete .
Could it stand for kill ?
I would also like somebody anybody to show up with one properly - conducted test report that shows that command keys are equivalent or superior to pull - down menus somewhere , somehow .
Menu ordering is another topic that should be raised at ID 89 .
Aaron is correct in assuming that items toward the top are accessed faster .
In face , our research showed that the fastest item of all is drum rollitem two .
Then theres the standardization of where items will occur on the menu bar : I am pleased to see that the new version of AppleLink , 5.0 , will actually open documents in the File menu .
How revolutionary !
Now if we can only get HyperCard to even have a menu bar ....
But that s next months column .
The ID '89 conference was quite a success , and , following it , we adopted a much more complete set of command keys , published in my 1989 edition of the Guidelines .
This column set off a flurry of email like no other .
Here are just three of the responses received ...
In The Thick Of It
Tog ,
As a developer and experienced user , I strongly disagree with your discussion on command keys ....
First , I disagree with the statement that keyboarding is slower than mousing .
Bet you could see that one coming .
I have absolutely no doubt that for most of the users , the non-power users ( for lack of a better term that has been extremely over used ) , mousing is faster .
To me , this is a basic part of the Macintosh user interface .
Users should ALWAYS learn via the mouse and ONLY in the most used statements convert from mouse to keyboard .
For example , I and many of my users and clients type at 75 - 125 words per minute .
In their environment , they and I have set up key equivalents such as Control - B for bold .
In typing their documents , it is far faster for the experienced user to type Control - B then the word then Control - B for a single bold word than it is to do the equivalent with the mouse .
For the non-power users , it is far faster to select the mouse command .
This is not because the mouse is inherently faster or slower than the keyboard , but because of the switching time between the two devices for the power user who types at extreme rates .
I do n't know how fast you type , but I know that some of my clients and myself no longer think of words as a series of letters .
We actually think in a pattern of keystrokes .
I do n't think of ' the ' as ' t - h- e ' , I think of it as ' the ' .
Bottom line -- key equivalents are , as you said , slower for anyone who does n't type at an extreme rate .
But , they are far faster for those of us who do .
Second , I 'm glad that Apple think that Command - P stands for Plain , but lets not fight what is CLEARLY the standard -- and that is Print .
Most of my clients , users and definitely myself Print far more times than selecting Plain .
Now , you re probably sitting there saying " this guy is out of it , " but think of this .
Most of the time when you are word processing , you are typing in the Plain style .
Occasionally , you may bold or underline something .
If the formatting takes place while typing , most people will choose BOLD type some and then choose BOLD again .
The other type of formatting takes place after the typing .
In this case , the user rarely needs the plain command because he / she has selected only the relevant text .
Now , the obvious exception to this is the user who frequently uses styles with multiple styles , but in my experience , this is much less common in everyday use .
Finally , what 's the difference if Command - K does stand for kill , as long as the user remembers it ?
- Neil Ticktin Truin Software
Hi , Nick ,
I dont think most folks can touch - type 75 - 100 command - keys per minute , particularly with the weird layout of the keyboard weve adopted , which often requires the user to curl the thumb underneath the other keys .
Regardless , you have presented the standard argument that makes it seem logical that command keys would be faster .
Unfortunately , experimental evidence does not support the argument .
You also argue that there is no need for a short - cut key for Plain , as there is for Bold , etc .
You have presented an argument based on most people writing in a very specific style , and with no errors .
I not only make errors when I type , but I play with the text , over and over , until it scans the way I want it to .
As a result , I probably use the plain key equivalent in my word processor Command - Shift - Spaceat least 30 times per day .
I print perhaps 5 times per day .
There are two things wrong with Command - K for kill .
First , the menu doesnt say , " Kill , " it says Delete .
Second , it violates an unwritten , but long - standing guideline :
Guideline : words like " kill , " " abort , " and " default " have powerful emotional charges connected with them and have no place in the interface .
Instead , use words like " stop , " " cancel , " and " standard . "
Your argument that P for Print is clearly the standard is well - taken : I hope we will change it soon .

Its All In Their Minds
Hi , Tog ,
... The August Apple Direct issue just arrived with your " Command Keys vs. the Mouse " article .
I totally agree with you about keyboarders versus mousers .
Keyboarders only think they are faster I think its because of the sound of the keys , and the boss thinks work is flying when he hears those keys pecking away .
If the mouse had a motor in it so it made a sound like a motorcycle or a whoosh or a zip , maybe folk would think the mouse was faster .
As a result of my observations of users , there are NO command key equivalents in my product , Smart Labels , except for Undo , Cut , Copy and Paste .
The Clear and Escape keys will clear the label text edit box .
Users may demand key equivalents , but I will resist them .
One of my current interesting projects is software that will work with the keyboard disconnected , and , in - fact , will not respond to any keystrokes .
How 's that for an interface challenge !
 Kim Hunter
Or Is It ?
Tog :
I have been doing some study and testing on the issues raised by your last article and would like to share some of my thoughts .
( If they prove useful maybe you could cut me in on some of that $ 50 million you paid the guy to time the 2 second " amnesia time slice " ! )
Let me begin by saying I agree that the mouse should be the primary interface to any application and that any support of the keyboard should in no way reduce the efficiency of the mouse or the aesthetic appeal of the graphical interface .
I disagree , however , with the premise that mousing is faster than keyboarding ( notice that I did not say that I believe keyboarding is faster than mousing ) .
I believe that making such assumptions will stand in the way of providing the user the ability to determine just how he will interact with the computer for any given function at any given time .
In your article you state " The keyboard users in this case feel as though they have gained two seconds over the mouse users , but the opposite is really the case . "
To the keyboard user , it may not matter that he was actually slower , because he has perceived a speed increase over using the mouse .
It is the subjective nature of perception and the disparity between perception and reality that gives rise to the " religious " nature of these discussions .
I came across an interesting example of perception vs. reality while designing a small text editor :
When scrolling the text horizontally in a window we would refresh the text by redisplaying each line starting at the top .
This resulted in a wave of text rippling down the screen , and many complaints that the screen refresh was too slow .
The remedy was to scroll the bits already on screen and then redisplay each line from the top .
The second implementation was actually slower than the first because we incurred the overhead of scrolling the bits before we even started to display the new text on the screen .
However , the perception was that there was an immense increase in speed .
We stuck with the second implementation because it increased the overall satisfaction of the user even though it actually decreased the throughput of the product .
In my mind , perception is stronger than reality .
A users perception of a product is what causes him to purchase it and influences his satisfaction with the product ...
I 'm not trying to propose that Apple abandon the mouse interface .
On the contrary , as I stated earlier , I believe that the mouse / graphical interface should remain primary .
But I strongly believe that more needs to be done to allow for the experienced user who is willing to make an investment in learning to be allowed more keyboard access to the entire interface , not just menus .
I think Donald Norman [ Norman , 1988 ] put it best when he said " the design should not impede action , especially for those well - practiced , experienced users who have internalized the knowledge .
It should be easy to go back and forth , to combine the knowledge in the head with that in the world .
Let whichever is more readily available at the moment be used without interfering with the other , and allow for mutual support . "

A new study found that white - tailed jack rabbits have vanished from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , where the bunnies were once abundant .
No one knows what caused the rabbits to disappear , according to the study conducted by the Bronx Zoo- based Wildlife Conservation Society .
It could be disease , extreme weather , predation or other factors , said Wildlife Conservation Society conservationist Joel Berger , a professor at the University of Montana .
Historical records from more than 130 years ago indicate that white - tailed jack rabbits were once common in Greater Yellowstone , a 60,000 square kilometer ( 23,166 square mile ) ecosystem that contains both Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks .
The study found no jack rabbit sightings could be confirmed in Yellowstone since 1991 and only three in Grand Teton since 1978 .
The jack rabbits ' departure may be having significant impacts on the whole region , including both predators of the rabbits and other prey species , Berger said .
The absence of jack rabbits may be causing elevated predation by coyotes on juvenile elk , pronghorn and other ungulates , according to the study .
Elsewhere , when rabbit densities drop predators often turn to preying more on livestock .
But without baseline data on rabbit numbers in Greater Yellowstone , assessing the impacts on predators such as grey wolves , which were reintroduced to the parks in 1995 , becomes more difficult .
Berger said wildlife managers should consider reintroducing white - tailed jack rabbits into Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks .
Reintroduction may restore the dynamic ecological processes that were intact before the rabbits vanished from the ecosystem , he said .
The study will appear in latest issue of the journal Oryx .

Top 10 Most Incredible Animal Journeys
Europe is known as a champion of combating climate change .
But a developing country famous for its capital 's polluted air is also a surprising front - runner : Mexico .
Mexico ranked fourth on the Climate - Change Performance Index , which scores countries on their greenhouse - gas emissions and policy .
The policy group Germanwatch released the report this week during the U.N. climate - change conference in Bali .
Only Sweden , Germany and Iceland outscored Mexico , with its 110 million people .
The United States ranked 55th out of 56 countries , ahead only of Saudia Arabia .
" I do n't think any developing country has spelled out as comprehensive a strategy as Mexico , " said Pankaj Bhatia , director of the Greenhouse - Gas Protocol Initiative of the World Resources Institute , a sustainability think tank .
" I think it 's a great example for developing countries like China , Brazil and India . "
With much of the wrangling at the international level occurring among the European Union , China and the United States , the strides of some smaller , non-European countries have been overlooked .
Known for its manufacturing and natural - resource extraction industries , Mexico is not typically considered a paragon of environmental planning .
Recent years , however , have seen a marked change in government policy .
The government adopted a comprehensive climate - change mitigation strategy in May , and the new mayor of Mexico City , Marcelo Ebrard , has received international acclaim for his $ 550 million plan to reduce the capital 's emissions .
Mexican companies were also the first in the developing world to begin voluntarily inventorying their greenhouse - gas emissions along World Resources Institute guidelines .
Germanwatch attributed Mexico's jump from No. 16 in last year 's rankings up to No. 4 this year to " constructive international and national climate policy and its relatively favorable emissions trends . "
Ned Helme , president of the Center for Clean Air Policy , said Mexico 's aggressive direction on climate change stems from the country 's new president , Felipe Calderon , who was sworn in last December .
" Calderon had come out of the ministry of energy and is really committed to moving on climate change , " Helme said .
According to the World Resources Institute , Mexico produced 415.3 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2004 .
Helme 's think tank believes Mexico 's new policies , which include increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as planting forests , will reduce the country 's greenhouse - gas emissions by 110 million tons by the year 2020 .
The United States , starting with 10 times the emissions that Mexico creates , would only reduce emissions 180 million tons based on current policy .
" The Mexican government has been very courageous , " Bhatia said .
" Their success is inspiring similar programs in other countries . "
In fact , the development of Mexico as a leader in the battle to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions has already proven to be a valuable model that other developing nations are looking to follow .
" When we went to China , the authorities said , ' We 'd like to see how other developing countries have done , ' " Bhatia said .
" We provided the Chinese with the Mexican success story , and that enabled us to get a program started there . "
Other Latin American countries have made strides to reduce their contributions to global warming .
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias declared that his country would be carbon - neutral by 2020 , even as he admitted the goal would be difficult to reach .
Both Mexico and Costa Rica have engaged in ambitious tree - planting efforts .
A far cry from the community efforts often seen in the United States , Mexico wants to put 250 million trees in the ground by the end of 2007 , and Costa Rica 's goal is 6.5 million .
The trees are a natural way to sequester carbon dioxide through their normal metabolic processes .
Mexico 's vigorous activity domestically has also given it a new voice internationally .
At the Bali climate - change conference , Helme said the Mexican delegation became a leader among developing nations .
" Stay tuned .
Mexico is going to be very aggressive in the next year , " he said .
" They 're saying , ' We 're actually doing more than the Europeans , and it 's time we beat our chests and asked the ( developed world ) :
What are you doing ? ' "
Last May , AMD introduced its much delayed Radeon HD 2900 XT at $ 399 .
In a highly unexpected move , AMD indicated that it would not be introducing any higher end graphics cards .
We discussed this in our original 2900 XT review :
" In another unique move , there is no high end part in AMD 's R600 lineup .
The Radeon HD 2900 XT is the highest end graphics card in the lineup and it's priced at $ 399 .
While we appreciate AMD 's intent to keep prices in check , the justification is what we have an issue with .
According to AMD , it loses money on high end parts which is why we wo n't see anything more expensive than the 2900 XT this time around .
The real story is that AMD would lose money on a high end part if it was n't competitive , which is why we feel that there 's nothing more expensive than the 2900 XT .
It 's not a huge deal because the number of people buying >
$ 399 graphics cards is limited , but before we 've started the review AMD is already giving up ground to NVIDIA , which is n't a good sign . "
AMD has since released even more graphics cards , including the competitive Radeon HD 3870 and 3850 , but it still lacked a high end offering .
The end of 2007 saw a slew of graphics cards released that brought GeForce 8800 GTX performance to the masses at lower price points , but nothing any faster .
Considering we have yet to achieve visual perfection in PC games , there 's still a need for even faster hardware .
At the end of last year both AMD and NVIDIA hinted at bringing back multi-GPU cards to help round out the high end .
The idea is simple : take two fast GPUs , put them together on a single card and sell them as a single faster video card .
These dual GPU designs are even more important today because of the SLI / CrossFire limitations that exist on various chipsets .
With few exceptions , you can't run SLI on anything other than a NVIDIA chipset ; and unless you 're running an AMD or Intel chipset , you can't run Cross Fire .
These self - contained SLI / CrossFire graphics cards will work on anything however .
AMD is the first out of the gates with the Radeon HD 3870 X2 , based on what AMD is calling its R680 GPU .
Despite the codename , the product name tells the entire story : the Radeon HD 3870 X2 is made up of two 3870s on a single card .
Click to Enlarge
The card is long , measuring 10.5 " it 's the same length as a GeForce 8800 GTX or Ultra .
AMD is particularly proud of its PCB design which is admittedly quite compact despite featuring more than twice the silicon of a single Radeon HD 3870 .
On the board we 've got two 3870 GPUs , separated by a 48 - lane PCIe 1.1 bridge ( no 2.0 support here guys ) .
Each GPU has 16 lanes going to it , and then the final 16 lanes head directly to the PCIe connector and out to the motherboard 's chipset .
Two RV670 GPUs surround the PCIe bridge chip - Click to Enlarge
Click to Enlarge
Thanks to the point - to - point nature of the PCI Express interface , that 's all you need for this elegant design to work .
The 3870 's board layout is far simpler ( left ) than the X2's ( right ) thanks to less stringent power requirements and lack of a bridge chip +
2nd GPU - Click to Enlarge
Each GPU has its own 512MB frame buffer , but the power delivery on the board has been reworked to deal with supplying two 3870 GPUs .
The Radeon HD 3870 X2 is built on a 12 - layer PCB , compared to the 8 - layer design used by the standard 3870 .
The more layers you have on a PCB the easier routing and ground / power isolation becomes , AMD says that this is the reason it is able to run the GPUs on the X2 faster than on the single GPU board .
A standard 3870 runs its GPU at 775MHz , while both GPUs on the X2 run at 825MHz .
Memory speed is reduced however ; the Radeon HD 3870 X2 uses slower , more available GDDR3 in order to keep board cost under control .
While the standard 3870 uses 2.25 GHz data rate GDDR4 , the X2 runs its GDDR3 at a 1.8GHz data rate .
The 3870 has 8 x 64MB GDDR4 memory devices on one side of the PCB , the X2 has 4 x 32MB GDDR3 per GPU on each side of the PCB for a total of 16 GDDR3 memory devices , or 1GB of memory total - Click to Enlarge
AMD expects the Radeon HD 3870 X2 to be priced at $ 449 , which is actually cheaper than a pair of 3870s - making it sort of a bargain high end product .
We reviewed so many sub -$ 300 cards at the end of last year that we were a bit put off by the $ 500 pricetag at first ; then we remembered how things used to be , and it seems that the 3870 X2 will be the beginning of a return to normalcy in the graphics industry .

Turns out Google already had another cartographic controversy on its hands .
Earlier this week we learned of an Israeli city 's slander lawsuit against the search giant based upon Google 's refusal to remove a user - generated Google Earth notation that identifies the community of Kiryat Yam as Arab Ghawarina .
A Google spokesperson told me that the notation violated no aspect of the company 's terms of use agreement , no matter how much it violated the sensibilities of Kiryat Yam officials .
In this second controversy , however , Google does not have the " We did n't do it " card at its disposal .
That 's because Google itself has renamed the Persian Gulf .
They can do that ?
Mother Jones blogger Justin Elliott explains :
The problem comes in the form of a letter to Google 's CEO from the National Iranian American Council loudly protesting the inclusion in Google Earth of the term " Arabian Gulf " - along with the more common " Persian Gulf . "
Only a few years ago , in 2004 , Google 's co-founders told shareholders that " focused objectivity " was a trait " most important in Google 's past success " and " most fundamental for its future . "
But that was before Google Earth .
And if the two complaints this month show anything , it 's that a map is a highly subjective thing .
Including " Arabian Gulf " was a classic hedge on Google 's part , probably an attempt to strive for that ideal of objectivity .
NIAC 's letter , however , explains the term 's somewhat untoward history :
You can read that letter here .
The group says that the National Geographic Society " made the same error " in 2004 and willingly corrected itself after NIAC complained .
Google has yet to reply to inquiries from Mother Jones .
Perhaps the programmers behind Google Earth should just pretend that the Middle East has dropped off the map altogether .
Drastic , yes , but their lives would be made so much simpler .

Try telling the time on this wall clock !
When I was young , I always had a hard time figuring out the time based on the positioning of the clock ’s hands .
I remember my Mom trying to teach me in so many different ways , but I just was not able to get a hold of it .
With that , math was not my strongest subject either , so I am happy this clock was not around then , or I would have NEVER learned to tell the time .

Many Christian conservatives see Mike Huckabee as the best candidate to deliver the GOP from an impending pro-abortion presidential nomination of either Rudy Giuliani or Mitt Romney .
Huckabee is doing especially well in Iowa , particularly among evangelicals .
Is Mike Huckabee worthy of this support , however ?
The facts say no .
I have already attempted to warn my evangelical brethren as to the dangers of supporting Mike Huckabee .
See http://www.chuckbaldwinlive.com/c2007/cbarchive_20071102.html
However , that first column was just the tip of the proverbial iceberg .
Here are more reasons to beware of Mike Huckabee .
Robert Novak recently wrote a column about Mike Huckabee entitled , " The False Conservative . "
In the column he said , " Huckabee is campaigning as a conservative , but serious Republicans know that he is a high - tax , protectionist , big - government advocate of a strong hand in the Oval Office directing the lives of Americans . "
Novak also said , " There is no doubt about Huckabee 's record during a decade in Little Rock as governor .
. .
He increased the Arkansas tax burden by 47 percent , boosting the levies on gasoline and cigarettes . "
Novak continued saying , " Quin Hillyer , a former Arkansas journalist writing in the conservative American Spectator , called Huckabee 'a guy with a thin skin , a nasty vindictive streak . '
Huckabee 's retort was to attack Hillyer 's journalistic procedures , fitting a mean - spirited image when he responds to conservative criticism . "
Calling Huckabee a proponent of big - government is an understatement .
" If you listen closely , all the things he supports increase the size , power and cost of government .
From subsidies for energy research to increasing money for health care and government housing , the size , power , and cost of government will not shrink under a President Mike Huckabee ; they will increase . . .
Mr. Huckabee swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution when he became governor , yet many of his proposals are clearly unconstitutional . "
( Source : David Ulrich , Letter of the Week , World Net Daily , 10/26/07 )
In addition , Dr. Jerome Corsi reports that " Financial inducements arranged by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to establish a Mexican consular office in Little Rock may have violated state law , according to an Arkansas attorney . "
Writing for World Net Daily , Dr. Corsi exposed the fact that Mike Huckabee " worked with some of the state 's most prominent and politically powerful businesses to establish the [ Mexican ] consulate as a magnet for drawing illegal immigrants to the state to accept low - paying jobs . "
Corsi goes on to report that " Arkansas attorney Chip Sexton provided WND a written legal brief arguing the state government 's sublease to Mexico of office space for the consulate was illegal under Arkansas law .
Sexton contended the deal raised questions about the appropriateness of private citizens and corporations in Arkansas providing financial incentives for the government of Mexico to locate a consulate office in Little Rock . "
Corsi also writes that " Robert Trevino , commissioner of Arkansas Rehabilitation Services , told WND he and Huckabee helped arrange state and private financial support to induce Mexico to establish the consulate as a business development ' quid pro quo . '
" Trevino signed on July 7 , 2006 , a ' Facilities Use Agreement ' with Mexican consular officials to rent state government office space for $ 1 a year on the second floor of the Arkansas Rehabilitation Services building at 26 Corporate Hills in Little Rock . "
According to Sexton , not only did subleasing state government offices to Mexico violate Arkansas state law under Ark. Code Ann. 22-2-114( C ) ( i ) which provides : " After July 1 , 1975 , no state agency shall enter into or renew or otherwise negotiate a lease between itself as lessor or lessee and a nongovernmental or other government lessor or lessee , " but it was even more offensive in that " there was nothing in the lease or other agreements that would have prevented the Mexican consulate from providing legal assistance to illegal aliens . "
In addition , Corsi also exposed the fact that Mike Huckabee worked with Mexican President Vicente Fox to help provide cheap Mexican labor for Tyson foods and other large Arkansas corporations .
According to Corsi , " Trevino confirmed he was state director of the League of United Latin American Citizens , also known as LULAC , an activist group strongly advocating for the rights of Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. , when on Oct. 3 , 2003 , he accompanied Huckabee in a state airplane to visit [ President Vicente ] Fox in Mexico . "
There is more .
The American Spectator reported that " Fourteen times , the ethics commission - - a respected body , not a partisan witch - hunt group -- investigated claims against Huckabee .
Five of those times , it officially reprimanded him .
And as only MSNBC among the big national media has reported at an real length , there were lots of other mini-scandals and embarrassments along the way . "
Plus , writing for The Washington Times , Greg Pierce quoted Hillyer as saying , " [ Huckabee ] used public money for family restaurant meals , boat expenses , and other personal uses .
He tried to claim as his own some $ 70,000 of furniture donated to the governor 's mansion .
He repeatedly , and obstinately , against the pleadings even from conservative columnists and editorials , refused to divulge the names of donors to a ' charitable ' organization he set up while lieutenant governor -- an outfit whose main charitable purpose seemed to be to pay Huckabee to make speeches .
Then , as a kicker , he misreported the income itself from the suspicious ' charity . ' "
Mike Huckabee 's beliefs and actions even border on the bizarre .
According to David Keene , Chairman of the American Conservative Union , " GOP presidential wannabe Mike Huckabee suggested that as president he would , for the good of the people , support a federal anti-smoking law .
You see , as governor , Huckabee supported such laws because , well , he does n't like smoking and does n't think folks should indulge in so heath - threatening an activity .
If he could move on up to the presidency , he would continue his abolitionist crusade at the national level without giving much , if any , thought to the question of whether the Constitution or anything else would legitimize a federal ban on smoking . "
I have yet one more word of warning for those evangelicals supporting Huckabee because he is pro-life : Mike Huckabee will most definitely support Rudy Giuliani should Giuliani obtain the Republican nomination .
Count on it .
I ask you , how could a committed " pro-life " conservative support a pro-abortion , pro-gay rights , pro-gun control liberal such as Rudy Giuliani ?
He could n't .
At the end of the day , however , there is absolutely no question that Huckabee will support Giuliani ( or any other pro-abortion Republican ) , because , when all is said and done , Huckabee and his fellow big - government Republicans have no real commitment to the life issue or to any other conservative principle .
Let 's say it plainly : Mike Huckabee is just another big - government , establishment politician who will do nothing to stem the tide of socialism or fascism ( pick your poison ) emanating from Washington , D.C. , these days .
Dear Christian friend , do n't be duped by Mike Huckabee .

U.S. Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola has decided to hold out the contempt - of - court citation in order to ensure that White House personnel save backups of electronic messages that may have been deleted .
Traces of all keystroke activities and electronic communiqués remain on respective computer hard - drives unless and until the hard - drive is replaced or otherwise rendered inoperable .
I found the follow - up story over at MSNBC.com :
Justice Department lawyers offered to have the government file a sworn declaration stating that the White House Office of Administration is safeguarding all backup materials .
" Unlike a court order , a declaration is not punishable by contempt , " the magistrate wrote .
" In other words , without such an order , destruction of the backup media would be without consequences . "
Whether to issue the order is up to U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy .
The Bush administration has 10 days to say why Kennedy should not order preservation of electronic communications by White House officials and aides .
Kennedy had referred the issue to the magistrate for a recommendation .
Facciola ’s report to the judge stems from a controversy dating back nearly two years over missing White House e-mails .
An ethics advocacy group says the White House has deleted millions of e-mails and the private organization is suing the Executive Office of the President in an attempt to force the government to reconstruct any lost messages from backup tapes .
The group is CREW , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , an intrepid group of democracy advocates who ’ve managed to maintain a significant presence in D.C. as the proverbial thorn in the Bush regime ’s institutional derriere .
The wielder of that raspy thorn is none other than Executive Director of CREW , Melanie Sloan .
From the CREW website :
Melanie Sloan serves as CREW 's Executive Director .
Prior to starting CREW , she served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the District of Columbia where , from 1998 - 2003 , she successfully tried cases before dozens of judges and juries .
Before becoming a prosecutor , Ms. Sloan served as Minority Counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee , working for Ranking Member John Conyers ( D - MI ) and specializing in criminal justice issues .
Ms. Sloan and CREW are fierce advocates for good democratic government and the rule of law and Constitution , and they deserve the respect and gratitude of all Americans for their indefatigable advocacy against the elements of tyranny within the Bush regime on a day - to - day basis .
They hold the front lines so We the People are still afforded at least a semblance of civil liberties in an era of retrogression not seen in America for a century or more .
Magistrate Facciola and other likeminded judges , and brave organizations like CREW and others , have quietly and legally waged all - out war against those powers - that - be that continue to tear down the foundation of our legal system every single day .
Through our rants and diatribes , we bloggers often lament about the reticence of the populace to do something ; anything ; to speak out vociferously against the injustices perpetrated against us by the Bush regime .
We ask ourselves where are the statesmen ; the protectors of democracy ?
Ms. Sloan and her CREW are some of those protectors .
Back to the article :
The group , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , says it has been unable to get assurances from the White House that all backup tapes will be preserved .
Nor is it clear whether some backup tapes have already been destroyed , or recycled , resulting in taping over messages that were already there .
The Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records
Act require that all e-mails be saved .
White House seeks declaration over order .
In a hearing before Facciola on Wednesday , the Justice Department argued strenuously against the course of action the magistrate ended up taking .
Facciola proposed a broadly worded order directing the Executive Office of the President to preserve copies of e-mails " presently in their possession or under their custody or control . "
Judge Facciola also deserves props and respect .
In this day and age , the judicial system is sorely lacking of constitutionalists .
Of course , I ’m really talking about the genuine variety of which there seems to be a shortage , and not the Rudi Giuliani preferred bizarre world " strict constructionists " which is really conservative code for executive branch enablers , and those judges who would gladly tear " privacy issues " clear out of the U.S. Constitution .
This all started back in early 2006 when Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald raised the possibility that communication records he sought in the CIA leak investigation involving the outing of ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame ’s name could be missing because of an email archiving " problem " at the White House .
In reality , the only problem occurred when Fitzgerald demanded the communications from the White House .
Amid the controversy over the firing of U.S. attorneys earlier this year , the issue of the emails once again took center stage , the same RNC servers facilitating those communications as did the emails and text messages concerning the Plame outing .
According to case fillings , an indeterminate number of emails were lost by the White House .
Ms. Sloan , obviously satisfied by Judge Facciola ’s ruling , commented that the judge :
" ... is not leaving them any wiggle room .
He would require them to preserve copies of e-mails no matter how they are kept — on backup tapes , DVDs , disks , in whatever form , and prohibit them from keeping them in some way that makes it difficult to use them . "
White House spokesman Tony Fratto declined to comment .
Remember , no data is ever completely gone from a computer hard - drive .
It can be encrypted , it can be " wiped " many times , but those methods just make it more difficult for techs and geeks to retrieve it .
But , not impossible ; data never really disappears beyond saving .
Unless the hard - drives containing all the data from the emails in question were utterly destroyed beyond salvaging , those emails remain .
Please , show Melanie Sloan some appreciation by contacting her ; thanking her and the whole CREW organization .
Please Donate if you can .
There are statesmen and women left in America .
We must support them at every opportunity .
SO , have you been nice to a lawyer today ?
( we 're gonna need 'em )
Peace
It is absolutely flabbergasting to me that our world will be soon commemorating the 5th year since George Bush announced that the US had commenced “ Shock and Awe ” against Iraq .
Millions of people marched against the impending invasion all over the world on February 15th , 2003 in one of the most touching and amazing show of solidarity against global aggression ever seen .
Since then , the pro-peace / anti-war demonstrations have been mostly disjointed with not so much solidarity .
I left the peace movement in May of this year partially in frustration over this lack of unity .
At the time I was in despair over the fact that the movement had been unable to stop anything because of the egos and the infighting .
Since then , the usurpation of our liberties and the killing of our children and the Iraqi people has just grown worse .
The movement was unable to stop a funding bill or be united in demanding accountability for the war criminals that have been instrumental in destroying three countries , ours included .
Now after nearly 5 years of the illegal occupation of Iraq and over 5 years of the immoral occupation of Afghanistan , we all know , even those who watch the propaganda news networks and are in denial , that this war is not only gone horribly wrong from day one , but is a sham based on deceit .
Not only has our foreign policy suffered profoundly under BushCo and Congress .
Inc , but the foreign war expenditures without a commensurate raise in revenue has driven our country deeply into a quagmire of debt .
Our trade deficit is the largest it has ever been and 54,000 homes went into foreclosure in October .
Gas is hovering around the $ 4.00 a gallon mark in the vicinity of San Francisco and is only going to go up .
The degradation of our environment is becoming catastrophic while closeted , deviate Republican lawmakers are worried about people of the same sex having intimate relations and Democrats are too busy trying to act like Republicans while pretending to be Democrats .
It is up to us — We the People .
Our country is rapidly slipping into a corporate - militaristic fascism and the peace / anti-war movement is worried about personalities and who gets a bigger piece of the pie — and I am not sure what kind of pie it is .
The only thing I know about this work is that it is very difficult and requires a lot of sacrifice and commitment without resulting in much monetary reward .
The rewards of true and lasting peace with an overthrow of the pigs of war who think they are globally in charge is our reward and seeing a better world for all the worlds ’ children and grandchildren is what we should be striving for .
This is why I am calling for The Dave Cline / MLK , Jr. Memorial Peace Summit in January ( 18 - 20 ) to bring all of the various groups together so we can strategize and brainstorm more effective ways of challenging war and injustices .
We not only need to come together in a Year Five Committee to come up with effective strategies to mourn the coming Sixth Year of a mistake that should have never happened with the loss of life counted past one - million , but we need to check our egos at the door and bring a healthy longing for the unity that can finally bring the peace that will bring health and prosperity to our country and the world .
Stomping on Their Children 's Dreams
One painful irony of the Obama - Clinton showdown is that it could end up with middle - aged women – who are determined to elect the first female president – stomping on the dreams of their own children , who have shaken off years of political apathy to rally behind Barack Obama .

What makes this dilemma particularly poignant is that many of these Hillary Clinton supporters themselves experienced the stomping on their dreams four decades ago in the pivotal election of 1968 .
That presidential campaign took place before the backdrop of the Vietnam War , with half a million U.S. soldiers committed to the bloody conflict and with millions of young people across the United States protesting to stop the war .
Hoping to redirect the country through the electoral process , many anti-war students joined the campaign of Sen.
Eugene McCarthy , who was making a long - shot bid to challenge President Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic nomination .
The anti-war cause was further galvanized by the stunning
Tet offensive , which began on Jan. 31 , 1968 , as Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops launched ambitious – and even reckless – attacks across the length of South Vietnam , puncturing the Johnson administration 's optimistic war rhetoric .
Then , on March 12 , 1968 , McCarthy shocked the incumbent president by closing to within seven percentage points in the first - in - the - nation New Hampshire primary .
Four days later , Sen. Robert F. Kennedy jumped into the race , earning criticism from some McCarthy activists as “ a Bobby come lately . ”
Kennedy ’s entrance , however , was the political death knell for Johnson .
On March 31 , faced with a growing insurrection within his own party and a growing casualty list from Vietnam , Johnson withdrew from the campaign to dedicate his remaining time in office to bringing the war to an end .
In those heady days of early spring 1968 , everything seemed possible .
Young Americans thought their enthusiasm and idealism could change the world .
Dark Days
However , those hopes were short - lived .
On April 4 , 1968 , civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a rifle shot to his throat .
Robert Kennedy learned of King ’s death just before he was to address a campaign rally in Indianapolis .
“ I have some very sad news for all of you , and I think sad news for all of our fellow citizens , and people who love peace all over the world , and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis , Tennessee , ” Kennedy told the shocked crowd .
“ In this difficult day , in this difficult time for the United States , it 's perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in .
For those of you who are black – considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible – you can be filled with bitterness , and with hatred , and a desire for revenge .
“ We can move in that direction as a country , in greater polarization – black people amongst blacks , and white amongst whites , filled with hatred toward one another .
Or we can make an effort , as Martin Luther King did , to understand and to comprehend , and replace that violence , that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land , with an effort to understand , compassion and love .
“ For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act , against all white people , I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling .
I had a member of my family killed , but he was killed by a white man .
“ But we have to make an effort in the United States , we have to make an effort to understand , to get beyond these rather difficult times . ”
Kennedy continued : “ My favorite poet was Aeschylus .
He once wrote : ‘ Even in our sleep , pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart , until , in our own despair , against our will , comes wisdom through the awful grace of God . ’
“ What we need in the United States is not division ; what we need in the United States is not hatred ; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness , but is love and wisdom , and compassion toward one another , and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country , whether they be white or whether they be black .
“ So I ask you tonight to return home , to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King , … but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country , which all of us love – a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke . …
“ The vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together , want to improve the quality of our life , and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land .
Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago : to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world . ”
Despite Kennedy ’s elegant appeal , race riots broke out in cities across America .
Divisions , distrust and hatreds deepened .
Fading Hope
Then , on June 5 , 1968 , as Kennedy appeared to be headed for the Democratic nomination having just won the California primary , he , too , was killed by an assassin ’s bullet .
The political vacuum that followed Kennedy ’s death turned the Democratic convention in Chicago in late August into a violent free - for - all , with hard - line Mayor Richard Daley unleashing his security and police forces inside and outside the convention hall , beating up young demonstrators outside and roughing up delegates and journalists inside .
Behind Daley ’s iron fist , the Democratic establishment controlled the convention , which handed the presidential nomination to Vice President Hubert Humphrey .
Suddenly , the anti-war youth were looking at a November match - up between two representatives of the old guard , Humphrey and Republican Richard Nixon , with the likelihood that the Vietnam War would continue no matter who won .
However , 1968 had one more cynical episode to add to its dark history , albeit one that would be accomplished out of sight and not pierce the public ’s consciousness for decades to come .
As the days to the November election counted down , President Johnson mounted a last - ditch effort to achieve a Vietnam peace deal with North Vietnam and the Vietcong through negotiations in Paris .
Besides starting to bring U.S. troops home , the deal also might have given Humphrey the boost he needed to edge out Nixon .
According to what is now an extensive body of evidence , the Nixon campaign countered by dispatching Anna Chennault , an anti-communist Chinese leader , to carry messages to the South Vietnamese government of Nguyen van Thieu .
Chennault ’s messages advised
Thieu that a Nixon presidency would give him a more favorable result than he would get from Johnson .
Journalist Seymour Hersh described the initiative sketchily in his biography of Henry Kissinger , The Price of Power .
Hersh reported that U.S. intelligence “ agencies had caught on that Chennault was the go - between between Nixon and his people and President Thieu in Saigon . …
The idea was to bring things to a stop in Paris and prevent any show of progress . ”
In her own autobiography , The Education of Anna , Chennault acknowledged that she was the courier .
She quoted Nixon aide John Mitchell as calling her a few days before the 1968 election and telling her : “ I ’m speaking on behalf of Mr. Nixon .
It ’s very important that our Vietnamese friends understand our Republican position and I hope you made that clear to them . ”
Reporter Daniel Schorr added fresh details in The Washington Post ’s Outlook section on May 28 , 1995 .
Schorr cited decoded cables that U.S. intelligence had intercepted from the South Vietnamese embassy in Washington .
On Oct. 23 , 1968 , Ambassador Bui Dhien cabled Saigon with the message that “ many Republican friends have contacted me and encouraged me to stand firm . ”
On Oct. 27 , he wrote , “ The longer the present situation continues , the more favorable for us . … I am regularly in touch with the Nixon entourage . ”
On Nov. 2 , Thieu withdrew from his tentative agreement to sit down with the Vietcong at the Paris peace talks , destroying Johnson ’s last hope for a settlement .
Though Johnson and his top advisers knew of Nixon ’s gambit , they kept it secret .
Anthony Summers ’s 2000 book ,
The Arrogance of Power , provides the fullest account of the Chennault initiative , including the debate within Democratic circles about what to do with the evidence .
Both Johnson and Humphrey believed the information – if released to the public – could assure Nixon ’s defeat .
“ In the end , though , Johnson ’s advisers decided it was too late and too potentially damaging to U.S. interests to uncover what had been going on , ” Summers wrote .
“ If Nixon should emerge as the victor , what would the Chennault outrage do to his viability as an incoming president ?
And what effect would it have on American opinion about the war ? ”
Summers quoted Johnson ’s assistant Harry McPherson , who said , “ You could n’t surface it .
The country would be in terrible trouble . ”
Late Surge
As it turned out – even without disclosure of Nixon ’s apparent treachery – a late surge brought Humphrey to the edge of victory .
Nixon hung on to win by only about 500,000 votes , or less than one percent of ballots cast .
Johnson and Humphrey went into retirement keeping their silence .
The direct U.S. role in the Vietnam War would continue for more than four years during which American casualty lists swelled by an additional 20,763 dead and 111,230 wounded .
Meanwhile , the bitterness over the war deeply divided the country , in many cases turning children against their parents .
Though the adults who grew up in the Depression and won World War II are often called the Greatest Generation , many of them let down their children during the Vietnam War , as some 58,000 Americans died in a poorly conceived conflict that caused long - term damage to the United States .
It was left to the young adults of that difficult time to grapple with the unusual challenges of the Vietnam War .
Should they serve in a war that many of them considered immoral ?
Or should they oppose their own government – and often their own parents – in resisting the war ?
Through both violent tragedy and political intrigue , Election 1968 had been transformed from a hopeful opportunity to change the country into an ugly case study of how easy it is to snuff out idealism and decency .
In many ways , Election 1968 charted the course that the United States would follow for most of the next four decades .
On one side , there would be aggressive , win - at - all - costs Republicans ; on the other side , timid , do n’t - get - too - rowdy Democrats .
Not surprisingly , the youthful idealism of the 1960s devolved into world - weary cynicism that would be passed down like some bitter legacy from the Baby Boomers to their children :
You ca n’t really expect to beat the Man .
You need to just look out for No. 1 . The Obama Challenge
By and large , political apathy among the youth held sway – at least until Campaign 2008 when a new generation was caught up in the inspirational message of Barack Obama .
I first encountered the Obama phenomenon when I visited my youngest son , Jeff , at Savannah College of Art and Design in spring 2007 .
At an arts festival where a park was set aside for students to do chalk drawings on the sidewalks , the only drawings of an American politician were of Obama .
The youth movement for Obama – this new children ’s crusade – has influenced some prominent mothers to endorse the 46 - year - old African - American senator from Illinois .
Caroline Kennedy , the daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy , said it was her three children who convinced her to come out publicly for Obama .
“ I am happy that two of my own children are here with me , ” she said at American University in Washington on Jan. 28 , “ because they were the first people who made me realize that Barack Obama is the president we need .
He is already inspiring all Americans , young and old , to believe in ourselves , tying that belief to our highest ideals – ideals of hope , justice , opportunity and peace – and urging us to imagine that together we can do great things . ”
But other mothers – especially white women over 50 who have been targeted as a core constituency by Hillary Clinton ’s campaign – are making another judgment .
They believe it is time for a woman to be president and they do n’t see another likely female contender on the horizon .
So Sen. Clinton it is .
During the early primaries , these white middle - aged women have turned out in large numbers to support Clinton , handing her a crucial early victory in New Hampshire and serving as a bulwark for her campaign in several other states , including Massachusetts and California .
They may prove to be the difference in other crucial states ahead , such as Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Yet , if they are successful , they may have to face a sad and unintended consequence of a Hillary Clinton nomination , especially if she wins in a bruising convention battle in Denver .
These women may have to watch the young enthusiastic Obama supporters – sometimes their own children – suffer the kind of painful disillusionment that an earlier generation of idealistic young Americans went through in 1968 .

I wanted to let you know that I 've enjoyed your dialog with Sam Harris .
I have appreciated the civility , the respect , and the acceptance of ambiguity in both of your positions .
I was raised in a religious household , but gradually became aware that I needed more evidence for the existence of a god than I was finding .
There was no falling - out with God , no anger , no sense of betrayal or loss .
There was simply the realization that we are in fact on our own .
Having said that , I still believe that a familiarity with religion is important to everyone .
I 'm deeply appreciative of the teachings of Jesus , infofar as we can attribute them .
I just do n't believe in magic .
But atheism is not for the faint of heart , and I do n't recommend it for everyone .
One must find a way to act ethically without believing in divine supervision .
One must give meaning to a life that may have none -- and must extend that meaning to others .
One must maintain a capacity for awe and wonder .
And one must deeply , deeply appreciate the chain of events that have led to beings that can contemplate what it all may mean .
And finally , one must be able to live in a world in which the majority consider atheists to be bad people .
But again , thanks for the dialog .
I appreciate a religious person who is courageous enough to listen .
The actions of fundamentalists ( Christianists as you properly call them ) belies a deep fear of engaging the world .
God or no God , that 's no way to live a life .
WMR has learned from U.S. and foreign intelligence sources that the B - 52 transporting six stealth AGM - 129 Advanced Cruise Missiles , each armed with a W - 80 - 1 nuclear warhead , on August 30 , were destined for the Middle East via Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana .
However , elements of the Air Force , supported by U.S. intelligence agency personnel , successfully revealed the ultimate destination of the nuclear weapons and the mission was aborted due to internal opposition within the Air Force and U.S. Intelligence Community .
Yesterday , the Washington Post attempted to explain away the fact that America 's nuclear command and control system broke down in an unprecedented manner by reporting that it was the result of " security failures at multiple levels . "
It is now apparent that the command and control breakdown , reported as a BENT SPEAR incident to the Secretary of Defense and White House , was not the result of a command and control chain - of - command " failures " but the result of a revolt and push back by various echelons within the Air Force and intelligence agencies against a planned U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and conventional weapons .
The Washington Post story on BENT SPEAR may have actually been an effort in damage control by the Bush administration .
WMR has been informed by a knowledgeable source that one of the six nuclear - armed cruise missiles was , and may still be , unaccounted for .
In that case , the nuclear reporting incident would have gone far beyond BENT SPEAR to a National Command Authority alert known as EMPTY QUIVER , with the special classification of PINNACLE .
Just as this report was being prepared , Newsweek reported that Vice President Dick Cheney 's recently - departed Middle East adviser , David Wurmser , told a small group of advisers some months ago that Cheney had considered asking Israel to launch a missile attack on the Iranian nuclear site at Natanz .
Cheney reasoned that after an Iranian retaliatory strike , the United States would have ample reasons to launch its own massive attack on Iran .
However , plans for Israel to attack Iran directly were altered to an Israeli attack on a supposed Syrian - Iranian - North Korean nuclear installation in northern Syria .
WMR has learned that a U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and conventional weapons was scheduled to coincide with Israel 's September 6 air attack on a reputed Syrian nuclear facility in Dayr az - Zwar , near the village of Tal Abyad , in northern Syria , near the Turkish border .
Israel 's attack , code named OPERATION ORCHARD , was to provide a reason for the U.S. to strike Iran .
The neo -conservative propaganda onslaught was to cite the cooperation of the George Bush 's three remaining " Axis of Evil " states -- Syria , Iran , and North Korea -- to justify a sustained Israeli attack on Syria and a massive U.S. military attack on Iran .
WMR has learned from military sources on both sides of the Atlantic that there was a definite connection between Israel 's OPERATION ORCHARD and BENT SPEAR involving the B - 52 that flew the six nuclear - armed cruise missiles from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale .
There is also a connection between these two events as the Pentagon 's highly - classified PROJECT CHECKMATE , a compartmented U.S. Air Force program that has been working on an attack plan for Iran since June 2007 , around the same time that Cheney was working on the joint Israeli - U.S. attack scenario on Iran .
PROJECT CHECKMATE was leaked in an article by military analyst Eric Margolis in the Rupert Murdoch - owned newspaper , the Times of London , is a program that involves over two dozen Air Force officers and is headed by Brig .
Gen. Lawrence Stutzriem and his chief civilian adviser , Dr. Lani Kass , a former Israeli military intelligence officer who , astoundingly , is now involved in planning a joint U.S. - Israeli massive military attack on Iran that involves a " decapitating " blow on Iran by hitting between three to four thousand targets in the country .
Stutzriem and Kass report directly to the Air Force Chief of Staff , General Michael Moseley , who has also been charged with preparing a report on the B - 52 / nuclear weapons incident .
Kass ' area of speciality is cyber - warfare , which includes ensuring " information blockades , " such as that imposed by the Israeli government on the Israeli media regarding the Syrian air attack on the alleged Syrian " nuclear installation . "
British intelligence sources have reported that the Israeli attack on Syria was a " true flag " attack originally designed to foreshadow a U.S. attack on Iran .
After the U.S. Air Force push back against transporting the six cruise nuclear - armed AGM - 129s to the Middle East , Israel went ahead with its attack on Syria in order to help ratchet up tensions between Washington on one side and Damascus , Tehran , and Pyongyang on the other .
The other part of CHECKMATE 's brief is to ensure that a media " perception management " is waged against Syria , Iran , and North Korea .
This involves articles such as that which appeared with Joby Warrick 's and Walter Pincus ' bylines in yesterdays Washington Post .
The article , titled " The Saga of a Bent Spear , " quotes a number of seasoned Air Force nuclear weapons experts as saying that such an incident is unprecedented in the history of the Air Force .
For example , Retired Air Force General Eugene Habiger , the former chief of the U.S. Strategic Command , said he has been in the " nuclear business " since 1966 and has never been aware of an incident " more disturbing . "
Command and control breakdowns involving U.S. nuclear weapons are unprecedented , except for that fact that the U.S. military is now waging an internal war against neo-cons who are embedded in the U.S. government and military chain of command who are intent on using nuclear weapons in a pre-emptive war with Iran .
CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD would have provided the cover for a pre-emptive U.S. and Israeli attack on Iran had it not been for BENT SPEAR involving the B - 52 .
In on the plan to launch a pre-emptive attack on Iran involving nuclear weapons were , according to our sources , Cheney , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley ; members of the CHECKMATE team at the Pentagon , who have close connections to Israeli intelligence and pro-Israeli think tanks in Washington , including the Hudson Institute ; British Foreign Secretary David Miliband , a political adviser to Tony Blair prior to becoming a Member of Parliament ; Israeli political leaders like Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu ; and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , who did his part last week to ratchet up tensions with Iran by suggesting that war with Iran was a probability .
Kouchner retracted his statement after the U.S. plans for Iran were delayed .
Although the Air Force tried to keep the B - 52 nuclear incident from the media , anonymous Air Force personnel leaked the story to Military Times on September 5 , the day before the Israelis attacked the alleged nuclear installation in Syria and the day planned for the simultaneous U.S. attack on Iran .
The leaking of classified information on U.S. nuclear weapons disposition or movement to the media , is , itself , unprecedented .
Air Force regulations require the sending of classified BEELINE reports to higher Air Force authorities on the disclosure of classified Air Force information to the media .
In another highly unusual move , Defense Secretary Robert Gates has asked an outside inquiry board to look into BENT SPEAR , even before the Air Force has completed its own investigation , a virtual vote of no confidence in the official investigation being conducted by Major General Douglas Raaberg , chief of air and space operations at the Air Combat Command .
Gates asked former Air Force Chief of Staff , retired General Larry Welch , to lead a Defense Science Board task force that will also look into the BENT SPEAR incident .
The official Air Force investigation has reportedly been delayed for unknown reasons .
Welch is President and CEO of the Institute for Defense Analysis ( IDA ) , a federally - funded research contractor that operates three research centers , including one for Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President and another for the National Security Agency .
One of the board members of IDA is Dr. Suzanne H. Woolsey of the Paladin Capital Group and wife of former CIA director and arch - neocon James Woolsey .
WMR has learned that neither the upper echelons of the State Department nor the British Foreign Office were privy to OPERATION ORCHARD , although Hadley briefed President Bush on Israeli spy satellite intelligence that showed the Syrian installation was a joint nuclear facility built with North Korean and Iranian assistance .
However , it is puzzling why Hadley would rely on Israeli imagery intelligence ( IMINT ) from its OFEK ( Horizon ) 7 satellite when considering that U.S. IMINT satellites have greater capabilities .

NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - President Mwai Kibaki ’s government accused rival Raila Odinga ’s party of unleashing “ genocide ” in Kenya on Wednesday as the death toll from tribal violence over a disputed election passed 300 .
Opposition supporters carry wooden sticks as houses and shops burn in Nairobi January 3 , 2008 .

“ It is becoming clear that these well - organized acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing were well planned , financed and rehearsed by Orange Democratic Movement leaders prior to the general elections , ” said the statement read by Lands Minister Kivutha Kibwana on behalf of his colleagues .
Odinga ’s party shot back that the government was also “ bordering on genocide ” by ordering police to shoot protesters enraged by Kibaki ’s victory in the December 27 polls that international observers said fell short of democratic standards .
Both sides alleged massive rigging .
Kenya is an important ally of the West in its counter - terrorism efforts , takes growing money flows from China , and is used to being the peacemaker in African hot - spots like Somalia and Sudan rather than the problem .
Kibaki ’s Kikuyu tribe was targeted in the initial violence , but revenge killings by Kikuyus are on the rise in mayhem that rights groups say has been exacerbated by a police crackdown on rioting and looting .
Apparently offering an olive branch to the ODM , which draws most of its support from western Kenya ’s Luo tribe , Kibaki invited all members of the new opposition - dominated parliament to a meeting at State House in Nairobi .
But no opposition MPs attended as Odinga demanded outside mediation : “ We cannot dialogue with a thief , ” he told reporters .
“ We are not interested in talking with Kibaki without international mediation . ”
A statement by Kibaki ’s office deplored the violence and vowed to secure roads “ so essential goods and services can reach people in the areas and other countries in the region ” .
CREDIT RATING HIT
Ghanaian President and African Union Chairman John Kufuor has been urged by the West to mediate and was waiting to talk to Kibaki before deciding whether to go himself or send a team .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Kufuor would fly to meet Kibaki and Odinga on Thursday .
Late on Wednesday , Finance Minister Amos Kimunya told BBC Radio there was no need for Ghana ’s president to come .
Odinga plans a mass rally on Thursday that the government has banned on security grounds .
The use of the word genocide will horrify Kenyans , used to being viewed by the world as a stable democracy , an investment and tourist destination and oasis of peace in a volatile region .
The turmoil delayed trading in the shilling currency , which then dropped to a six - week low .
Stocks also fell and tea and coffee auctions were postponed .
Standard & Poor ’s cut Kenya ’s long - term local currency credit rating to ‘ B + ’ from ‘ BB -’ and said if the violence was not resolved , the foreign currency credit rating could be lowered as well .
It put both the long - term foreign and local currency ratings on “ CreditWatch with negative implications ” .
Kenya ’s long - term foreign - currency rating from S&P is B + and its long - term issuer default rating from Fitch Ratings is B+. Moody ’s Investors Service does not rate the country .
“ MORE THAN 300 DEAD ”
More than 300 people have died in an explosion of tribal violence since Kibaki ’s disputed re-election on Sunday .
British Foreign Minister David Miliband and Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice called for an end to violence and “ an intensive political and legal process ” to end the crisis .
As young men armed with machetes manned roadblocks in rural areas , a trickle of office workers in the capital Nairobi made it through police cordons to begin the new working year .
A local and an international rights group gave a death toll of “ more than 300 ” and accused Kenyan security forces of having “ bloodily repressed ” protests by opposition supporters .
“ As a reaction , some protesters are responsible for the assassination of Kikuyus , ” added the Kenya Human Rights Commission and the International Federation for Human Rights .
On Tuesday , about 30 Kikuyus died when a mob set fire to the church where they had taken sanctuary in the western town of Eldoret .
It was one the worst outbursts of violence that has uprooted nearly 100,000 Kenyans , some fleeing to Uganda .
There were growing examples on Wednesday of revenge killings by Kikuyu militants .
In Naivasha town in the Rift Valley , scores of people were injured in retaliation for the church killings .
The Kikuyu have dominated political and business life in east Africa ’s biggest and fastest - growing economy since independence from Britain in 1963 .
Adding to the chaos , Kenya ’s electoral commission head Samuel Kivuitu said : “ I do not know ” when asked if Kibaki won .
Kivuitu pronounced Kibaki the victor on Sunday , and his remark stunned Kenya and cast further doubt on the result .
GUANGZHOU - HONG KONG
It is estimated that 500,000 people are stranded in the southern city of Guangzhou as they wait for train services to resume .
Paul Surtees was among the crowds on Monday .
The railway stations in Guangzhou are a scene of horror , with countless thousands of desperate and freezing people besieging them .
Conditions are freezing cold in Guangzhou as people wait for trains
Guangzhou is a place of vast numbers of migrant workers .
They saved up for the whole year to afford a third - class ticket to their home province for the holiday and they can't get anywhere near the station .
As you approach Guangzhou 's main station , people are standing shoulder - to - shoulder trying to get into the station .
The plastic marquees put up outside by authorities do little to keep people warm in freezing conditions .
Those people inside the station dare n't leave for fear of losing their chance to travel .
But trains are n't going .
So people are literally living there and have been for days .
Whole families have camped out there setting out newspapers on the floor and settling down .
The huge expanse of the station concourse is a sea of bodies .
There are only a dozen toilets , so people relieve themselves on the station concourse .
I saw human faeces .
The amount of mess is indescribable .
There are n't many customer service people outside the station , only those people dealing with the trains .
They have now brought the police and army in as crowd control
They have set up barricades to control access to the station .
While I was in Guangzhou East station a train did start to let on passengers .
They opened one arm of the barricade and within seconds it was swept away and the soldiers on the floor as a sea of people surged through .
I was lucky to be going in the right direction , from Guangzhou to Hong Kong .
To get into my station I had to speak to an officer of the Chinese army and I was lifted over the barricade .
It 's like something from a war film .
CHANGSHA - ZHUZHOU - CHANGSHA
Sean Clinton has been stuck in Changsha , Hunan province , for days as poor weather has defeated all attempts to travel further than the next town .
We 've been in Changsha for about nine days .
When we got here it was bitterly cold with major power outages in the industrial area .
All the highways were closed because they were iced over and there were many car accidents .
We stayed for four days waiting for the power to return .
Our hotel lost water and heat - so it ran a cable across the street to steal power from another building .
We tried to get to the airport which is normally a 45 minute ride but it took us three hours and on the way we were in a car accident .
We were in the airport for more than 15 hours with no planes taking off and no news as to whether we would ever take off .
At the train station we found people had been waiting for four days .
After a six - hour wait on the station a train bound for Guangzhou finally pulled in .
We waited on the train for another six hours and it never moved .
Eventually it went on its way and reached Zhuzhou .
When we got there the phone calls started filtering in saying trains were stuck for days in Guangzhou .
We had no way out so we stayed overnight in a hotel and begged , borrowed , stole our way back to Changsha in a taxi .
So we 're back in Changsha now and just waiting out the cold .
About half the stores do n't have power here but people seem to be going about their daily lives .
We hear an airline might be opening up soon .
Who knows where that will lead ?
DONGUAN - GUANGZHOU - SHENZHEN - HONG KONG
On his way back to Hong Kong , Devon Bovenlander spoke to some of those camping out in Guangzhou .
Thank God I 'm back in Hong Kong .
I got back last night and it was chaos .
In Guangzhou there were people sleeping everywhere - all around the train stations , shopping centres , taxi ranks , bus stations .
They are basically setting up shop wherever they can .
People were sleeping on stairs .
Some have been there for two , three nights already .
Luckily it is not as cold in Guangzhou , Dongguan and Shenzhen as it is in other parts of China .
I talked to some of those camped out and they had been there for a two nights .
They seemed in fairly good spirits although the nights get quite cold .
The riot police were there in case trouble broke out .
The people waiting are the factory workers going home to their local villages .
They have access to food and are just waiting it out .
Editor 's note : CNN's Jeanne Meserve and producer Mike M. Ahlers recently went along with a Transportation Security Administration official on an undercover test of airport screeners .
Here is what they witnessed .
CNN agreed not to disclose the name of the tester .
A mock bomb -- as slim as a wallet -- gets placed in a back support of a TSA tester going undercover as a passenger .
TAMPA , Florida ( CNN ) -- Jason -- that 's the name CNN was asked to call him -- slides a simulated explosive into an elastic back support .
The mock bomb is as slim as a wallet ; its fuse , the size of a cigarette .
He wraps the support around his torso , and the bomb fits comfortably into the small of his back .
It 's hard to tell he 's concealing anything ; harder still when he dons a black T - shirt and a maroon golf shirt .
Then , with CNN 's cameras in tow , Jason heads to Tampa International Airport , where he 'll try to sneak the fake explosive past security screeners .
Jason , a covert tester for the Transportation Security Administration , has been probing airport weaknesses for five years , beginning with big mock bombs before switching to ever smaller devices as the TSA adapts to evolving terrorist threats .
Watch the tester slip past security »
As jobs go , this one comes with its own unique set of satisfactions and tribulations .
Jason wants to succeed at his task -- and he wants to fail .
Success is a measure of his stealth , hewn by 40 years in law enforcement .
But failure is satisfying too , because it means airport screeners are growing more adept at detecting threats .
So Jason -- looking every bit the middle - aged man on an uneventful trip to anywhere -- shows a boarding pass and an ID to a TSA document checker , and he is directed to a checkpoint where , unbeknown to the security officer on site , the real test begins .
He gets through , which in real life would mean a terrorist was headed toward a plane with a bomb .
To be clear , the TSA allowed CNN to see and record this test , and the agency is not concerned with CNN showing it .
The TSA says techniques such as the one used in Tampa are known to terrorists and openly discussed on known terror Web sites .
Even before the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , government agencies deployed " red teams " such as this one to look for holes in airport security .
The tests have resulted in a torrent of reports criticizing the government for failing to staff , train , manage and equip properly the screener work force , which numbers 43,000 .
While test results are classified and rarely leak out , those that have been disclosed typically do n't inspire confidence .
In tests conducted in 2006 and disclosed to USA Today last year , investigators successfully smuggled 75 percent of fake bombs through checkpoints at Los Angeles International Airport , 60 percent through Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport and 20 percent at San Francisco International Airport .
The TSA has disputed some test methodologies and test results .
But instead of running from tests , the agency has embraced the idea that testing has a value that goes beyond measuring the performance of individual screeners .
Tests , the TSA says , can show systemwide security vulnerabilities .
When used frequently -- as was the case with San Francisco in 2006 -- they can heighten screener awareness .
Tests can show areas that need increased attention .
And tests can be used to determine whether terrorist plots uncovered by intelligence agencies or being discussed on terrorist Web sites are lunatic rants , or are plausible .
As a result , the TSA says it believes its work force is the most tested in the federal government , with checkpoint drills of various sophistication occurring in every checkpoint at every airport daily .
Almost an hour before Jason approached the checkpoint , a fellow red team member had gone through the checkpoint .
It 's this member 's job to make sure the test is conducted safely .
Five minutes before the test begins , he uses a cell phone to call Tampa 's federal security director , the airport 's top security official .
" Sir , the reason we 're calling today is to tell you that we will be conducting covert testing at your airport , " the red team leader says .
" But I would ask that you not speak to anyone on your staff to alert them of this test . "
The message is clear : Do n't tell anyone .
Testers say they will scratch a test if they believe anyone has been alerted .
The TSA was embarrassed several years ago when word of one test leaked out , and an internal auditor is investigating other possible leaks .
But in Tampa , everything goes smoothly as Jason steps through the metal detector portal .
The detector alarm goes off , as Jason expects it to , not because of the nonmetallic device strapped to his back but due to his metal knee .
It 's the perfect tool for ensuring he gets to " secondary , " where more extensive searches are conducted .
Soon Jason is in a posture familiar to air travelers .
He is standing , legs apart , with his arms extended .
A screener " wands " him with a hand - held metal detector , and it beeps as it passes his metal knee , his necklace and the rivets on his bluejeans .
The screener then pats him down , running latex - gloved hands over Jason 's legs , arms and torso .
And he pats down Jason 's back , including the lower part where the device is concealed .
But Jason explains away the back support .
He tells the screener that he has a bum back in addition to having a metal knee .
With the patdown over , the screener releases Jason .
He picks up his belongings and walks freely into the airport , the fake bomb still fastened to his back .
TSA officials say the Tampa test demonstrates the type of systemic vulnerability that the agency is working to expose and address .
Screeners have cultural sensitivities toward travelers ' handicaps , and they are sometimes hesitant to perform intrusive searches , officials said .
Terrorists could exploit that reluctance , they said .
The TSA screener could have used other relatively unobtrusive means to check Jason 's back brace .
But he did n't .
After leaving the screening checkpoint , Jason returns with other members of his red team and informs the screener he has failed a test .
A fake bomb has just entered their airport .
The screener appears devastated .
The reaction is common , says Jason , adding that notifying screeners of failed tests can be the toughest part of his job .
On occasions , he says , testers have appeared indifferent .
In those rare instances , Jason says , he gets " nasty , " stressing the importance of the tests .
The stakes are too high to tolerate indifference .
Regardless of their reactions , screeners who fail to detect contraband are " pulled off the line " and retrained before being allowed back .
The test CNN witnessed was conducted by the TSA 's Office of Inspection , which the agency calls the most sophisticated of its covert tests .
But there are others .
For starters , every TSA X - ray machine has a Threat Image Projection system , which digitally inserts images of guns , knives and bombs into the X - rays of luggage , to keep screeners alert .
This system library contains " tens of thousands " of images , said TSA spokesman Christopher White .
If screeners observe a suspicious object , they can check with the simple click of a computer mouse .
If they detect a threat object , the computer congratulates them .
Successes and failures are recorded for use in a screener 's performance evaluation and are factors in determining pay .
Some 69,929 threat image tests are conducted on an average day , or more than 25 million tests per year .
An array of other tests also are conducted to assess screeners , including the red team ones .
The TSA declines to give test results , which are classified .
But it says the agency is getting better at finding bomb parts .
And test scores wo n't demonstrate that , it says , because as success rates improve , tests are made more difficult .
" We 're designing our tests not so much to indicate or to show or highlight performance , " says Dave Holmes , who runs the Office of Inspection , " but we 're highlighting where the vulnerabilities exist . "
The elaborate test at the Tampa airport , Holmes says , is not to identify individuals performing below par .
It 's intended to provide data that , together with other information , will reveal the whole system 's performance .
Back at the Tampa checkpoint , a member of Jason 's red team is holding court with a group of screeners , including the one who missed the fake bomb .
" Today ... was a scrimmage , " the red team leader says .
" Every day , every time a passenger is coming through -- that is game day . "

By now everybody acknowledges that Barack Obama is good at making speeches that inspire people with hope of a better America .
" Yes We Can ! " and all that .
But one of the recurrent raps against Obama is that he 's naive , that he does n't understand the realities of power , that he has his head in the clouds and does n't understand that there are powers that must be overcome in order to accomplish the kinds of transformation of which he speaks .
If we had only these inspirational speeches to judge by , we might reasonably suspect that possibility .
But there is some other evidence available to us .
And with this evidence in hand , it ceases to be reasonable to imagine Obama to be some naive fool ignorant of how power works in the world .
That evidence comes from his book DREAMS FROM MY FATHER , a book published in 1995 , when Obama was 33 years old and before he was involved in electoral politics .
( Of him , Obama says : )
So it was to Lolo that I turned for guidance and instruction ... [ H ] is knowledge of the world seemed inexhaustible ... He knew more elusive things , ways of managing the emotions I felt , ways to explain fate 's constant mysteries .
" Have you ever seen a man killed ? " I asked him .
He glanced down , surprised by the question .
" Have you ? " I asked again .
" Yes , " he said .
" Was it bloody ? "
" Yes "

After pandering to Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert ’s right - wing government last week , US president George W. Bush carried the Israeli / neoconservative campaign against Iran to Arab countries .
Sounding as authentic as the " Filipino Monkey , " Bush told the Arab countries that " Iran is the world ’s leading state sponsor of terror , " and that " Iran ’s actions threaten the security of nations everywhere . "
To no effect .
Every country in the world , except America , knows by now that the US is the world ’s leading state sponsor of terror and that the neoconservative drive for US hegemony over the world threatens the security of nations everywhere .
But before we get into this , let ’s first see what Bush means by " terrorist " and Iran ’s sponsorship of terrorism .
Bush considers
Iran to be the leading state sponsor of terror , because Iran is believed to fund Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian ghetto .
Hezbollah and Hamas are two organizations that exist because of Israeli aggression against Palestine and Lebanon .
The two organizations are branded " terrorist " because they resist Israel ’s theft of Palestine and Israel ’s designs on southern Lebanon .
Both organizations are resistance organizations .
They resist Israel ’s territorial expansion and this makes them " terrorist . "
They are terrorists because they do n’t receive billions in US military aid and cannot put armies in the field with tanks , fighter jets and helicopter gunships , backed up by US spy satellites and Israel ’s nuclear weapons  although Hezbollah , a small militia , has twice defeated the Israeli army .
However , Palestine is so thoroughly under the Israeli heel that Hamas can resist only with suicide bombers and obsolete rockets .
It is dishonest to damn the terrorist response but not the policies that provoke the response .
The US is at war in Iraq , because the neoconservatives want to rid Israel of the Muslim governments 
Iraq , Iran and Syria  that are not American surrogates and , therefore , are willing to fund Palestinian and Lebanese resistance to Israeli aggression .
Israel , protected by the US , has disobeyed UN resolutions for four decades and has been methodically squeezing Palestinians out of Palestine .
Americans do not think of themselves or of Israel as terrorist states , but the evidence is complete and overwhelming .
Thanks to the power of the Israel Lobby , Americans only know the Israeli side of the story , which is that evil anti-semite Palestinians will not let blameless Israelis live in peace and persist in their unjustified terror attacks on an innocent Israeli state .
The facts differ remarkably from Israel Lobby propaganda .
Israel illegally occupies Palestine .
Israel sends bulldozers into Palestinian villages and knocks down Palestinian houses , occasionally killing an American protester in the process , and uproots Palestinian olive groves .
Israel cuts Palestinian villages off from water , hospitals , farmlands , employment and schools .
Israel builds special roads through Palestine on which only Israelis can travel .
Israel establishes checkpoints everywhere to hinder Palestinian movement to hospitals , schools and from one enclave or ghetto to another .
Many Palestinians die from the inability to get through checkpoints to medical care .
Israel builds illegal settlements on Palestinian lands .
Israeli Zionist " settlers " take it upon themselves to evict Palestinians from their villages and towns in order to convert them into Israeli settlements .
A huge wall has been built to wall off the stolen Palestinian lands from the remaining isolated ghettoes .
Israeli soldiers shoot down Palestinian children in the streets .
So do Israeli Zionist " settlers . "
All of this has been documented so many times by so many organizations that it is pathetic that Americans are so ignorant .
For example , Israeli peace groups such as Gush Shalom or Jeff Halper ’s Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions provide abundant documentation of Israel ’s theft of Palestine and persecution of Palestinians .
Every time the UN passes a resolution condemning Israel for its crimes , the US vetoes it .
The Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees ’ film , The Iron Wall , reveals the enormity of Israel ’s crimes against Palestine .
President Jimmy Carter , Israel ’s friend , tried to bring peace to the Middle East but was frustrated by Israel .
Carter was demonized by the Israel Lobby for calling , truthfully , the situation that Israel has created " apartheid . "
Historians , including Israel ’s finest , such as Ilan Pappe , have documented The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine , the title of Pappe ’s book published in 2006 .
Israelis , such as Uri Avnery , a former member of Israel ’s Knesset , are stronger critics of Israel ’s policies toward Palestine than can be found in America .
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz is more outspoken in its criticism of Israeli policies than any newspaper would dare to be in North America or Europe .
But it is all to no avail in brainwashed America where Israelis wear white hats and Arabs wear black hats .
The ignorance of Americans commits US foreign policy to the service of Israel .
As Uri Avnery wrote recently , a visitor from another planet , attending the recent press conference in Jerusalem , would conclude that Olmert is the leader of the superpower and that Bush is his vassal .
Americans do n’t know what terror is .
To know terror , you have to be a Palestinian , an Iraqi , or an Afghan .
Layla Anwar , an Iraqi Internet blogger , describes what terror is like .
Terror is families attending a wedding being blown to pieces by an American missile or bomb and the survivors being blown to pieces at the funeral of the newlyweds .
Terror is troops breaking down your door in the middle of the night , putting guns to your heads , and carrying off brothers , sons , and husbands with bags over their heads and returning to rape the unprotected women .
Terror is being waterboarded in one of America ’s torture dungeons .
Terror is " when you run from hospital ward to hospital ward , from prison to prison , from militia to militia looking for your loved one only to recognize them from their teeth fillings in some morgue . "
For people targeted by American hegemony , terror is realizing that Americans have no moral conscience .
Terror is the lack of medicines from American embargoes that led to the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children .
When asked by Lesley Stahl if the American policy was worth the children ’s deaths , Madeleine Albright , President Bill Clinton ’s secretary of state , said " we think the price is worth it . "
In the feeble minds of the White House Moron and his immoral supporters , the massive deaths for which America is responsible , including those inflicted by Israel , have nothing to do with Muslim enmity toward America .
Instead , Muslims hate us for our " freedom and democracy , " the real threat to which comes from Bush ’s police state measures and stolen elections .
There is dispute over the number of Iraqis killed or murdered by Bush ’s illegal invasion , a war crime under the Nuremberg standard , but everyone agrees the number is very large .
Many deaths result from American bombing of civilian populations as the Israelis did in Lebanon and do in Gaza .
There is nothing new about these bombings .
President Clinton bombed civilians in Serbia in order to dictate policy to Serbia .
But when Americans and Israelis bomb other peoples , it is not terror .
It is only terror when the US or Israel is attacked in retaliation .
The Israeli assault from the air on Beirut apartment houses is not terror .
But when a Palestinian puts on a suicide belt and blows himself up in an Israeli cafe , that ’s terror .
When Clinton bombs a Serbian passenger train , that ’s not terror , but when a buried explosive takes out an American tank somewhere in Iraq , that ’s terror .
Aggressors always have excuses for their aggression .
Hitler was an expert at this .
So are the US and Israel .
Unfortunately for the world , there ’s little chance for change in America or Israel .
The presidential candidates ( Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich ) who would bring change in Washington , without which there will be no change in Israel , are not in the running for their party ’s nomination .
As John J. Mearsheimer noted on January 12 , the candidates in the running are as much under the thumb of the Israel Lobby as Bush .
The candidates are Bush clones as strongly committed as Bush to hegemony , war , Israel and executive power .
The possible exception is Obama .
If he is an exception , that makes him a threat to the powers that be , and , as we might have witnessed in the NH primary , the Republican - supplied , Republican - programmed Diebold electronic voting machines can easily be rigged to deny him the Democratic nomination .
Hillary will not resist Israel ’s wishes , and her husband ’s presidency bombed at will his demonized victims .
There is no essential difference between the candidates or between the candidates and George W. Bush .
Alabama Governor George Wallace , a surprisingly successful third party candidate for the presidency , said as long ago as 1968 , " There ’s not a dime ’s worth of difference between the Democrat and Republican Parties . "
Today , four decades later , there ’s not a penny ’s worth of difference , not an ounce of difference .
Both parties have revealed themselves to be warmonger police state parties .
The US Constitution has few friends in the capital city .
JACKSONVILLE , North Carolina ( CNN ) --
The remains of an adult and a fetus were found Saturday in a shallow grave in the backyard of the primary suspect in the death of a pregnant Marine , Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown announced .
Investigators search for the body of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach on Saturday .
An arrest warrant has been issued for Cpl. Cesar Armando Laurean in the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach .
He is charged with first - degree murder , although authorities have not positively identified the body as hers .
" This is consistent with what we were looking for : A pregnant lady who is the victim Maria Lauterbach and her unborn child , " Brown said .
The body was charred , and the fetus was in the victim 's abdomen , Brown said , describing the scene in gruesome detail .
The fetus was developed enough that the " little hand was about the size of my thumb .
The little fingers were rolled up , " he said .
" One of the things that will probably stick with me for a long time , and forever , is that little hand , the way those fingers were turned , that had been burned off the arm .
That is bizarre .
That is tragic .
And it 's disgusting . "
Watch Brown describe the scene »
The remains were taken to the Onslow County medical examiner 's office .
They will next be sent to the chief medical examiner in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , for DNA testing and comparison with dental records .

Lauterbach , 20 , disappeared , when she was eight months pregnant , from Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , in mid-December , not long before she was to testify at a military hearing about her rape accusation against Laurean .
Laurean is believed to have left the base at 4 a.m. Friday , and a nationwide manhunt is under way .
Watch authorities search for a grave »
Lauterbach 's relatives believe her pregnancy was the result of the alleged rape , said Lauterbach 's uncle , Peter Steiner , a Kentucky psychiatrist .
Investigators told CNN that Laurean vanished four hours before his wife , Christina , approached Brown with a note from her husband claiming that Lauterbach had committed suicide and he buried the body .
" We believe our suspect has fled the state of North Carolina ; removed himself as far from here as he can get , " Brown said Saturday .
Watch Brown describe the cavity where the body was found »
Brown said Friday that blood spatter evidence was found inside Laurean 's home , even on a ceiling .
There was evidence of " an attempted clean - up , " including an attempt to paint over the blood spatter , he said .
" Evidence now is saying what he 's claiming happened did not happen like he said it happened , " Brown said of Laurean .
Lauterbach 's mother , Mary Lauterbach , reported the young woman as missing from Camp Lejeune on December 19 .
Mary Lauterbach said she had not talked with her for five days .
Watch police face unanswered questions »
Laurean , 21 , of Nevada , is believed to be driving a black Dodge pickup with North Carolina license plate TRR1522 .
Laurean repeatedly refused to meet with investigators , finally telling them that his attorney would n't let him .
The sheriff described him as " dangerous , " especially if cornered .
Military officials said Laurean was not taken into custody after Lauterbach reported the alleged rape because there was information the two carried on " some sort of friendly relationship " after she filed the complaint against him .
" The information ... leads us to believe that she still had some kind of contact " with him , said Paul Ciccarelli , agent in charge of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service at Camp Lejeune , this week .
Because of that , Laurean was n't considered a flight risk , he said .
Steiner disputed that , and said his niece had no relationship with Laurean .
Ciccarelli also said the rape investigation is still active .
See a timeline of the case »
On Friday , authorities questioned Lauterbach 's roommate , Sgt. Daniel Durham , but said he had no apparent ties to her disappearance or death .
Authorities have not released any details from that interview .

“ There ’s still a lot of misinformation out there , ” she added , “ but I think we have taken positive steps toward correcting the record . ”
In the aftermath of the Sept. 16 shootings in Baghdad that Iraqi authorities said left 17 Iraqis dead , the formerly reclusive Mr. Prince has conducted a series of media interviews intended to polish Blackwater ’s tarnished brand .
The company has changed the name of its major operating division from Blackwater USA to Blackwater Worldwide and toned down its warlike logo .
It has sent out a mass e-mail message to workers , suppliers and clients hoping to inspire them to send letters to members of Congress and make other public statements of support .
As reports poured out of Baghdad about the September shootings by several Blackwater guards , the company felt it could not adequately defend itself .
The company operates under confidentiality agreements with the State Department , which employs 845 Blackwater guards to protect its diplomats in Iraq .
But after Mr. Prince testified for more than three hours before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Oct. 2 , the company said it felt free to speak out .

“ It was no picnic to keep our contractual obligations not to talk , ” said one person close to Blackwater , who insisted on not being named .
“ We wrote the book on how not to get good P.R . ”
In the days leading up to the hearing before the oversight panel , which is led by Representative Henry A. Waxman , a liberal California Democrat who has no love for Blackwater , the company hired Burson - Marsteller , a global public relations firm .
Blackwater said it hired the company on a temporary basis to help prepare Mr. Prince for his testimony .
Mark J. Penn , Burson - Marsteller ’s chairman and a senior adviser to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign , said in an e-mail message that he had no direct contact with Blackwater and that the work was landed by BKSH , a subsidiary .
BKSH is a political consulting firm led by Charles R. Black Jr. , an adviser to President Bush and his father , and R. Scott Pastrick , a top Democratic fund - raiser .
Mr. Penn said that a BKSH associate had worked briefly in Iraq and met several Blackwater personnel , who steered the work to his firm .

Upgrading from Drupal 4.7 or earlier
Drupal 6 supports direct upgrades from 5.x versions .
If you are using an earlier version of Drupal , first upgrade your site to the latest version of Drupal 5 , and then upgrade to Drupal 6 .
Upgrading from Drupal 5.x
Ensure that you have Drupal 6 versions of all of your contributed modules and themes , and that you have reviewed and updated your site 's custom code ( if any ) .
When upgrading , always save backups of your original files and database .
of your original files and database .
Disable contributed themes and modules before starting the upgrade process .
Contributed modules and themes may be upgraded after your core upgrade is complete .
before starting the upgrade process .
Contributed modules and themes may be upgraded after your core upgrade is complete .
Because some modules may have been renamed or removed within the Drupal core , you should not extract Drupal 6.0 on top of your existing installation .
Instead , start with a fresh copy of Drupal and then add your custom modules , themes and configuration file .
of Drupal and then add your custom modules , themes and configuration file .
If you are using the Update status contributed module for Drupal 5.x , you are encouraged to both disable and uninstall the module before upgrading to Drupal 6.0 .
Also , some of the advanced features of the contributed version of Update status were not moved into the Update status module included with Drupal core , and can be found in the Update status advanced settings contributed module for Drupal 6.x .
In Drupal 6 , translation files are now spread across a set of small files , and distributed in a package ( since importing translations from one large file did not work on some hosts ) .
To import all new translation files automatically , uncompress the translation files into the Drupal root and use the Reimport tab ( under Import page in the Translate interface administration section ) provided by the contributed Localization client module .
The Localization client module provides a number of useful features for managing and translating a multilingual site .
Drupal 6 versions ( when available ) of other contributed modules , including i18n and localizer , also provide additional features that complement or complete the Drupal 6 multilingual feature set .
Upgrading from a Drupal 6.0 release candidate
Copy the new distribution over your existing installation and run the upgrade script .
Additional notes
Sites which deploy their Drupal installations by directly checking out code from CVS will need to install the CVS deploy contributed module for Drupal 6.x for the Update status module in 6.x core to work properly .
Special thanks to Roy Scholten ( yoroy ) for assembling the new feature list and to Keith Smith and others for editing it to its current state .

An out - of - place artefact is an object that exists in a place in which it is impossible for it to exist .
OOPArts are often of interest to creationists and others who seek evidence that may refute the theory of evolution ; they are also used to support religious descriptions of pre-history , ancient astronaut theories , or the notion of vanished civilizations that possessed knowledge or technology more advanced than our own .
This is a list of the top 10 out - of - place artefacts .
10 . Baigong Pipes
The Baigong Pipes are a series of pipe - like features found on and near Mount Baigong about 40 km southeast of the city of Delingha , in the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture , Qinghai Province , China .
The Baigong Pipes are reported to be associated with a “ pyramid ” about 50 to 60 meters ( 160 to 200 feet high ) built on Mount Baigong .
The front of the “ pyramid ” is reported to contain three caves .
The mouths of the two smaller caves have collapsed .
Only the largest cave , which is 6 meters ( 18 feet ) high , can be entered .
Two Baigong Pipes have been reported from the largest cave .
One of these is described as being 40 cm ( 16 in ) in diameter and preserved as a reddish - brown “ half - pipe ” .
Within the same cave , another pipe - like feature of similar diameter was also found .
“ Dozens ” of upright pipe - like features , about 10 to 40 cm ( 4 to 16 inches ) in diameter , were also found protruding from Mount Baigong above the largest cave .

9. Tecaxic Calixtlahuaca Head
The Tecaxic - Calixtlahuaca head is a terracotta head , probably originally part of a larger figurine , discovered in 1933 among pre-Columbian grave goods in the Tecaxic - Calixtlahuaca zone in the Toluca Valley , approximately 65 kilometers west of Mexico City .
Because of the head ’s non-Amerind facial features , including a beard , and its unusual style , some believe that it is of Roman origin , and thus evidence of pre-Columbian trans - oceanic contact .
The site where the head was found seems to be a genuine pre-colonial site undisturbed during the colonial period .
A thermoluminescence test performed in 1995 by P.Schaaf and G.A. Wagner in the FS Archaeömetrie unit in Heidelberg , Germany , established its age limits between the 9th century B.C. and the middle of the 13th century A.D , confirming that it is a pre-colonial artifact .
Bernard Andreae of the German Institute of Archaeology in Rome , Italy , confirmed the style as Roman and proposed the 2nd century A.D as datation , based on the hairstyle and the beard .
8. Starchild skull
The Starchild skull is an abnormal human - like skull which was found in Mexico .
Its origin and nature are contested by scientists and paranormal enthusiasts .
The starchild skull came into the possession of Lloyd Pye , a writer and lecturer in the field of alternative knowledge , in February 1999 .
According to Pye , the skull was found around 1930 in a mine tunnel about 100 miles ( 200 km ) southwest of the Mexican city of Chihuahua , Chihuahua , buried alongside a normal human skeleton which was exposed and lying supine on the surface of the tunnel .
The skull is abnormal in several aspects .
A dentist determined that it was a child ’s skull , due to unerupted teeth being impacted in the associated upper right maxilla found with the skull .
However , the volume of the interior of the starchild skull is 1600 cubic centimeters , which is 200 cm3 larger than the average adult ’s brain , and 400 cm3 larger than an adult of the same approximate size .
The orbits are oval and shallow , with the optic nerve canal situated at the bottom of the orbit instead of at the back .
There are no frontal sinuses .
The back of the skull is flattened , but not by artificial means .
The skull consists of calcium hydroxyapatite , the normal material of mammalian bone , but there is an overload of collagen in it , much more than is usual for human bone .
Carbon 14 dating was performed twice , the first on the normal human skull at the University of California at Riverside in 1999 , and on the Starchild skull in 2004 at Beta Analytic in Miami , the largest radiocarbon dating laboratory in the world .
Both independent tests gave a result of 900 years ± 40 years since death .
DNA testing at Trace Genetics in 2003 recovered mitochondrial DNA and determined that the child had a human mother , though it was not the child of the skull found with it .
7. Aluminium wedge of Aiud
The Aluminum Wedge of Aiud , also known as the Object of Aiud , is a wedge - shaped object found 2 kilometers East of Aiud , Romania , on the banks of the Mures river in 1974 .
According to an article written by Boczor Iosif , a contributor to Hungarian paranormal magazines , it was found under 35 feet of sand and along side 2 mastodon bones .
His article also claims it was found in 1973 .
For three reasons some claim the wedge is proof that aliens came to visit Earth in the past .
An unnamed aeronautical engineer said it resembled the foot of landing gear not unlike the current space vehicles at the time , only smaller .
This was corroborated by Florin Gheorghita , a known ufologist in Romania .
The fact that it was found in the same layer as mastodon bones , and assuming it was found in original context , would make it at least 11,000 years old .
The third reason people believed that this was from an alien ship was because aluminum was not even discovered until 1808 and could not be produced in mass until 1885 .
Therefore , because it looks like landing gear , it was found with mastodon bones and the oxide dated to at least 300 years old ( before aluminum on earth ) , it was from an alien spaceship .
Most scientists believe the wedge was made here on earth and its purpose is just not yet identified .
Not much information is to be found on this subject .
The lack of data can possibly be explained by the imposed restrictions on archaeology and history by the communist rule of the time .
Aluminum requires 1,000 degrees of heat to be produced .
The aluminum wedge of Aiud remains a mystery .
6 . The Coso Artifact
The Coso Artifact is a spark plug found encased in a lump of hard clay or rock on February 13 , 1961 by Wallace Lane , Virginia Maxey , and Mike Mikesell while they were fossicking for geodes near the town of Olancha , California .
Following its collection , Mikesell destroyed a diamond edged blade cutting through the rock containing the artifact and discovered the item .
Virginia Maxey , one of the people who discovered it , speculated at different times that this artifact was either 100 or 500,000 years old as noted by Stromberg and Heinrich ( 2000 , 2004 ) .
Mrs. Maxey failed to provide either any specific information or verifiable citation about either the dating technique or evidence used in calculating either date .
The origin of the artifact has been the cause of much speculation .
Pseudoscientific suggestions include :
An ancient advanced civilization ( such as Atlantis ) , Prehistoric extraterrestrial visitors to Earth , Human time - travellers from the future leaving or losing the artifact during a visit to the past .
5. Kensington Runestone
The Kensington runestone is a roughly rectangular slab of greywacke covered in runes on its face and side .
Its origin and meaning have been disputed ever since it was found in 1898 near Kensington , Minnesota .
It suggests that Scandinavian explorers reached the middle of North America in the 14th century .
Its origin is uncertain , and opinions are divided as to its authenticity , with some ( including reknowned Minnesota geologist Newton Horace Winchell ) suggesting it is an important Medieval artifact , and others ( including eminent runologists such as R.I Page and James Knirk ) arguing the Runestone is a hoax .
In The Kensington Runestone : Approaching a Research Question Holistically ( 2005 ) archeologist Alice Beck Kehoe alluded to reports of contact between native American populations and outsiders prior to the time of the runestone , which tend to validate the possibility of a fourteenth century , northern European Scandanavian expedition .
The translation of both sides reads :
Face : 8 Geats ( South Swedes ) and 22 Norwegians on acquisition venture from Vinland far to the west
We had traps by 2 shelters one day ’s travel to the north from this stone
We were fishing one day .
After we came home found 10 men red with blood and dead AVM ( Ave Maria ) Deliver from evils .
Lateral : I have 10 men at the inland sea / lake to look after our ship 14 days travel from this wealth / property Year of our Lord 1362
4. Saqqara Bird
The Saqqara Bird is a bird - like artifact made of sycamore wood , discovered during the 1891 excavation of the Pa - di - Imen tomb in Saqqara , Egypt .
It dates back to at least 200 BC and is now housed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo .
It has a wingspan of 7.2 inches and weighs 39.120 grams .
The artifact has a beak , no holes for feathers , and one eye , and was painted to resemble a falcon without clear images and carving of feathers on the wings .
Perhaps the most intriguing speculation is that the “ Bird ” may show that an understanding of the principles of aviation existed many centuries before such are generally believed to have first been discovered .
The Ancient Egyptians had knowledge to some extent of sail construction .
Since the 5.6 - inch long object closely resembles a model airplane , it has led one Egyptologist , Khalil Messiha , and others to speculate that the Ancient Egyptians developed the first aircraft .
Messiha , who was the first to argue that the model did not represent a bird , wrote in 1983 that it “ represents a diminutive of an original monoplane still present in Saqqara . ”
3. Antikythera Mechanism
The Antikythera Mechanism is believed to be an ancient mechanical calculator ( also described as a “ mechanical computer ” ) designed to calculate astronomical positions .
It was discovered in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera , between Kythera and Crete , and has been dated to about 150 - 100 BC .
It is especially notable for being a technological artifact with no known predecessor or successor ; other machines using technology of such complexity would not appear until the 18th century .
While a century of research is finally answering the question of what the mechanism did , we are actually no nearer to answering the question what it was for .
2. Dendera Light
The Dendera light comprises three stone reliefs ( one single and a double representation ) in the Hathor temple at the Dendera Temple complex located in Egypt .
The images are interpreted by traditional Egyptologists to depicting lotus flowers spawning a snake , representing aspects of Egyptian mythology .
Controversy arose when the main object in the images was interpreted by some as electric lamps based on comparison to modern devices .
These individuals believe the object may be electric lamps .
Engineers have constructed a working model based on the reliefs and some authors ( such as Peter Krassa and Reinhard Habeck ) have produced a basic theory of the device ’s operation .
1. Baghdad Battery
The Baghdad Battery was discovered in the village of Khuyut Rabbou ’a ( near Baghdad , Iraq ) in 1936 .
These artifacts came to wider attention in 1938 , when Wilhelm König , the German director of the National Museum of Iraq , found the objects in the museum ’s collections , and in 1940 ( having returned to Berlin due to illness ) published a paper speculating that they may have been galvanic cells , perhaps used for electroplating gold onto silver objects .
The artifacts consist of ~ 130 mm ( ~5 inch ) tall terracotta jars ( with a one and a half inch mouth ) containing a copper cylinder made of a rolled - up copper sheet , which houses a single iron rod .
At the top , the iron rod is isolated from the copper by asphalt plugs or stoppers , and both rod and cylinder fit snugly inside the opening of the jar which bulges outward towards the middle ( reverse hourglass shape ) .
On MythBusters ’ 29th episode ( which aired on March 23 , 2005 ) , the Baghdad battery myth was put to the test .
Ten hand - made terracotta jars were fitted to act as batteries .
Lemon juice was chosen as the electrolyte to activate the electrochemical reaction between the copper and iron .
( Oddly enough , it was discovered that a single lemon produced more voltage than one of the batteries ) .
When all of the batteries were linked together in series , they produced upwards of 4 volts .
Then , the major question was , “ What were these ancient batteries used for ? ”

Collingwood ’s Vessel : a Retirement Home for Elderly Fisherman
Ship Drydock Design –
The scheme is a retirement home for elderly fisherman that also houses a working men ’s club for members of Newcastle ’s fishing community , ” Pearson writes .
“ As a reflection of the separation and torpor of this unique society , the scheme takes the notion of the ship in an architectural context , to create an ersatz environment which interacts with the city around it as if it were a dry docked vessel .
The environmental technologies and the ways in which the notional ship has been translated into an architectural system are the focus of this study . ”

A group of Australian researchers at the Universities of Melbourne and New South Wales have developed new tools and paradigms to understand immune evasion from HIV .
The study , published Friday , January 25 in PLoS Pathogens , shows that both prior vaccination and timing influence the rates of immune escape , providing further insight into the effectiveness of T cell immunity to HIV .
An HIV vaccine is urgently needed .
A major hurdle is the rapid evolution of HIV and its ability to mutate to escape effective immunity .
Low levels of mutant virus cannot be detected with standard techniques , making it difficult to study the evolution of mutant viruses .
The group , led by PhD student Liyen Loh and Dr. Stephen Kent , developed highly sensitive assays to track mutant viruses .
They show that vaccination of macaques against SIV ( a simian AIDS virus ) results in the rapid selection of mutant viruses .
In contrast , escape mutants evolve much more slowly when they appear later during infection .
Mutant viruses , however , result in some “ fitness ” cost and they revert back when transmitted to a new host .
Reversion of mutant viruses also follows the same principles – rapid during acute infection and slower during chronic infection .
These insights suggest new ways to improve HIV vaccines .

Ross asks :
37signals has contributed massively to the open source community , but in what ways has the open sourcing helped and hindered 37signals and would you advocate that more companies contributed or open sourced their software , if so what advice would you give them ?
Open source provides an incredible amount of technical leverage for small companies .
No matter who productive your rock - star programmers are and no matter how much judo you apply to your problems , solid infrastructure takes a long time and benefits immensely from broad involvement .
It really does take a village to raise great infrastructure .
The Ruby on Rails framework of today is a lot more productive than the one I was using before it was open sourced .
I use features every day created by others , enjoy polish done by others , evade bugs caught by others .
All work I would otherwise have to do myself .
So I simply get more done for less effort than it would otherwise have taken .
The same holds true for the other open source projects that have been cultivated in 37signals , like Prototype and Capistrano .
Getting more done for less is the obvious benefit of open sourcing your work .
But there are a lot of other positives as well .
For one , it feels good to give back .
37 signals as a company is possible in part only because of how open source lowered the barriers of entry for small businesses .
Everything from the operating system to the database to the web server to the proxy engine to everything in between on our servers is open source .
If we ’d have to go back to a time where all that carried big upfront licensing costs , we might never have gotten the product direction for the company off the ground .
Helping further that ecosystem is very rewarding .
It also gives you a public arena to learn from other great programmers and to better yourself .
Most of the people using Rails are working on proprietary applications , so we do n’t get to share or discuss the specifics of the projects all that often .
But we do get to share and discuss the specifics of the infrastructure .
That ’s the best continued training course you could ever run .
Through that public arena you get access to scout for the best minds and hire people of exceptional talent .
We have found all our current programmers through the Rails scene and had access to evaluate much of their work as a result of open source .
I also wrote about a few years back .
Sprinkle on top that if you happen to run a successful open - source project , you ’ll probably attract a fair amount of press attention and customer goodwill .
37signals has definitely benefitted from both of those categories off the many open source projects that we run .
So you get all these positives , but what about the negatives ?
I really do n’t see any .
A big fear that a lot of people have is that they ’ll somehow be giving away their secret sauce .
Unless your actual product is what you ’re open sourcing , it really does n’t matter ( and there are even plenty of examples of that working well ) .
It ’s unlikely that the piece of code that ’s only seen internal development is such a silver bullet that you ’re going to outshine your competition by its use alone .
All that to say that I think open sourcing infrastructure software is a great idea .
I ’d heartily recommend it to anyone sitting on a piece of code that more people could benefit from and that they ’d like to see developed further .
There are many things tech 'y people argue about online , from vim vs emacs , Python vs Ruby , imperative vs functional languages .
The list is nearly endless .
One of the most common is " Which is the most secure OS " .
Typically it goes that Windows is the most ridiculously insecure OS , and Linux the far more secure .
Mac OS
X users then point out that they do n't get viruses .
Then a Windows user points out that he 's run Windows for years without getting any viruses , and that there are lots of exploits for Linux applications .
These arguments are all pretty much right .
Windows is insecure .
Linux is more secure .
Mac OS
X does n't get many viruses ..
But you can make Windows secure , and Linux insecure ..
Does this mean one OS is more secure than another ?
No .
You can secure pretty much any OS given a bit of effort .
Installing a virus scanner / firewall on a Windows machine , and not clicking random email attachments will pretty much stop most problems .
So why is Windows considered so insecure ?
Because people are technologically stupid - they do n't know that they need a firewall , or to enable WPA security on their router , or ...
Windows , by default , is very insecure - There are lots of processes running , Internet Explorer runs ActiveX Controls without hesitation , there are plenty of services running , and many listening sockets ( DCOM is a famous example )
Compare this to your average Linux install - Ubuntu is probably the best example of this -
It has no listening services by default .
You run as a non-administrative user by default .
If you install Ubuntu , change nothing and connected it to the Internet , it does n't get infected within minutes .
OpenBSD is considered the most secure OS .
You can still run " rm - rf / " and destroy the system in seconds , or " nc - l - p 21 -e / bin / bash " and allow anyone passwordless access to your machine .
The difference is , it is " Secure by Default " - you can count the number of remote - exploits for a default OpenBSD install using about two fingers ..
As the OpenBSD site says , it lets inexperienced users setup OpenBSD securely , then as they learn more about the OS , they can enable extra daemons and services , standing more chance of knowing what they are doing .
Take wireless routers as another example .
A few years ago , if you took Kismac and wandered pretty much populated area , chances are you 'd see about 80 - 90 % of visible access points would be unencrypted .
Today , it 's nearly the opposite - 80 - 90 % are now encrypted .
Are people becoming more security conscious ?
More technologically competent ?
No .
Router manufactures are shipping wireless routers with WPA enabled by default !
To connect to the access point , click " Connect " and enter the WPA key printed on the base of your new router .
Easy , and it stops random people using your internet connection , and it requires no setup .
Security is sensible defaults .
Linux , Mac OS X , FreeBSD , OpenBSD , modern wireless routers - all have fairly secure default settings , all are considered secure .
Of course , there are other factors - People using Linux are generally more technologically competent than someone who have just bought their first computer ( which will have Windows installed by default ) .
The fact Windows is installed on a lot of computers is the reason there are so many random " this_is_not_a_trojan.jpg.gif.bmp.exe " viruses floating around .
More important is the fact it 's installed on a lot of computers , owned by new or inexperienced computers owners , where you can be a single click away from installing a virus that can completely take control of the system quite easily ..
Now that woman can finally drive and stay in hotels alone in Saudi Arabia , it seems the men who call the largest country in Arabia home think they too can loosen up a bit .
They ’re wrong .
The country ’s “ religious police ” interrogated 57 men today for “ for flirting with women in front of a shopping mall in the holy city of Mecca . ”
It ’s reported that the men were also wearing inappropriate clothing ( T - shirts with English writing ) and dancing to pop music — both punishable offenses .
AP reports ,
“ The newspaper report said the men who were arrested Thursday could be released if they could prove they did not flirt with any women .
Otherwise , they will be transferred to court and stand trial … ”
No word on what punishment the men face if convicted .
The U.S. Department of State has a currently - running travel warning which urges Americans who wish to travel to Saudi Arabia “ to avoid staying in hotels or housing compounds that do not apply stringent security measures and are also advised to maintain good situational awareness when visiting commercial establishments frequented by Westerners . ”
And of course , no dancing .

例の「暴言」は内輪受けのジョークや( Rubyの事情が)わかる人にしかわからない内容で一杯だ。
For instance , a significant percentage of readers obviously understood from the rant that Zed is unemployed , starving , and / or stark - raving mad .
All three could not be further from the truth .
Zed is happily employed by a major , household - name financial institution in New York City , where he comes into work everyday with a nice shirt and tie , and leads a Rails ( yes , Rails ) development team .
Of course , none of this is news to those of us that really know him , but the rest of the world got a totally different story .
たとえば、読者の多く は 「 Zedは無職で、飢えていて、むやみやたらと怒っている」と思っただろう。しかし、いずれも真実ではない。Zedはニューヨークのメジャーで名の通った金融機関に、毎日パリッとしたシャツとネクタイで通勤している。そしてRails(そう、Railsだ)開発チームのリーダーとして働いている。これらのことはZedを知ってる人には目新しいことじゃないけど、知らない人には全然違う風に受け取られたんじゃないかな。
ということはなにか、彼の暴言をことさらに取り上げた人は、
肯定側も否定側もまんまと一杯喰わされたということなのか。
もうひとつ 。
To those that would use the number of Rails - related listings on major job boards as evidence of opportunity limitations , I point out that due to extraordinary demand for Ruby talent in the marketplace , it is almost pointless to advertise Ruby job positions via conventional channels .
The way to find Rails talent is via targeted Ruby job boards , word of mouth , and blogging .
Counts on mainstream job boards are meaningless at best , misleading at worst .

An ambulance company spokeswoman said 17 people were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries , mostly from inhaling smoke or from fleeing the building .
None of the 120 firefighters who fought the blaze was hurt .
The spectacle brought to mind the state 's deadliest fire .
In 1980 , 87 people were killed in a fire at the old MGM Grand just down the street from the Monte Carlo .
Strict fire codes , including mandatory fire sprinklers , have since been adopted for the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip .
Fire Chief Steve Smith credited firefighters , not the sprinkler system for quickly containing Friday 's fire .
He called it an exterior fire that consumed a foam - like building material .
He said it was best fought from the interior .
Firefighters entered top - floor rooms , broke windows and leaned out with hoses to aim water at the flames .
" It 's very precarious up there , " Smith said .
" They did expose themselves to some extreme danger .
They could have fallen out . "
Smith said it was too early to assess damage or say what caused the fire , which began just before 11 a.m .
There was no immediate indication of criminal activity or arson , but " nothing is ruled out at this time , " he said .
Officials were told welders were working on the roof of the building before the fire , Clark County spokesman Erik Pappa said .
Ron Lynn , chief of the county Building Department , said five floors were affected by the fire , mostly from water damage , but only a few rooms had significant damage from fire and water .
Officials went door - to - door evacuating the hotel , said Gordon Absher , a spokesman for the resort 's owner , MGM Mirage Inc. Larry Wappel , 25 , said he and his brother were in a room on the 30th floor when they heard housekeeping staff banging on doors and yelling " Fire , get out ! "
He said it took about 10 minutes to walk single - file down the stairs .
" There were a couple of ladies crying , but it was pretty calm , " he said .
Another guest , Renza Badilla , 45 , said she exited through the hotel kitchen to find burning debris and embers falling from the roof .
" I think people were shocked when they saw the smoke , " she said .
Guests were taken to the MGM Grand Garden Arena and were being moved to other MGM Mirage hotels in Las Vegas , Absher said .
Late Friday , some guests were escorted to their hotel rooms to retrieve their belongings , he said .
The top six floors remained closed to guests .
Lynn said it 's possible the casino would reopen ahead of the hotel but he said that would not happen immediately .
" We 're going to recommission as if it would be a new building , " he said .
An estimated 900 hotel workers on duty when the fire began were evacuated to the adjacent New York - New York hotel .
Huge crowds formed to watch the fire , and traffic on the Las Vegas Strip was gridlocked as streets were blocked off around the hotel .
Nearby resorts were not evacuated .
The Monte Carlo Resort & Casino has 3,002 guest rooms and 211 suites .
The resort , on Las Vegas Boulevard near Tropicana Avenue , opened in June 1996 and is modeled after the Place du Casino in Monte Carlo , Monaco .

State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard has been accused by a Congressional committee of stonewalling investigations into billions of dollars of waste and fraud among contractors paid by the US to rebuild Afghanistan .
CBS
News covered one such case of shoddy contracting , at a hospital in Jalalabad .
Public health expert Dr. Dave Warner showed CBS that the hospital is forced to dump its biological waste in pits out back because it can't afford the fuel to run a US - donated incinerator .
The hospital was also provided by the US with a " new " septic truck that turned out to be a 60 - year old vehicle with a fresh coat of paint and a plumbing system where blood can be seen flowing in open drains .
Equipment is so restricted that critically ill newborns have to share oxygen machines and ultraviolet lights .
Warner said that when he tried reporting the problems to the Pentagon , he was told to keep quiet because this was one of their " success stories . "
The following video is from CBS 's Evening News , broadcast on September 18 .
The Pirate Bay has canceled its plan to launch an OiNK replacement .
BOiNK was supposed to revive the hundreds of thousands of music albums that were lost during the raid , but The Pirate Bay will leave that up to more specialized private BitTorrent trackers .
The plan behind BOiNK was to re-upload all the lost OiNK torrents to a public tracker called BOiNK .
However , it turns out that the music loving pirates did n’t need The Pirate Bay to help them out because several new sites sprung up to replace it mere days after OiNK went down .
Pirate Bay admin Brokep , who listed some of these alternatives on his blog a few weeks ago , noticed this as well and decided that BOiNK was n’t needed anymore .
“ There are so many people opening up new music trackers right now so there ’s no need for us to go and do that as well . ”
He adds : “ It ’s simply better for us not to interfere with the music lovers that want their special ratio trackers for only scene releases and so forth .
That ’s not our specialty !
Each to do what they ’re best at and what they love the most . ”
Brokep is right , it looks like former OiNK members , and releasing talent , already moved to other music trackers .
Some moved to new trackers such as what.cd and waffles.fm , but existing trackers like STmusic also got a huge number of new members , as seen in the graph below :
For those who are interested in supporting OiNK admin Alan Ellis , the is an official legal defense fund set up that will be used to cover the legal costs .

BAGHDAD – The recent killing of two U.S. soldiers by their Iraqi colleague has raised disturbing questions about U.S. military relations with Iraqi forces .
On Dec. 26 , an Iraqi soldier opened fire on U.S. soldiers accompanying him during a joint military patrol in the northern Iraqi city Mosul .
He killed the U.S. captain and another sergeant , and wounded three others , including an Iraqi interpreter .
Conflicting versions of the killing have arisen .
Col .
Hazim al - Juboory , uncle of the attacker , Kaissar Saady al - Juboory , told IPS that his nephew at first watched the U.S. soldiers beat up an Iraqi woman .
When he asked them to stop , they refused , so he opened fire .
" Kaissar is a professional soldier who revolted against the Americans when they dragged a woman by her hair in a brutal way , " Col .
Juboory said .
" He is a tribal man , and an Arab with honor who would not accept such behavior .
He killed his captain and sergeant knowing that he would be executed . "
Others gave IPS a similar account .
" I was there when the American captain and his soldiers raided a neighborhood and started shouting at women to tell them where some men they wanted were , " a resident of Mosul , speaking on condition of anonymity , told IPS on phone .
" The women told them they did not know , and their men did not do anything wrong , and started crying in fear . "
The witness said the U.S. captain began to shout at his soldiers and the women , and his men then started to grab the women and pull them by their hair .
" The soldier we knew later to be Kaissar shouted at the Americans , ‘ No , No , ’ but the captain shouted back at the Iraqi soldier , " the witness told IPS .
" Then the Iraqi soldier shouted , ‘ Let go of the women you sons of bitches , ’ and started shooting at them . "
The soldier , he said , then ran off .
The Association of Muslim Scholars , a Sunni organization , issued a statement saying the Iraqi soldier had shot the U.S. soldiers after he saw them beat up a pregnant woman .
" His blood rose , and he asked the occupying soldiers to stop beating the woman , " they said in the statement .
" Their answer through the translator was : ‘ We will do what we want . ’
So he opened fire on them . "
The story was first reported on al - Rafidain satellite channel .
That started Iraqis from all over the country talking about " the hero " who sacrificed his life for Iraqi honor .
The U.S. and Iraqi military told a different version of the story .
An Iraqi general told reporters that Kaissar carried out the attack because he had links to " Sunni Arab insurgent groups . "
" Soldier Kaissar Saady worked for insurgent groups who pushed him to learn army movements and warn his comrades about them , " a captain of the second Iraqi army division told IPS .
" There are so many like him in the army and now within the so - called Awakening forces [ militias funded by the U.S. military ] . "
One army officer speaking on condition of anonymity described Kaissar ’s act as heroic .
" Those Americans learned their lesson once more . "
Sheik Juma ’ al - Dawar , chief of the major al - Baggara tribe in Iraq , told IPS in Baghdad that " Kaissar is from the al - Juboor tribes in Gayara – tribes with morals that Americans do not understand . "
The tribal chief added , " Juboor tribes and all other tribes are proud of Kaissar and what he did by killing the American soldiers .
Now he is a hero , with a name that will never be forgotten . "
Many Iraqis speak in a similar vein .
" It is another example of Iraqi people ’s unity despite political conspiracies by the Americans and their tails [ collaborators ] , " Mohammad Nassir , an independent politician in Baghdad , told IPS .
" Kaissar is loved by all Iraqis who pray for his safety and who are ready to donate anything for his welfare . "
Col .
Juboory said Kaissar , who had at first accepted collaboration with the U.S. forces , " found the truth too bitter to put up with . "
The colonel said : " I worked with the Americans because being an army officer is my job and also because I was convinced they would help Iraqis .
But 11 months was enough for me to realize that starving to death is more honorable than serving the occupiers .
They were mean in every way . "
Independent sources have since told IPS that Kaissar was captured by a special joint Iraqi- U.S. force , and he is now being held and tortured at the al - Ghizlany military camp in Mosul .
Despite a recent decline in the number of occupation forces being killed , 2007 was the deadliest year of the occupation for U.S. troops , with 901 killed , according to the U.S. Department of Defense .

“ A RACIST : A racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist ( racist ) system .
The term applies to all white people ( i.e. , people of European descent ) living in the United States , regardless of class , gender , religion , culture or sexuality .
By this definition , people of color cannot be racists , because as peoples within the U.S. system , they do not have the power to back up their prejudices , hostilities , or acts of discrimination .
( This does not deny the existence of such prejudices , hostilities , acts of rage or discrimination . ) ” – Page 3

“ REVERSE RACISM : A term created and used by white people to deny their white privilege .
Those in denial use the term reverse racism to refer to hostile behavior by people of color toward whites , and to affirmative action policies , which allegedly give ‘ preferential treatment ’ to people of color over whites .
In the U.S. , there is no such thing as ‘ reverse racism . ' ” – Page 3
— –
“ A NON - RACIST : A non-term .
The term was created by whites to deny responsibility for systemic racism , to maintain an aura of innocence in the face of racial oppression , and to shift responsibility for that oppression from whites to people of color ( called “ blaming the victim ” ) .
Responsibility for perpetuating and legitimizing a racist system rests both on those who actively maintain it , and on those who refuse to challenge it .
Silence is consent . ” – Page 3

“ Have you ever heard a well - meaning white person say , ‘ I ’m not a member of any race except the human race ? ’
What she usually means by this statement is that she does n’t want to perpetuate racial categories by acknowledging that she is white .
This is an evasion of responsibility for her participation in a system based on supremacy for white people . ”

“ The notion of indigenous people as more akin to animals than human beings is at the basis of U.S. policy toward Native Americans .
In 1784 George Washington , famous Indian fighter , large landholder and slave owner , advised the Continental Congress that it would be cheaper for the new nation to buy up Indian land than to make war on Indian people for the land .
If you make war , Washington cautioned , ‘ the savage as the wolf ’ – both wild beasts of the forest – will retreat for awhile and then come back to attack you .
Washington ’s metaphor stuck .
The young U.S. nation - state , and all sectors of European - American ; began to view the Native American as a wild animal . ”

Ever wonder why you see so many of those giant Hummers and Escalades , even in neighborhoods with relatively modest homes ?
What kind of sense does it make for someone to have a 3 - bedroom ranch , and a $ 70,000 truck parked out front that 's bigger than the living room ?
Well , it helps a lot if that $ 70,000 truck comes with a $ 25,000 tax deduction .
It 's one of the many loopholes buried within the fine print of the tax code : Business owners who purchase heavy luxury SUVs , those weighing over 6,000 pounds , get to take deductions up to $ 25,000 .
The original intent of this law was to give small businesses a break on buying delivery vehicles .
However , almost from the moment these giant SUVs became available , dealers have been helping buyers to create Chapter S corporations , or small hobby businesses , that have just enough existence to net that tax break .
This misuse of the credit is wasteful on so many levels -- it 's bad for the environment , it 's bad for the budget , it distorts the actual price / demand relationship within the auto industry , and its bad for real businesses who have to compete for vehicles with all these business phantoms .
Naturally , Republicans loved it .
Fortunately , Representative ( and Daily Kos user ) Earl Blumenauer is sponsoring legislation to close what surely has to be one of the most openly and cynically exploited loopholes in the tax code .
Blumenauer said that the new bill includes provisions for legitimate business use by exempting farm vehicles , vans , flatbed trucks and school buses from the closure of the loophole .
He predicts that the provision will give back to the government about $ 750 million over five years , which will be used to promote conservation and alternative energy .
Supporting this legislation makes so much sense , that predictably the auto industry , their not - so - small army of lobbyists , and their " friends " on the hill are violently against it .
Despite the crafting of the bill to protect legitimate businesses , they 're striking out against Blumenauer 's bill , claiming that it's " anti-business . "
Anti-cheating is more like it .
Anti-looking the other way while people rip off legitimate businesses and the environment to assuage their egos in 3 + ton monsters .
It would n't hurt to put in a call to your own congress people and remind them that there are few opportunities to act so clearly in support of fairness , the environment , the budget , and common sense .
The long - sought - after biological “ gateway ” that anthrax uses to enter healthy cells has been uncovered by microbiologists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) .
Anthrax spores enter the cell through something called Mac - 1 , a receptor that sits on the surface of certain cells .
This is the first study to uncover exactly how the bacteria get inside cells to begin with , the UAB researchers said .
Previous studies have shown what happens after anthrax spores enter the body and wreak havoc .
Unraveling the anthrax - Mac - 1 gateway is a milestone in the ongoing efforts to protect humans from bioterrorism and biological warfare , the UAB microbiologists said .
Such a discovery will speed the development of new drugs and vaccines to fight or prevent anthrax infection , and advance the understanding of bacterial infection .
The findings are published in the online version of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and will soon appear in a print edition .
“ We know anthrax infection can occur in wild and domestic animals , but in humans this disease is extremely rare and very dangerous .
It is a bioweapon , ” said John Kearney , Ph.D. , a professor in the UAB Department of Microbiology and co-author on the study .
“ This study reveals the biological paradigm that makes the anthrax spore clever enough to target the Mac - 1 receptor , and use this entry point to boost its lethality . ”
Bacillus anthracis infection occurs in three forms : cutaneous ( skin ) , inhalation and through swallowing spores .
The skin infection is the most common type and can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed rapidly .
The more serious form is inhalation anthrax , which was diagnosed in a few adults during the anthrax scare after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks against the United States .
In the UAB study , researchers worked under strict bio -safe conditions to infect cultures of cells and laboratory - bred mice with a strain of anthrax often used in research .
Infection rates and other observations were significant enough to convince the microbiologists anthrax relies on Mac - 1 to do its damage inside healthy cells .
“ By showing how anthrax spores recognize Mac - 1 receptors , this discovery points toward a precise entry point which B. anthracis uses to proliferate and trigger lethal consequences , ” said Claudia Oliva , Ph.D. , and Melissa Swiecki , Ph.D. , both researchers in the UAB Department of Microbiology and co-lead authors on the study .

What Do n’t We Know About the Pharmaceutical Industry ?
A Freakonomics Quorum
This blog has regularly featured items on the pharmaceutical industry , including posts here , here , and here .
It was this post in particular , highlighting an interview with the CEO of Genentech , that made me want to post a quorum on the subject .
So we ’ve gathered up some willing and able candidates — Dr. Stuart Apfel , Zola P. Horovitz , Dr. Harlan Krumholz , Ray Moynihan , and Dr. Cyril Wolf — and asked them the following question :
What ’s something that most people do n’t know , pro or con , about the pharmaceutical business , whether from an R&D , economic , or political perspective ?
Here are their responses .
I hope you will find , as I did , plenty of surprises and illumination .
Thanks to all of them for their thoughtful contributions .
Dr. Harlan Krumholz , professor of medicine , epidemiology , and public health at Yale :
Science and the public good in a capitalist society depend on the free flow of unbiased information , but it does n’t always work that way .
Events are revealing that many pharmaceutical companies , along with their consulting academic physicians , have engaged in practices that obscure or misrepresent information about their products .
Does the public realize the depth of these practices , and their implications for patient care ?
Most physicians continue their education and keep up to date with new science by attending lectures given by experts , with the assumption that the information they hear is unbiased .
But pharmaceutical companies regularly pay high - profile scientists and physicians , either directly or indirectly , to speak on topics relevant to their products .
At a scientific meeting in Europe , I watched an American colleague — a famous cardiologist who was being well compensated for his participation — practice his upcoming speech in front of drug company marketers .
After his practice talk , they replaced some slides with ones that presented their drug in a more favorable light .
The speaker initially resisted the change , but finally acceded , and his talk the next day was a strong endorsement of his sponsor ’s drug .
Another important way for physicians to learn about new therapies , and for scientists to disseminate the results of their studies , is through medical journals .
The expectation is that these articles pass through rigorous review , and represent strong science .
However , when I worked as an expert in litigation related to Vioxx , an anti-inflammatory drug marketed by Merck , I was surprised to discover that many of the manuscripts on Vioxx were prepared and written by Merck or medical writing companies that Merck had commissioned .
The company then often paid academics to become authors , placing their names at the head of scientific studies that were already planned , performed , interpreted , and drafted by the company .
Some of these articles had well known authors , and their impact was substantial .
The authors ’ lack of involvement was not revealed , and , in some cases , the involvement of the company was not even mentioned .
Then there is the problem of company studies , often completed with academics , that never see the light of day .
Some recent examples with Vytorin , a cholesterol lowering drug , and Avandia , a blood - sugar - lowering drug , have illustrated this point .
Conscientious physicians seeking to learn about those drugs would not have access to all the information available .
For Avandia , the information on the unpublished studies became available only because of litigation ; even though the data were placed in the public domain , the location was not widely publicized .
It was these unpublished studies , eventually uncovered , that led to concerns about the drug ’s safety .
Clearly , we are at a critical juncture in the history of the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians , and the health of patients hangs in the balance .
Breaches in professional ethics , which can distort the knowledge upon which clinicians and patients depend , undermine trust in academic physicians and diminish the standing of the pharmaceutical industry .
Academic medicine and the pharmaceutical industry are replete with ethical and talented individuals who dedicate their lives to fighting disease .
The credit for many important advances in science lies with industry and its strong collaborative relationships with basic and clinical scientists .
The current pattern of misbehavior that is exhibited by many , on both sides , is a pox on the profession and a danger to patients .
A key question is : can industry and academics work together to cure this disease ?
Zola P. Horovitz , Ph.D , pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry consultant , and member of the board of drug companies including Biocryst Pharmaceuticals , Phyton , Genaera Corporation , and Avigen :
My answer to this question is this : that the United States is subsidizing prescription drug prices for the rest of the world .
Most people do not realize that when a prescription is paid for in the U.S. , the payer ( the patient , his or her insurance company , or the government ) is subsidizing the cost of that same prescription in most countries outside the U.S.
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies price their products to get a return that will support research and development to discover new products .
Almost all major new drugs are discovered and developed by these companies , and most are located inside the U.S.
We have a free market system here that supports this pricing , and helps sustain new R&D .
However , countries like Canada , France , Germany , Australia , and others set the prices for prescription drugs sold in their countries , and for the most part they do not allow any premium pricing that can aid the industry in new R&D .
The only solution to this problem would be for our government to force , through trade agreements , these countries to allow better pricing to help cover the cost of new R&D that their citizens will take advantage of , or for the U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to refuse to provide the fruits of their discoveries to countries that do not allow a fair return .
Unfortunately , these remedies never happen because of political roadblocks .
As the downside pressures on U.S. prescription drug prices increase , and the lack of support continues from the rest of the world to participate in some help for new R&D , the future of finding new and unique lifesaving and quality of life pharmaceuticals appears bleak .
As a result , future generations are likely to suffer from our shortsightedness .
Dr. Cyril Wolf , practicing physician and prescription sales researcher :
The best kept secret by the retail pharmaceutical industry is the obscene profits made on generic drugs by the large chain stores .
Whereas brand name drugs are all purchased , and therefore sold , for around the same price , generics are obtained for a fraction of that cost .
The price at which the generics are sold is determined by the sellers , who thus have the ability to make exorbitant profits on these drugs .
It is for this reason that the chains are always encouraging the public to buy generic drugs “ in order to save . ”
Do they save consumers money ?
The answer is “ yes , but very , very little , ” since these drugs are sold at prices not much lower than those of the branded products and are certainly priced well above their cost .
The travesty is that it is those who can afford it the least ( i.e. , people without health insurance and Medicare recipients without drug coverage ) who suffer the most from this .
Below , I have tabled the prices of the commonly prescribed generic drugs at Costco , which does not mark its prices up excessively , compared to those charged by Walgreens and CVS in Houston , New York , and Los Angeles .

When I show these prices to my patients , their reaction is always the same : “ How can they do this ? ”
The answer , of course , is : “ Because they can . ”
Dr. Stuart Apfel , founder and president of Parallax Clinical Research and chief medical officer at Elite Pharmaceuticals :
For the majority of people , the great appeal of biomedical science is the potential benefit it presents to human beings through curing disease , extending life , and improving the quality of life .
As is generally well - known , biomedical science has achieved much in extending our knowledge of the complex biological processes that make up all living organisms , including ourselves .
Take our understanding of cancer , for example .
Over the past two decades , hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent successfully elucidating the genome , identifying genes that may lead to cancer , identifying tumor suppressor genes , defining the molecular mechanisms underlying cell proliferation , unraveling how and why tumor cells metastasize , and identifying molecules that can interact with all of these processes .
Yet the survival rate for patients with most malignant tumors is not much improved over what it was in the 1980s .
Consider , as well , neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer ’s disease or Parkinson ’s disease .
Over the past couple of decades , our understanding of the degenerative processes involved in these diseases on a cellular and molecular level has increased enormously , and so too has our understanding of the molecular factors that maintain and promote the survival of the affected population of neurons ( nerve cells ) .
Yet their management has not improved much , and the prospects of a cure remain just as they were : remote .
While most people understand in a vague way that modern biomedical science is advancing at a remarkable pace , many people are less aware that we have been far less successful at translating science from the laboratory bench to the clinic .
This is not to say that the pharmaceutical industry has been quiescent ; total spending on health related research by the drug industry has increased from about $ 6 billion in 1980 to about $ 39 billion in 2004 .
During that period , basic science research has increased the number of potential drug targets ( the biological site on which a drug is intended to act ) from 500 to more than 3,000 .
Still , the total number of truly novel drugs approved each year has remained relatively constant .
Part of this discrepancy may be due to the enormous costs associated with developing novel drugs , estimated to be about $ 800 million in 2002 .
It is far less expensive , and far less risky in terms of getting approval , to develop so called “ me too ” drugs that either modify the formulation of existing drugs ( a process that often provides patients with important benefits ) , or developing alternative drugs with mechanisms of action similar to well established drugs .
Market forces will always drive the actions of pharmaceutical companies , which are , after all , businesses like any other .
However , society as a whole will benefit from greater risk taking and increased efforts to bridge the divide between laboratory science and the clinic .
In recent years , we ’ve made progress in closing this gap .
Small biotechnology companies ( many of which have been spawned as a result of an effort to develop discoveries made in an academic setting ) are often less risk averse than the larger companies , and have been largely focused on advancing discoveries from the lab into clinical trials .
There has also been an increased effort stemming from academic institutions ( which tend to be short on resources , but where most of the basic science work is done ) and the pharmaceutical industry ( flush with cash but with limited incentive to focus research efforts on basic science ) to work together and bridge this gap on a larger scale .
The success of these efforts will be a determining factor in how successful we are at overcoming the most challenging medical problems that confront us today , and in the future .

How does one describe the layered horror that is eBay ?
Look long enough and you 'll find an item that the mere knowledge of its existence brings shock and dismay .
Then , you must cope with the fact that the seller thought we would be willing to pay good money for it , and then come to terms with the fact that usually they 're right .
Here are some that almost had us bidding out of sheer , morbid curiosity .

That 's right , it 's the CB - 6000 male chastity belt on sale for a Buy It Now price of $ 189.95 .
What a steal !
This horrible , horrible device just about looks like the most uncomfortable and awkward thing that has ever been invented .
The auction claims that " This is a new , flat design that is even more comfortable and even less noticeable than the previous popular models , " but the huge plastic dongs staring back at us seem to differ in their opinions .
Wearing one of these would be the equivalent of getting that half - chub in english class , then having to go up to the board and diagram sentences , but even better because it is ALWAYS THERE .

DailyKos :
Colorado representative Doug Lamborn has just made the final doo - doo step it what will be the shortest and most lackluster career the House has ever seen .
Doug Lamborn 's recorded threats to a pair of voters critical of his views has now reached the pages of both the Denver and Huffington Posts .
Doug 's local paper , the Colorado Springs Gazette , is eerily silent .[.. ]
Update : Here 's the back story from Colorado Confidential .
And here are Doug 's threats , as printed by the Denver Post :
" Now there are consequences to this kind of thing , but I would like to work with you in a way that is best for everyone here concerned . "
He did n't stop there , though .
The message cut off before his inner Tony Soprano could kick in :
President Bush 's final State of the Union speech touched on but did not dwell on Congress ' ongoing debate over how much unilateral spying power to hand over to the nation 's spooks and whether to grant the nation 's telecoms retroactive immunity for helping the government 's warrantless spying on Americans .
On the homefront , we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country .
This is our most solemn duty .
We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since September 11 .
This is not for a lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy .
In the past six years , we have stopped numerous attacks , including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic .
Dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans .
These good citizens are saving American lives , and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks .
And we owe them something more :
We owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe .
One of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications .
To protect America , we need to know who the terrorists are talking to , what they are saying , and what they are planning .
Last year , the Congress passed legislation to help us do that .
Unfortunately , the Congress set the legislation to expire on February 1 .
This means that if you do not act by Friday , our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger .
The Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted .
The Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America .
We have had ample time for debate .
The time to act is now .
Following on the lies and mistruths issued from the mouths of Republican senators over the past week and months , Bush 's rhetoric seems tame and almost hardly worth mentioning .
THREAT LEVEL is convinced that Bush will sign some temporary extension to the current wiretapping bill , but is less sure that immunity will ever be passed by this Congress .
Democrats and Republicans alike have bought into the " intelligence gap " rhetoric , however , and will likely give the nation 's spooks the power to live in our domestic communication networks with hardly any oversight .
That 's far more dangerous than any immunity clause , because once the spooks are in the tubes , they will continue to find reasons – cyber - crime or drug dealing or pedophiles – to stay in there .
But there remains hope that the nation 's courts will find a way to question the sweeping claims of power made by the executive branch to avoid responsibility for secretly turning the nation 's spy apparatus loose on Americans without following the law .

But 10 years ago , Captain Charles Moore took a short cut through the airless doldrums in his catamaran , Alguita , and caught sight of something that changed his life .
As he looked out at what should have been a clear blue ocean , Moore saw a sea of plastic .
As far as he could see , day after day , were bottles , wrappers and fragments of plastic in every colour .
Historically , the ocean 's circular currents have led to accumulation of flotsam and jetsam in the subtropical high , where the waste has biodegraded with the help of marine micro-organisms .
But since humans developed a material designed for durability , which can survive exposure to any bacteria , the gyre has been filling with a substance it can't get rid of .
Rather than biodegrading , plastic photodegrades , breaking down in the sunlight into smaller and smaller pieces .
But no matter how small it gets , it 's still plastic , and causes havoc when it enters the stomachs of marine life .
Ian Kiernan , the Australian who founded Clean Up the World , started his environmental campaign 20 years ago after he became appalled by the amount of rubbish he saw on an around - the - world solo yacht race .
He 'll never forget the first time he saw the gyre .
" It was just filled with things like furniture , fridges , plastic containers , cigarette lighters , plastic bottles , light globes , televisions and fishing nets , " Kiernan says .
" It 's all so durable it floats .
It 's just a major problem . "
He picks up an ashtray filled with worn - down coloured pieces of plastic .
" This is the contents of a fleshy - footed shearwater 's stomach , " he says .
" They go to the ocean to fish but there ain't no fish - there 's plastic .
They then regurgitate it down the necks of their fledglings and it kills them .
After the birds decompose , the plastic gets washed back into the ocean where it can kill again .
It 's a form of ghost fishing , where it goes on and on . "
With gyres in each of the oceans , connected by debris highways , the problem is n't restricted to the North Pacific Gyre .
It is estimated there are more than 13,000 pieces of plastic litter on every square kilometre of the ocean surface .
The United Nations Environment Program says plastic is accountable for the deaths of more than a million seabirds and more than 100,000 marine mammals such as whales , dolphins and seals every year .
A Dutch study in the North Sea of fulmar seabirds concluded 95 per cent of the birds had plastic in their stomachs .
More than 1600 pieces were found in the stomach of one bird in Belgium .
Since his first encounter with the gyre in 1997 , Moore has returned several times and created the Algalita Marine Research Foundation to study the problem .
The Canadian filmmaker Ian Connacher joined Moore in 2005 and again last year to film the garbage patch for his documentary , I Am Plastic .
After a week of sailing from Long Beach , California , Connacher was not prepared for what he saw .
" Charlie once found a mile - long trail of Taco Bell wrappers which had plastic in them .
I did n't see anything like that , but that 's not the point , because it 's the little bits that are really making it a plastic soup , " Connacher says .
" The most menacing part is those little bits of plastic start looking like food for certain animals , or the filter feeders do n't have any choice , they just pick them up . "
Then there 's the plastic that does n't float .
Greenpeace reports that about 70 per cent of the plastic that makes it to the ocean sinks to the bottom , where it can smother marine life .
Greenpeace says Dutch scientists have found 600,000 tonnes of discarded plastic on the bottom of the North Sea alone .
A study by the Japanese geochemist Hideshige Takada and his colleagues at Tokyo University in 2001 found that plastic polymers act like a sponge for resilient poisons such as DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls .
Takada 's team found non-water - soluble toxic chemicals can be found in plastic in levels as high as a million times their concentration in water .
As small pieces of plastic are mistaken for fish eggs and other food by marine life , these toxins enter the food chain .
Even without this extra toxic load , eating plastic can be hazardous to the health .
In 2002 a study of hermaphrodite fish led Canadian scientists to link oestrogen in water to abnormal sex organs in fish .
Several plastic additives have been found to mimic oestrogen .
Some experts , such as Frederick vom Saal , a professor of biological sciences at Missouri University , say declining fertility rates in humans could be linked to exposure to synthetic oestrogen in plastics .
Some of the ocean 's plastic arrives over the side of a ship as litter , and some is the result of containers falling into the ocean .
But Greenpeace says about 80 per cent of plastic found at sea is washed out from the land .
The journal Science last year predicted seafood stocks would collapse by 2048 if overfishing and pollution continued .
Greenpeace says embracing the three Rs - reduce , re-use and recycle - would help tackle the problem .
Plastic recycling is lagging well behind paper and cardboard , as people are confused about what recycling is available in their areas .
There are other challenges for plastic recycling , such as the fact that it can release toxic chemicals into the atmosphere , and that it is more expensive to recycle some plastic than to create a new product from petrochemicals .
The use of bioplastics could help reduce the amount with which we are coating the planet .
Traditional petrochemical - based plastics are non-degradable and non-renewable ; degradable plastic breaks into smaller pieces in UV light but remains plastic ; and there are two kinds of biodegradable plastic that break down in compost - one from a petrochemical resource , the other from a renewable resource such as corn or wheat , which is known as bioplastic .
Dr Katherine Dean , of the CSIRO , says corporate firms have become interested in bioplastic over the past three years .
" When oil prices soared in 2005 , that changed a lot of people 's perspective , because bioplastic became quite cost - competitive , " she says .
" All of a sudden it was n't just about doing the right thing . "
In 2001 CSIRO researchers were involved in the development of a corn-based bioplastic that would provide the foundation for the company Plantic Technologies , which developed biodegradable plastic for everything from food and beverage packaging to medical , agricultural and sporting applications .
The chief executive of Plantic , Grant Dow , says once composted , the plastic would become nothing more than carbon dioxide and water .
" For all intents and purposes , it looks like plastic and feels like plastic and does the same thing as plastic in the application , " he says .
" It will only biodegrade in the presence of heat , moisture and bacteria , so it will sit in your cupboard pretty much indefinitely , but when the bacteria get to it in compost , that 's it .
It 's gone . "
While researchers continue to develop bioplastics , there 's no doubt the new generation of polymers can make a difference in day - to - day living .
Already supermarkets in Britain , such as Marks & Spencer , Sainsbury 's and Tesco , have introduced bioplastic packaging , and food companies are embracing the concept .
Connacher believes as consumers learn more about the situation , many will respond positively .
" We think products are going to be recycled , but they 're not .
We have become irresponsible with the way we use a lot of things , particularly disposable products . "

About once a week I like to run through about 200 of the most liquid ETF ’s to get a better sense of the market .
A good picture of the market can be painted by scanning through them so I thought I ’d share my thoughts on what I ’m seeing ( in no particular order ) .
What are you seeing ?
I post my thoughts on the general market in my weekly reports on Sunday , so wo n’t discuss it in detail again here but considering the futures are way off and tomorrow could get ugly I ’ll just mention that just maybe tomorrow sets us up for that massive capitulation day that marks an intermediate bottom .
Pay attention to the VIX .
Remember : it ’s not how we open but we we close .
If on Tuesday , we do n’t at the very least close in the upper half of the trading range it could get real ugly .
There is quite a bit of room to run to the downside before any support comes into play .
Gold is up 35 % in 5 months and big distribution has come into the Streettracks Gold Trust ( GLD ) in the last few trading sessions .
Take some profits already !
The agriculture stocks are not immune to the heavy selling and many of the top performers such as MOS , TNH , MON , CF , TRA and DE have been hit with big time institutional selling in recent days .
Is the Powershares Agriculture Fund ( DBA ) next to go ?
It is n’t showing any signs of deterioration yet , but keep an eye on it for a short .
It ’s extremely overbought and hitting the top of an upward channel .
Semis are severely oversold .
I ’m not saying that ca n’t stay oversold and dip further .
I ’m just sayin .
It will take Intel several months to recover from that slaughtering .
Maybe semis become interesting later this year .
The Powershares Dynamic Semis ( PSI ) ETF is hitting some key resistance it might be ready for a snap back rally .
But that ’s about it .
Divergence between oil and natural gas .
As oil breaks down and retreats from $ 100 / barrel , natural gas appears headed the other way and on the verge of breaking out .
It ’s hard to believe oil was up 50 % this year .
I had n’t realized that .
I see retrace of that run for the US Oil Fund to the $ 60 range .
.. and that brings me to Oil Service stocks which are approaching a long term trend line .
It ’s holding there now but given the distribution going on these names it ’s just a matter of time before before the Oil Services Holders ( OIH ) takes out that long term trend line .
Oil Service stocks look done to me over the next few months .
.. and that brings me to alternative energy which tends to trade in line with oil .
The great diversified way to play alternative way is the Powershares Clean Energy ( PBW ) ETF .
Solar stocks have been killed in the past few weeks and I have to admit some of them are beginning to flash interesting long term entry points .
It ’s too soon just yet to get in , but they are worth paying attention to as is PBW .
Below is a weekly chart and you see it ’s closing in on a trend line .
However , that is huge distribution going on .
Avoid at least until it begins to stabilize .
.. and on the non renewable side of alternative energy we have nuclear , a source of much debate .
France is doing the right thing with nuclear and largely energy independent .
Nuclear energy traders are probably realizing it will be a long time before nuclear becomes a larger part of our energy source .
Everyone wants to know when homebuilders and banks will bottom .
I ’ve touched on the homebuilders recently as they have begun to stabilize and it appears that the banks ( at least the smaller regional ones ) have begun to stabilize a bit .
Notice how I ’m not calling a bottom .
Downward trendlines will need to be broken for that to happen and we ’re quite a ways from that .
Note the capitulation 2 weeks ago on the weekly chart of the Regional Bank Holders ( RKH ) and a retracing of that move with lighter volume last week .
That is healthier action .
Look for support near the 4 year lows .
Fidel Castro is alive and well .
Ok maybe not well but he ’s alive and that ’s more than I can say for the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund ( CUBA ) .
On the other side of the world Malaysia is flying high and defying gravity as the rest of the world crumbles .
Maybe it ’s next in line .
Emerging market high flyers China and India are another story and have the potential to be punished the most .
Looking at the big picture both have a long way to go before you could say serious damage has been inflicted .
In fact the Morgan Stanley A Shares Fund ( CAF ) could drop nearly another 15 % and still be considered a bullish looking chart in terms of the long term picture .
Looks to me like India has just begin its deterioration and may provide a great short entry soon .
INP will be down big on Tuesday so it may be some time before providing a good entry .
Note the potential top marking high volume reversal on the weekly chart in the iPath MSCI India ETF last week .
I ’d be looking to get short on a retrace of this move somewhere in the 100 to 105 range .
Showdown Over Destroyed CIA Tapes
This Week A hearing this week will probe how -- and why -- tapes were destroyed .
Jan. 13 , 2007  --
In a closed door hearing scheduled for Wednesday , Congress plans to ask why the CIA destroyed tapes showing interrogations of suspected al - Qaeda operatives .
Was it a cover-up ?
National security author Ken Timmerman says , " All the members of the House Intelligence Committee are very upset about this , Republicans and Democrats . "
Upset because they believe the tapes may have shown illegal torture .
But the chief witness , former CIA official Jose Rodriguez — the man who ordered the destruction of the tapes — threatens to invoke the Fifth Amendment and remain silent , unless he is granted immunity from prosecution for anything he tells Congress .
Former U.S. prosecutor Alan Baron says , " If he takes the Fifth Amendment , if there 's a hearing , it 's like putting on ' Hamlet ' without the prince . "
Chuckling , Baron adds , " Who 's going to care ? "
It 's not funny to Congress , which is in a dilemma .
If it grants immunity to Rodriguez , that could block a separate investigation being conducted by the Justice Department .
Twenty years ago , Oliver North was granted immunity by Congress during the Iran - Contra scandal .
Later , he was tried and convicted .
But his conviction was overturned when an appeals court decided the jurors at his trial were influenced by his testimony to Congress .
Sources tell ABC News that Congress , still mindful of what happened with North , is highly unlikely to grant immunity to Rodriguez .
Some of his former CIA colleagues have been saying privately that Rodriguez acted on his own , and that he did not get the approval of CIA lawyers to destroy the tapes .
That prompted a sharp denial from his lawyer , Robert Bennett , who said in a statement to ABC News , " It is unfortunate that , under the pressure of a congressional and criminal investigation , history is being revised , and some people are running for cover . "
Even if Rodriguez refuses to testify , Congress will question another key witness , John Rizzo , the top lawyer at the CIA , and will demand to know whether anyone really gave Rodriguez the green light to destroy the tapes .

The City Edition

Evidence of a covert campaign to undermine the presidential primaries is rife , so it ’s curious that the Democractic Party and even some within the G.O.P. have ignored the actual elephant in the room this year .
That would be Karl Rove .
After rigging two previous presidential elections , this master of deceit would have us believe that he ’s gone off to sit in a corner and write op - eds .
Not so .
According to an article in Time Magazine , Republican party activists have been organized by the G.O.P. to throw their weight behind Barack Obama , the democratic rival of frontrunner Hillary Clinton .
Early in Obama ’s campaign , top Republican fundraisers flushed his coffers with cash , something the deep pockets had n’t done for any candidate in their own party .
With receipts topping $ 100 million in 2007 , the first - term Illinois senator broke the record for contributions .
It was a remarkable feat , considering that most Americans had not even heard of him before 2005 .
The Time magazine article goes on to explain that rank and file Republicans in red states have switched their party registrations , enabling them to vote in Democratic primaries .
Some states , like Virginia and Texas , have open primaries , allowing citizens to vote for any candidate regardless of party affiliation .
In Nebraska , the mayor of Omaha publicly rallied Republicans to caucus for Obama on February 9th .
Called crossover voting , the tactic is playing a crucial role in the Rove push to deprive Clinton of the Democratic nomination .
Even with the help of his more familiar hodge - podge of dirty tricks – swiftboating , waitlisting , bogus polling data , paperless electronic voting equipment , Norman Hsu , etc. – Rove would be hard pressed to defeat Clinton in November , since she ’s popular nationwide and has promised an immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq .
If the contest is n’t close , the vote - rigging wo n’t matter .
If , on the other hand , Obama wins the nomination ( or even the VP spot ) , Rove ’s prospects brighten considerably .
Largely unvetted by the media , the self - described agent of change carries considerable baggage from his stint as a state legislator , particularly his long - running relationship with a notorious Chicago slumlord named Tony Rezko .
So far , the mainstream press has paid lip service to the affair and instead portrayed Obama as a fresh new face in American politics .
The author of the Time magazine article , Jay Newton - Small , offered the following explanation to account for the bizarre love affair G.O.P. voters say they ’re having with an African American senator on the other side of the aisle .
" It seems a lot of Republicans took to heart Obama ’s statement in his rousing speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention that ‘ there is not a liberal America and a conservative America — there is the United States of America . ’ "
Is he kidding ?
The conservative publication National Journal claims Obama ’s voting record is the most liberal in the senate .
Although not everyone agrees with the assessment , it ’s hard to picture the voting pattern that Mr. Small implies here : Nixon – Reagan – Bush – Dole – Bush – Obama .
Yet he and his cohorts across the media spectrum – from NBC to NPR – daily provide this very spin on reality , even as they dismiss Clinton as a disparaged figure within her own party .
Last year , at the same time she commanded a huge lead in the national polls , political analysts and professional strategists hired by CNN and other broadcast networks began hammering across the notion that " the voters do n’t like her " .
The adjectives " unlikable " , " divisive " and " polarizing " are repeated over and over in the same manner as terms like " biological warfare " and " weapons of mass destruction " were branded on the American conscience in the lead - up to the Iraq War .
In both cases , the terminology is traceable to right - wing ideologues , especially those who frequent Fox News programs .
" There is no candidate on record , a front - runner for a party ’s nomination , who has entered the primary season with negatives as high as she has , " Rove told Reuters last August .
The Bush Administation ’s former senior political strategist recently joined Fox an an election analyst .
Obama himself frequently recites Rove ’s " high negatives " comment in press interviews whenever discussing Clinton .
His often bitter criticism of the former First Lady and other " Washington insiders " , who he says want to " boil and stew all the hope out of him " , represents a staple of his core political message .
His campaign slogan of " I ’m a uniter , not a divider " is also reminiscent of the Bush 2000 campaign , which Rove managed .
According to Marisa Guthrie of BC Beat , Obama campaign speechwriter Ben Rhodes is the brother of David Rhodes , a Fox News VP .
The latter Rhodes has been with the network since its inception in 1996 .
You may recall that on election night in November 2000 , it was Fox that called Florida for Bush , even though the other networks declared Gore the winner , citing the exit polls .
How
Fox knew the polls were wrong in advance of the vote tabulation has never been explained .
Her naysayers aside , on Super Tuesday , Clinton captured sizeable majorities in the population - rich states of California , New York , Massachusetts and New Jersey .
While Obama won most of the the red states in play , Clinton took Tennessee , Oklahoma , Arizona , New Mexico and Arkansas .
Obama later closed the gap in delegates with wins in the caucus states of Washington and Nebraska , along with the Louisiana primary on February 9th .
These victories were followed by Maryland , Virginia and D.C. , giving Obama a 55 - delegate lead , according to the Associated Press .
However , neither candidate is expected to reach the 2025 - delegate mark needed to cinch the nomination before the convention in August .
Presidential Race or Next American Idol ?
Now that McCain has locked up the Republican nomination , it ’s likely that crossover voting will intensify in the remaing primary statses .
Yet even when the race was hotly contested , only one in three voters cast ballots for Republican candidates nationwide .
In red -state New Hampshire , 50,000 more votes were cast for Democrats than Republicans , about 10 pecent of the total voter turnout .
In Iowa , the lopsided vote was even more pronounced .
G.O.P. winner Mike Huckabee received only half the number of votes cast for Clinton , who placed third behind Obama and Edwards .
As ominous a portent as that may be , the Clinton campaign must also contend with a succesful branding campaign mounted by the professional public relations team working for her opponent .
Both traditional progressives and younger voters appear to have taken the Obama agent of change premise at face value .
A constant stream of You - Tube videos touting the candidate ’s rock star status , especially the popular " Obama Girl " clip watched by millions , has n’t exactly hurt his cause .
And nobody would have predicted a few years ago that left - leaning pundits would join in an unholy alliance with Fox to help defeat a popular liberal promising immediate troop withdrawals , but here we are .
Journalists like Ari Berman , editor of The Nation , are popping up on Fox programs they once labeled as 24/7 campaign commercials for the Republican Party .
The fact that Obama is known to have watered down legislation requiring nuclear giant Exelon to publicly disclose radiation leaks does n’t seem to trouble them in the least .
Exelon is Obama ’s fourth largest campaign contributor .
( Read the New York Times article about the controversy . )
In a blog posted the morning after the Iowa Caucus , Adrianna Huffington lauded the Illniois senator as practically the Second Coming .
She did n’t have much to offer in the way of specifics , however , and spent the bulk of her remarks railing at Bill Clinton , who she said had conducted himself in an interview as " arrogant and entitled , dismissive and fear - mongering " .
Huffington , it should be noted , was one of several progressive politicos swindled by the California recall referendum in 2002 .
That was the year Enron ’s Ken Lay , on the hook for $ 3 billion pilfered trom the state in the rolling blackouts scandal , succeeded in installing " Governator " Arnold Schwarzenegger through the back door .
Candidate Huffington dropped out of the race a few days before the election , conceding the entire affair had been a set - up to divide the Democratic vote .
That she and her peers have allowed themselves to be bamboozled a second time is astonishing .
With a few clicks of a mouse , they might have easily learned that former Speaker Dennis Hastert and the Illinois G.O.P. fielded a non-Illinois resident named Alan Keyes to run against Obama for the U.S. senate seat in 2004 .
Keyes , who had little public office experience , was hand - picked to replace Jack Ryan , the candidate who offically won the G.O.P. primary .
Ryan was forced to resign in the wake of an alleged sex scandal involving his ex-wife .
( A bit of trivia – The ex-wife is actress Jeri Ryan , who played the character " Seven of Nine " in the television series Star Trek Voyager . )
In the general election , Alan Keyes received 27 percent of the vote to Obama ’s 70 percent .
Here ’s a little more history you wo n’t find at HuffPost or The Nation :
At the time of his senate run , Obama was a relatively minor player , a two - term state legislator who lost a congressional race against African American incumbent Bobbie Rush in 2000 .
Obama ’s first significant campaign donor in the 1990 ’s was Antoin " Tony " Rezko , a Chicago power broker and developer who he met while still in law school .
After leaving Harvard , Obama hired on with a community nonprofit agency in Chicago called Project VOTE , where he helped organze voter registration efforts .
He later joined the law firm Miner Barnhill & Galland , whose clients included Rezko , and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago .
Obama worked on ( and later endorsed as a senator ) a low - income senior housing development deal in which Rezko and a partner firm run by Allison Davis collected $ 855,000 in development fees .
According to the Chicago Sun -Times , " In addition to the development fees , a separate Davis - owned company stood to make another $ 900,000 through federal tax credits . "
Later , while Rezko was busy fundraising for Obama , tenants in other Rezko developments launched with taxpayer dollars were having their heat cut off and other maintenance problems left unattended .
The City of Chicago eventually sued Rezko , and an F.B.I. investigation into unrelated fraud allegations led to a felony indictment .
Rezko is charged with illegally obtaining income through kickbacks and bribes , with a trial set to begin February 25th .
Last June , Davis ’ longtime business associate William Moorehead was convicted of stealing $ 1 million in public housing funds .
( For more on the housing deals and Obama ’s strange bedfellows , read the articles in the Sun - Times . )
According to Edward McClelland , writing for Salon.com , " Rezko , after all , built part of his fortune by exploiting the black community that Obama had served in the state Senate , and by milking government programs meant to benefit black - owned businesses . "
While it may be unclear why Obama would continue his relationship with Rezco after this point , it ’s indisputable that he did .
In 2005 , Obama approached Rezko for help in purchasing a $ 2 million Georgian - revival home in a Chicago suburb .
The property deal involved two adjoining lots that the owner wanted to sell together .
Rezko ’s wife bought the first , while Obama acquired the parcel with the mansion for $ 300,000 less than the asking price .
Although no laws were broken in the transaction , Obama ’s 17 - year long relationship with Rezko may represent a significant liability in achieving his presidential aspirations .
Or so one would think .
Remarkably , the connection went unreported by the national media until the CNN debate in South Carolina on January 17th , when Clinton raised the matter of the Chicago slumlord .
CNN duly followed - up , interviewing the Sun- Times reporter who broke the story , and confirmed her claim .
Some of Obama ’s campaign donations over the years have come from sources named in the federal indictment .
While the Chicago Sun -Times puts the figure of known tainted cash at $ 168,000 , the senator initially agreed to give half that amount to charity , but only as an " abundance of caution " , a senior staffer said .
Later , after NBC Nightly News grudgingly broadcast a story about the affair , the campaign announced it would donate the entire amount .
Soon , however , the crimes of Clinton ’s opponent would be transferred onto her .
During an early morning interview broadcast on the Today show , Matt Lauer brandished a photograph showing Rezko posing with President Clinton and his wife during the 1990s , then grilled the sleepy - eyed , former First Lady about her relationship to Rezko .
Neither she nor the former President appeared to have any history with the developer , yet NBC deftly managed to cast aspersions on them , not Barack Obama .
More recently , Brian Williams repeated the journalistic sleight of hand when airing a segment on Obama ’s Exelon ties .
OutFoxing Fox News
NBC may in fact be outFoxing Fox News when it comes to sabotauging Clinton ’s presidential hopes .
On the night before the New Hampshire primary , Williams followed Obama around on the campaign trail , flashing a Newsweek cover of the senator while proclaining to viewers that the Obama campaign had now become a " movement " .
During the same broadcast , Andrea Mitchell described the Clinton campaign as broke , desperate , and ablaze with in - fighting .
Mitchell continued with this theme the following night , even as Hillary led in the vote tally .
She assured viewers that the results would eventually tip in favor of Obama .
She was mistaken .
Following the South Carolina primary , both Mitchell and Tim Russert claimed on Nightly News and Today that the leadership of the Democratic Party was " mad as hell " at Bill Clinton for " attacking " Obama , and were lining up to back the Illinois senator .
The charge was not corroborated with any sources .
Russert also informed Matt Lauer that Ted and Caroline Kennedy ’s endorsement of Obama represented a sea change in the election , insinuating that because Bobby Kennedy was friends with Cesar Chavez , founder of the United Farmworkers , the endorsement should pave the way for Obama to capture the Latino vote .
What NBC ’s crack team of reporters failed to mention was that three of Bobby Kennedy ’s own children , the son of Cesar Chavez and the United Farmworkers union had already endorsed Clinton .
In Nevada , Latinos in the 60,000 member Culinary Workers Union defied their white male leadership ’s endorsement of Obama and helped Clinton win the caucus there .
While the Florida primary was showing Clinton with a 15 percent lead in the polls , CNN fill - in anchor Bob Acosta complemented NBC ’s aggressive push by declaring the Obama campaign had become a " runaway train " following its big South Carolina victory .
On February 10th , CBS anchor Katy Couric joined the Clinton - bashing fray in a 60 Minutes segment , barraging Clinton with multiple questions about how she would deal with losing the election .
The contentious exchange followed a far more upbeat piece on Obama , who at the time was trailing Clinton in delegates .
To wit , if there ’s a runaway train in this race , it is n’t either of the candidates .
For the past 20 years , media outlets have become increasingly consolidated into chains owned by multinational corporations whose primary mission is to enhance their bottom lines .
The NBC / MSNBC network , for example , is owned by General Electric .
Tim Russert ’s Meet the Press served as a principle outpost in the dissemination of the weapons of mass destruction argument used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq , while Andrea Mitchell , who appears on televsion almost exclusively to criticize Hillary Clinton , is married to former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan .
Some journalists admit off - camera that Clinton has not been treated fairly in the course of the campaign .
For his part , Howard Kurtz published an article in the Washington Postin December examining the widespread media bias favoring Obama .
" The Illinois senator ’s fundraising receives far less press attention than Clinton ’s , " Kurtz wrote .
" When the Washington Post reported last month that Obama used a political action committee to hand more than $ 180,000 to Democratic groups and candidates in the early - voting states of Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina , the suggestion that he might be buying support received no attention on the network newscasts . "
Fear of Flying novelist Erica Jong later offered a possible explanation for the unequal treatment in Hillary vs. the Patriarchy , also published in the Washington Post .
Unlike her big Florida victory , the news of Clinton ’s New Hampshire win was not blacked out from coast to coast the next day , but more dark clouds were brewing on the horizon .
Accusations of racism surfaced as on - air pundits and Obama surrogates argued that New England ’s white voters had betrayed their publicly declared support of the black candidate in the secrecy of the polling booth .
When Clinton made a speech in South Carolina tying Martin Luther King ’s " I have a dream " speech to President Johnson ’s signing of the 1964 Cvil Rights Act , highlighting the role of Johnson , the Obama camp siezed on the opportunity .
An advisor circulated a memorandum urging the faithful to slam Clinton for being disrespectful to King .
If you tracked the coverage of the ensuing feud , you would never know that it was this document that sparked the episode .
Before the memo showed on the internet , Obama assured reporters that neither he nor anyone on his staff had accused Senator Clinton of any impropriety in her speech about Johnson , adding he was " baffled " by her suggestion that they were somehow involved .
Meanwhile , South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn said the Clintons ’ aggressive reaction to the accusation of racism had compelled him to renege on an earlier promise to the Democratic National Committee not endorse a candidate before his state ’s primary .
A few days later , Clyburn retracted his endorsement of Obama , but the damage was done .
The Clintons have been barbecued ever since for " playing the race card " against Obama .
When the former President launched into an angry ( albeit laudable ) tirade against the media ’s role in executing underhanded campaign manuevers , the networks used the occasion to argue that he was upstaging his spouse .
Even as commander - in - chief , the pundits explained , Hillary would still be unable to control him .
Clinton Unplugged
Intelligent and astute , the New York senator has historically shied away from personal attacks , whether it comes from Manhattan ’s sexist firefighters or Chris Matthews of MSNBC ’s Hardball .
Her campaign only briefly cut off relations with NBC when another reporter , David Schuster , said the Clintons had " pimped - out " daughter Chelsea as part of their election strategy .
This is not to say Clinton is n’t capable of landing a knock - out punch when provoked .
During the ABC New Hampshire debate , she slammed the tag - team antics of John Edwards and Barack Obama when they tried to portray her as the voice of the " status quo " .
She informed the audience that both men supported Vice - President Dick Cheney ’s 2005 energy legslation , a bill " larded with subsidies for the oil companies " .
She opposed the legislation .
However , it was her performance in two CNN debates broadcast from South Carolina and California that elevated Clinton to the A - List of celebrity icons .
In both contests , she took the gloves off to pound Obama on his record and statements uttered along the campaign trail .
In the first debate , she highlighted his habit of voting " present " in the Illinois legislature , along his characterization of Ronald Reagan as a " transformative " president and the Republican Party during that period as the " party of ideas " .
She said , " I ’m just reacting to the fact , yes , they did have ideas , and they were bad ideas .
. . .
Bad for America , and I was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor [ Tony ] Rezko in his slum landlord business in inner-city Chicago . "
In Hollywood , she delivered her other memorable soundbite , " It took a Clinton to clean after the first President Bush , and it ’s going to take another Clinton to clean up after the second President Bush .
"
Over four million domestic viewers tuned in to the South Carolina debate , breaking a cable record .
Twice that many watched the second debate .
Many millions more saw the verbal prize fights on CNN ’s international broadcast .
Nevertheless , Clinton seems remiss in doing relatively little challenge the media ’s manipulation of the electorate .
Having agreed to appear in an NBC debate shortly before the Texas and Ohio primaries , she ’s sure to be walking into another ambush .
Like Benazir Bhutto , the years of political bludgeoning may have short - circuited her ability to navigate the minefields of the body politic ( or even to appoint competent advisors ) .
Regarding Karl Rove and the Bush - Cheney team , all she has mustered to date is her oft - repeated statement , “ They ’re not going to surrender the White House voluntarily . "
Last spring , she suggested that another terrorist attack against the United States would inevitably play into the hands of the G.O.P .
Vague as they sound , those two comments may prove prophetic in the event the Obama strategy fails and she goes on to win the Democratic nomination .
The implications of a female president for American foreign and domestic policy are profound , creating jitters not only on Wall Street but for the Pentagon , the CIA and the State Department .
It ’s possible that a significant number of officials accused of breaking U.S. laws or violating the Geneva Conventions might be arrested and prosecuted by a Clinton - directed Justice Department .
If that ’s not enough to keep Bush appointees and generals lying awake deep into the night , their long - running undercover operation with the ayatollahs in Iran ( who paved the way for Reagan ’s 1980 election ) , the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence , and the Saudi royal family could be curtailed by the staunchly pro-women ’s rights democrat .
The Saudis especially have reason to fret now that they and their counterparts in Kuwait and the U.A.E. have started buying up huge stakes in U.S. banks .
Condolleeza Rice and Nancy Pelosi are one thing .
A Clinton White House is quite another .
For his part , President Bush may have implemented a back - up plan last April when he signed National Security Presidential Directive / NSPD 51 , an executive order allowing him to suspend the constitution without prior congressional approval .
NSPD 51 gives the President the discretion to declare a state of emergency ( i.e. martial law ) in the event of a major terrorist attack or other “ decapitating ” incident against the United States , even if the attack happens outside the country .
Under this scenario , he can cancel elections , padlock the Capitol dome and send the Supreme Court justices home .
The directive also allows assigns the President ’s homeland security assistant ( a low - level position exempt from senate confirmation ) to administer what has been dubbed the Enduring Constitutional Government .
In other words , another Sept. 11th disaster could reduce this year ’s election to nothing more than the status of a season of Survivor .
( Here ’s the text of the directive . )
Delegating the Superdelegates
Assuming the homeland security assistant does n’t take over the country before next August , the Democratic Party ’s 796 superdelegates will decide the nomination .
About half are elected officials , including members of Congress and governors .
The other half are party officials , former campaign managers and ex-officials .
The specter of less than 800 people determining the ticket in November has set Obama surrogates back on their haunches , this time arguing that a " brokered convention " decided in " smoky back rooms " will destroy the party .
Initially it was thought that two - thirds of the superdelegates were pledged for Clinton , but more recent surveys suggest the situation is fluid .
Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean has issued a press release reassuring Americans that he will intervene before August if the race still remains deadlocked .
The extent of his authority to do so relies on the cooperation of both candidates .
The DNC is also considering the possibility of holding caucuses in Michigan and Florida in April or May as a way to allocate their delegates , which were stripped because the states were not granted " waivers " to hold primaries before February 5th .
The Clinton campaign , which originally agreed to the ban , has since argued that both delegations should be seated according to the primary results .
In the case of the Florida primary , the argument has merit , given that Democratic voters there recorded the largest turnout in history .
It also appears some of Obama ’s cable TV spots appeared in the state , though he was not accused of violating the pledge not to campaign there .
Clinton won 50 percent of the popular vote , Obama 33 percent , and John Edwards 16 percent .
State Senator Bill Nelson , a Clinton supporter , has balked at the suggestion that the ballots cast by 1.7 million Floridians – it ’s the nation ’s fourth most populous state – should be replaced with caucuses that might at best attract 50,000 participants .
It was Florida ’s Republican - controlled legislature that set the date for the primary , state party officials point out , not them .
Michigan held its primary on January 15th .
Since Obama and Edwards pulled their names from the ballot beforehand , the votes for Clinton cannot be said to represent a mandate .
Unfortunately for her , the stripped delegates in both cases have worked in Obama ’s favor .
With its high percentage of hispanic voters , Florida could have been forecast as a Clinton treasure trove .
The same is true for Michigan , whose native son Mit Romney ’s candidacy precluded the possiblity of a large crossover vote of Republicans there .
Michigan boasts a relatively low number of upper - middle - class whites , one of Obama ’s strongest performing constituencies .
Had the DNC not sanctioned the state , Clinton would likely have hauled in the lion ’s share of 156 delegates up for grabs .
( The G.O.P. , by the way , did n’t punish either state for moving up their primaries . )
One can not blame her for experiencing some measure of frustration .
If the DNC opts to schedule caucuses , Obama would emerge the victor , since this form of voting typically requires traveling long distances , waiting outside a building in while volunteers sort out the logistics , and then attending a meeting that lasts one or two hours .
Such factors tend to deter the participation of older voters ; immigrants ; those who work , need childcare or have other obligations during the narrow time frame of the caucus ; and those for whom English is a second language .
In a nutshell , this represents the Clinton base .
And it gets worse .
Of the remaining states left to vote , Texas and Wisconsin will hold open primaries , which portends of a large crossover vote to put Obama over the top .
( Texas was gerrymandered under Tom Delay to favor a Republican lock on most districts . )
The state party in Texas also allots a third of its delegates by way of a caucus .
Thus , even Clinton ’s superdelegate failsafe may prove insufficient in overcoming the shrewdly stacked deck against her .
Thanks to Karl Rove and his friends in the shadows , the Democratic nominee may ultimately be determined not by Democrats but by the G.O.P. , with the help of its unwitting accomplices at the DNC .

Jerry
Yang ’s got some pink slips to hand out in the next couple of weeks .
So goes the rumor floating around the blogosphere at the moment .
According to Silicon Alley Insider ’s Henry Blodget , Yahoo ! is looking to soon slim its 12,000 - strong workforce by 13 - 20 % .
Should this tip be given any credence ?
Perhaps .
The Wall Street Journal recently published a piece ( subscription needed ) documenting strong evidence that Yahoo ! ’s chief executive will begin to take strong measures to turn around the company ’s fortunes , which may well include a significant cutback in employee numbers .
Yahoo !
has borne the brunt of much criticism in the way it has addressed lagging performance in the face of increasing competitive pressures delivered by the faster - moving Google complex .
A little weight loss could be essential to the recovery process .
Going back to a column I put together on Jan 11 , I claimed that a Yahoo !
buyout was unlikely .
I still stand by that belief .
Yet I will secede from my previous statement on Yahoo ! ’s current health .
Whereas a week ago I recognized the company as not weak , I ’ll attest now that it ’s really not looking so good .
Yang sure has a big mess on his hands .
All is not lost , though .
Edits ( like the supposed layoffs to come shortly ) and amendments can be enacted to right the ship once again .
But things could very easily go from bad to much , much worse fairly quickly in the months to come .
If public perception is that Big Y ! is faltering company - wide , the performance of its ticker symbol will head ever more gradually on a decline , and one ca n’t rule out a snowball effect of bad tidings for the Web giant in ’08 as a result .
So CEO Jerry is going to have to do a sterling job of balancing caution with intelligent risk to alter the fate of the company ( which he co-founded with David Filo ) .
He ’s got a strong interest in making the corporate gearing – the managers , salesmen , and the software engineers alike – work well again .
Yahoo !
is what he is best known for , and there is no reason to think that he wants to see his legacy overshadowed by a big ol ’ sore spot .
Pride and joy are likely what he aims for .
We ’ll have to wait and see if he and his teammates in Sunnyvale succeed in achieving that mission .
BAGHDAD , Monday , Sept. 3 — The British Army began withdrawing from its last base in Basra ’s city center early Monday , a move that will leave Iraq ’s second - largest city without foreign forces for the first time since the American - led invasion in 2003 .
Basra residents reported overnight that they saw British military trucks accompanied by armored vehicles and helicopters leaving the base , Basra Palace , beside the Shatt al Arab waterway , heading for their airport headquarters miles outside the city , the oil - industry hub of southern Iraq .
While the British exit from Basra had been widely anticipated , the British government has given no timetable for the eventual withdrawal of British troops from Iraq .
British officials would not publicly confirm the withdrawal of the 500 or so remaining troops in the palace , apparently fearing that the disclosure would compromise their security .
However , the Ministry of Defense said through a spokesman in London : “ There is an operation under way .
It is ongoing now and will continue to be ongoing for hours , possibly days . ”
Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen Hot Power Couple ( Photos )
Having a hard time deciding who is better looking ?
Me too ! andreek of good genes .
We hope that Gisele is n't in for the same treatment Dallas fans recently foisted onwhen they claimed she brought down their NFL quarterback
Brady , NFL quarterback for the top ranked New England Patriots , is riding high right now but he's in for a couple of challenging games if his team is destined to claim all of the glory on Superbowl Sunday , February 3rd in Glendale , Arizona .
The couple was out for a stroll in New York yesterday .
They look like they do n't have a care in the world .
Brady has reason to be calm .
The Patriots had a perfect regular season - 16 wins , zero losses .
The playoffs will begin this weekend and his team has a week off to heal and get ready for the second round .
Keep on reading and check out the pictures too .
We are n't sure how serious the relationship is between these two incredibly good looking celebrities but can you imagine what beautiful babies they could make together .
Sigh ....
Enjoy the photos .
PALERMO , Italy ( Reuters ) - A teacher who forced a pupil to write “ I am a retard ” 100 times was acquitted by an Italian court on Wednesday of abuse charges .
The teacher , whose identity was withheld to protect her privacy , forced the punishment on the 12 - year - old boy after he blocked a fellow pupil from going to the toilet and called him “ gay ” and “ girly . ”
The parents had sought 25,000 euros ( $ 33,580 ) in damages and a public prosecutor had called for a two - month prison sentence , but the court cleared the teacher , a court source said .
The teacher said her punishment of the boy had been appropriate , particularly after a widely publicized case of an adolescent who committed suicide in Italy , apparently after receiving taunts at school about being homosexual .
Gay rights groups had called for the charges to be dropped .
“ I never intended to humiliate the boy , ” the teacher told journalists after she was cleared .
In Italian , she made the boy write : “ Io sono deficiente , ” which literally means “ deficient ” but is more commonly used as a disparaging term meaning “ moron ” or “ mentally retarded . ”
“ I explained , discussing with him and his classmates , that deficient means ‘ lacking ’ .
He was ‘ lacking ’ sensitivity for one of his classmates , ” the teacher said .
There are so many things that a potential blog network owner should do before actually showing the world their sites , and I think that most people who decide to start a network , are really unaware of the challenges that they will have to surpass .
Thanks to the prodding of Ahmed Bilal , I have come up with this list of forty - six things you should do before launching a blog network .
Money
1. ) Building a network costs money , even if you build the sites from scratch .
Get together enough capital to keep the whole thing running for six months .
It will take at least that long to get really noticed by the world , and especially by search engines .
2. ) Create a list of expenses , and add a fifteen percent buffer zone .
Things like hosting costs , business supplies , and business cards all add up quickly .
3. ) Are you hiring writers ?
Designers ?
Developers ?
Budget properly for each of these expenses .
It can be very hard , especially early on to find people willing to work for you at the rates you can afford , but if you cast a wide net , and work hard at selecting the right people for the job at a price you can afford , you will be more successful .
4. ) Spending money on advertising to get the word out there ?
Make sure you budget for each type of advertising separately .
Banner advertising , paid posts or reviews , text links , press releases and even some social media attention can cost a fair bit of money .
Do n’t over extend yourself early on .
Goals
5. ) Write a list of goals you would like your network to reach every month for a year , and then every half a year after that .
Be realistic , not conservative , and not ridiculous .
If you make your goals too easy , you wo n’t push yourself as hard .
6. ) Do n’t let yourself fail .
Put a support system in place .
Have friends ready to cheer you on , and find others willing to give a helping hand if needed .
Blog Overview
7. ) How will your blogs be different ?
What will make them unique ?
Positioning your blog is key .
Will their be more posts per day than your competition ?
Will you have a well known writer or celebrity writing on the blog ?
8. ) Every blog should have content before being launched .
If you show the world blogs with no content , they probably wo n’t come back .
I suggest having at least half a dozen posts on a blog before you even begin to promote it .
9. ) Every blog should have a proper about page .
Check out the Five P’s of improving your about page .
10 . ) Check every feature on each blog .
Can you comment , search , and properly view the archives ?
11 . ) Check over your design .
Does it work on all the major browsers ?
What about the major operating systems ?
Not only do you have to worry about inconsistencies between Internet Explorer and Firefox , but also OS X and Windows .
Hosting
12 . ) Find proper hosting , do n’t skimp and go cheap , or you ’ll just end up changing later .
Get something good , keep it within a certain budget , but find out about their support .
You do n’t want to have your site go down when social networking traffic comes to any of your blogs .
And if for some reason they do go down , you want to be assured that they will get them back up as quickly as possible .
13 . ) Think about expansion .
Will you need to get a dedicated server down the line ?
If so , begin to think about data organization , and your ability to transition .
14 . ) Document the steps you took in setting up your blogs .
What databases did you create , which sites are they for , did you use any custom scripts ?
Documentation can be the key to managing your blogs properly , especially if you are using things like Subversion , shell scripting , or special PHP scripts .
E-mail
15 . ) Set up e-mail accounts for the network , making sure that each one works .
[ email protected ] should not bounce !
While this can lead to a fair bit of spam management on your part , a key goal in building a line of communication is making sure those that want to contact you , do n’t have to think hard or search for long .
16 . ) Add a contact form to the blog network site , and / or each blog in the network and make sure it works correctly .
17 . ) Can you easily check your e-mail ?
What about when you are away from your normal computer ?
Do n’t just think that because you have a desktop mail client set up that you are set .
Make sure you have some way to access it away from home .
Advertising
18 . ) Create accounts with the major advertising companies .
Google ’s AdSense , Text - Link - Ads , Azoogle and others .
Even if you are n’t planning on using them right away , you will have them set up , and most have a newsletter which informs users of new products or services that might help you monetize your blogs .
19 . ) Find out the best affiliate programs in your niche , and sign up for them .
There are affiliate programs for pretty much any niche you can think of , and while many of them may not pay well , it is still an advertising option which may benefit you at one point or another .
20 . ) Add your advertising to each blog , making sure you can easily manage its colors and positioning .
You will most likely have to change your advertising a few times before you find the right sized advertising unit , and place it in the best converting spot , so make it easy to change .
21 . ) If you are going to be advertising with AdWords , spend time researching the proper keywords for each of your sites .
Even if you are n’t going to be using AdWords , keyword research is key , and can help bring advertisers to your site at a later date .
WordPress
22 . ) Use proper permalinks to make your blog more search engine and user friendly .
I suggest /% category % / %postname % / , but others use / %year % / %postname % / or just /%postname % /.
I do n’t know which one is the best , but in having the category in the URL , I am hoping it brings forward another keyword for search engines to see .
The option for this is under Options and then Permalinks .
23 . ) Remove the calendar from the sidebar of your design .
No one uses it .
Do n’t believe me ?
Look at other networks and professional blogs .
I doubt you will see many calendars in the sidebar .
This is because calendars are a horrible way for users to find what they are looking for .
Categories , tags , and search are much better , and more direct .
The space that the calendar took up could be better used .
24 . ) Make sure the wp- content / uploads directory is writable on each blog .
This is constantly overlooked .
To test , go to the area where you would write a post , and attempt to upload an image to your blog .
If you are able to upload an image , then your permissions are set properly .
If you are unable to upload an image , change your wp - content / uploads directory to 755 , making sure it does so recursively .
If you do n’t understand this , make sure you find someone that does , or research CHMOD and Permissions on Google .
Graphics
25 . ) Have a professional design for each blog in your network .
Branding each blog is very important , and just as important is to properly brand your Network ’s main page .
Having a similar design is fine , and can make it easier to control certain elements , but if all your sites look exactly the same visually , then they may have problems building up their own unique brands .
26 . ) A professional logo design can set you apart , even if it is text only using an effective font .
It can say a great deal about your network .
You can easily find some amazing talent on a variety of web forums and usually these will be far better than what you can come up with yourself , and not cost too much money .
Networking
27 . ) Create a list of all competing blogs in the niches your network wants to enter .
Research both the leaders , and the failures .
Create a list of what you liked and what you disliked about each site .
Add the things you liked to your blogs .
28 . ) Get the contact information of other bloggers in your selected niches , as they can be the best way to promote your pillar content , and gain links .
Writers
29 . ) A one man army rarely succeeds .
Research the best places to find writers for the niches you are going to cover and in the languages you require .
I highly recommend Freelance Writing Jobs .
30 . ) If you are going to have more than two or three writers , you will want to create a management system .
Usually networks use a private forum where everyone can communicate .
I have found that having everyone on the same instant messaging client works wonders , and that a private blog that is constantly updated is n’t a bad idea either .
31 . ) Unless they have been blogging forever , your writers are going to need some training material .
Maybe on the blogging platform you use , or in writing for the web .
Luckily , Performancing has a great list of articles all bloggers should read at least once .
RSS
32 . ) Check to make sure your RSS feeds work correctly .
Using WordPress ?
There is more than one RSS Feed .
Check the comments feed , the RSS 0.92 and RSS 2.0 feed , as well as the Atom feed .
Different visitors may subscribe to different feed technology , depending on their personal preferences .
33 . ) Do you have a way to track your RSS feed statistics ?
Feedburner provides such a service , and even better , you can keep using your domain , now that their Pro version is free .
34 . ) Have you made it easy to find the subscription option on your blogs ?
Pushing content to a user is much better than having them try to remember to return .
35 . ) Create an account for each blog on Google Reader or a similar service .
Add a variety of competing blogs , popular sources for news in your niche , and other good sources of information .
Duplicate this niche focused subscription list for every one of your writers .
Most services provide an export and import tool to allow you to easily replicate the lists you build up .
Not only is this great for new writers , but it also allows you to influence the quality of the sources for your content .
Domains
36 . ) Research domain registrars .
Just because you have always used the same one , does n’t mean it is the best for your network .
As you grow you will want a flexible domain registrar that is inexpensive , but will also be around for the long haul .
Joe ’s Domain
Shoppe , might not be the best place to buy domains , even if they are only $ 1.99 each .
37 . ) Pick your domains carefully .
Each one is a brand on its own .
It should be easy to remember , interesting , and shorter is better .
As I have mentioned before , I use Instant Domain Search , to come up with the domains that I use .
38 . ) Register for multiple years if you can afford it .
Research says that longer domain registrations creates more trust from search engines because short term spammers do n’t want to pay for multiple years of domain registrations .
Work Flow
39 . ) You and your writers are going to be cropping and editing lots of pictures .
For Windows users , I suggest using Irfanview for cropping , sharpening , and other simple edits .
It is free and does n’t use up much system resources .
40 . ) Create an organizational system , using whatever software you feel comfortable with , to track your tasks , payment details , advertising and hosting accounts , and other important information .
I would suggest a tool like Basecamp would be very effective as long as you make sure to update it often .
Management
41 . ) You will have days where you ca n’t do everything you hoped , and there will be days where you are sick and ca n’t do anything .
Make sure you and your writers have some content on reserve , find some people that can cover for you when you are sick , and create ways to automate the majority of the business functions .
You ’ll know that you have done well , if you can take a day off , and know that things will be fine when you get back .
Backup
42 . ) Create a backup routine for the files on the server , the database , and the files on your own work computer .
I suggest daily for the database , weekly for the files on the server , and monthly for your own work computer .
If you can back up more often , then do it .
There is nothing worse than lost content .
43 . ) Test your backup system before launching .
Test it again before upgrading or changing any software .
I do n’t know how many times I have tried to restore from a backup that did n’t work .
Periodic testing of your backup and restore procedure can save many headaches when an emergency does happen .
44 . ) Test your ability to restore a backup .
Even some compressed database files are too large to be managed through phpMyAdmin ’s web interface .
You may need Shell access or a server administrator that is able and willing to restore your database .
Such restores may cost money !
Statistics
45 . ) Sign up for a metrics account to track the stats on each of your blogs .
Some good ones include Google Analytics and Performancing Metrics .
Exit Strategy
46 . ) You should always have an exit strategy , as the blogosphere is unpredictable , and so is life .
You may fall ill , run out of money , or just lose interest in continuing to build your network .
Conclusion
If you have made it through to the end of this list , then you are most likely prepared to launch your blog network onto the world .
There will always be things that will pop up and create issues along the way , so the more time you can spend researching and preparing , the better of you will be .
This list will also help give you the best chance for success , as it will help save you time later , and as we all know , time is the one thing you ca n’t buy more of .

Last Update :

BBC News , Mogadishu
The once - bustling streets of Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu , are now eerily empty .
The southern neighbourhoods are littered with the scars of recent fighting between the insurgents and Ethiopian - backed forces of the transitional government .
Ethiopian tanks have taken up positions outside the houses of the hundreds of thousands of residents who have fled the city - estimated to be 60 % of the city 's population .
Forty - two - year - old Shamsa Nur Ali was one of those who could stand it no longer .
This Mogadishu street used to be full of activity Towards the end of last month she sought refuge with her children and her aged mother in Daynile , on the southern outskirts of Mogadishu .
The family of six now lives under a tree where they depend on relatives nearby - also displaced by the violence - and are lucky to get one meal a day .
Before their departure , the family had considered itself fortunate as Mrs Nur 's husband had a wheelbarrow and could earn an income from transporting goods for people in the market .
" We are suffering enough .
No shelter , no food and no hope , " says Mrs Nur .
" Plus there is the fear that the fighting could spread here and drive us away again . "
Malnutrition
Her husband , Mohamed Issaq , finds the situation equally depressing .
" I am not comfortable about it , but there is nothing I can do , " he says .
Sometimes the food runs out and sometimes the agencies do not come
Fadumo Khalif
Displaced Mogadishu resident " There is no work and it is too dangerous to go back to market . "
Other Mogadishu families have trekked to the neighbouring provinces of Middle and Lower Shabelle - the area was once the country 's breadbasket - for safety .
But the region has been hit by floods and drought .
Prices of basic goods have shot up , meaning many Somalis cannot afford to buy food , leading to widespread malnutrition .
Aid workers estimate that 100,000 displaced people are now living in the villages between Mogadishu and Afgoye , along the road that links the capital to the south .
Both local and international aid agencies are doing their best to help .
Destitute
They hand out plastic sheets to make improvised shelters and have organised the distribution of what food and water supplies are available .
Shamsa Nur Ali ( l ) fears the fighting could resume any day
They admit it is not enough .
Every morning destitute Somalis line up in their thousands to receive a handout of corn , beans and oil .
" We sometimes line up for food early in the morning and go back to our children at sunset empty - handed , " complains Fadumo Khalif , a 26 - year - old pregnant mother , with a baby strapped to her back .
" Sometimes the food runs out and sometimes the agencies do not come . "
Fear and mistrust
Both the federal government and the regional authorities have called for people to return to their homes but no - one heeds these calls because they say " the troops are still sitting in front of our homes " .
Rumours abound , reinforcing their terror - some say the Ethiopian soldiers deliberately shot civilians as they tried to run away from the fighting .
Our only hope lies in the new prime minister taking steps towards peace
Mustafa Aden
Mogadishu resident Others say that in the city streets that became battlefields more than 50 civilians were found dead , some beheaded .
Islamist insurgents melt into the community , from where they carry out random attacks on the Ethiopians , who they see as an occupying force .
" If outnumbered they went into hiding as before , regrouping when the security operations lessen , " says Mogadishu resident Jama Abdulahi .
" The only solution lies in peaceful negotiations .
Haji Hassan Abukar , 65 , believes that " all respect for human life has been lost " .
" I never fled from my house in the last 16 years ... but this time I felt unsafe because even old people like me were killed , " he says .
Endless cycle
Many residents were trapped for long periods in their homes , fearing they would be shot if they emerged .
The Ethiopian troops are not popular in Somalia " We could not even go out to buy food , there was no water , we were left with no safe place to go , " Abdi Aden told the BBC by telephone .
For many , the newly appointed prime minister , Nur Hassan Hussein , also known as Nur Adde , brings a glimmer of hope that this endless cycle of violence can be ended .
Mr Nur has been the head of the Somali Red Crescent for many years and is seen as untainted by political affiliation .
" Our only hope lies in the new prime minister taking steps towards peace , " says another Mogadishu resident , Mustafa Aden .
" If he supports peaceful dialogue , I hope things will be sorted out . "
Like Mr Aden , other residents say the only resolution to the humanitarian crisis is to put an end to the violence that has forced so many to run for their lives .
But for that , Mr Nur has to build a consensus , reach out to the opposition and give all the Somali factions a perspective that does not involve looking down a gun barrel .

Amnesty International Recreate Guantanamo Bay in London
Last Thursday , Amnesty International brought Guantánamo Bay to London 's American Embassy to mark 6 years since its opening and , more importantly , to raise the profile of the campaign to close the notorious detention centre .
A replica prison cell was installed outside the Embassy and an all night vigil held .
Kate Allen , Amnesty 's Chief Executive , was one of the prisoners .
The following morning , protestors joined the powerfully visual demonstration dressed in orange boiler suits and face masks and camp guards with real guard dogs shouted orders for them to assume stress positions used at Guantánamo Bay .
The message was clear .
It 's time for Guantánamo Bay to close .
You can sign Amnesty 's pledge to tear down Guantánamo here .

BBC News , Baghdad
Sultan Hashim 's supporters say he did not drive policy
The three , including Ali Hassan al - Majid , known as " Chemical Ali " , were condemned to death for the campaign against the Iraqi Kurds in the 1980s .
There has been division in the Iraqi leadership over the executions and the US says it is waiting for consensus .
There is suspicion the US does not want ex-defence chief Sultan Hashim to hang .
It is on the former defence minister , one of Majid 's alleged accomplices , that the controversy is focused .
The death sentences on the three were upheld by an appeals court in September .
Under Iraqi law , the three men should then have been hanged within 30 days .
But the verdict should also have been approved by the three - man presidential council and that is where the issue turned into a major political row .
' Incensed '
President Jalal Talabani , a Kurd himself , opposes the death penalty in principle .
" Chemical Ali " is the cousin of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
One of his two vice - presidents , Tareq al - Hashemi , a Sunni , is particularly incensed by the death sentence on Sultan Hashim and has threatened to resign if it is carried out .
The Americans , who are physically holding the three convicted men , have refrained from handing them over to Mr Maliki 's Shia - led government for execution .
Now Mr Maliki has lashed out at them , accusing the US embassy of dragging its feet and causing a violation of the constitution .
He insists all three men should be delivered for execution .
There is a strong suspicion the US is reluctant to see the former defence minister hang .
It has been widely reported that he was in touch with the CIA during Saddam Hussein 's rule and took part in plots to unseat him .
Sultan Hashim 's supporters , Sunnis and others , say that like many others at the time he was simply obeying orders and not driving policy .
" Some recent studies suggest that over - consumption of fluoride can raise the risks of disorders affecting teeth , bones , the brain and the thyroid gland , " reports Scientific American editors ( January 2008 ) .
" Scientific attitudes toward fluoridation may be starting to shift , " writes author Dan Fagin .
" Fluoride , the most consumed drug in the USA , is deliberately added to 2/3 of public water supplies theoretically to reduce tooth decay , but with no scientifically - valid evidence proving safety or effectiveness , " says lawyer Paul Beeber , President , New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation .
Fagin , award - wining environmental reporter and Director of New York University 's Science , Health and Environmental Reporting Program , writes , " There is no universally accepted optimal level for daily intake of fluoride . "
Some researchers even wonder whether the 1 mg / L added into drinking water is too much , reports Fagin .
After 3 years of scrutinizing hundreds of studies , a National Research Council ( NRC ) committee " concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function , especially in the thyroid – the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism , " reports Fagin .
Fagin quotes John Doull , professor emeritus of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Kansas Medical Center , who chaired the NRC committee thusly , " The thyroid changes do worry me . "
Fluoride in foods , beverages , medicines and dental products can result in fluoride over - consumption , visible in young children as dental fluorosis – white spotted , yellow , brown and / or pitted teeth .
We can't normally see fluoride 's effects to the rest of the body .
Reports Fagin , " a series of epidemiological studies in China have associated high fluoride exposures with lower IQ . "
" ( E ) pidemiological studies and tests on lab animals suggest that high fluoride exposure increases the risk of bone fracture , especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and diabetics , " writes Fagin .

The best and healthiest way to decrease calorie intake is to do it bit by bit .
You would do well to keep a food diary and write down everything that you eat .
Count the calories that you consumed on the day that you began your food diary and then plan the next day ’s meals such that you decrease your intake by , say , 50 calories .

Hillary Clinton is still outraged that Rockstar Games left a sexually - themed mini game nestled in its best - selling Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas in 2005 .
You 'll recall the kerfuffle when the deactivated love scene was found buried in the code for the otherwise wholesome car jacking , cop-killing shooter .
The unfinished mini - game featured clothed characters simulating sex acts .
To access the scene , randy teens had to download and install a special patch developed by a Dutch coder , expending more effort than it takes to find real , human adult content on the web .
That all led some cynics to suspect Clinton of grandstanding when she called a press conference to denounce Rockstar and demand a Federal Trade Commission investigation into San Andreas .
The ESRB re-rated the game to AO for " adults only , " raising the minimum age of purchase from 17 to 18 years old – a crucial year in which a teen develops the necessary psychological defenses to resist the Siren song of polygon porn .
But in a response to a questionnaire from the watchdog group Common Sense Media , Clinton reveals today that she still sees the affair as a victory for child safety .
She describe her introduction of the doomed Family Entertainment Protection Actas a response to the " illicit " sexual content in * San Andreas * , and says , as president , she 'd support regulation of the gaming industry .
" When I am President , I will work to protect children from inappropriate video game content , " she told CSM .
That puts her on the same page as Republican candidate Mitt Romney , who told CSM that the U.S. needs to " get serious against those retailers that sell adult video games that are filled with violence and that we go after those retailers . "
Clinton 's fellow Democrats John Edwards , Barack Obama and Bill Richardson said they 'd rather give the industry a chance to self - regulate , at least initially .
Clinton 's Family Entertainment Protection
Act would have made it a federal offense to sell adult - rated video games to minors .
It never passed , but similar state laws have been struck down as unconstitutional .
Clinton 's co-sponsor on the bill , Joseph Lieberman , had his own video game nemesis : Stubbs the Zombie , who , like too many politicians , needs braaiiiins .

NEW YORK , May 31 ( Reuters Life ! ) - A 7th century skeleton found in an elaborate tomb in Honduras shows ancient Mayan life in the region was more culturally and socially complex than previously thought , anthropologists said .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The tomb ’s construction , the human remains and the artifacts found nearby show the person was an elite member of Mayan society who lived in a complex urban state , according to a report published in National Geographic News .
The tomb was found about 450 meters ( yards ) west of the Mayan ceremonial center of Acropolis in Copan , western Honduras .
Copan is well - known for its grand Mayan monuments and hieroglyphics and is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site .
“ It ’s an extraordinary tomb construction , ” Professor Allan Maca of Colgate University in New York who headed the research team , said in an interview .
“ Never have we found anything outside of the area that is so elaborate ...
We ’ve never had a full picture of the social and political complexity of the city itself , beyond this kind of ceremonial core where the Acropolis is . ”
The team of researchers spent two years excavating and documenting the find , including digital reconstructions of the tomb , after making the discovery in 2005 .
Their findings show the skeleton belonged to a man who died when he was about 50 years old .
He had suffered several debilitating infections and some deformities .
He also had detailed dental work including jade inlays .
“ The studies of the skeletal bone are indicating pathologies that are really unusual , suggesting this was a very unusual and unique person , ” said Maca .
“ The variety and pattern of dental modifications -- they modified their teeth with inlays and different types of stone , including jade -- in this person ’s teeth have never been seen before anywhere in the Maya area . ”
Unusual ceramic vessels were also found , suggesting cultural affiliations between areas of Mesoamerica far beyond the Copan region .
Maca said these clues give researchers a much richer cultural fabric with which to make interpretations of ancient Maya life .
“ We know that people with deformities or illnesses ... were considered special and unusual and were sometimes granted different types of religious and political authority , so that ’s one of the reasons why we ’ve drawn such attention to the pathologies and to the unique features of skeleton itself , ” said Maca who has worked in the region for ten years .
The researchers are continuing excavations in this area .
“ We ’ll be doing that for quite a while .
We ’ve already located at least one other tomb , so it appears we have a funerary complex , an area where important people were laid to rest . ”
Unmanned aircraft are showing up in the skies more often and today the US Army awarded $ 14.4 million to Carnegie Mellon to build a remote - controlled unmanned tank .
A certain amount of the award will go toward significantly improving the Crusher , a 6.5 - ton unmanned support vehicle Carnegie engineers developed in 2006 in conjunction with DARPA .
Since its introduction , the Crusher has demonstrated unparalleled toughness and mobility during extensive field trials in extremely rugged terrain , according to Carnegie Mellon .
The next generation Autonomous Platform Demonstrator ( APD ) ill make use of the latest suspension , vehicle frame , and hybrid- electric drive technologies to improve upon its predecessor 's performance .
Enhanced mobility capabilities will push the envelope for autonomous and semi-autonomous operation , the engineers said .
The engineers will develop a comprehensive control architecture that makes use of hardware and software components as well .
Ultimately unmanned ground vehicles would be outfitted with anti-tank or anti-aircraft missiles and anti-personnel weapons to make them lethal .
Part of the new award budget is also slated to help the university prove that autonomous ground vehicles are feasible in future combat situations .
But most of these vehicles have n't advanced that far with weaponry .
According to the GlobalSecurity.org
Web site other smaller unmanned vehicles have had success in the field .
The M60 Panther and the Mini-Flail prototype mine proofing systems were used with great success in Bosnia and Kosovo .
The M60 is a full blown tank modified for mine sweeping operations .
The Air Force is using the All - Purpose Remote Transport System ( ARTS ) overseas for force protection and homeland defense in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom .
The university 's National Robotics Engineering Center ( NREC ) , will be working closely with the US Army Tank - Automotive Research , Development and Engineering Center ( TARDEC ) on the project .
NREC is the commercialization arm of Carnegie Mellon 's Robotics Institute .
Carnegie Mellon 's Tartan Racing team recently won first place and $ 2 million in the DARPA Urban Challenge this past weekend .
The field of 11 autonomous vehicles was pitted against each other on a course of suburban / urban roadways .
In one of those strange moments of symmetry that have marked their respective histories , Osama Bin Laden and the neocons are both kicking off the week with a renewed dedication to their shared cause : a worldwide war between the Western powers and all of Islam .
No surprise , really .
It 's in their mutual interest to make sure the rest of the world 's Muslims stay invisible .
Bin Laden released a new video - man , this guy kicks out more product than Ryan Adams - just as a shaky cabal of radical rightists was launching something called " Islamo - Fascism Awareness Week . "
As Barbara Ehrenreich points out , this loosely affiliated group does n't hesitate to draw anti-Semites into what it claims is a pro-Israel platform .
They also bring out ardent anti-feminists to argue that their global war on Muslims would advance women 's rights .
What they do n't say is that the invasion of Iraq - the prime achievement of their movement - was an enormous blow to the rights of Muslim women in that country .
And , while they claim they like some Muslims , they 're usually hard - pressed to name any - except those who have left their faith of origin and replaced it with the dogma of neoconservatism .
The very name " Islamo - Fascism " incorrectly uses the word " fascism , " which by definition includes extreme statism , nationalism , and corporatism .
Those forces are all abhorred by Islamic radicals .
It 's a neocon head game designed to make dangerous terrorist fringe groups look like an existential threat to the West , like the Axis or Soviet Communism .
They want you to think that Islamic extremists are n't just violent and horrible people , but that they can destroy our way of life .
That 's the perfect justification for the authoritarian , citizen - spying , militarized , corporate world they seek to create .
What 's more , it 's the perfect propaganda framework for that other big prize , an attack on Iran .
That 's why another mirror - dancer , Dick Cheney , is also busting a move this week by keeping the war rhetoric hot .
And that 's why President Bush used the words " World War III " in reference to Iran last week .
" Islamo - Fascism Awareness Week " is another part of the heating - up process , to convince the American people ( or enough of them ) that war with Iran is part of a fight for our very survival .
That 's why Democrats like Hillary Clinton who voted for the Kyl Amendment played into the neocons ' hands .
Do they really think that their vote would result in " diplomacy " ?
Still , fair is fair .
Since we mentioned Sen. Clinton , here 's a reason to support her :
If she 's elected , at last our enlightened " Western " nation will finally have a woman for a leader - something an Islamic nation accomplished nearly twenty years ago .
Yes , many women are terribly oppressed in some Islamic cultures , and we must fight that .
But the election of Benezir Bhutto in 1988 proved that we 're not fighting all Islam , just that segment of it that wants to drive women out of public life .
In the midst of all this , it was a perfect week for Osama to come out with his latest monologue .
Yawn ... another static shot of him declaiming his philosophy .
He needs a new director to liven these videos up .
It 's " My Dinner With Andre " stuff , not exactly boffo at the box office .
And that 's something else worth noting :
In the Islamic world , Bin Laden is n't doing great box office .
Even in war - torn Iraq , Al Qaeda fighters are a tiny minority of the insurgents .
Administration blunders have greatly increased Bin Laden 's visibility and prestige , but he 's still not getting a lot of traction among the world 's 1.2 billion Muslims .
Plenty of Muslims seem to feel the same way about Bin Laden as most of us do : namely , that he 's an asshole .
Dangerous , yes .
( He 's killed people I knew and liked . )
But an asshole just the same .
While imams are n't likely to use that language , many of them around the world have made anti-terror statements .
They do n't get the media attention they should , and you certainly wo n't hear them from the crowd making noise this week .
For example , you probably have n't seen this list of Muslim voices against extremism and terrorism , or this bumper sticker for Muslims who denounce terrorism .
And does this phrase ring a bell ?
" Genital mutilation must be considered as criminal aggression against mankind . "
Probably not .
But that 's what 20 conservative Muslim clerics said in Egypt when asked to protest that practice .
The great irony of misguided propaganda jihads like " Islamic - Fascism Awareness Week " is that they make us less safe .
They focus on the wrong threats in fighting terrorism .
If we 're to fight terrorism successfully we 'll need allies , friends - even intelligence sources - among the very party we 're alienating with this petty bigotry .
And loaded terms like " Islamo - fascism " weaken the hand of reformers who want to bring much - needed change to the Islamic World .
And , it 's funny .
The neocons will " coddle terrorists " when it suits them .
The Right does n't seem to have a problem with the Bush Administration cozying up to the man who murdered so many Americans aboard the Lockerbie flight .
In fact , there was hardly a whisper of objection when the Administration reopened its diplomatic mission in Libya in 2004 .
So it 's true , as they often insist , that they do n't oppose all Muslims .
They 've found a man they can work with in Moammar Qaddafi .
Bin Laden and the neocons are both publicity - hunting this week .
Bin Laden 's tape , if it 's verified , is a desperate attempt to seize leadership of the civil war in Iraq and of Muslim unrest in the rest of the world .
And " Islamo - Fascism Awareness Week " will try to make it look as if he already is the leader of the Islamic world .
George W. Bush .
" Awareness Week . "
Dick Cheney .
Osama Bin Laden .
It 's mirror - dance time .
As Madonna used to say :
" Strike a pose . "

Americans like Sandra Day O'Connor .
Empathy for Justice O'Connor ?
You decide .
Our history cannot be amended or changed .
Elections Selections have consequences .
BIG NUMBERS , like 45 million uninsured Americans , are hard to grasp .
But that number came home to me at a recent conference .
The keynote speaker was former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor .
Her topic was our healthcare system , and her message was personal and anguished .
The gist was that even she lives in constant fear of major uninsured health bills .
Not her own -- those of her son .
He can't afford insurance because his son -- her grandchild -- has a preexisting condition .
http://www.boston.com/...
So the American people wait and wait and wait some more .
Our patience is running out , our anger is mounting .
Democratic candidates be warned : you will not receive a pass from either the netroots or the American people if you do not speak clearly and commit to a comprehensive plan to correct this crisis of epic proportions .
Nothing less than an audacious plan which will give every American citizen , guaranteed and affordable healthcare - - from cradle to grave .
Nothing less is acceptable .
It would be foolish not to recognize that there is a clash looming between what we should do as a nation and what we can do — between political expedience and political pragmatism .
I can say one thing with absolute certainty : the American people will not tolerate another debacle .
The numbers grow more alarming with every passing day , and what do the politicians do ?
What they do best of course , flap their annoying lips .
Pay attention political class , pay very careful attention , failure is not an option .
Affordable .
Guaranteed .
Single - Payer .
For every American .
Better Social Networking
When advogato.org was still cool I signed up to it .
It was an interesting research project in skill metrics ( determining the rating of people ’s coding skills by the votes of others and weighting the votes by the rating of each person ) , and it was nice to be rated Master soon after I joined .
I still use it on occasion for the blog syndication feature ( when I find a good blog on Advogato I add it to my Planet installation ) .
When orkut.com was really cool ( when every time I had dinner with a group of people someone would ask if they could be an “ orkut friend ” ) I signed up to it .
It was interesting for a while but then most people got bored with it .
Now there is Facebook and MySpace for social networking for social purposes and LinkedIn.com for business related social networking .
I periodically get invited to join those services but have not been interested in any other than Linked In .
I ca n’t join Linked
In because their mail server is regarded as a SPAM source by my mail server but their web server refuses to provide any information on why this is ( the rejection was apparently long enough ago that it ’s rolled off my logs ) .
The problem with all these services is that I am expected to sign up with each of them and go to a moderate amount of effort in writing up all the data in the various web pages .
Writing it is a pain , keeping it up to date is more pain , and dealing with spam in “ scrap - book ” entries in Orkut is still an annoyance which I do n’t want to multiply by four !
So far the only step I ’ve seen towards addressing this issue is the XFN – XHTML Friends Network [ 1 ] project .
But that seems to be of fairly limited scope ( just referring to the friendship status of people in a < a href link ) .
I believe that the requirements for social networking are :
Personal data about each person , some of which may only be available to friends or friends of friends .
The user owns their own data , has full control over where it ’s sent and the ability to request people who receive it to keep some parts of it secret .
Ability to send email to friends of friends ( determined by the wishes of each friend and FOAF ) .
Ability to get a list of friends of friends .
Incorporation of a standard format for CVs ( for business social networking ) .
I think that the only way to go is to have a standard XML format for storing all personal data ( including financial , career , and CV data ) that can be used on any web site .
Then someone who wants to be involved in social networking could create an XML file for a static web server ( or multiple files with different content and password protected access ) , or they could have a server - side script generate an XML file on the fly with a set of data that is appropriate for the reader .
The resulting social network would be entirely distributed and anyone could write software to join in .
This covers item 1 and part of item 2 .
For sending email to friends of friends it would be good to avoid spam as much as possible .
One way of doing would be requesting that friends publish a forwarding address on their own mail server in a manner similar to SRS [ 2 ] .
SRS include the ability for such addresses to expire after a certain period of time ( which would be convenient for this ) .
In fact publishing SRS versions of friends email addresses would be a good option if you already use SPF [ 3 ] and SRS in your mail server .
This covers item 3 .
The XML format could include information on how far the recipient could transfer it .
For example if my server sent an XML file to a recruiting agency with my CV it could state that they could distribute it without restriction ( so that they can give it to hiring managers ) with the possibility of some fields being restricted ( EG not tell the hiring manager what I used to get paid ) .
For my mobile phone number I could send it to my friends with a request that they not send it on .
This covers part of item 2 .
The URL for the friends file would of course be in the main XML file , and therefore you could have different friends lists published from different versions of your profile ( EG the profile you send to recruiting agencies would n’t include drinking buddies etc ) .
This completes the coverage of item 2 .
Then to have a friends list you have a single XML file on a web server that has the public parts of the XML files from all your friends .
This means that getting a list of friends of friends would involve getting a single XML file for each friend ( if you have 100 friends and each friend has 50 unique friends on average then you do 100 HTTP operations instead of 5,000 ) .
Minimising the number of web transfer operations is essential for performance and for reliability in the face of unreliable web servers ( there is no chance of having 5,000 random web servers for individuals all up and accessible at the same time ) .
This covers item 4 .
Item 5 is merely a nice thing to have which allows more easily replacing some of the recruiting infrastructure .
As any such XML format will have several sections for arbitrary plain text ( or maybe HTML ) for describing various things the CV could of course be in HTML , but it would be good to have the data in XML .
I posted this in the “ blog ” category because blogs are the only commonly used systems where end users do anything related to XML files ( the RSS and ATOM feeds are XML ) .
A blog server could easily be extended to do these social networking systems .
As with a blog users could run their own social networking server ( publishing their XML files ) or they could use a service that is similar in concept to blogger which does it all for them ( for the less technical users ) .
Then an analogy to Planet , Technorati , etc in the blog space would be public aggregation services that compare people based on the number of friends they have etc , and attempts to map paths between people based on friends .
This could also include GPG [ 4 ] data such that signing someone ’s GPG key would cause your server to automatically list them in some friend category .
The XML format should also have a field for a GPG signature ( one option would be to use a GPG sub - key to sign the files and have the sub - key owned by the server ) .
I do n’t have any serious time to spend on implementing this at the moment .
But if someone else starts coding such a project then I would certainly help test it , debug it , and contribute towards the XML design .
A s history has taught us , Microsoft finds it too risky to attack GNU / Linux directly .
It would be too transparent and probably result in backlash from Microsoft ’s own customers , many of whom also use and / or stock Free software .
Microsoft prefers to use proxies and insiders to do their seemingly - independent jobs that accomplish long - term objectives .
Examples include SCO ( via BayStar ) , Andy Tanenbaum ( via a book author ) ( to avoid misinterpretation here , see this and this .
Microsoft tried to use Andy Tanenbaum against Linux , but was not successful because he defended Linus Torvalds ) , Acacia and its sister ‘ patent firms ’ which comprise former Microsoft employees , Novell which gently spews out software patent FUD to market itself , and folks from Ximian who plant ‘ time bombs ’ in the heart of GNU / Linux desktop environments ( slowly propagating from one to another ) .
This last element among the whole will be the subject of this one particular post , which may otherwise become too broad .
Microsoft is in serious trouble , but it is fighting .
It is not stupid , especially not in the legal department .
Most people out there are not aware of Microsoft ’s pains simply because Microsoft has done a fantastic job hiding the truth .
Again , this wo n’t be discussed in detail here , especially in order for this post to be concise and focused .
These other stories also were covered before .
We received some valuable information from one of our readers and we wish to share it and reach out for some feedback .
Denial and Manipulation
The first issue to draw one ’s attention to is manipulation of search engines , news feeds , video sites , social news sites , and the mainstream press .
We covered many such examples in the past and these include astroturfing , acquisition of the media , heavy lobbying , acquisition of analysts , political manipulation , malicious intervention , creation of civil wars and at times even bribery , kickbacks and dumping .
Of more relevance to the following new bits we have spamming of YouTube with viral videos and search engines manipulation .
Adding to this ‘ Hall of Shame ’ we have just accumulated some reports about behaviour that was described by a reader in the following way :
Along similar lines , I spotted the other day one method how Microsoft boosters within GNOME are able to affect Ubuntu :
They can camp on bug reports and mark them repeatedly ‘ invalid ’ that way the report never shows up in any RSS feeds or for that matter any normal or advanced searches .
One has to specifically search for invalid bugs to find it and at that level of specificity one probably already has the URL and bug number .
My general complaint about Google News falls into the same category .
It ’s not just a matter of Microsoft gaming the system , pro-ODF or anti-OOXML articles just do n’t make it into Google News regardless of the publisher .
[...]
Here ’s one from ZDNet :
“ Developers warned over OOXML [ sw ] patent risk ”
http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39292853,00.htm
I bet it wo n’t show up in Google News .
Not that Google News is in and of itself important , but the appearance of tampering , on the other hand , is .
http://news.google.com/news?oe=UTF-8&tab=wn&hl=en&q=ooxml+-site…
http://news.google.com/news?q=opendocument%20-site%3A…
OOXML is not the main issue here , but we will return to it in a moment .
In fact , the latter bit turned out to be false just 2 hours ago .
The Real Problem and a Case Study
The same reader talks about the increasingly severe issue which is Mono in GNOME .
To give one example of a scenario where Mono dependencies crop up , consider Cheese .
One thing I noticed this week is that the mono group has been able to encumber a growing number of Ubuntu ( not Kubuntu ) applications with proprietary Microsoft technology .
However , the documentation and program descriptions do not warn of this ( of course they want to keep it under the radar ) .
“ A risk here is that , especially in regards to media ( audio , video , pictures , text , etc. ) it will provide a ramp for OOXML , WMA , WMV , HDPhoto , and others along with the prerequiste DRM .
” A risk here is that , especially in regards to media ( audio , video , pictures , text , etc. ) it will provide a ramp for OOXML , WMA , WMV , HDPhoto , and others along with the prerequiste DRM .
I would expect that if Micrsooft makes further contracts with Novell or other turncoats , that this will soon start to cover DRM .
In short , mono spreads , becomes integrated into some desktops , then Microsoft formats are rolled out as part of mono .
[...]
Here is not an example of the dependencies , but of more peripheral incursion :
http://www.gnome.org/projects/cheese/
Note the recommendation of f- spot .
digikam , flphoto , kphotoalbum and others would do the job without infecting the machine with mono .
I ’m thinking that any kind of confrontation should be avoided , these people are well entrenched in some high profile projects .
Non-mono projects should be brought to the forefront .
It was then that a more systematic study needed to be carried out .
Packages Named
Further , from the same reader :
I am loading a list of package dependencies right now and will check the current situation for ubuntu :
dapper 159 ?
gutsy 150 ?
hardy 176 ?
To check an individual package , for example ‘ boo ’
apt - cache depends ^boo $
You can do it without the caret and dollar sign , but that just makes sure that you get exactly that name and nothing else .
Methodology :
# freshen data
sudo apt - get update ;
# guess at all the packages
for i in a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ;
do apt - cache search -n $ i |sed -e “ s/ .*$ // ” ;
done | sort | uniq > packages.txt
# find the dependencies
for i in `cat packages .
txt` ;
do apt - cache depends $ i >> dependencies.txt ;
echo >> dependencies.txt ;
done
# make a spare
cp dependencies .
txt x
# then edit x to be one line per package ,
# using your favorite editor or sed or awk
# get the package description
for i in `grep libmono x|sed -e ‘s/ .*$//’` ;
do apt - cache search – names - only ^${i} $ ;
done > mono- infected - gutsy.txt

“ Here is the new / etc / apt / preferences .
Nuke ’m from orbit .
It ’s the only way to be sure , ” our reader adds .
He wishes to remain anonymous , but there are no conflicting interests at all , just genuine concern about things which are conveniently overlooked by many .
These ‘ Monopendencies ’ could soon turn GNOME into MONOME , making it virtually impossible in due time to use basic applications without Mono somewhere in the dependecies tree .
Moonlight is a good example of such dangers .
These dependency checks are reminiscent of the one which other people have obtained ( and published ) for Fedora [ 1 , 2 ] .
Miguel de Icaza and Jeff Waugh get vocal about this when the issue comes up .
They seem to be sensitive to this issue which they are certainly aware of .
Denial , promises or mitigation ensue .
Ways Forward
At least two bloggers other than ourselves occasionally criticise this direction which is increasingly chosen and then taken with little or no consultation .
We need more information about the problem to be made available out there .
Only yesterday , one of those fairly prolific bloggers described GNOME ’s direction quite realistically :
I do n’t consider XFCE as the best desktop environment , however it ’s still lighter than GNOME , it ’s still not under the contamination attack from the Mono guys , and it ’s increasingly tempting in recent times , since GNOME seems to be a captive of Novell …
We were advised and told that contacting Fedora ’s new leader might help .
We was in touch with Shuttleworth on some occasions in the past , so that might help also .
About Red Hat , our reader says :
Red Hat gained a lot of positive publicity way back when they gave a common theme to KDE .
I think that was ground breaking in that now , people expect the theme more from the distro than from the developers of the desktop environment .
Red Hat has KDE support already , but I ’m still wondering the best way to present the situation .
I ’m guessing that all the recent news about KDE , and the development , would be a good excuse to re-evaluate the two desktops .
KDE has always been ahead in development , Gnome on the eye candy and promotion .
Besides , much of the jubilation about Ubuntu gutsy and hardy is about the window manager and that is a layer below , and independent from , the desktop environment .
So if people find out that it ’s not GNOME but Compiz Fusion , then they might be more likely to try other desktop environments .
One thing that we do n’t have to mention explicitly is that since the formation of the KDE Free Qt Foundation , the original purpose of GNOME has been made moot .
( Let people figure that out . )
However , stepping around that ( at least for a while ) the KDE Free Qt Foundation should be mentioned and leveraged .
http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php
Xfce is out there and gaining interest , since it ’s good for low power machines that get a second life with Linux .
Fluxbox is also out there and hit 1.0
Gnome has a fair amount of good things , but the direction of many projects and the positions of the leaders ( e.g. Jeff and Miguel ) is duplicitous at best …
[...]
The holy grail here would be to get Mark Shuttleworth and other key ubuntu people to go for KDE by default .
Same for Fedora / CentOS .
If we get into a situation where function is provided only by mono - based apps , then they pave the way for Microsoft incursion .
GTK + hopefully can remain clean .
That is all the more important now that Nokia ’s competitors are dropping Qt / Qtopia .
[...]
I ’m thinking the way to deal with this is to avoid confrontation , or at least high - profile confrontation and instead to promote the heck out of the tools Microsofters are copying .
Anything that brings attention to them is free marketing , even it if is ‘ bad ’ .
The idea is to steer mindshare and thus developer interest towards the good tools .
Perhaps if we talk about how FOSS could be subverted without mentioning names , or bring up the benefits of GPLv3 and some of the discussion ( against lgpl ) that went on with the creation of the LGPL .
Take it as you will , dear readers .
Facts are being accumulated and hope is that these will lead to responsible action ; it ’s not intended to achieve hostility , insults and confrontation .
OOXML translators , which Novell tries to fool us with , remain Mono - dependent .
It would be naive to assume that Microsoft is not aware of this .
But if it spoke out , it would scare people away from the bait . █

完成形を見てしまった気がする。それくらいできが良い。
これま でWikiエンジンを幾つも紹介してきた。もちろん、機能面ではもの凄く充実しているものも数多い。だが、使い勝手や初期状態での機能等を考えると、これがまさに完成系と言えるのではないだろうか。
今回紹介するオープンソース・ソフトウェアはMindTouch Deki Wiki、エンタープライズ向け のWikiエンジンだ。
欠点がなさすぎる。日本語はもちろんOK、Ajaxを使って遷移の少ない作り、履歴管理＋差分表示にももちろん対応している。編集はWYSIWYGなテキストエリアでできる。
ヘッダを作れば、その中だけで編集できる。画像をアップロードして、埋め込むのも簡単。ページの階層管理もできて、タグも使える。ウォッチリストに登録、コメントをする、RSS配信など何でもござれだ。
さらに多言語対応 、Google Analyticsを埋め込めるなどなど…。しかもこれがMySQL+PHPというライトな組み合わせで提供されているのも素晴らしい。
興味深いのは、VMWare向けのファイルでも提供され、簡単に試してもらおうという姿勢が見える点だ。サイズは200MB超あるのだが、これはVMWare Playerも含んだサイズだ。もちろん、ソースだけでも提供されている。
さら にWindows向けには専用のデスクトップクライアントが提供されている。これを使うとファイルを複数、一括でアップロードできる。Wiki＋ドキュメント管理としての役割もしてくれるのだ。もちろん、ドキュメントにはリビジョンが付与される。
MindTouch Deki Wikiはやばい。かなりやばい。触れば触るほど、魅力がましていく。このWikiエンジンはこれまで触ってきたどのWikiエンジンよりも魅力に溢れている。ぜひ体験してみてほしい。

Senate Moves to Shield Phone Companies on Eavesdropping ( NYT ) :
After more than a year of heated political wrangling , the Senate handed the White House a major victory Tuesday by voting to broaden the government�s spy powers and to give legal protection to phone companies that cooperated in President Bush�s warrantless [ i.e. , openly , flagrantly , boastfully illegal ] eavesdropping program ....
Beyond the immunity provision , the Senate measure would also widen the executive branch�s surveillance powers by allowing the National Security Agency and intelligence agencies to use broad orders � without getting court orders in advance � to eavesdrop on groups of overseas targets , rather than using individualized warrants .
What 's more , as Glenn Greenwald notes , the bill goes out of its way to assure the Commander that he can also use other methods of warrantless ( i.e. , openly , flagrantly , boastfully illegal ) surveillance against American citizens , if he in his great wisdom -- and arbitrary authority -- so desires .
We 've been mourning the death of the American Republic here ( and at other venues ) for many years now , since Congress surrendered its Constitutional responsibilities with the passage of the Patriot Act on September 14 , 2001 , and Bush then declared ( on September 17 , 2001 ) that he had the right to kill anyone on earth anytime he felt like it and there was n't a damn thing anyone could do about it .
The many , many outrages that have followed -- the gulag , the torture program , the Hitlerian war crime in Iraq , the Military Commissions
Act ( which stripped away the ancient right of habeas corpus and also officially enshrined the concept of the " unitary executive " / presidential dictatorship into law ) , right down to Tuesday 's vote to " legitimize " Bush 's illegal keyhole - peeping and the corporate criminals who abetted it -- have simply been further confirmations of the Republic 's moribund state .
Bush and the Democrats have been abusing the corpse over and over , like the sick and degraded moral perverts that they are .
I do n't know what will come next .
I do n't know if the United States can crawl out of the filthy pit of empire and tyranny over the next few decades and claw its way toward some new manifestation of democracy -- or if it will just keep sinking , raging , rotting , mutating further into a war - and - torture state that must feed constantly on human flesh to survive .
Of course , I hope for -- and will work toward -- the former , the new manifestation , although I honestly do n't expect to see such a thing in my own lifetime .
But whatever will be , one thing is certain now : the constitutional republic of the United States is a dead letter , a relic of history .
And nothing that happens in November -- when one imperial factotum or another gets their turn at the top of the greasy pole -- will change that basic fact .
The Freedom Road is a long road -- and we 're still a long way from taking even our first steps on that journey .
We 've got miles of wilderness to cut through yet .

The roller coaster that is the Canadian DMCA has taken another turn .
Sometime between yesterday afternoon and this morning , the government decided to hold off .
At 10:00 am this morning , the introduction of new government bills came and went without a new copyright bill .
The Industry Minister 's press secretary has advised journalists that the bill will not be introduced today or tomorrow .
Since the House of Commons will break at the end of the week , the Canadian DMCA will not be introduced until at least late January .
Given this change of events , I reiterate my comment from earlier this week – this is Prentice 's moment .
He has an opportunity to brush aside the momentary embarrassment of the delays and instead work toward a genuine copyright balance by reaching out to all Canadians .
As astonishing number of people have voiced their concern over the past two weeks and the government seems to have listened .
Now it must act by openly consulting and engaging with a country that genuinely cares about copyright .
Embattled Unix vendor SCO may get a new lease on life , thanks to a $ 100 million infusion aimed at helping it emerge from bankruptcy and pursue its controversial legal claims .
The financing comes from Stephen Norris Capital Partners ( SNCP ) , which will take a controlling interest in SCO as part of the deal .
" Not only will this deal position us to emerge from Chapter 11 , but it also marks an exciting future for our business , " said Jeff Hunsaker , the company 's president and COO of SCO Operations , in a statement .
[ cob: Related_Articles ] " This significant financial backing is positive news for SCO 's customers , partners and resellers who continue to request upgrades and rely upon SCO 's UNIX services to drive their business forward , " he said .
According to a statement from the company , SNCP already has a business plan for SCO that includes pursuing its legal claims .
SCO has been locked in bitter legal battles with both IBM and Novell over Unix copyright issues .
Those battles have n't gone all that well for the company recently .
In an August decision Judge Dale Kimball ruled against SCO , finding that Novell was the owner of the disputed Unix and UnixWare copyrights .
That ruling ultimately led to SCO 's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
SNCP 's efforts will also include new product lines , SCO said .
The company 's statement did not provide additional detail on either parts of the plan .
While under bankruptcy protection , the company continued to maintain its core Unix offerings .
In November , it released an update to its flagship OpenServer 6 Unix product line .
The company said its board of directors unanimously approved the deal with SNCP , which , once finalized , will mean SCO becomes privately traded as a result .
The company had been delisted from NASDAQ in late December , and has since been traded in over - the - counter " Pink Sheets . "
The $ 100 million dollar financing is nearly triple the $ 36 million for which SCO appeared willing to sell its Unix business off in October , when it announced a tentative bid from York Capital .
That deal ultimately fell through .
AT the suggestion of the federal Department of Homeland Security , New York City Council members have drafted legislation requiring anyone who has or uses a detector that measures chemical , biological or radioactive agents to get a license from the Police Department .
The purpose of the bill is to reduce unwarranted anxiety and damage from false alarms of terrorist attacks .
Proponents say police officers need to know where detectors are and make sure they ’re reliable .
But the bill , which appears to be the first of its kind in the country and a model for other cities , could stifle the collection of environmental information vital to the public good .
The problem is that the bill as written would cover all “ environmental sensors , ” and in the extreme interpretation even laboratory analyses , used by students , teachers , researchers , activists , unions and many other groups .
Their work has far more to do with ecology , education , public health and worker safety than with terrorism .
These sensors allow them to measure things like greenhouse gases in order to document air pollution .
There are many examples of nongovernmental groups collecting important environmental data based on laboratory analyses .
Indeed , the original identification of PCB contamination of the Hudson River did not come from the government but from a study by Sports Illustrated magazine that included data on striped bass collected from the river by a private citizen , Robert H. Boyle .
Computer security people have been talking about this for years , but only recently are we seeing it in the wild : software that encrypts your data , and then charges you for the decryption key .
PandaLabs points out that this is not the first time such a Trojan has made the rounds , citing PGPCoder as having a “ long record on the ransomware scene . ”
Ransom .
A is another Trojan that presented to the user both a shorter time frame and a significantly lower bounty — a file was to be deleted every 30 minutes unless the user paid up the ransom of $ 10.99 .

WASHINGTON 
After more than a year of heated political wrangling , the Senate handed the White House a major victory Tuesday by voting to broaden the government ’s spy powers after giving legal protection to phone companies that cooperated in President Bush ’s warrantless eavesdropping program .
The Senate rejected a series of amendments that would have restricted the government ’s surveillance powers and eliminated immunity for the phone carriers , and it voted in convincing fashion  69 to 29  to end debate and bring the issue to a final vote .
That vote on the overall billwas an almost identical 68 to 29 .
The House has already rejected the idea of immunity for the phone companies , and Democratic leaders reacted angrily to the Senate vote .
But Congressional officials said it appeared that the House would ultimately be forced to accept some sort of legal protection for the phone carriers in negotiations between the two chambers this week .
The Senate debate amounted to a proxy vote not only on the president ’s warrantless wiretapping program , but also on a range of other issues that tested the president ’s wartime authority , from secret detentions to wiretapping issues .
The discussion in effect presaged the debate over national security that will play out this year in the presidential and congressional elections .
' Everywhere you turn , it is the policy of Iran to foment instability and chaos , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned Gulf dignitaries in Bahrain last month .
But in reality , everywhere you turn , from Qatar to Saudi Arabia to Egypt , you now see Iranian leaders shattering longstanding taboos by meeting cordially with their Arab counterparts .
The Gulf has moved away from American arguments for isolating Iran .
American policymakers need to do the same .
The states of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) are accommodating themselves to Iran 's growing weight in the region 's politics .
They remain key parts of America 's security architecture in the region , hosting massive US military bases and underwriting the American economy in exchange for protection .
But as Saudi analyst Khalid al - Dakheel argues , they are no longer content sitting passively beneath the US security umbrella and want to avoid being a pawn in the US - Iranian struggle for power .
Flush with cash , they are not interested in a war that would mess up business .
That 's why America 's attempt to shore up containment against Iran increasingly seems to be yesterday 's battle .
On Dec. 3 , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addressed the GCC in Doha , Qatar .
It was the first time an Iranian leader had addressed the alliance , which was formed in 1981 against the Iranian challenge .
Weeks later , Saudi King Abdullah invited Mr. Ahmadinejad to Saudi Arabia – the president 's third visit in a year – for the hajj , or Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca .
The king used the occasion to hold cordial talks .
Iran is even reaching out to Egypt .
Ali Larijani , head of Iran 's National Security Council , visited Cairo recently for the highest level talks in 27 years .
Afterward , Arab League chief Amr Moussa bluntly stated that there was no point in Arabs treating Iran as an enemy .
Gulf Arabs have thus visibly discarded the central pillar of the past year of America 's Middle East strategy .
Saudis and Egyptians had been the prime movers in anti-Iranian and anti-Shiite agitation .
When they are inviting Ahmadinejad and Mr. Larijani to their capitals , America 's talk of isolating Iran sounds outdated .
One hears little today of the " Shiite crescent " threatening the region , against which Arab officials once gravely warned .
The Bush administration 's proposed " axis of moderation , " joining Sunni Arab states and Israel against Iran , has quietly passed from view .
Meanwhile , the GCC seems more unified and confident than it has in years .
Earlier this week the six member countries agreed to form a common market .
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have mended fences .
Pressures for domestic political reforms have been largely defanged , and the oil bonanza has allowed Saudi Arabia to pursue an energetic foreign policy .
The Gulf states wo n't abandon their US protectors anytime soon , but they seem more willing than ever to act on their own initiative .
The emerging signs of a tentative thaw in the Gulf are not due solely to the release of the findings in last month 's National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) that Iran was no longer pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
The NIE helped trigger the thaw by convincing Arabs that a US - led war against Iran had become much less likely .
But it has long been clear that most Gulf rulers have no appetite for a war that would disrupt their economic boom and put them at the most risk .
The Gulf media today speaks more of avoiding war than of fomenting it .
Even in Iraq , fears of a Saudi - Iranian proxy war have given way to hints of an emerging modus vivendi .
Gulf regimes remain hostile to the pro-Iranian Iraqi government .
But instead of trying to replace its Shiite leader , Nouri al - Maliki , they now seem satisfied that the rise of the Sunni " Awakenings " – US - backed neighborhood councils that have begun fighting Al Qaeda – will check Iranian ambitions .
Saudi and Iranian clients in Iraq even seem to be carving out zones of influence , as suggested by recent talks between the Sunni Anbar Salvation Council and the Shiite Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council .
This is not to say that the Gulf states are comfortable with Iranian power .
Anti-Shiite and anti-Persian sentiment exists throughout the Gulf .
Iran 's territorial dispute with the United Arab Emirates generates considerable passion in that country .
Few Gulf or Arab leaders publicly welcome an Iranian nuclear program .
And Ahmadinejad 's proposal of a new Gulf security architecture including Iran was widely seen as an initiative for Iranian hegemony , not a genuine collective security arrangement .
Gulf states see Iran as a challenge that they have been dealing with for decades , not an urgent or existential threat .
The shifting Arab approach may leave the US with little choice but to do the same .
Just as America 's containment of Iraq began to collapse in the late 1990s when its Arab neighbors lost faith in the value of sanctions , the new Gulf attitudes will probably now shape what the US can do with Iran .

Maxwell , Molecules , and Evolution
by Charles Petzold
Abstract : Modern - day Christian creationists have claimed nineteenth - century Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell as one of their own .
The author explores the historical evidence and discovers that Maxwell 's attitude toward evolution was more nuanced than people assume .
The characterization of Maxwell as a anti-Darwin creationist is based on exaggerations , misinterpretations , and ( probably most of all ) wishful thinking .
Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell ( 1831 – 1879 ) is a towering figure of nineteenth century physics .
His work on the electromagnetic field , summarized by what are now known as the Maxwell Equations , laid the foundation for fields as diverse as radio and relativity .
Maxwell is also one of several long - dead scientists who have become pawns in today 's " evolution wars . "
He is frequently included on lists of " famous scientists who believed in Creation " and profiled in creationist books and Web sites .
Maxwell was 28 years old when Charles Darwin ( 1809 – 1882 ) published his groundbreaking work On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859 .
It is well known that Darwin ’s book was quite controversial among scientists in the several years following its publication .
Prominent geologists and biologists , such as Adam Sedgwick and Richard Owen , wrote critical reviews . [ ]
The astronomer William Herschel called natural selection “ the law of higgledy piggledy , ” [ ] and William Whewell banned Darwin ’s book from the Trinity College library at Cambridge . [ ]
But where does Maxwell fit into these controversies ?
Modern histories of the nineteenth - century Darwin debates do n't mention Maxwell at all , so it 's odd he should be tallied among the creationists in our own era .
Have creationists uncovered new information about Maxwell ?
Or have they simply misunderstood and distorted Maxwell 's writings to suit their own agenda ?
Creationism for High - School Students
Much of the information circulating about Maxwell 's views on evolution can be traced back to the high school textbook Physical Science for Christian Schools ( Bob Jones University Press , 1974 ) .
The authors state in their preface : “ Our textbook is not only a Christian book ; it is a creationist book . ” [ ]
Like five other “ Christian Men of Science ” ( Lord Kelvin , Robert Boyle , Johannes Kepler , Michael Faraday , and Samuel F. B. Morse ) , Maxwell is the subject of a short biography in this textbook that unfortunately includes statements like this :
Maxwell had no use for any theory of evolution — cosmic , chemical , biological , or otherwise .
In a paper presented to the British Association at Bradford in 1873 , he stated , “ No theory of evolution can be formed to account for the similarity of molecules , for evolution necessarily implies continuous change . …
The exact quality of each molecule to all others of the same kind gives it , as Sir John Herschel has well said , the essential character of a manufactured article , and precludes the idea of its being eternal and self - existent . ” [ ]
This particular quotation contains two of the very few mentions of the word “ evolution ” in all of Maxwell ’s published writings .
Notice the ellipsis ( … ) in the middle of the quoted material , indicating that something has been omitted .
By yanking this quotation out of context with no explanation of Maxwell ’s subject matter , the authors are relying on the phrase “ No theory of evolution can be formed ” to have the dominant impact on the reader and to support their contention that “ Maxwell had no use for any theory of evolution . ”
In fact , Maxwell is referring to a very specific type of evolution , as even this edited quotation makes evident .
One hesitates to accuse a book with a title like Physical Science for Christian Schools of deliberately deceiving its readers , particular because the readers are children , many of whom probably attend schools whose anemically funded libraries do not contain those books that would allow them to verify this quotation and other questionable statements made in this textbook .
These students are relying on the authors of their textbooks to convey accurate information .
But the distortion of the quotation is also unfortunate because what Maxwell actually said is much more interesting when it ’s not being laced up into someone ’s personal theological straightjacket .
Maxwell and the Molecules Lecture
James Clerk Maxwell delivered his lecture on “ Molecules ” in 1873 during the annual weeklong meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , held that year in Bradford .
It was not a paper presented to the Association and it does not appear in the BAAS Report for that year .
It was instead an evening lecture scheduled for 8:30 PM on Monday , September 22 , 1873 in St. George ’s Hall .
Such evening lectures were open to the public and were intended to be popular and less technical than the hard - core science going on during the day .
The lecture was subsequently published in the magazine Nature [ ] and Maxwell ’s posthumously collected scientific papers , [ ] and it has been transcribed from Nature for the Victorian Web . [ ]
An extract of the lecture containing the pertinent passages also appears in the Campbell and Garnett biography of Maxwell . [ ]
Maxwell 's lecture is frequently misunderstood so it 's worth a close reading .
Much of the lecture focuses on properties of molecules and atoms , particularly as they relate to the diffusion of gases .
Towards the end of the lecture , Maxwell discusses how the spectroscope has shown molecules of a particular type ( for example , hydrogen ) to be exactly the same regardless whether they are found on earth or revealed in the light from distant stars :
Each molecule , therefore , throughout the universe bears impressed on it the stamp of a metric system as distinctly as does the metre of the Archives at Paris , or the double royal cubit of the Temple of Karnac .
Maxwell is saying that , regardless of their age or distance from the earth , all hydrogen molecules are the same .
This is unusual considering that everything else we ’re familiar with in nature is subject to change .
Molecules are unique in this respect .
As Maxwell says :
No theory of evolution can be formed to account for the similarity of molecules , for evolution necessarily implies continuous change , and the molecule is incapable of growth or decay , of generation or destruction .
This sentence contains the only two mentions of evolution in the entire lecture and it ’s clear that Maxwell is speaking only of molecules .
He ’s saying that we ca n’t formulate a theory of evolution for molecules because molecules never change and do n’t evolve .
The next two sentences omitted from Physical Science for Christian Schools clarify how unusual this is :
None of the processes of Nature , since the time when Nature began , have produced the slightest difference in the properties of any molecule .
We are therefore unable to ascribe either the existence of the molecules or the identity of their properties to any of the causes which we call natural .
These sentences are crucial because Maxwell is identifying a difference between the natural world and molecules .
He ’s implying that the processes of nature normally cause change , but that molecules seem immune to these processes .
The constancy of molecules is unlike everything else in nature .
Of course , everything in the natural world is made out of molecules , and natural processes change these objects , but the molecules themselves remain the same .
On the other hand , the exact quality of each molecule to all others of the same kind gives it , as Sir John Herschel has well said , the essential character of a manufactured article , and precludes the idea of its being eternal and self - existent .
Maxwell is actually implying the opposite of what the authors of Physical Science for Christian Schools seem to want him to say .
They want him to be opposed to evolution in nature , but he ’s using evolution in nature to contrast the absence of evolution in molecules .
Maxwell is not saying that the universe does n’t evolve , and he ’s not saying that living things do n’t evolve .
What he ’s saying is that molecules — and only molecules — do n’t evolve and hence appear to be manufactured .
Maxwell ’s argument makes no sense if nothing evolves .
It only makes sense if nature exhibits evolution but molecules do not .
Maxwell ’s allusion to John Herschel ( 1792 – 1871 ) is to Herschel ’s influential 1830 book A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy , which is where Maxwell first encountered the concept that molecules resemble manufactured articles .
Herschel discusses the discovery that atoms of a particular type are always exactly the same , and asserts that these discoveries “ effectually destroy the idea of an eternal self - existent matter ” such as is implicit in the atomism of Epicurus and Lucretius .
Instead , atoms have “ the essential characters , at once , of a manufactured article , and a subordinate agent . ” [ ]
Make no mistake about it : Herschel and Maxwell are making a theological point , but not the one that the authors of Physical Science for Christian Schools want .
By noting how molecules have the “ character of a manufactured article , ” Herschel and Maxwell are implying that molecules were created , but with no implications concerning astronomical or biological evolution .
This is not an anti-evolution argument ; it ’s a design argument , and a rather interesting one at that .
Rather than hammering the lesson home , however , Maxwell backs away in the next paragraph of his lecture :
Thus we have been led , along a strictly scientific path , very near to the point at which Science must stop .
Not that Science is debarred from studying the internal mechanism of a molecule which she cannot take to pieces , any more than from investigating an organism which she can not put together .
But in tracing back the history of matter Science is arrested when she assures herself , on the one hand , that the molecule has been made , and on the other , than it has not been made by any of the processes we call natural .
Maxwell soon concludes his lecture still talking of the permanency of molecules but now in a more rhapsodic tone :
They continue this day as they were created — perfect in number and measure and weight , and from the ineffaceable characters impressed on them we may learn that those aspirations after accuracy in measurement , truth in statement , and justice in action , which we reckon among our noblest attributes as men , are ours because they are essential constituents of the image of Him who in the beginning created , not only the heaven and the earth , but the materials of which heaven and earth consist .
Maxwell certainly believed that God created the universe , but based on this lecture , it 's simply not possible to label him as a “ creationist ” in the modern sense of the word , that is , someone who believes this creation took place relatively recently in accordance with the book of Genesis .
The Molecules lecture is one the rare allusions to God in the writings that Maxwell intended for publication .
( His letters are another matter . )
Concluding a lecture or address with a reference to God had once been very common at the BAAS , but the practice was on the decline during this period .
Scientists were more wary of attributing design to the world ever since Origin of Species had presented an alternative model of biological complexity and adaptation , thus discrediting common design arguments that had dominated British natural theology and science from before the Boyle Lectures ( begun in 1692 ) through the Bridgewater Treatises ( early 1830s ) .
A growing professionalism in the occupation of science also contributed to this trend . [ ]
Criticism and Clarification
Like all design arguments , the identification of molecules as “ manufactured articles ” relies on an analogy that when poked a little bit tends to break apart .
About a year after Maxwell 's lecture on Molecules appeared in Nature the magazine published a letter concerning the lecture .
In a train of thought reminiscent of David Hume ’s thrashing of design arguments in Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion ( 1779 ) , the letter questioned if the manufactured uniformity Maxwell detected in molecules is really evidence of design or a poverty of imagination .
The nearest approach I can think of is to be found on a scale almost molecular , for number and sometimes for magnitude , in a London wilderness of similar and similarly situated houses .
It is oppressive to walk past these boxes so identical in form , and to think of the infinite variety of their contents ; to think how different they would have been , and how much fitter for their purposes , if their inhabitants could have secreted them as a snail secretes its shell .
And why does it make all the difference that they have been manufactured ?
Why did not the manufacturer vary them according to the interests connected with them ?
Of course because he did not care about those interests ; because he could not foresee them ; and because it would not answer to try and provide for them .
And now we understand the sort of manufacturer the new argument reveals : a manufacturer who does not care what becomes of his articles the moment he gets them off his hands by his formulas beginning to be interpretable ; a manufacturer who cannot solve his own equations except in a grossly approximate fashion ; a manufacturer who could not give his constants the proper values if he knew what values to give them .
Uniformity , in short , is not as such the sign of a manufactured article , except as it may be the sign of an imperfect manufacturer . [ ]
The letter was signed C. J. Monro , and perhaps few readers of Nature knew that Cecil James Monro ( 1833 – 1882 ) was a friend of Maxwell ’s since they were at Cambridge together 20 years earlier .
Maxwell tried to clear up Monro ’s objections in his article on the “ Atom ” for the 9th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica .
The article elaborates on the themes of the “ Molecules ” lecture but with less ambiguity concerning Maxwell 's attitude towards evolution ( Darwinian and otherwise ) .
In this article Maxwell discusses “ species ” of molecules , and then compares them to species of living things .
The following series of quotations comprise a single paragraph , which begins :
It is well known that living beings may be grouped into a certain number of species , defined with more or less precision , and that it is difficult or impossible to find a series of individuals forming the links of a continuous chain between one species and another .
Species of molecules are similar to species of living things in that they represent distinct groups without overlap .
But obviously , species of molecules are more distinct than living things .
You ’ll never find a continuum of atoms between hydrogen and helium , for example .
Biological species are not quite that rigid .
The species are “ defined with more or less precision ” and finding a continuous chain between them may be “ impossible ” or otherwise “ difficult . ”
The paragraph continues by identifying an even bigger distinction between molecules and living things :
In the case of living beings , however , the generation of individuals is always going on , each individual differing more or less from its parent .
Each individual during its whole life is undergoing modification , and it either survives and propagates its species , or dies early , accordingly as it is more or less adapted to the circumstances of its environment .
Hence , it has been found possible to frame a theory of the distribution of organisms into species by means of generation , variation , and discriminative destruction .
For those who believe Maxwell to be opposed to biological evolution , this passage is probably a bit disturbing .
It is a clear and straightforward description of evolution by means of natural selection , with the charming phrase “ discriminative destruction ” substituted for “ survival of the fittest . ”
It could certainly be argued that Maxwell is only blandly reciting the rudiments of biological evolutionary theory while withholding his approval .
However , if Maxwell did n’t believe in the legitimacy of the theory he ’s just described , than the rest of the paragraph makes no sense .
He needs the contrast to demonstrate how the lack of evolution in molecules makes them different from living beings :
But a theory of evolution of this kind cannot be applied to the case of molecules , for the individual molecules neither are born nor die , they have neither parents nor offspring , and so far from being modified by their environment , we find that two molecules of the same kind , say of hydrogen , have the same properties , though one has been compounded with carbon and buried in the earth as coal for untold ages , while the other had been “ occluded ” in the iron of a meteorite , and after unknown wanderings in the heavens has at last fallen into the hands of some terrestrial chemist . [ ]
Again , molecules do not change and thus have the characteristics of manufactured objects .
Maxwell ’s mention of “ untold ages ” might also give a young - earth creationist pause .
A Textbook 's Lasting Influence
It is clear that the authors of Physical Science for Christian Schools have , either deliberately or ignorantly , distorted Maxwell ’s concepts of evolution regarding molecules .
Although this is a 30 - year old textbook , its influence did n’t end with graduation .
The miniature biographies of Maxwell and other Christian scientists in this textbook continue to influence other creationist authors .
Henry M. Morris , for example , author of numerous creationist texts including the children ’s book Men of Science — Men of God : Great Scientists Who Believed the Bible ( Creation Life Publishers , 1982 , 1988 ) seems to have drawn on this textbook .
( Or perhaps the textbook drew on earlier works of Morris . )
Ann Lamont , author of 21 Great Scientists Who Believed the Bible ( Creation Science Foundation , 1995 ) does n't hide her reliance on the textbook .
She even uses Physical Science for Christian Schools as a source for Maxwell ’s “ Molecules ” lecture without bothering to check the text of the original ! [ ]
Like a persistent virus , the flawed quotations and misconceptions of these books have also infested the Internet .
Anyone attempting to use the Web to legitimately research Maxwell ’s views on evolution must weed through sites whose sole purpose is promoting a creationist agenda , and for whom Maxwell is merely a pawn .
Maxwell vs. Spencer ?
Let ’s go back to Physical Science for Christian Schools for an even more blatantly grotesque fumbling of Maxwell ’s writings .
Immediately following the quotation from Maxwell ’s “ Molecules ” lecture , Physical Science for Christian Schools continues with another example of Maxwell ’s supposed opposition to evolution :
In his discourse “ On the Telephone , ” written in 1878 , he took special pains to refute the evolutionary speculations of Herbert Spencer ( 1820 – 1903 ) , an English philosopher who did much to popularize Darwin ’s theory of evolution . [ ]
Here again , other creationists have taken the textbook authors at their word .
Henry M. Morris ’s book contains a similar statement but with one of those little evolutionary mutations that often occur in paraphrased material :
He also wrote an incisive refutation of the evolutionary philosophies of Herbert Spencer , the great advocate of Darwinism . [ ]
Now let ’s go to the source .
The setting is another public lecture , this time the Rede Lecture for 1878 .
Maxwell chose to speak about the telephone , which Alexander Graham Bell had patented just two years previously .
As with the “ Molecules ” lecture , this lecture was first published in Nature [ ] and reprinted in Maxwell ’s scientific papers , [ ] and a pertinent except appeared in the Campbell and Garnett biography . [ ]
In discussing the mechanics of the telephone , Maxwell notes that the same mechanism serves for both speaking and listening :
One great beauty of Prof .
Bell ’s invention is that the instruments at the two ends of the line are precisely alike .
When the tin plate of the transmitter approaches the core of its bobbin it produces a current in the circuit , which has also to circulate round the bobbin of the receiver , and thus the core of the receiver is rendered more or less magnetic , and attracts its tin plate with greater or smaller force .
Thus the tin plate of the receiver reproduces on a smaller scale , but with perfect fidelity , every motion of the tin plate of the transmitter .
The next paragraph alludes to Spencer .
Do n’t blink or you ’ll miss it :
This perfect symmetry of the whole apparatus — the wire in the middle , the two telephones at the end of the wire , and the two gossips at the ends of the telephone — may be very fascinating to a mere mathematician , but it would not satisfy an evolutionist of the Spencerian type , who would consider anything with both ends alike to be an organism of a very low type , which must have its functions differentiated before any satisfactory integration can take place . [ ]
It ’s a joke , people !
Notice the word “ gossips ” used as an early - warning signal that further wit is on the way , and indeed it is .
Maxwell ’s use of a biological analogy in discussing the technology of the telephone is so obviously a moment of deliberate humor in the talk that its misinterpretation by modern - day authors is truly frightening .
Everybody agrees Maxwell was a witty guy , and his humor really is n’t really that hard to recognize .
Yet , this little joke is the full extent of Maxwell taking “ special pains ” for his “ incisive refutation ” of Herbert Spencer .
Nevertheless , this unmistakably jocular sentence may be interpreted to imply that Maxwell ( the mathematician ) is satisfied with the use of a single device for transmitting and receiving , whereas only an evolutionist would want the devices to be different .
But in the next paragraph Maxwell himself indicates that differentiation is one of the keys to improving the system :
Accordingly , many attempts have been made , by differentiating the function of the transmitter from that of the receiver , to overcome the principal limitation of the power of the telephone .
Maxwell then goes on to discuss the work being done to improve the telephone , including Thomas Edison ’s electrically powered microphones .
As the telephone evolved in the years following 1878 , the microphone and speaker soon became two specialized components just as Darwin and Spencer would have predicted for evolving organisms .
When we examine an 1878 telephone today we indeed see “ an organism of a very low type . ”
The Battle for Maxwell 's Soul
Why is it so important to modern - day creationists to claim James Clerk Maxwell as one of their own ?
Why do they covet Maxwell ’s soul with such desperation that they would fabricate evidence and lie to children ?
And why does Maxwell simply refuse to cooperate ?
Why do these modern authors fail so miserably in painting Maxwell in their own colors ?
Creationists want Maxwell in their camp because he ’s one of the biggest trout in the pond .
Maxwell is today considered the foremost theoretical physicist of the nineteenth century whose achievements are most famously summarized by Richard Feynman :
From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from , say , ten thousand years from now — there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell 's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics .
The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade . [ ]
Moreover , getting a good anti-evolution quotation out of Maxwell should be a slam - dunk .
Even by Victorian standards , Maxwell was unquestionably a very religious man , [ ] mostly revealed in the letters to his wife , some of which are included in the Campbell and Garnett biography .
Yet , it ’s probably wrong to speak of Maxwell as a “ religious scientist ” in the same way the term might be applied to Robert Boyle , for example .
Maxwell was a very religious man who was also a scientist .
His religion drove his scientific research in only the most general way .
Maxwell ’s religion is virtually absent from his scientific writings , and he never seemed to bias either his choice of research or his conclusions on preconceived religious notions .
Like all Cambridge students of his era , Maxwell was subjected to a strong dose of William Paley ( 1743 – 1805 ) , the English utilitarian philosopher and theologian whose book Natural Theology , or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature ( 1802 ) summed up the prevailing contemporary arguments for intelligent design .
Yet , the evangelical circle that influenced Maxwell so profoundly in his Cambridge years rejected both Paley ’s utilitarianism and his natural theology .
[ ]
To these evangelicals , a reliance upon intelligent design to justify religious belief was even somewhat offensive .
Rather than Maxwell ’s science supporting his religion or his religion supporting his science , “ Maxwell ’s evangelicalism committed him to an anti-positivist position , the separation of science from other realms of human life : religion , morals , and aesthetics . ” [ ]
In this way , Maxwell is not quite like fellow Scottish scientists William Thomson ( 1824 – 1907 ) , later known as Lord Kelvin , and Peter Guthrie Tait ( 1831 – 1901 ) .
Thomson spoke of Paley ’s “ excellent old book ” in his 1871 President ’s Address to the BAAS , and spent some 40 years , on and off , trying to demonstrate that the earth had not been a suitable habitat for life long enough for natural selection to occur .
( Thomson ’s calculations did n’t take account of the warming effects of radioactive emissions of radium , which was n’t discovered until 1898 . )
Peter Guthrie
Tait wrote articles on this same theme and coauthored the book The Unseen Universe ( 1875 ) concerning , among other things , the spiritual implications of ether ( the stuff that was supposed to permeate the universe and provide a medium for electromagnetic waves ) .
Maxwell ’s involvement in the age - of - the - earth controversy is limited to one mention in his 1871 book Theory of Heat .
After analyzing Thomson ’s methodology , Maxwell concludes :
In this way Sir W. Thomson has calculated that , if no change has occurred in the order of things , it cannot have been more than 200,000,000 years since the earth was in the condition of a mass of molten matter , on which a solid crust was just beginning to form . [ ]
Although Thomson later refined his calculation and brought his estimate down to 10 million years , the 200 million year figure was still unchanged by the 9th edition of Theory of Heat published in 1888 .
Maxwell was not a signatory to the infamous 1865 Declaration of the Natural and Physical Sciences that stated “ We conceive that it is impossible for the Word of God , as written in the book of nature , and God ’s Word written in Holy Scripture , to contradict one another , however much they may appear to differ . ”
But then , neither were most reputable scientists in Britain .
The biggest names among the signatories were David Brewster , James Joule , and Adam Sedgwick . [ ]
Restraining from Conflict
Maxwell mostly kept his religious beliefs to himself .
He was a private man with an “ habitual reticence as to all that moved him deeply . ” [ ]
It seems he found these controversies about the supposed “ conflicts ” between science and religion rather distasteful .
Rather than conflicts , Maxwell perceived boundaries .
A few examples :
In November 1876 , Maxwell received a letter from the Reverend C. J. Ellicott , Lord Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol , soliciting a scientific interpretation from Maxwell of the Genesis passage implying that light was created prior to the sun .
Maxwell replied that “ it would be very tempting to say that the light of the first day means the all - embracing æther , the vehicle of radiation , and not actual light , whether from the sun or from any other source . ” [ ]
But that ’s the science of 1876 , and Maxwell was n’t sure it would agree with the science of 1896 .
I should be very sorry if an interpretation founded on a most conjectural scientific hypothesis were to get fastened to the text in Genesis , even if by doing it got rid of the old statement of the commentators which has long ceased to be intelligible .
The rate of change of scientific hypothesis is naturally much more rapid than that of biblical interpretations , so that if an interpretation is founded on such an hypothesis , it may help to keep the hypothesis above ground long after it ought to be buried and forgotten . [ ]
Maxwell suspected that the ether theory might someday be discarded ( which , of course , it was ) , but the most intriguing part of this passage is his reference to commentary on Genesis “ which has long ceased to be intelligible . ”
Several times , Maxwell was invited to join the Victoria Institute , an organization founded in 1865 to bring together scientists and others in defending scripture and religion against the findings of science .
Campbell and Garnett quote an unfinished draft of a letter from Maxwell declining the invitation :
I do not think it my duty to become a candidate for admission into the Victoria Institute .
Among the objects of the Society are some of which I think very highly .
I think men of science as well as other men need to learn from Christ , and I think Christians whose minds are scientific are bound to study science that their view of the glory of God may be as extensive as their being is capable of .
But I think that the results which each man arrives at in his attempts to harmonise his science with his Christianity ought not to be regarded as having any significance except to the man himself , and to him only for a time , and should not receive the stamp of a society .
For it is of the nature of science , especially of those branches of science which are spreading into unknown regions to be continually — [ ]
The draft ended there but a recent biography of Maxwell plausibly suggests that the next word would have been “ changing . ” [ ]
Maxwell is most explicit in defining his concepts of the limits of science in his review of the book Paradoxical Philosophy ( a sequel to The Unseen Universe ) , a review that was published in Nature [ ] and the collection of his scientific papers . [ ]
Maxwell writes that “ one of the severest tests of a scientific mind is to discern the limits of the legitimate application of scientific methods ” and concludes
The progress of science , therefore , so far as we have been able to follow it , has added nothing of importance to what has always been known about the physical consequences of death , but has rather tended to deepen the distinction between the visible part , which perishes before our eyes , and that which we are ourselves , and to show that this personality , which respect to its nature as well as to its destiny , lies quite beyond the range of science .
This is why the “ Molecules ” lecture and the “ Atom ” article are so fascinating :
They represent Maxwell ’s few forays into theological and metaphysical concerns in his published writings .
This brief flirtation with a design argument is , moreover , more sophisticated than the conventional ( often anthropomorphic ) astronomical and biological design arguments common earlier in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .
It 's a post - Darwin design argument .
And how refreshing is Maxwell ’s attitude when compared with those creationists who hold science hostage to Biblical literalism , and who shamelessly force Maxwell to conform to their agendas .
The creationist biographies of Maxwell treat his scientific work as a battle against materialism and evolution , and imply that this is a proper way to conduct science .
That attitude insults Maxwell and grossly distorts any type of reasonable scientific method .
The " French Atheist Laplace "
Here ’s another except from the Maxwell biography in Physical Science for Christian Schools .
This paragraph appears just before the one quoted at the beginning of this article :
An important work undertaken by Maxwell was the disproof of Laplace ’s nebular hypothesis .
In 1796 , the French atheist Laplace proposed a theory that the solar system had “ evolved ” from a large cloud , without need of a creator .
The cloud , Laplace claimed , contracted over a period of millions of years and gradually produced the solar system as we know it today .
Many who were of an anti-religious turn of mind accepted this idea without question .
Maxwell , however , upon analyzing it mathematically , found two major flaws in the theory : ( 1 ) The material would never condense into planets ; ( 2 ) There would be no way to slow the rapidly - spinning mass in the center to form our present slowly rotating sun .
The theory was discarded , and to this day it has never been replaced with one that is truly workable . [ ]
The " French atheist Laplace " is apparently the accepted form of address for Pierre Simon , Marquis de Laplace ( 1749 – 1827 ) in creationist circles .
Earlier Physical Science for Christian Schools had conceded that Laplace was “ a brilliant French mathematician ” and quickly added “ but an atheist , ” and then smote him with a quotation from the book of Job . [ ]
Ann Lamont ’s version shows her keen skill at paraphrase , and forces us consider the scholarship standards of someone who does most of her research out of a high school textbook :
Maxwell was able to refute evolutionary thinking in another important way .
He mathematically disproved the nebular hypothesis proposed in 1796 by French atheist , Laplace .
Laplace suggested that the solar system began as a cloud of gas which contracted over millions of years to produce planets and so on .
Laplace claimed there was thus no need of a Creator .
This philosophy was eagerly embraced by the opponents of Christianity .
However , Maxwell demonstrated two major flaws in Laplace ’s theory , and proved mathematically that such a process could not occur .
Laplace ’s theory was subsequently discarded . [ ]
Morris in Men of Science — Men of God condenses the whole thing into one sentence :
He was strongly opposed to evolution and was able to develop a rigorous mathematical refutation of the famous “ nebular hypothesis ” of the French atheist Laplace . [ ]
Whether Laplace was or was not an atheist is not known .
“ Nowhere in his writings , either public or private , does Laplace deny God ’s existence . ” [ ]
Laplace obtained this reputation mostly because his major scientific writings do not speculate about God , metaphysics , creation , or design .
A famous story has Napoleon asking Laplace about the role of God in his universe , and Laplace replying “ Je n’avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse - là ” ( “ I have no need of this hypothesis ” ) . [ ]
If Laplace really said that , he meant it literally — as less a declaration of atheism then of unrelenting empiricism .
Ever since Newton , the whole idea of science was to explain the workings of the universe without recourse to supernatural intervention .
What makes Laplace a dreaded " French atheist " in creationist 's eyes is not this attitude , for that was common , but that he was so successful at it .
Newton 's Theories of Intelligent Design
To understand why Laplace curls the toes of creationists , it 's necessary to understand the scientific and religious concepts of Isaac Newton ( 1642 – 1727 ) .
Like virtually all scientists of his era , Newton believed that his study of the universe ultimately revealed the glories of its Creator .
Yet , Newton 's goal in his masterwork Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy , 1687 ) was to explain the movements of the cosmos without using the assumption of God .
As Newton famously stated at the outset of Book 3 of the Principia , “ The System of the World ” :
No more causes of natural things should be admitted than are both true and sufficient to explain their phenomena . [ ]
Or , as he elaborated in an abandoned draft of a preface to a later edition of the Principia :
What is taught in metaphysics , if it is derived from divine revelation , is religion ; if it is derived from phenomena through the five external senses , it pertains to physics ; if it is derived from knowledge of the internal actions of our mind through the sense of reflection , it is only philosophy about the human mind and its ideas as internal phenomena likewise pertain to physics .
To dispute about the objects of ideas except insofar as they are phenomena is dreaming .
In all philosophy we must begin from phenomena and admit no principles of things , no causes , no explanations , except those which are established through phenomena .
And although the whole of philosophy is not immediately evident , still it is better to add something to our knowledge day by day than to fill up men ’s minds in advance with the preconceptions of hypotheses .
[ ] [ emphasis added ]
But the first edition of the Principia does n’t go even this deep in discussing the relationship between religion and physics .
The first edition of the Principia does n’t mention religion or God at all .
It was only after Newton had been stung by criticisms of his materialistic approach in the Principia that he added the final General Scholium to the second edition ( published in 1713 ) , which discusses the nature of God for those readers who make it through to the end of the book .
Newton 's concepts of God 's role in creating and maintaining the universe are revealed more in letters and other works than in the Principia .
When Richard Bentley ( 1662 – 1742 ) was preparing the very first Boyle Lecture , he asked Newton about evidences of intelligent design in the universe .
Newton responded with four letters ; [ ] the first begins with a reference to the recently published Principia :
When I wrote my treatise about our System , I had an eye upon such principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity ; and nothing can rejoice me more than to find it useful for that purpose . [ ]
Newton goes on to describe the fortuitous arrangement of the sun and planets of the solar system :
[ H] ad this cause been a blind one , without contrivance or design , the sun would have been a body of the same kind with Saturn , Jupiter , and the earth , that is , without light or heat . [ ]
Newton also sees design in the motions of the planets , which all revolve around the sun in the same direction and approximately the same plane :
[ I]t is plain that there is no natural cause which could determine all the planets , both primary and secondary , to move the same way and in the same plane , without any considerable variation ; this must have been the effect of counsel . [ ]
In the 1706 edition of his book Opticks , Newton suggested that God still had necessary chores to perform in maintaining the universe .
In reasserting his ideas about the revolutions of the planets , Newton now added a little caveat :
For while Comets move in very excentrick Orbs in all manner of Positions , blind Fate could never make all the Planets move one and the same way in Orbs concentrick , some inconsiderable Irregularities excepted , which may have risen from the mutual Actions of Comets and Planets upon one another , and which will be apt to increase , till this System wants a Reformation . [ ]
In other words , the gravitational interactions among the planets and comets eventually destabilize their orbits , causing irregularities that periodically need correction ( “ reformation ” ) through divine intervention .
This got the attention of Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz ( 1646 – 1716 ) , who ridiculed Newton ’s theology :
Sir Isaac Newton , and his followers , have also a very odd opinion concerning the work of God .
According to their doctrine , God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time : otherwise it would cease to move .
He had not , it seems , sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion .
Nay , the machine of God ’s making , is so imperfect , according to these gentleman ; that he is obliged to clean it now and then by an extraordinary concourse , and even to mend it , as a clockmaker mends his work ; who must consequently be so much the more unskillful a workman , as he is oftener obliged to mend his work and to set it right . [ ]
Both Newton and Leibniz are wading into treacherous waters here .
It ’s the central paradox of natural theology :
As the universe is increasingly shown to be governed by fixed laws , God ’s perfect creation seems to require no further divine interaction , which implies a deistic cosmology .
The need for miracles and divine intervention implies a flawed creation .
Yet , the absence of miracles implies a God who no longer cares .
Newton 's influence over British ( and later , Continental and American ) science , philosophy , and religion cannot be underestimated , but the influence manifested itself in several streams .
Some Newtonians used the existence of natural laws — the order , harmony , and regularity of the universe — as clear evidence of intelligent design .
This was the tradition of natural theology epitomized by the Boyle Lectures , Paley , and the Bridgewater Treatises .
Others , however , found the perfection of these laws to be the best argument for deism .
Miracles were increasingly doubted because they represented improbable violations of God 's own laws .
Even the most prominent Newtonian theologian — Samuel Clarke ( 1675 – 1729 ) , who had delivered the Boyle Lectures of 1704 and 1705 and who was Newton 's spokesman in the debates with Leibniz — was , like Newton , a disbeliever in the divinity of Christ .
It is a direct line from Newton to the deists , skeptics , and Unitarians of the late eighteenth century Enlightenment — to British writers such as David Hume and Edward Gibbon , French philosophes such as Denis Diderot and Voltaire , American revolutionaries such as Thomas Paine , Thomas Jefferson , and Benjamin Franklin . [ ]
To modern - day creationists , Laplace provides a convenient bogeyman in this philosophical evolution .
Laplace followed Newton ’s dictum about admitting " no more causes of natural things " to the limit , and in that sense , Laplace was the ultimate Newtonian .
But if modern - day creationists really wish to identify the man who secularized cosmology , the man who planted the seeds of deism that took root during the eighteenth century , the man on whose shoulder Laplace stood , they really must attack Newton — just like late nineteenth - century Methodist ministers did . [ ]
Laplace Solves Newton 's Problems
By the time of Laplace , few people still believed that the solar system needs “ reformation ” — those little fixes and tune - ups to prevent catastrophes .
Yet , there were still some problems to be solved .
It was well established that Jupiter was accelerating in its orbit and Saturn was decelerating .
In 1786 , Laplace demonstrated that these two effects would balance out and reverse themselves in 900 years without the hand of God that Newton required earlier in the century .
Laplace 's calculations were considered at the time ( and still today ) as a triumph of the Newtonian method .
By the end of the eighteenth century , arguments for intelligent design had generally shifted focus from the astronomical to the biological .
Natural theologians were now more interested in the adaptation of living things to their environments .
However , the fortuitous arrangement of the solar system that had so impressed Newton — the massive warming sun in the middle surrounded by orbiting planets — was certainly not neglected .
Here 's William Paley in his 1802 book Natural Theology :
Amongst proofs of choice , one is , fixing the source of light and heat in the centre of the system .
The sun is ignited and luminous ; the planets , which move round him , cold and dark .
There seems to be no antecedent necessity for this order .
The sun might have been an opaque mass ; some one , or two , or more , or any , or all , the planets , globes of fire .
There is nothing in the nature of the heavenly bodies , which requires that those which are stationary should be on fire , that those which move should be cold : for , in fact , comets are bodies on fire , or at least capable of the most intense heat , yet revolve round a centre : nor does this order obtain between the primary planets and their secondaries , which are all opaque .
When we consider , therefore , that the sun is one ; that the planets going round it are , at least , seven ; that it is indifferent to their nature , which are luminous and which are opaque ; and also , in what order , with respect to each other , these two kinds of bodies are disposed ; we may judge of the improbability of the present arrangement taking place by chance . [ ]
Just six years earlier , however , Laplace had indeed suggested a natural explanation for the configuration of the solar system .
Speculation and conjecturing were not in Laplace 's nature .
He rarely considered anything that was n't the result of observation and experience , and he nearly apologized for proposing something that at the time was more hypothesis than anything else .
Yet , a condensation of matter rotating around the sun seemed to explain all the characteristics of the solar system that Newton had attributed to divine providence and design . [ ]
That ’s perhaps what Laplace meant when ( or if ) he said he had " pas besoin de cette hypothèse - là . ”
Two centuries later , apparently , there are some who still hate him for it .
The Nebular Hypothesis Comes to England
According to Physical Science for Christian Schools , after Laplace developed the nebular hypothesis , “ Many who were of an anti-religious turn of mind accepted this idea without question . ”
The history of the nebular hypothesis in scientific thought was never this simplistic .
First , Laplace ’s conjectures of the origin of the solar system were n’t entirely the fabrication of a solitary atheistic mind .
They were partially based on observations of nebulae made by astronomer John Herschel ( which he interpreted as solar systems in the making ) and can also be traced to Immanuel Kant , certainly no heretic .
Also , no one ever accepted “ this idea without question . ”
There ’s a good reason why it was known as the nebular hypothesis .
Nor was the nebular hypothesis an idea accepted only by those “ of an anti-religious turn of mind . ”
In fact , the term “ nebular hypothesis ” was coined by the Reverend William Whewell ( 1794 – 1866 ) , “ one of the central figures in Victorian science , ” [ ] who devoted a chapter to discussing the concepts in his book Astronomy and General Physics Considered with Reference to Natural Theology ( 1833 ) , one of the eight Bridgewater Treatises “ On the Power , Wisdom and Goodness of God , as manifested in the Creation ” commissioned in the early 1830s .
Whewell assures his readers that the nebular hypothesis is n’t as materialist as it may first seem .
Leaving then to other persons and to future ages to decide upon the scientific merits of the nebular hypothesis , we conceive that the final fate of this opinion can not , in sound reason affect at all the view which we have been endeavouring to illustrate ; — the view of the universe as the work of a wise and good Creator . [ ]
Whewell had already assured his readers early on that the earth exhibited sure signs of divine creation .
The length of the day and the length of the year , for example , had been set precisely in agreement with the needs and rhythms of the living things populating the planet .
Even if the solar system and earth had formed as Laplace had described , it was clear to Whewell that God had guided the process .
The man who really spread the word in the English - speaking world about the nebular hypothesis was John Pringle Nichol ( 1804 – 1859 ) .
About the same time that the young William Thomson was attending Nichol 's class in Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh , Nichol published his extremely popular Views of the Architecture of the Heavens ( 1837 ) .
Pringle does n’t let his readers forget what they are looking at when they gaze at the heavens :
Apart from all speculation , — surely the view of an actual order whose beginnings are hid in what seems in our eye nothing less than Eternity , cannot but elevate our thoughts of that BEING , who , amid change , is alone unchangeable — whose glance reaches from the beginning to the end — and whose presence occupies all things !
If uneasy feelings are suggested , and I have heard of such , by the idea of a process which may appear to substitute progress for creation , and place law in the room of providence , their origin lies in the misconception of a name .
LAW of itself is no substantive or independent power ; no crucial influence sprung of blind necessity , which carries on events of its own will and energies without command .
Separated from connection with an ARRANGER in reference to whose mind alone , and as experience of the Creative Idea it can be connected with the notion of control —
Law is a mere name for a long order — an order unoriginated , unupheld , unsubstantial , whose floor sounds hollow beneath the tread , and whose spaces are all void ; an order hanging trembling over nothingness , and of which every constituent — every thing and creature fails not to beseech incessantly for a substance and substratum in the idea of ONE — WHO LIVETH FOREVER ! [ ]
Among J. P. Nichol ’s many readers was Edgar Allen Poe , who has his fictional detective Dupin mention “ Dr. Nichols ” [ sic ] and the “ nebular cosmogony ” in his story “ Murders in the Rue Morgue ” ( 1841 ) .
Poe later heard Nichol lecture in New York in 1847 - 8 and in response wrote the prose poem Eureka : An Essay on the Material and Spiritual Universe ( 1848 ) . [ ]
The nebular hypothesis was well known by the time Robert Chambers integrated it into his immensely popular ( but scientifically flawed ) evolutionary view of the universe , Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation ( 1844 ) .
Maxwell and the Rings of Saturn
But we were considering James Clerk Maxwell here , and suddenly the connections between our subject and the nebular hypothesis dry up .
They simply do n’t exist .
Maxwell never undertook to disproof the nebular hypothesis , he never analyzed the nebular hypothesis , and he never even wrote about the nebular hypothesis in any detail .
Nevertheless , Maxwell is sometimes mentioned in connection with the nebular hypothesis as a result of his research into the rings of Saturn .
Analyzing the rings of Saturn was the subject chosen for the 1856 Adams Prize , named after John Couch Adams , who had predicted the existence of Neptune .
The Adams Prize was open to graduates of Cambridge .
For the 1856 prize , entrants were to mathematically derive a structure of Saturn ’s rings that would exhibit stability .
James Clerk Maxwell was intrigued and his mathematical analysis won the prize ( he was the only entrant ) and was published in 1859 as a 71 - page book .
[ ]
Although Maxwell had previously published 18 scientific papers , this was the real launch of his illustrious career .
In his essay of Saturn ’s rings , Maxwell is clearly standing on Laplace ’s shoulders .
He refers to Laplace several times , and never once calls him an “ atheist ” or considers that a reason to discount his work .
Laplace had demonstrated that a single solid ring around Saturn would tend to break apart .
Maxwell agreed , but found an odd case where a solid ring would be stable .
A fluid ring , Maxwell determined , would not be stable .
It was widely assumed ( by Laplace and others ) that a ring composed of disconnected solid particles would be unstable as well .
Any collision or other perturbation would tend to propagate itself through the ring and shake things up .
But Maxwell demonstrated — using mathematics from Laplace and Fourier ( another theologically suspect French mathematician ) — that a ring composed of particles would be stable .
Now , what has this got to do with the nebular hypothesis ?
Laplace thought that the rings of Saturn provided a small - scale example of the nebular hypothesis in action .
But if the rings of Saturn are stable , a spinning ring of gases might also be stable , and hence , the gases would never coalesce to form a solar system .
However , the leap from Saturn ’s rings to the nebular hypothesis is one that Maxwell never made .
Maxwell briefly mentions the nebular hypothesis towards the beginning of his essay , but does n’t touch on it again .
He even concludes the essay with some speculation about the possible future evolution of Saturn ’s rings .
At the time of Maxwell ’s research , some recent observations seemed to indicate that the rings had been changing over the years .
Maxwell discussed the implications :
If the changes already suspect should be confirmed by repeated observations with the same instruments , it will be worth while to investigate more carefully whether Saturn ’s Rings are permanent or transitionary elements of the Solar System , and whether in that part of the heavens we see celestial immutability , or terrestrial corruption and generation , and the old order giving place to new before our eyes . [ ]
Maxwell ’s last clause of evolutionary supposition alludes to the beginning of King Arthur ’s deathbed speech in Tennyson ’s “ Morte d’Arthur ” :
The old order changeth , yielding place to new ,
And God fulfils
Himself in many ways ,
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world . [ ]
Historian of science Stephen G. Brush , one of the co-editors of the book Maxwell on Saturn ’s Rings , confirms that Maxwell had little to do with debunking the nebular hypothesis :
[ I]t is correct that Maxwell demonstrated the stability under various perturbing forces of a system of rings composed of particles ; in particular , he showed that the tendency toward conglomeration into a single satellite , suggested by the Nebular Hypothesis , would be effectively counteracted by the dynamical forces involved in the revolution of the particles around the massive central body .
But Maxwell did not , as is sometimes claimed , infer from this that the Nebular Hypothesis is invalid as an explanation of planetary formation . [ ]
Brush chronicles the rocky history of the nebular hypothesis in his books Nebulous Earth and Fruitful Encounters . [ ]
For much of the nineteenth century , the nebular hypothesis was the primary model for the origin of the solar system .
Only around the turn of the century did the nebular hypothesis begin to be seriously challenged by alternative theories involving an encounter between the sun and another star .
Since about the time of the Second World War , however , a modified form of the nebular hypothesis has again been favored .
If Maxwell indeed disproved the nebular hypothesis , then we should not expect a prominent Victorian scientist to be still talking about the nebular hypothesis decades after Maxwell ’s 1859 paper and eight years after Maxwell ’s death .
And the last thing we should expect is for this prominent scientist to be none other than William Thomson ( Lord Kelvin ) , who helped develop the Adams Prize problem that Maxwell solved , who was as familiar with Maxwell ’s scientific work as anyone , and who merits a mini-biography of his own in Physical Science for Christian Schools .
Yet , here is William Thomson delivering an evening lecture “ On the Sun ’s Heat ” on Friday , January 21 , 1887 , before the Royal Institution of Great Britain .
Thomson had explored the origins of the sun ’s heat for a couple decades , but the problem ( like that of the age of the earth ) would not be solved until after his death .
In this lecture , Thomson suggests that the sun was formed by the confluence of several million moon - like bodies .
A vapor of gas is generated that
may settle into an oblate rotating nebula extending its equatorial radius far beyond the orbit of Nepture , and with moment of momentum equal to or exceeding the moment of momentum of the solar system .
This is just the beginning postulated by Laplace for his nebular theory of the evolution of the solar system ; which , founded on the natural history of the stellar universe , as observed by the elder Herschel , and completed in details by the profound dynamical judgment and imaginative genius of Laplace , seems converted by thermodynamics into a necessary truth … [ ]
So here we have William Thomson , one of the primary figures in formulating the first two laws of thermodynamics — which according to the creationists are supposed to refute evolution — not only committing the unforgivable sin of failing to identify Laplace as an atheist , but also suggesting that the nebular hypothesis be accepted as a consequence of thermodynamics as “ a necessary truth . ”
Maxwell Dragged Into Battle
I suppose we can forgive Physical Science for Christian Schools for claiming that Maxwell disproved the nebular hypothesis because that misconception is quite common .
Several popular authors of the past half - century have written something similar , including famous ones like George Gamow [ ] and Isaac Asimov . [ ]
It even shows up in the current ( 15th ) edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica ! [ ]
And from there it ’s inevitable that the same mistake pops up lightly paraphrased in Wikipedia [ ] and other online sources .
Despite the claim in these three - and - a - half sources that Maxwell disproved the nebular hypothesis , all go on to discuss how the nebular hypothesis has regained acceptance since the 1940s .
Interestingly enough , the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica ( 1910 – 1911 ) makes no such mention of Maxwell and suggests that the nebular hypothesis , while “ emphatically a speculation ” that “ cannot be demonstrated by observation or established by mathematical calculation ” is nevertheless “ indicated by the general tendencies of the laws of nature ” and “ has not been proved inconsistent with any fact . ” [ ]
In 1916 James Jeans developed a “ tidal theory ” of the origins of the solar system involving a close encounter between the sun and another star .
By proposing an alternative to the nebular hypothesis , Jeans would have good reason to enlist Maxwell in his support .
But in his popular The Universe Around Us ( 1929 ) he writes that Laplace ’s conception of the nebular hypothesis in 1796 “ survived , and indeed [ had ] been generally accepted , for nearly a century before it encountered any serious opposition , ” [ ] that is , some 35 years after Maxwell ’s essay and 15 years after his death .
If Maxwell really disproved the nebular hypothesis , nobody seems to have noticed it at the time , or for many years thereafter .
So how has it become almost common knowledge that Maxwell was involved ?
The blame for this misconception should probably be lain on the shoulders of George Gamow ( 1904 – 1968 ) , the Russian - born American physicist who was instrumental in developing the Big Bang theory , and whose popular books on science ( such as One , Two , Three … Infinity ) have delighted generations of readers .
Between 1940 and 1952 Gamow wrote a “ cosmological trilogy ” through which we can trace Gamow ’s changing conception of Maxwell ’s involvement in the nebular hypothesis .
In The Birth and Death of the Sun ( 1940 ) , Gamow makes no mention of Maxwell with regard to the nebular hypothesis .
Instead , Gamow indicates some problems with the theory and finds more probable that “ the formation of the planets as due to an encounter of our Sun with some other stellar body of comparable size . ” [ ]
A year later , in Biography of the Earth ( 1941 ) , Gamow discusses the cosmogonical theories of Buffon and Laplace , and introduces a role for Maxwell in the debate :
The stability of gaseous or liquid rings rotating around a central body was studied by the famous English [ actually Scottish ] physicist James Clerk - Maxwell in his investigation of the rings surrounding the planet Saturn .
His results , published in 1859 , indicate that such rings will actually break up into a large number of smaller bodies , distributed uniformly in a circular orbit instead of coalescing into single planets .
According to his calculations , for example , the gaseous ring that Laplace supposed had given rise to Jupiter would break up into about fifty separate bodies , distributed along the present orbit of Jupiter and showing no tendency to coalesce . [ ]
That ’s a fair evaluation .
Gamow indicates that Maxwell was studying the rings of Saturn and that these calculations could be applied to the nebular hypothesis .
Gamow is not asserting that Maxwell had ever done so .
A decade later , however , in The Creation of the Universe ( 1952 ) , Gamow describes Maxwell ’s role as a much more active one :
The Kant - Laplace hypothesis , which dominated scientific thought for over a century , was , however , severely criticized by the British scientist James Clerk Maxwell , who thought he had proved that such a condensation had never taken place . [ ]
What happened here ?
The idea that Maxwell “ severely criticized ” the nebular hypothesis is just plain wrong .
Perhaps Gamow did n’t quite remember the very passive role Maxwell ’s research had actually played , and blew it up into something it certainly was not .
Unfortunately , Gamow ’s error has taken deep roots in the popular history of the nebular hypothesis , perhaps never to be extracted .
Bad Science History but Worse Science
Yes , we can forgive Physical Science for Christian Schools for repeating this misconception about Maxwell and the nebular hypothesis .
But we cannot forgive the book for the way in which it portrays Maxwell as a creationist sheriff , hunting down blasphemous theories and eliminating them with blasts of brilliant mathematics .
Are the authors really suggesting that this is how science should be practiced ?
The statement that the nebular hypothesis “ was discarded , and to this day it has never been replaced with one that is truly workable ” is true only in the sense that the origins of the solar system is a problem still being actively pursued .
It is a common fallacy among creationists that the lack of a completely proven theory strengthens the most implausible theory , which even Physical Science for Christian Schools is reticent to spell out .
Yet , a few unmistakable hints are dropped throughout the book :
The Preface states of the book ’s objectives , “ A young earth model is offered when the scientific dating methods are discussed , ” [ ] and the chapter on thermodynamics states flatly “ Creation was finished in six days . ” [ ]
The authors of Physical Science of Christian Schools are very proud of their chapter on thermodynamics : “ In what is probably a unique chapter for a ninth - grade physical science book , the first and second laws of thermodynamics are discussed and then related to the concept of evolution . ” [ ]
It is obvious , however , that the sole purpose of this chapter is not to convey information about thermodynamics , but to use thermodynamics to refute evolution .
It is certainly , as they say , a “ unique ” chapter , and one in which the book ’s favorite scientists remain oddly silent .
Surely if evolution really violates the laws of thermodynamics , they could have found one little quotation from William Thomson or James Joule or James Clerk Maxwell to that effect .
Just one .
It must be extremely frustrating for young - earth creationists to be so convinced that Maxwell is one of their own , and yet have no evidence to back up the claim .
Maxwell so successfully separated his science and his religion that the few tiny connections are pounced upon by creationists with squeals of delight , treasured without comprehension , and worshipped as if they provide a full - view window into Maxwell ’s beliefs .
The resultant miniature biographies of Maxwell and other “ creationist scientists ” have become an unseemly form of grave digging .
Bodies of long - dead geniuses are exhumed and wired to some unholy machine from the cobwebbed backrooms of pseudo - science , where they are zapped with politicized biblical dogma and made to dance a bizarre creationist jig .
Playing
God must be easy for people who think they know the one true way to read the book of Genesis .
But it ’s not science , and it ’s not history , and it ’s certainly not theology .
And yet , the same globs of nonsense continue to be coughed up and recycled on creationist web sites .
A recent mini-biography of Maxwell on the Apologetics Press site provides the sorry spectacle of a yet another author — said to be a scientist — cribbing from a children ’s book :
He strongly opposed the theory of evolution , and was easily able to develop a rigorous mathematical refutation of the famous “ nebular hypothesis ” of the French atheist LaPlace .
He also wrote an incisive refutation of the evolutionary philosophies of Herbert Spencer , the great advocate of Darwinism . [ ]
Notice the evolutionary mutation : Now Maxwell was “ easily " able to disprove the nebular hypothesis .
Regardless of the implications of Maxwell ’s essay on Saturn ’s rings , the suggestion that he did n’t devote a lot of hard work to this essay adds yet another insult to those that Maxwell has already sustained at the hands of creationists .
Meanwhile , the successor to Physical Science for Christian Schools is entitled Physics for Christian Schools ( Bob Jones University Press , 1996 ) , and it ’s somewhat tamer than the original text .
It trims the Maxwell biography to one page and abandons all discussions of the nebular hypothesis , manufactured molecules , and the telephone .
It says simply :
He strongly opposed the theory of evolution , which was becoming popular among scientists of his time . [ ]
The authors of this newer book offer no proof or evidence of this outrageous statement .
That ’s because there is none .

PARIS --
To reach Virginie and Ronnie 's apartment , located in a working - class district near Paris 's Gare du Nord station , you need to climb a narrow , endless spiral staircase .
At the very top , under the eaves , their tiny living area has peeling paint and rising dampness .
Given the space , the visitor can hardly fail to notice the three posters the tenants have hung on the walls .
A breath of fresh air in these dank surroundings , they portray the wide open spaces of Quebec through the seasons .
The slogan " Faire sa vie au Québec " ( " Make Your Life In Quebec " ) is splayed across the posters .
It 's a new mantra for this ...
CRAWFORD , Texas ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Friday rejected the defense spending bill passed by Congress earlier this month .
With a " pocket veto , " President Bush has killed a defense spending bill passed by Congress earlier this month .
The president has concerns over a provision that would let victims of Saddam Hussein 's regime with legal claims in U.S. courts seek compensation from the Iraqi government .
He issued a " memorandum of disapproval " Friday that means the bill will die without becoming law .
He did not veto it outright , but killed the bill by failing to sign it within 10 days of Congress passing it .
When that happens and Congress is out of session , a bill dies without becoming law -- a process known as a " pocket veto . "
If enacted , the White House said , the act would have permitted " plaintiff 's lawyers immediately to freeze Iraqi funds and would expose Iraq to massive liability in lawsuits concerning the misdeeds of the Saddam Hussein regime .
" The new democratic government of Iraq , during this crucial period of reconstruction , cannot afford to have its funds entangled in such lawsuits in the United States . "
Among those who would have benefited from the provision are American prisoners of war from the 1991 Gulf War who were tortured and beaten by members of Hussein 's military .
The Gulf War POWs sought $ 959 million in compensation from the interim Iraqi government .
They were opposed by the Bush administration , which argued Iraq has reformed and needs the money to rebuild .
The Supreme Court without comment refused in 2005 to intervene in the dispute , following a federal appeals court ruling that said Congress did not permit such lawsuits against foreign governments .
The suit was brought by 17 former POWs and their family members .
The pocket veto also blocks a 0.5 percent pay raise for members of the U.S. armed forces , but does not affect a 3 percent pay increase scheduled to take effect Tuesday .
The White House , however , said it hopes to reinstate the 0.5 percent pay raise , retroactive to Jan. 1 , after working with Congress to remove the provision related to legal claims against Iraq .
Bush 's action Friday also blocks more money for veterans ' health care .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , criticized the president 's decision .
" The defense bill passed both houses of Congress by overwhelming bipartisan margins and addresses urgent national security priorities , " including the pay raise and money for veterans ' health care , Pelosi and Reid said in a written statement .
" It is unfortunate that the president will not sign this critical legislation . "
The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Sen. Carl Levin , D - Michigan , also expressed dismay at the president 's decision .
" This bill is important to our men and women in uniform , " Levin said .
" It is unfortunate that the administration failed to identify the concerns upon which this veto is based until after the bill had passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the president for signature .
" I am deeply disappointed that our troops and veterans may have to pay for their mistake and for the confusion and uncertainty caused by their snafu . "
The disputed legal claims provision in the defense bill prompted the Iraqi government to threaten to withdraw $ 25 billion in Iraqi assets from U.S. banks , White House officials told CNN .
The Democratic leaders said that Bush worked closely with Congress on the bill and " gave no indication prior to its passage that one section of the bill could generate a presidential veto . "

All About George W. Bush • Saddam Hussein • The White House
Alcohol has a strong causal relationship with sexual arousal and disinhibited sexual behavior in humans ; however , the physiological support for this notion is largely lacking and thus a suitable animal model to address this issue is instrumental .
We investigated the effect of ethanol on sexual behavior in Drosophila .
Wild - type males typically court females but not males ; however , upon daily administration of ethanol , they exhibited active intermale courtship , which represents a novel type of behavioral disinhibition .
The ethanol - treated males also developed behavioral sensitization , a form of plasticity associated with addiction , since their intermale courtship activity was progressively increased with additional ethanol experience .
We identified three components crucial for the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition : the transcription factor regulating male sex behavior Fruitless , the ABC guanine / tryptophan transporter White and the neuromodulator dopamine .
fruitless mutant males normally display conspicuous intermale courtship ; however , their courtship activity was not enhanced under ethanol .
Likewise , white males showed negligible ethanol - induced intermale courtship , which was not only reinstated but also augmented by transgenic
White expression .
Moreover , inhibition of dopamine neurotransmission during ethanol exposure dramatically decreased ethanol - induced intermale courtship .
Chronic ethanol exposure also affected a male 's sexual behavior toward females : it enhanced sexual arousal but reduced sexual performance .
These findings provide novel insights into the physiological effects of ethanol on sexual behavior and behavioral plasticity .
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , which offers vast genetic resources , tools and databases , is an excellent model to investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying behavior and has been adopted for studying addictive substances such as alcohol , cocaine , and methamphetamine [ 10 ] – [ 12 ] .
Ethanol is naturally present in fermented fruits and cereals where fruit flies are usually found .
Upon exposure to ethanol vapor , flies show increased locomotor activities and sedation [ 11 ] .
Moreover , flies develop tolerance to the sedative effect of ethanol after a single exposure to high concentrations of ethanol or after a prolonged exposure to low concentrations , which is mediated by adaptive changes in brain activities [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
These biphasic and adaptive responses of flies to ethanol are strikingly similar to those of rodents and humans .
This implies that ethanol affects the fly and mammalian nervous systems in a similar manner .
In this study , we have explored whether recurring ethanol experience elicits behavioral changes in Drosophila .
We report here that Drosophila males , upon repeated exposure to ethanol , not only developed tolerance to the sedative effect , but they also displayed active intermale courtship and behavioral sensitization to this effect .
Moreover , the neural factor regulating male sexual behavior Fruitless M ( Fru M ) , the ABC guanine / tryptophan transporter White and the neuromodulator dopamine were crucial in the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
Ethanol acts on multiple neural systems to produce diverse behavioral responses [ 1 ] – [ 3 ] .
At low doses , ethanol induces euphoria and disinhibition whereas excessive consumption causes loss of motor control , sedation and sometimes fatality .
A prominent euphoric response associated with ethanol in humans is sexual arousal .
The enhanced arousal , in combination with the negative effect of ethanol on cognition , is believed to cause disinhibited sexual behavior , which possibly underlies risky sexual behavior such as unprotected sex and assaults associated with drinking [ 4 ] – [ 6 ] .
The ethanol - associated sexual behavior appears to be due to expectancy ( outcome based on learned anticipation ) as well as pharmacological effects [ 5 ] ; however , physiological evidence is lacking .
Animal studies investigating ethanol 's effects on sexual behavior have mainly focused on sexual performance , in which ethanol negatively affects copulatory behavior [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
Nonetheless , two studies specifically explored ethanol 's effect on sexual motivation or arousal in male rats , but their findings are inconsistent [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] .
Therefore , the physiological underpinning of ethanol 's effect on sexual arousal and disinhibition needs to be resolved .
Contrary to the effect of chronic ethanol , the initial ethanol experience has a negative effect on male courtship behavior toward females .
Without ethanol , males actively courted females , which were typically followed by copulation ( Figure 6B ) ; however , the courtship activity was drastically diminished under the influence of ethanol on the first exposure ( Figure 6A ) .
Ethanol also affected sexual performance .
In the absence of ethanol , approximately 35 % of males copulated with females , whereas only a small percentage of the ethanol - naïve or chronic - ethanol - treated males copulated with females under the influence of ethanol ( Figure 6B ) .
Thus , both initial and recurring ethanol treatments have a negative effect on copulation .
( A) Courtship .
The wings of CS males or females were clipped to distinguish the sex .
The ethanol - naïve or ethanol - treated males were housed with an equal number of virgin females and subjected to ethanol exposure in 95 % Flypub .
Two - factor ANOVA revealed the significant effects of partner , exposure , and interaction in both sets of experiments ( intact male with wing - clipped female : partner effect , F 1,27 = 75.8 , p<0.0001 ; exposure effect , F 1,27 = 93.9 , p<0.0001 ; interaction , F 1,27 = 53.2 , p<0.0001 ; n = 7 .
Wing - clipped male with intact female : partner effect , F 1,27 = 120.8 , p<0.0001 ; exposure effect , F 1,27 = 239.5 , p<0.0001 ; interaction , F 1,27 = 43.2 , p<0.0001 ; n = 7 ) .
Double asterisks , significant difference by planned Student t- tests .
( B ) Copulation .
CS males under the influence of ethanol on the 1 st and 6 th exposures displayed significantly reduced copulation with virgin females ( ANOVA , F 2,20 = 47.7 , p<0.0001 ; double asterisk , significant difference by Tukey - Kramer ; n = 7 ) .
Courtship of Drosophila females is usually passive .
Upon daily ethanol treatment , females did not show courtship toward other females ( n = 6 ) .
Thus , the effect of ethanol on homosexual courtship is specific to males .
We next addressed whether the ethanol - induced intermale courtship is attributable to altered sexual orientation of males .
If this were the case , chronic - ethanol - treated males would prefer courting males to females .
To test this , the age - matched , ethanol - naïve and chronic - ethanol - treated ( daily ethanol treatment for 5 days ) CS males were subjected to ethanol exposure in the presence of CS virgin females .
In this experiment , the wings of either males or females were clipped to distinguish the sex .
Typically , males in the absence of ethanol vigorously court virgin females and readily engage in copulation that lasts approximately 20 min [ 32 ] .
To differentiate sexual behavior affected by ethanol from basal behavior , males and females were acclimated in separate compartments in Flypub and mixed together immediately after ethanol administration .
Under the influence of ethanol , the previously ethanol - naïve males displayed a small , but significant , courtship activity toward females and negligible courtship toward males ( Figure 6A ) .
In contrast , the chronic - ethanol - treated males exhibited dramatically increased courtship toward females as well as males ; nonetheless , a significantly larger number of males courted females than males .
It was also noticeable that the courting males routinely changed a courtship partner from a male to a female and vice versa .
These observations indicate that recurring ethanol experience does not change sexual orientation of males ; rather , it enhances sexual arousal and disinhibition .
( A) TH - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts and DDC - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts males , when subjected to daily ethanol exposure at 32 °C to block synaptic output of dopamine neurons , displayed drastically reduced intermale courtship compared to the control mw + / UAS - Shi ts males on all exposures ( 1 st exposure , F 2,21 = 18.24 , p<0.0001 ; 2 nd , F 2,21 = 35.26 , p<0.0001 ; 3 rd , F 2,21 = 27.02 , p<0.0001 ; n = 7–8 ) .
Double asterisks , significant difference by Tukey - Kramer tests .
( B ) TH - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts males , when subjected to daily ethanol exposure at room temperature , showed intermale courtship activities comparable to those of the control TH - GAL4 / UAS - GFP males , indicating that Shi ts expressed in dopamine neurons without the dominant negative activity has no effect on the ethanol - induced intermale courtship ( Student t- test on all exposures , p>0.5 , n = 7 ) .
Ethanol acts on multiple neural systems ; however , the altered intermale courtship activities of w and mw + males point to dopamine and serotonin as primary culprits for the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
To test this , we employed the GAL4 / UAS system [ 28 ] and temperature - sensitive dominant negative Dynamin Shi ts [ 29 ] to manipulate dopamine neuronal activities .
At 30 °C or higher restrictive temperature , Shi ts inhibits endocytosis and thus blocks synaptic output .
Transgenic TH ( tyrosine hydroxylase enhancer ) - GAL4 or DDC ( dopa decarboxylase enhancer ) - GAL4 flies express the transcription factor GAL4 in dopamine or dopamine and serotonin neurons , respectively , to activate expression of the gene ( e.g . Shi ts ) downstream of UAS [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
Thus , we tested TH - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts and DDC - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts males to recurring ethanol exposure at the restrictive temperature , under which condition synaptic output of dopamine and dopamine / serotonin neurons , respectively , is inhibited .
Since all transgenes are tagged with mw + as an in vivo transformation marker , mw + / UAS - Shi ts males were used as a control to match the mw + copy number .
When subjected to daily ethanol exposure at 32°C , both TH - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts and DDC - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts males showed significantly reduced intermale courtship activities compared to mw + / UAS - Shi ts males on all exposures examined ( Figure 5A ) .
When tested at room temperature , on the contrary , TH - GAL4 / UAS - Shi ts males displayed the ethanol - induced intermale courtship activities comparable to those of the control males ( Figure 5B ) .
Thus ,
Shi ts in the absence of dominant negative activities has no effect on the ethanol - induced intermale courtship .
These observations indicate that synaptic output of dopamine neurons is required for the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
Interestingly , the ethanol - induced courtship activities of homozygous f06195 ( mw + / mw + ) and heterozygous PHSBJb 3 ( hs - mw + /+ ) males with or without heat shock ( incubation at 37 °C for 1 h once a day for 3 days prior to ethanol exposure ) were higher than that of CS males in all exposures except for the first ( Figure 4 ) .
On the first exposure , significant levels of intermale courtship were detected in mw + / mw + males and hs - mw + /+ males with heat shock ( hs- mw + /+ HS ) ( Figure 4A ) while the same heat treatment did not induce intermale courtship in CS and w males ( n = 6 ) .
The w gene is normally expressed in the eye pigment cells and the brain [ 27 ] , in which its expression pattern is unknown .
Notably , the eye colors of all transgenic mw + males were lighter than that of CS males and the males expressing mw + in the CS ( w+ ) background displayed enhanced ethanol - induced intermale courtship levels similar to those in the w mutant background ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , while deficient
White in the eye appears to primarily account for the poor ethanol - induced courtship in w males , over - or mis-expressed White may enhance intermale courtship under ethanol possibly by acting on the cellular pathway ( s ) underlying courtship disinhibition .
Taken together , the ABC guanine / tryptophan transporter
White is essential for the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition and its ectopic or increased expression leads to a high propensity to this behavior .
To test whether the w 1118 male 's phenotype could be rescued by reinstating White expression , we employed two independent lines f06195 and PHSBJb 3 , which carry the transgenic mini- white ( mw + ) gene in the transformation vectors piggyBAC and P - element , respectively [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
The mw + gene represents a w genomic clone including 300 bp 5 ′ and 630 bp 3 ′ endogenous regulatory sequence but lacking most of the first intron [ 26 ] .
In addition , the mw + gene in PHSBJb 3 is under the influence of neighboring heat - shock promoter , which induces over - expression of mw + at 37 °C [ 25 ] .
The heterozygous f06195 and PHSBJb 3 males in the w 1118 mutant background ( mw + /+ and hs -mw + /+ ; Figure 4 ; Movie S2 ) exhibited intermale courtship under the influence of ethanol in an exposure - dependent manner .
This indicates that White , the protein absent in the w mutant , is essential for the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
We surveyed pre-existing fly mutants to investigate the cellular mechanism underlying the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition and found a commonly used strain white 1118 ( w 1118 ) displaying negligible intermale courtship upon recurring ethanol administration with 70 % ( n = 6 ) or 95 % ethanol ( n = 32 ; Figure 4 ; Movie S2 ) .
A similar result was obtained with the independent allele w 1 ( n = 6 for both 70 % and 95 % ethanol ) , indicating a strong association of the observed phenotype with the w mutation .
The w gene encodes an ABC transporter for guanine and tryptophan that are crucial not only for eye pigmentation but also for dopamine ( guanine ) or serotonin ( guanine and tryptophan ) biosynthesis [ 23 ] .
w males whose eyes are depigmented have a normal capacity to detect light as judged by their strong preference for a lighted to a dark area ( n = 8 ; data not shown ) ; nonetheless , the w male 's deficient intermale courtship could be due to their potential visual problem .
To explore this possibility , we administered daily ethanol to CS males under infrared light , in which flies can't see .
In all exposures up to the 6 th , CS males did not show any intermale courtship ( n = 6 ) .
Thus , visual input is indispensable for the ethanol - induced intermale courtship and a potential visual anomaly of w males may attribute to their deficient response .
fru 1 and fru 3 males showed vigorous intermale courtship in Flypub without ethanol ( No EtOH ) .
Upon daily ethanol treatments in 95 % Flypub , their courtship activities did not change with additional ethanol treatment while the courtship levels under ethanol were lower than those without ethanol ( ANOVA : fru 1 , F 3,27 = 3.24 , p = 0.0396 , Tukey - Kramer showed a significant difference between No EtOH and 3 rd EtOH ; fru 3 , F 3,27 = 16.94 , p<0.0001 , No EtOH was significantly different from the others by Tukey - Kramer ; n = 7 ) .
NS , not significant .
CS males tested together with fru males as a control showed negligible intermale courtship in the absence of ethanol and on the 1 st ethanol exposure ( marked by diamonds ) ; however , their courtship activities were enhanced under the influence of ethanol on the 2 nd and 3 rd ethanol treatments ( F 3,27 = 42.86 , p<0.0001 ; double asterisks , significant difference by Tukey - Kramer ) .
Genetic alterations in somatic sex development are known to cause intermale courtship in Drosophila [ 21 ] .
The studies described here , in contrast , reveal recurring ethanol exposure as a post - developmental factor affecting male sexual behavior .
We asked whether ethanol affects the brain activity in the manner that the altered brain development causes intermale courtship .
If this were the case , ethanol would further enhance the intermale courtship activity of fruitless ( fru ) males defective in Fru M , a neural sex determination factor .
To test this , we employed two fru mutant alleles fru 1 and fru 3 , which have abnormal expression of male - specific Fru M in the central nervous system .
fru 1 males have an inversion break point 3.3 Kb upstream of the sexually dimorphic P1 promoter , causing altered Fru M expression : subpopulations of Fru M neurons have either less or undetectable Fru M while numerous non-Fru M neurons display ectopic Fru M expression [ 22 ] .
On the other hand , fru 3 males with a transposon insertion at the second intron in the fru gene have undetectable Fru M expression [ 22 ] .
Both fru 1 and fru 3 males exhibit active intermale courtship [ 22 ] , which we also observed in Flypub without ethanol ( Figure 3 ) .
When subjected to daily ethanol exposure , the courtship levels of fru 1 and fru 3 males were decreased on the first exposure , which remained unchanged on subsequent exposures ( Figure 3 ) .
While the inability for fru males to increase levels of intermale courtship upon recurrent ethanol exposure could be due to the behavioral ceiling effect , the intermale courtship level of fru 3 males is significantly lower than that of CS males on the third exposure ( two tailed Student t- test , p<0.001 ) .
This suggests that normal physiological function of Fru M or the male - specific neural system established by Fru M is crucial for the ethanol - induced intermale courtship .
A salient effect of ethanol is cognitive impairment [ 5 ] , [ 19 ] , which may account for the disinhibited courtship of sexually aroused males under the influence of ethanol .
Thus , we reasoned that the aged males whose cognitive capacity is reduced [ 20 ] might exhibit enhanced ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
When 2 or 4 wk - old males were subjected to daily ethanol exposure , a significantly higher percentage of males showed intermale courtship on the second ethanol exposure compared to 4 day - old males while the difference was less apparent on subsequent exposures ( Figure 2D ) .
This implies that certain aging - sensitive activities may be related to the ethanol - induced adaptive changes underlying courtship disinhibition .
Taken together , recurring ethanol administration induced conspicuous intermale courtship , which represents disinhibited sexual behavior and entails certain adaptive changes prompted by initial ethanol exposure .
The significant increases in this activity in the absence of concurrent increases in tolerance imply distinct mechanisms underlying behavioral sensitization to the disinhibition effect and tolerance to the sedative effect of ethanol .
We assessed whether the ethanol - induced intermale courtship is due to changes in aversive male pheromones , which may become attractive upon repeated ethanol exposure .
If this were the case , ethanol - treated males would not court ethanol - naïve males while ethanol - naïve males would actively court ethanol - treated males .
To test this , the males treated with daily ethanol for 5 days ( chronic - ethanol - treated males ) were subjected to ethanol exposure in the presence of the decapitated previously - ethanol - naïve males .
In another set of experiments , the ethanol - naïve males were housed with the decapitated chronic - ethanol - treated males and tested for their courtship under the influence of ethanol .
The chronic - ethanol - treated males displayed active courtship toward the previously - ethanol - naïve males ; however , the courtship activity of the naïve males toward the ethanol - treated males was negligible ( Figure 2C ) .
Thus , the ethanol - induced intermale courtship is unlikely caused by altered male pheromones .
Notably , the ethanol - induced courtship was dynamic ( Movie S1 ) : courtship duration of each pair or chain ( courters courted by courtees ) ranged from a couple of seconds to minutes and new courtship pairs or chains were continuously formed .
These dynamic courtship activities typically lasted for 5 to 10 min before the flies began loosing motor control and became sedated .
Moreover , courtship chains with the length ranging from 3 to 5 were frequently noticeable on the third and subsequent ethanol challenges while courtship pairs were dominant on the second exposure .
To quantify the ethanol - induced courtship activity , we scored the percentage of males engaged in active courtship during a 30 sec period and used an average of 10 consecutive periods ( total 5 min ) to represent a percentage of courtship for each group .
The percentage of CS males engaged in intermale courtship increased with recurring experience of ethanol , reaching a plateau on the 4 th exposure with 95 % ethanol ( Figure 2A ) , whereas the males subjected to daily mock treatment did not display any intermale courtship ( n = 6 ) .
Likewise , no intermale courtship activity was detected when the chronic - ethanol - treated males ( daily ethanol for 5 or 6 days ) were examined in Flypub in the absence of ethanol ( n = 6 each ) .
Therefore , the observed intermale courtship requires physiological actions of ethanol .
Similar increases in the courtship activity were observed with 70 % ethanol , but with lesser extents on the second and third exposures ( Figure 2B ) .
These observations together indicate that Drosophila males develop behavioral sensitization to the ethanol 's effect on courtship disinhibition .
(A) The percentage of males engaged in intermale courtship progressively increased upon additional ethanol treatments in 95 % Flypub .
Least squares regression showed the significant effect of exposure ( r 2 = 0.68 , p<0.0001 , n = 10 ) .
( B ) CS males subjected to daily ethanol exposure in 70 % Flypub exhibited the exposure - dependent increase in intermale courtship but at the significantly reduced levels compared to those challenged with 95 % ethanol .
Two - way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of ethanol concentration , exposure , and interaction ( concentration effect , F 1,24 = 54.02 , p<0.0001 ; exposure effect , F 3,24 = 138.2 , p<0.0001 ; interaction , F 3,24 = 6.7 , p = 0.0019 ; n = 4 ) .
Post hoc two - tailed Student t- test showed the significant difference of the courtship scores on the 2 nd ( p< 0.005 ) or 3 rd exposure ( p<0.0005 ) ( marked by double asterisks ) .
( C ) The chronic - ethanol - treated males displayed active courtship toward the decapitated previously - ethanol - naïve males under the influence of ethanol ( chronic to naïve ) , whereas the ethanol - naïve males , on the 1 st ethanol exposure , displayed negligible courtship toward the decapitated chronic - ethanol - exposed males ( naïve to chronic ) .
Two - tailed Student t- test showed a significant difference ( p<0.0001 , n = 6 , marked by double asterisks ) .
( D ) Two or 4 wk - old CS males exhibited the increased levels of intermale courtship compared to 4 d-old males when tested in 95 % Flypub .
Two - way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of age and exposure , and a marginal interaction ( age effect , F 2,36 = 16.6 , p<0.0001 ; exposure effect , F 3,36 = 61.7 , p<0.0001 ; interaction , F 6,36 = 2.58 , p = 0.035 ; n = 4 ) .
Tukey - Kramer tests showed that the intermale courtship activities of 2 and 4 wk - old males were significantly different from that of 4 d- old males on the 2 nd exposure ( marked by double asterisks ) .
Upon daily ethanol treatments , CS males showed distinct sexual behavior .
Typically , Drosophila males vigorously court females that have attractive pheromones with the courtship ritual comprising a sequential act of following , tapping the female 's abdomen , wing vibration ( courtship song ) , licking the female 's genitalia , and attempted copulation , which eventually leads to copulation [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
Drosophila males , on the contrary , rarely exhibit active courtship toward other mature males [ 18 ] , which we also observed in the absence of ethanol or on the first exposure to ethanol ( Figure 2A , Movie S1 ) .
Occasionally , a male attempted to court another male but quickly moved away .
Also , a male courtee strongly rejected a courting male ( Movie S1 ) .
Under the influence of ethanol on the second and subsequent ethanol treatment , however , CS males actively courted other males in the ritual similar to that shown toward females , which represents disinhibited courtship .
( A) Sedation profile .
Flies were exposed to ethanol vapor in 70 % Flypub ( diamond ) or 95 % Flypub ( triangle ) .
MST in 70 % Flypub was higher than that in 95 % Flypub on all exposures and recurring treatment in both ethanol concentrations increased MST .
Two - way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of ethanol concentration and exposure , and a marginal interaction of two factors ( concentration effect , F 1,72 = 383.4 , p<0.0001 ; exposure effect , F 5,72 = 40.5 , p<0.0001 ; interaction , F 5,72 = 2.7 , p = 0.03 ; n = 7 ) .
Post hoc
Tukey - Kramer tests revealed the significant difference of the 1 st from the other exposures in both ethanol concentrations .
All data are reported as mean ±standard error of the mean .
( B ) Ethanol concentrations .
CS males were subjected to ethanol treatment for 1 , 2 or 6 days ( 1 st , 2 nd , 6 th ) in 95 % Flypub and ethanol contents were measured at 16 or 30 min after the onset of ethanol exposure .
CS males without ethanol treatment ( No EtOH ) were used to measure the basal level .
There was no significant difference in the ethanol contents of the males on the 1 st , 2 nd and 6 th exposure at 16 min ( ANOVA , F 2,11 = 1.75 , p = 0.23 , n = 4 ) or 30 min ( F 2,11 = 3.98 , p = 0.06 , n = 4 ) .
To investigate adaptive behavior associated with recurring exposure to ethanol , we developed a novel apparatus Flypub .
Flypub is made of a plastic chamber with a clear ceiling for videotaping behavior and an open bottom for administering ethanol .
We exposed fully mature ( 4 to 5 day - old ) wild - type Canton - S ( CS ) males to intoxicating doses of ethanol once a day for 6 days in Flypub .
Prior to ethanol exposure , flies were acclimated to the chamber and then the whole unit was gently placed on a Petri dish containing a cotton pad applied with 70 % or 95 % ethanol .
While slowly exposed to ethanol vapor , flies showed sequential behavioral changes : they became hyperactive ( fast walking ) , lost motor control ( infrequent movements and frequent falls during walking ) , and then were sedated ( lying on their back ) .
On the first exposure to ethanol vapor in 95 % Flypub , all male flies became sedated within 24 min with a mean sedation time ( MST ) of approximately 16 min , whereas it took longer with 70 % ethanol ( MST ∼ 23 min ; Figure 1 ) .
The flies on the second exposure showed a similar activity profile with a delayed sedation time ( ∼24 min MST with 95 % and ∼ 35 min with 70 % ) , indicating tolerance development to the sedative effect of ethanol .
The tolerance level , as measured by MST , did not change significantly with additional ethanol exposure on consecutive days ( Figure 1 ) .
It is difficult to compare MST observed in Flypub with that reported in other studies , which employ diverse devices , conditions and parameters .
Nonetheless , the mean elution time ( MET ) of wild - type flies exposed to humidified ethanol vapor ( 50/45 ethanol / air flow ) in the 4 foot - long inebriometer is ∼ 20 min with 40 % and 25 % increases in MET on the second exposure at 4 h and 24 h intervals , respectively [ 13 ] .
When measured in the perforated 50 mL Falcon tube with 50 % ethanol vapor , on the other hand , MET ( time for immobilizing 50 % of flies ) is ∼ 16 min with 100 % increase in MET on the second exposure at a 4 h interval [ 15 ] .
Thus , MST on the first exposure and tolerance levels on the second exposure measured in 95 % ( 16 min ; 50 % ) and 70 % ( 23 min ; 52 % ) Flypub are within the range observed in other studies .
Notably , the ethanol concentrations measured at 16 or 30 min after administering ethanol were comparable in the males subjected to ethanol treatment for 1 , 2 and 6 days ( Figure 1B ) .
Therefore , tolerance developed upon repeated ethanol exposure is not due to altered ethanol absorption or metabolism , but likely due to adaptive changes in neural activities .
Discussion
In this report , we have shown that Drosophila males , when subjected to repeated exposure to ethanol , display disinhibited courtship toward other mature males , which is enhanced by additional ethanol challenges .
Ethanol affects various aspects of sexual behavior in humans : it is known to impair sexual performance and to enhance sexual arousal or motivation [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
Moreover , disinhibited sexual behavior is highly associated with alcohol consumption ; however , the physiological support for this notion is largely lacking and a suitable animal model to address this issue is instrumental .
In a rodent model , a low dose of ethanol reinstates copulatory behavior of the male rats that have been repeatedly trained to suppress their sexual response to unreceptive females [ 33 ] .
Unfortunately , the study did not distinguish whether the disinhibition effect is on sexual arousal / motivation or sexual performance .
Scott et al. have followed up this issue and failed to observe disinhibited sexual motivation [ 9 ] .
The findings described here provide for the first time unambiguous evidence for disinhibited sexual arousal induced by ethanol and behavioral sensitization to this effect .
Disinhibited homosexual courtship has been previously reported on genetic and transgenic mutants .
In particular , homosexual courtship is obvious in transgenic males expressing female TransformerF ( a key component of somatic sex determination ) or transgenic females expressing FruM ( a downstream target of Transformer ) in distinct neuronal populations , and fru males with aberrant FruM expression [ 34 ] – [ 38 ] .
These studies indicate that sexual orientation and behavior are controlled by the brain circuitry established by FruM during development .
The findings described here , on the other hand , unveil a post - developmental experience of recurring ethanol as a key factor affecting sexual behavior of wild - type males .
In the absence of ethanol , fru1 and fru3 males with altered or undetectable FruM expression , respectively , display characteristic intermale courtship , whose levels were slightly ( fru1 ) or significantly ( fru3 ) reduced under the influence of ethanol .
The male 's courtship toward the female is typically initiated by visual and pheromonal input .
The ethanol - induced intermale courtship , on the other hand , appears to depend largely on visual input and less on pheromones since CS males exposed to ethanol under infrared light show negligible intermale courtship as noted above .
It is conceivable that reduced levels of intermale courtship observed in fru males under ethanol could be attributable to compromised pheromonal input .
Alternatively , certain intermale courtship activities associated with abnormal FruM may be negatively affected by ethanol .
It is yet unclear how aberrant FruM expression causes increased intermale courtship in fru1 and fru3 males and enhanced understanding of this process should help resolve this issue .
Remarkably , repeated ethanol exposure has no effect on enhancing intermale courtship in fru males .
FruM is normally expressed not only during development but also at the adult stage [ 22 ] .
Thus , disinhibited courtship induced by ethanol may recruit a physiological FruM function or a FruM neural circuit established during development or both .
Future studies of additional fru alleles or transheterozygotes with different lesions in the fru gene [ 39 ] along with temporally and spatially controlled transgenic manipulation of FruM expression should be instrumental to unravel the mechanism by which FruM mediates the ethanol - associated courtship disinhibition .
Ectopic or increased
White expression is previously shown to trigger intermale courtship in the transgenic males carrying mw + gene under the control of heat shock promoter [ 25 ] .
Indeed , PHSBJb 3 employed in our study was one of the lines used in the previous study wherein homozygous PHSBJb 3 males in the Df ( 1 ) w67c2 , yellow genetic background exhibit intermale courtship after heat treatment in a densely populated culture bottle .
Under the experimental condition ( a low density population ) and the genetic background ( w1118 ) used in our study , they did not show a significant level of intermale courtship in the absence of ethanol with or without heat shock .
Besides its function in body color pigmentation , Yellow in the brain is crucial for male sex development [ 40 ] .
This implies that a combined action of yellow mutation and ectopic
White in PHSBJb 3 males may attribute to the enhanced intermale courtship observed in the previous study .
Similarly in our study , the males with transgenic
White expression were more susceptible to the ethanol - induced disinhibited courtship compared to CS males .
While
White has been extensively used as an eye color marker , several studies indicate the significant roles of White in the central nervous system .
Notably , w mutants subjected to submaximal training learn poorly in operant heat - box conditioning , in which flies learn to avoid entering a hot temperature - associated chamber , whereas they learn better in classical olfactory conditioning , in which flies lean to avoid the odor associated with electric shock [ 41 ] .
w mutants also show a reduced sensitivity to general anesthetics enflurane and halothane [ 27 ] .
These studies demonstrate the distinct roles of White in various types of behavioral plasticity and anesthesia beyond its function in the eye .
While it remains to be resolved whether and how White in the brain is involved in ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition , it is at least conceivable that a major action of over -/ mis- expressed White is to inhibit the neural system mediating intermale courtship suppression , potentiating the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
Regarding the cellular mechanism underlying the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition , the biochemical functions of the White ligands guanine and tryptophan suggest dopamine and serotonin as key components .
This notion is supported by the observations that certain polymorphisms in hW , the human homologue of w encoding ABCG1 , are linked in males to panic and mood disorders , which are associated with abnormal monoamine functions [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
Consistently , our results reveal an essential role of dopamine neuronal activities ( and presumably released dopamine ) in courtship disinhibition induced by ethanol .
Dopamine plays crucial roles in mediating the locomotor - activating , rewarding , and behavioral sensitization effects of ethanol in mammals [ 2 ] , [ 44 ] .
Indeed , ethanol intake increases dopamine levels in several brain areas and adaptive changes in the dopamine transporter and receptors are associated with alcoholism in humans and rodent models [ 2 ] , [ 45 ] – [ 47 ] .
Thus , dopamine is a key neuromodulator mediating the pleiotropic effects of ethanol , which is processed by various dopamine receptors in distinct neural systems in mammals , and similar mechanisms may underlie the ethanol - induced behaviors in flies .
Dopamine is also implicated in sexual motivation or arousal in humans , rodents , and flies [ 12 ] , [ 48 ] – [ 50 ] .
Particularly in flies , transgenic males overexpressing vesicular monoamine transporter in DDC - GAL4 neurons or wild - type males fed with methamphetamine display enhanced courtship toward females [ 12 ] , [ 50 ] .
While none of the previous studies in flies and mammals have specifically addressed the dopamine 's role in disinhibited sexual behavior , it is conceivable that altered dopamine activities induced by ethanol may be responsible not only for enhancing sexual arousal but also for impairing cognition , causing disinhibited courtship .
Indeed , dopamine is involved in numerous cognitive processes including attention , goal - directed behavior , and learning and memory [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
Five receptor subtypes ( D1 - 5 ) mediate diverse dopamine functions in mammals .
Similarly , Drosophila has D1 , D2 and D5 receptors and we have recently identified the distinct functions of the D1 receptor dDA1 for punishment and reward memory formations in olfactory conditioning [ 53 ] .
Future studies uncovering dopamine receptor subtypes involved in an arousal or cognitive aspect of disinhibited courtship should provide substantial insights on the underlying cellular mechanism .
The deficient ethanol - induced courtship in the males with defective FruM or dopamine neuronal activities suggests that FruM and dopamine systems may be functionally connected to each other for regulating male sexual behavior .
One pathway could be for dopamine to modulate the FruM neural circuit .
Interestingly , both FruM and dDA1 are highly enriched in the mushroom body neurons projecting to the gamma lobe [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 54 ] .
It is possible that dopamine , upon binding to dDA1 , may play a role in modifying the gamma lobe function established by FruM for courtship disinhibition .
Alternatively , FruM may regulate dopamine neuronal activities .
This could occur through direct or indirect interactions of FruM and dopamine neurons since both neuronal populations project to many overlapping brain areas [ 37 ] , [ 55 ] .
It is noteworthy that a dopamine neuron in each hemisphere , which projects to the anterior commissure and anterior brain areas , is positive for FruM expression ( our unpublished observation ) .
Future studies clarifying the functional interaction of FruM and dopamine activities are of great importance to delineate the cellular mechanism underlying the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
The observations described here also reveal the dual effects of ethanol on the heterosexual courtship activity , which is reduced under initial ethanol exposure but enhanced upon chronic treatment .
The effect of acute ethanol on sexual arousal or motivation has previously been addressed by two studies in rats .
When tested for the operant lever - pressing response to get access to receptive females , the ethanol - injected male rats show increased latencies , implying attenuated sexual motivation [ 9 ] .
On the other hand , the ethanol - injected male rats show increased frequencies to change platforms prior to encountering receptive females , suggesting enhanced sexual motivation [ 7 ] .
While our study supports the former , ethanol 's effect on sexual arousal / motivation may depend on multiple factors including measurement methods and routes of ethanol administration .
Nonetheless , a consistent effect of ethanol on heterosexual behavior observed in our studies of flies and the previous findings in rats [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] and humans [ 5 ] is the inhibitory effect on sexual performance .
It is tempting to speculate that ethanol may act on similar cellular targets in different species .
Comparing the ethanol 's effects on heterosexual courtship and copulation , chronic ethanol has opposite effects on sexual arousal and performance of male flies , indicating that their underlying processes may be distinct .
It is possible that adaptive changes induced by chronic ethanol exposure are necessary to enhance sexual arousal and may overlap with those underlying behavioral sensitization on disinhibited courtship .
In summary , recurring ethanol administration has diverse effects on sexual behavior of Drosophila males including disinhibited intermale courtship , enhanced sexual arousal toward females and decreased sexual performance .
We have identified three cellular components FruM , White and dopamine that are crucial for the ethanol - induced courtship disinhibition .
These findings support the notion that alcohol - associated sexual behavior is physiological and provides a baseline to further clarify the underlying cellular mechanisms .
The news of Con Kolivas , a Linux kernel developer , quitting that role , along with an interview in which he explains why , could and should make loud noises around the Free Software community which is often touting GNU / Linux as the best operating system one could use , and not just because of freedom you have with it .
In the interview he says certain things which should cause tectonic shifts in the mindset that we have all been having .
Why did n’t we realize these things before ?
As you can see , the article intrigued me quite a bit , and got me thinking about a better way forward for the Free Software OS .
I ’ll go through some of the basic points that he makes and lay out one possible solution and its implications .
However , take this article as just a discussion starter .
Linux kernel is too bloated
It was made for servers because that ’s where its initial success was possible and where most of the money came .
Linux kernel developers are on the payroll of companies who , in the first place , care for their server related businesses .
This makes it much less likely for the kernel development to focus on needs related to the desktop , a most demanding of the market segments .
Developers are also developing on machines which are too powerful compared to the machines that ordinary desktop users are using , making performance issues that desktop users may experience , practically invisible to these developers .
Lack of communication with desktop users
Linux kernel developers are normatively disconnected from the rest of the users , most of which are desktop users , the kind making up 90 % of all computer users .
Since they are not mostly governed by the companies whose interests are on the desktop it is logical that they will a lot of the time be oblivious to the needs of the ordinary desktop users .
This is not because a desktop user does not have the freedom to participate .
In a Free Software world we have the freedom , but we also have social and cultural norms which are often enough of an obstacle to healthy communication and cooperation .
Some of those norms are beneficial , and some are quite hurtful .
Can a kernel developed by people not so attuned to the needs of desktop users lead an OS to success on the desktop ?
Lack of innovation
It is largely unfashionable to accuse the GNU / Linux world of not being innovative enough , but accusing it of lack of innovation is not saying that it is n’t more innovative than the rest .
I believe Linus Torvalds once said that all operating systems suck , but “ Linux just sucks less ” .
I think this statement is very true , but useless if not taken as a call to improvement .
Why does it have to suck at all ?
The point that CK makes is related to performance issues on hardware which is so powerful that it should n’t have performance issues at all .
Why do we still need a specially optimized Linux kernel just to properly enable music production ?
Should n’t real time audio processing just work absolutely flawlessly on computers containing dual core CPUs ?
Even Windows XP does n’t have this requirement .
The question has to be asked .
Why does * anything * have to run slow on todays computers ?
Free Software movement is about freedom which includes freedom to innovate , but having this freedom wont make things just happen automatically .
It is merely a beginning .
We have to use this freedom to really do things better , to revolutionize the world of computing .
But , so far , GNU / Linux is becoming just another bloated OS which is incapable of making the most out of the most powerful hardware we have ever had ( yes , that ’s probably your computer too ) .
It is leaving the revolution to the social and ideological side of the issue , while remaining stuck to the old ways that everyone else is stuck with on a technical side of things , yet it can do better .
Solutions ?
One of the solutions being pondered is forking a Linux kernel into a kernel which would specifically be aimed at desktop users and their needs .
It could be ran in a way which would allow for a seamless two way communication between desktop users and kernel developers , because they would share much of the same interests in this project .
This means that an ordinary user would be able to leave a bug report or a suggestion without being flamed as a newbie who does n’t know anything , but rather awarded with contribution points .
Now imagine the implications of having a desktop kernel .
Popular distributions such as Ubuntu would likely switch to this new kernel , without diminishing their popularity .
The new kernel would allow a lot of the lost performance to be gained , allowing us to reclaim the title of the fastest OS around .
However , applications would have to follow this trend in order for performance gains to be felt more dramatically .
It is possible that a project of forking a kernel for a desktop with focus on performance would also initiate a similar movement with the rest of the Free Software world .
We can call it a hint that would affect the way developers think about their software , encouraging them to pay more attention to performance issues on the desktop .
This would also likely blur the lines between what is or is n’t considered to be “ Linux ” or “ GNU / Linux ” , especially if a new kernel does n’t carry a name involving “ Linux ” , possibly even throwing the whole definition of an “ OS ” in a limbo , perhaps making it irrelevant .
Above all else , it would just be a Free Software OS where distributions use whichever kernel suits their users the most .
The reason why this would happen is the discussion that , for example , Ubuntu switching to a new kernel , would entice regarding what we should now call the new OS ; as “ Linux ” , by the name of the new kernel , just “ Ubuntu ” or perhaps “ GNU ” .
The reason I believe this would blur the lines is simply because I doubt a proper consensus on this would ever be made .
It will likely just end up being called Ubuntu , which is merely a distribution , leaving the OS simply unnamed – a Free Software OS .
Therefore the benefits are twofold .
There is a technical benefit of regained performance and moving away from the bloat of the rest of the computing world , truly innovating on the desktop and not just making a one - shoe - fits - all operating system .
And there is a benefit of blurring the lines between operating systems based on what kernel they run , which would encourage further diversity and open mindedness towards different platforms .
The only way we would most often identify an OS is by the name of the given distribution ( Ubuntu , Gentoo , Nexenta , Haiku etc . )
Free Software is about restoring the freedom of computer users .
But now that we have it , why not take things to the next level ?
Let ’s make a desktop operating system which will be truly irresistible , then conquer the desktop and make computers really fun again .
Thanks
Edit :
There have been some comments by people who seemed to have understood this article as saying that GNU / Linux sucks and is not ready for the desktop then going on to point out the obvious advantages that GNU / Linux has compared to other platforms , including the advantage of performance .
However , if you reread the article you would see that I in no way argued that GNU / Linux is not better and that it is not ready for the desktop .
Saying that it sucks less than anything else does mean that it is the best thing around .
My point was simply that things can be even better .
We can be even better than merely better than anyone else .
We can leave them trailing us hopelessly and obviously .
Why else would I call this a “ revolution ” in computing ?
Because it is not just about beating other platforms , it is about beating ourselves .
Why does merely “ being better ” have to be enough ?
That said , yes , I do believe GNU / Linux already is ready for the desktop .
It ’s more ready than anything else .
It deserves 90 % of the market share right now if you ask me .
However , it is hard to win that market share without going even further than people would usually expect us to go .
Good enough is not enough .
Being the best is not enough .
I was reading Perl Cannot Be Parsed : A Formal Proof on PerlMonks over breakfast this morning ( this may in itself cause you to worry about me ) , which introduced me to a clever , ambiguous snippet of Perl constructed by Randall Schwartz :
whatever / 25 ; # / ; die " this dies ! " ;
How this is parsed depends on what whatever is : if it ’s a function that takes an argument , the slashes delimit a regular expression , and the following statement kills the program .
If , on the other hand , whatever is a function without any arguments , its return value is divided by 25 , and the rest of the line is a comment .
Since it ’s possible to define whatever dynamically , the snippet ca n’t be parsed without running the program up to that point .
Ergo ,
Perl can not be parsed statically .
But can we do the same in Ruby ?
Initially , it seems possible .
The disambiguation of slashes has an additional nicety in Matz ’s Ruby interpreter : if there ’s a space after the opening slash , it will always be interpreted as a division operator .
This works , though :
whatever / 25 #/ ; raise ' this dies !'
The meaning of the line depends on whether whatever is a method or a variable :
whatever = 100 whatever / 25 # / ; raise ' this dies ! ' # completes
def whatever ( re ) end whatever / 25 # / ; raise ' this dies ! ' # dies
So it looks like we can perform the Perl trick and use code to define what whatever is , thereby creating Ruby code that ca n’t be parsed .
But , in fact , it does n’t work , because Ruby ’s cleverer than that .
And by clever , I mean evil .
Ruby looks at everything in the current context — even unreachable code — to determine what the symbol whatever refers to .
So this works as you ’d expect :
if false def whatever ( ) 200 end else whatever = 100 end whatever # => 100
But reverse the logic , and something strange happens :
if true def whatever ( ) 200 end else whatever = 100 end whatever # => nil
Even though the method is defined , and the variable is n’t , the parser has ‘ seen ’ the variable , and the meaning of the symbol is changed into a variable .
The message : whatever is never sent , because it refers to a variable .
But that variable is n’t defined !
Instead of an error , though , we get nil .
If you ’re thinking of getting round it by setting up the definitions in eval , I ’ve bad news : that does n’t work for variables :
eval " def whatever ( ) 200 end " whatever # => 200
eval " whatever = 100 " whatever # => NameError : undefined local variable or method `whatever ' for main :
Object
So there you go .
Ruby ’s syntax may have some apparent ambiguities , but they can be resolved statically .
At least , unless there are any others I do n’t know about …
Incidentally , it ’s testament to the hard work that the JRuby developers have put in that it has exactly the same behaviour .

さてすっかりブログの書き方を忘れた俺ですが、リハビリもかねてこのあたりの話題から行きましょう。プリンスが今度発売するニューアルバム『Planet Earth』（日本だと今日発売ですね）を英国の人気新聞「 Daily Mail」の日曜版 「 Mail on Sunday 」 紙の7月15売り号の付録として配布したという話。
↓これが前日に英国で放送されたCM映像。
「 おーかっこいいなーこの曲！」と思った人はVerizon
Wirelessがオフィシャルに提供しているYouTubeのPV映像をどうぞ。といっても、フルレングスではなく１分強の映像になってる↓
「 んーフルでこの楽曲だけじゃなくて、アルバム全曲聴いてみたい！」と思った人は下記サイトにアクセスしましょう。
● First Spin : Prince （MuchMusic.com ）
こっちはアルバム全曲が聴けます。こっちはほとんどの曲がフル試聴できてフルじゃなかったりするものも１曲２分くらいは聴けるのでアルバムの内容は十分判断できますね。いやーネットの試聴は全部こういう形式にすりゃいいんだよな。レコード会社の公式サイトに置かれているWMAファイルへのリンクしか試聴を認めないとかそんなのを2007年にやってること自体が時代錯誤も甚だしいという。
全曲試聴して 「 こりゃ素晴らしい ！ もう買うしか！」となった人はAmazon様でご購入可能です。
この争いをもっとも強く感じ取れる分野の一つは、いうまでもなくオンラインの世界――いまだ幼年期にありながらもここ10年での爆発的成長はすべての人に衝撃を与えた、無秩序に広がりつつある無政府的コミュニティ――だろう。そして、大きな物議を醸している「ピアツーピア」ファイル共有問題とそこから派生するデジタル諸問題以上に、政府、大企業、個人の権利、この3つの間の争いを典型的に示すものはないだろう。
US盤は2500円もする日本盤と比べてお得感が高いですね……という感じで何という自然な流れのバイラルマーケティング！
SMEさんギャラは10万はてなポイントもしくは1万はてなスターでお願いしますね！
いやーこれで俺もアジャ何とかネットにもアルファブロガーとして参加できるな（よく知らないんだけど、アムウェイみたいなもの？
違うよ、全然違うよ）。とまぁ寒い冗談はさておき、日本盤は今日発売なんだけど、Amazonだとすぐ買えないしジャケット画像すらない有様。この騒動で日本のSMEJが売る気なくしちゃったのかねぇ。あ、僕はさっくりUS盤買いました。相変わらず長い前置きの音ハメのエントリですが（いや、書いててまさにこれが音ハメだと思った！）ここからが本題。なぜプリンスはこんなことをしでかしたのか。と、その前に多分あれだけ参考リンク最初に貼ってもきちんとリンク先に飛んで読む人はほとんどいないだろうから、一応あらかたの事実関係を解説しておこう。ポイントを箇条書きにすると●「 Mail on Sunday 」の価格は1.4ポンド（約350円）。7/15号はこの価格で『Planet Earth』が付いた。●プリンスはこのアルバムの発売に合わせて英国ロンドンの「O2 Arena（以 前Millenium Domeと呼ばれていた場所ね）」で8月と9月にライブ公演を行う。この公演チケット購入者にも『Planet Earth』は無料配布された。●当のプリンスはこの行動に対して「これは直接的なマーケティングであり、これを行うことでたくさんの騒動を抱えている現在のレコード会社の投機的なビジネスに付き合う必要がなくなる」とコメント。彼の代理人も「プリンスは彼の音楽を聴きたいを望んでいる多くのファンに直接それを届けたいだけだ」という声明を発表している。●「Mail on Sunday 」 の現在の発行部数は227万部。この号に関しては英国の大手CDチェーンHMVも特別に販売することを決定。発売後全国で300万部（300万枚）が流通したと見られている。●英国では日本と同じで新聞がネットに食われてて部数がここ数年低迷してきている。こうした状況の打開策として以前のヒット曲を集めたCDや旧作の映画のDVDを新聞の付録として付けて販売する手法が盛んになっているそうだ。●今回のプリンスの付録は『Planet Earth』に加えて、 「 パープル・レイン 」 「 Kiss 」 「 サイン・オブ・ザ・タイムズ 」
「 ラズベリー・ベレット」といったプリンスの過去のヒット曲も含まれる、ベスト盤的要素もあるそうだ。●英ガーディアン紙の報道によれば、Mail on Sundayは今回のCD配布にあたり、プリンス側にCD制作費、プレス、広告ライセンス料を払ったとされており、その総額は25万ポンド（約6200万円）とのことだ。ただ、CD制作費が「原盤制作費」なのかは不明。●プリンスの行動に対してCD発売元のSony BMGと英国の小売店は大反発。イギリスのSony BMG は 『Planet Earth』の発売中止を決定。英国の小売業者協会であるERA（The Entertainment Retailers Association）のポール・クワーク会長は「これまでプリンスのキャリアを支えてきたすべてのレコードショップに対する侮辱」とコメントし、以前プリンスが名乗っていたアーティスト名「
The Artist formerly known as Pince（かつてプリンスとして知られたアーティスト）」になぞらえて「 こんなことをしていたらプリンスは『Artist formerly available in record store（かつてレコード店で売られていたアーティスト）』になってしまうだろう」と皮肉を込めたコメントを発表している。まぁこんな感じ。今までのレコード（CD）販売ビジネスの手法からしたら常識破りとも言える今回のプリンスの行動であるが、プリンスがインターネット黎明期から、ネットに対してどのようにコミットしてきたかを知っている人なら、あんま驚くことではない。「MP3」のフォーマットが普及してきた97年〜98年くらいにトッド・ラングレンやピーター・ガブリエルが「これからはレコード会社を通さず、アーティストが直販する」という感じでMP3の販売を実験的に行っていたが、プリンスもその可能性を模索していた一人である。また、1999年にNapsterが登場してレコード会社やメタリカなど、多くのアーティストがNapsterを非難していたとき、早くからNapsterを好意的に評価していたのも他ならぬプリンスだ。そして明確にレコード会社の在り方に「No!」を突きつけたのは2002年のこと。当時運営していたプリンスの公式サイト「NPG MUSIC CLUB 」に「 A Nation of Thieves ?
」という論文を掲載したのだ（現在は消去されている）。この論文、実に刺激的な内容で読んだときに「すげー！」と思った俺はNPG
MUSIC CLUB に 「 プリンス閣下 のA Nation of Thieves ?という論文が素晴らしいので、俺のサイトに翻訳したものを転載していい？」というメールを送った。そしたらすぐに「好きにやっていいよ」という返事が来たので、翻訳したものを
音ハメ上に転載した んだけど、実はこれ、翻訳業者に３万円くらい払って作ったものなんだよね。翻訳した人があんま音楽業界に詳しくなかったっぽいことと、プリンス独特の言い回しが訳すの難しかったらしく、「翻訳の質が悪いよ！」と、いろいろなところから文句を言われるハメに……（このときyomoyomoと知り合いだったらまた違ったかもねぇ）。どうしようか困ってたら airheadさん という方が、もっと正確な訳で 訳し直してくれて ありがたい、あー自分のサイトの翻訳も差し替えようと思いつつ、忙しさにかまけて放っておいて数年……という。しかし、まさに今このタイミングこそ、2002年のプリンスの論文がウェブ上できちんと読めることに意味があると思うので、それは
別エントリとして起こす ので、ぜひこの論文は論文で読んでいただきたいと思う。長い論文なので、キーポイントとなる部分を抜粋すると
P2Pが音楽製作に実質的な不利益をもたらすということについてレコード業界は、数多くの反論もむなしくアーティストの努力という意味でも商業活動という意味でさえも証明できていない、ということは確実にいえる。たとえば、音楽CDの売上げはNapsterが最高潮にあったころ実際に増加し、Napsterが突然閉鎖された後に減少した、ということは記憶に留めておくといいだろう。
大いに尊敬を集めている多くのアーティストが企業の拝金主義に反対するインターネットユーザー側の立場を取り、新たな道を切り開く目的で実際にインターネットを活用している、ということだ。それによって彼らは捕らわれの身でない合法的なオーディエンス、つまり真の音楽愛好家に向かって彼らの音楽を配布し、手を差し伸べるようとしている。もちろんこれは、ファイル共有のあらゆる形態が等しく無害だ、ということを意味しない。人々がインターネットをラジオの代用品、すなわち未知の音楽を発見する手段として使うのなら、アーティストの作品をプロモートすることに役立つ可能性があるのは間違いないだろう。
曲をインターネットからダウンロードし、その複製CD-Rを作成して、校庭で5ドルで売りさばく幼い中学生がいるというなら、それはオリジナルCDの売上に損害を与えるし、アーティストに対して失礼というものだ――レコード業界にいるすべての重役や中間業者が取り分を取ったあとでアーティストが実際に受け取るCD実売価格の一部がいかに小さいか、そういったことを抜きにすればの話だが。
業界は一貫して、多くのアーティストから彼らのもっとも基本的な権利を奪うことができるように奮闘してきた。業界は、ポピュラー・アーティストがアルバムを何百万も売ろうとも破産するような状況を許していた。業界はアルバム売上げからのアーティストの取り分を、売上げによる実際の利益のばかばかしく小さい割合に抑えてきた。業界は一貫して、真の音楽芸術性を犠牲にして商業的音楽製品を推し進めてきた。
デジタルテクノロジーおよびP2Pファイル共有の台頭は、人々が持っている芸術やアーティストへの本質的な敬意とはほとんど関係がない。それは実に、本物の芸術やアーティストへの敬意を犠牲にしてより商業的で高利益の製品を一貫して推し進めてきた、巨大産業コングロマリットのシニカルな態度に関係するものなのだ。
実際の芸術作品は、このとてつもなく利益最優先の業界の亀裂から今もなんとか染み出てきてはいるが、そのことは、これまで業界を突き動かしてきて今なお突き動かし、これまで以上のものとなっている基本的公式に何ら影響を及ぼさない。すなわち、芸術＝金、アーティスト＝金儲けの種、芸術愛好家＝消費者という公式だ。
芸術形態の一つとして業界に評価されている音楽がいかに少ないか、その簡単な例を挙げよう。過去録音されて現在入手できる音楽は20％ほどでしかないと見積もられている――そしてその20％のうち、音楽愛好家が実際に容易に入手できる割合はどれほどになるだろう？
こんな感じ。もう何だろう、いちいちもっともで、この論文見るとスティーブ・ジョブズのThoughts on Musicが子供だましに見えてくるよね。スティーブ・ジョブズがiTunes
Music Storeを始める1年前、Thoughts on Musicが書かれる5年前にこれだけのことを的確に指摘して、その後の過程見ると、ほとんど彼が予想した音楽業界を巡る本質的な部分というのは変わってないわけだから。
個人的に論文の中で一番大きなポイントだと思ったのは以下の部分。
芸術愛好家の本能的な反応とは（それが音楽、TV番組、映画あるいは他の形態であれ）、業界が彼/彼女を芸術の価値がわかる人として敬意を払わなければ、彼/彼女が業界を芸術の調達人として敬意を払う理由なんてない、そういったものであるとしか見えない。文化的製品とやらをデジタルコピーすることで多くの人々が露呈しているのは彼らの、芸術やアーティストに対する敬意の欠如ではない。芸術制作者と芸術愛好家の両方を犠牲にして芸術から利益を得るエンターテイメント業界のやり方に対して彼らが持っている――意識的な、あるいは無意識の――不満なのだ。エンターテイメント業界は、製品をくだらない低レベルのものにすること、アーティストを搾取すること、利益最優先の選択や決定をすること、現実社会の一般的な人々とかけ離れた不愉快な補償金と法的な免責を彼らの同類に与えること、そういったことを行って徐々に自身をシニカルに変えてきた。業界の商業製品の消費者は、それと同じようにシニカルになっているだけなのだ。
ここの部分はCCCDに対するヘビーリスナーの忌避感や、コピーワンスを巡る心底下らないゴタゴタに対する明解な回答になっていると俺は思う。
消費者やエンドユーザーが業界のやり口や語り口に対して怒っており、さらにはクリエイターを盾にとって「自分たちをリスペクトしろ」とか言うから、こっちも腹立って「じゃーいいよ別にテレビなんか見ねーし、音楽も聴かねーよ！」みたいになると。お客さん失った業界が最終的にどうなるのかって話ですよ。別に権利者スーツの人たちが職失ったところで俺らには関係ない話だけど、でもそういう人たちのビジョンのなさによって自分たちが好きなアーティストなりクリエイターが巻き添えを食らうのはホント耐えられないっつー部分もあるよね。だからこそ、今までは一方的に資本持ってる従来のコンテンツ企業しかパトロンになりえなかったわけだけど、それをどうやったら消費者がまとめてパトロンになれるようなシステムを構築できるかってのが今後の大きなテーマになるんだとは思う。今求められているのは「CGM」ですよ。「 Consumer Generated Media」ではなく 「 Consumer Generated Money」という意味のCGM 。
ただ、もちろん今回プリンスがやったことというのは、単なるレコード会社に対する無謀なテロなんかではないってことは押さえておいた方がいい。
プリンスのCD無料配布における狙いは何か？ シンプルに言えばそれは「レコードで収入を上げるのではなく、ライブエンターテイメントの収益を最大化する」ということだ。
8月と9月にO2 Arenaで行われるプリンスの公演は実は全21回にも及ぶ大規模なものだ。そして、報道によればCD配布が行われた7月中旬の段階で21回の公演のうち、15回分は発売から1時間以内にチケットが「完売」しているそうだ。これは間違いなくＣＤ配布による効果であり、大規模ライブ公演のための「プロモーション」が成功したことを意味している。
O2 Arenaの収容人数は約2万人。21回すべての公演が完売すると、それだけで総売上は2600万ドル（約30億円）を超える。もちろん、もちろん、ライブの運営費用やら何やらがあるからそれがすべてプリンスの手元に残るわけではないが、21回同じ場所で公演を行えばその分音響や照明といった機材の使い回しがしやすいというメリットもあって、コストを効率化できる部分も多い。
notraxの記事によれば、プリンスの前作『3121』はイギリス限定で約8万枚しか売れなかったそうだ。
今回の原盤制作をどういう形で行ったのか今イチ見えてない部分がある（Sony BMGが制作費出したのか、それともプリンス本人が出したのか、Mail on Sundayが全部出したのか、とかね）ので、何とも言えない部分もあるんだけど、従来の米国流で制作するならこちらのブログで書かれているように、米国では大体アーティスト印税として10〜12％を受け取り、そこから制作費やら、A&Rやら自分で雇った金額などの「コスト」を支払うことになっている。
話を分かりやすくするためにあえてシンプルに計算するけど、イギリスでの今のCDの売価は安いもので7ポンド（約1700円）、高いもので10ポンド（約2500円）前後。2500円のCDの印税10％（250円）×8万枚は2000万円の印税にしかならない。いくらレコーディングコストが安くなったからといって、これでは大した儲けとは言えないわけだ。
この流れで同じような条件でCDを英国からリリースしてせいぜい10万枚程度しか売れないくらいなら、最初からアルバムを無料配布してしまって、ライブの収益を最大化させた方が（30億円も売上が出れば、少なくとも数億円は手元に残るだろう）ビジネスとして理にかなっているし、プリンスが大嫌いなメジャーレコード会社を「不当に」儲けさせることもしなくて済む。さらにはライブという形で自分の音楽を愛してくれるファンと直接コミュニケーションを行えるわけで、まさにこれは一石三鳥とでも言うべき結果をもたらした。実に痛快でクレバーな判断であり、これを狙い通り成功させてしまうあたりが、プリンスの凄さなのだろう。
俺は未だにCDたくさん買ってるし、レコード会社を中心とする従来型の音楽産業にそれなりの意味と、ある種の郷愁を持っているが、レコード会社と小売店だけが「音楽不況」という妄言を声高に叫んでいる今の状況に対しては「もうそういう時代じゃないでしょ」ということをしっかり認識してもらいたいと思っている。
ライブビジネス はCDの売上がピークだった98年移行も確実に伸びているし、消費者の音楽に求めるプライオリティーも変化しているわけだ。「音楽はライブが命」なんて陳腐なことを言おうとはまったく思わないが、MySpaceでの成功事例なども含め、ライブという付加価値をうまく使った新しい音楽ビジネスの萌芽が出てきているわけである。状況は混沌としているが、間違いなく言えることは「音楽ビジネス＝ＣＤビジネス」という時代が終わったということだ。プリンスの今回の「行動」と「成功」は、１つの時代の終わりを告げる象徴的な出来事であり、今後音楽業界がどこに向かうのか示す１つのメルクマールとして多くの人に記憶されるのではないだろうか。

Prude : How the Sex - Obsessed Culture Damages Girls ( and America , Too ! )
Carol Platt Liebau
Center Street ( 2007 )
Carol Platt Liebau is proud to be a prude .
In fact , " Proudly , A Prude , " is the concluding chapter in her teen - sex - shockfest Prude : How the Sex - Obsessed Culture Damages Girls ( and America , Too ! ) .
What sets Liebau , an attorney , political analyst and commentator , and self - professed " voice from the right , " apart from the spate of other recent books decrying the ills of teen sexual exploration , is her unabashed conservatism and real desire to roll back the clock -- sometimes as far as previous centuries .
Nostalgia is omnipresent in Prude , which reluctantly reckons that the sexual revolution did , in some ways , overhaul bedroom mores in her country : " With so many sexual taboos having been effectively dismantled , perhaps it's no surprise that sexual experimentation does n't carry the stigma it used to , especially for young girls .
Previously unacceptable sexual behavior , like same - sex relationships , is increasingly common , and at younger ages . "
[ Emphasis mine . ]
This is a typical Liebau sentiment , one that does nothing to distance itself from its clearly homophobic message .
For Liebau is not simply bemoaning the fact that it 's easier , and more socially acceptable , for young girls to be sexually active , but also that adult women dare to act this way as well .
Sluts and virgins
Liebau is just the latest in a series of writers essentially pitting the good girls against the bad girls -- the good girls being the ones we need to protect , the slutty , bad girls being the ones who are ruining things for the good girls .
Her examples are unoriginal and largely unconvincing .
While Wendy Shalit cited Bratz dolls and Abercrombie and Fitch in her more nuanced Girls Gone Mild , Liebau 's original research leaves much to be desired .
( She concludes that R.A. Nelson 's young adult novel Teach Me " encourages young girls to fantasize about their teachers as sexual objects , thereby ripening them for exploitation by real - life classroom Lotharios . "
In fact , the student , Nine , almost winds up getting herself and her best friend killed due to her obsessed stalking .
It would be quite difficult to read the book and want to emulate her . )
Both books come after a wave of tomes telling us how far we have n't come , baby , from Ariel Levy 's feminist take in Female Chauvinist Pigs to Laura Sessions Stepp 's supposedly objective journalistic take in Unhooked , and from Jillian Strauss 's you - waited - too - long scold The Unhooked Generation to Hayley DiMarco , who has made a cottage industry of selling girls insecurity around sex ( tag line on the back cover of Sexy Girls : How Hot Is Too Hot ? : " If it ai n't on the menu , keep it covered up ! " ) .
To be fair , the issue of girls being marketed sex-related products at increasingly young ages should be of concern to everyone -- feminists and conservatives alike .
Naomi Wolf zeroed in on a Liebau target , Gossip Girl , in the pages of the New York Times .
The shifting sexual landscape , threats of STDs , and reports of younger and younger children becoming sexually active are important issues , but as even Liebau herself points out , simply harping on the twin horrors of pregnancy and STDs is not the best approach .
Scolding the grown - ups , too
But Liebau 's arguments throughout the book show that she does n't want to shield only girls from sex , but adults , too .
Liebau is horrified that burlesque performer Dita Von Teese was featured in the Los Angeles Times 's calendar section as " fashion 's ' it ' girl " when she 's known for " stripping down to her pasties . "
She is not just talking about girls when she writes , " ... the idea that everyone has his or her own , individual sexual morality -- which no one else is entitled to challenge -- has contributed immeasurably to the sexualization of American culture .
It 's also contributed to the death of the concept of sexual shame , which is nothing more than an inner recognition that one has violated established standards of propriety , good taste , and morals . "
Whose standards ?
Whose morals ?
Liebau's ?
George W. Bush's ?
Mine ?
To pretend that Americans can all agree about anything , let alone sex , is preposterous .
Liebau makes the same tired mistake that so many do , assuming that " sexual freedom " means living in a world where sex does n't matter , to anyone .
In her world , you 're either in a committed , monogamous relationship , or out there screwing anything that moves .
In other words , it would be nice to read a book advocating chastity that does not resort to the " why buy the cow " analogy , whether explicitly or implicitly .
Liebau goes there , even in 2007 : " ... rather than being taught to value those who decline to engage in easy sex , boys are simply learning to avoid them ; it 's easier to seek out the girls who will meet their sexual needs while asking nothing in return . "
First , this is not necessarily a new trend .
Nor is it one I think anyone 's applauding .
I certainly do n't want to see the next generation of teenagers assume that sexual pleasure is for men , while acquiescing to it is for women .
I do n't deny that there may be gender - based differences when it comes to our approaches to sex and what turns us on ; however , the answer to this gap cannot simply be to make girls ashamed of sexual curiosity .
It can not be to urge girls to lord the possibility of sex over boys as a way to " obtain " a relationship .
What ' good old days ' ?
Liebau pits those of us who are sex - positive against those who favor abstinence until marriage , and I 'm still not sure why we should have to pick a side .
I 'm not anti-abstinence or anti-abstinence education .
I 'm against abstinence - only education , which leaves those who are already exploring sex , or are simply curious about it , at a complete loss .
But reading Prude , you 'd think we have armies of sex - positive feminists like me recruiting teenage girls to forget their homework , whip off their clothes , and get busy with their boyfriends .
If anything , I 'd rather give them vibrators so they can learn about pleasuring themselves first .
We have to face the fact that there was n't a universal " good old days . "
( Liebau decries the existence of teen sex information online , claiming that this " intimate advice ... in an earlier day might have been solicited only in the darkest hallways of the roughest schools -- if there . " )
Sex , in and of itself , is not evil .
Teenagers have been kissing , petting , making out and " going all the way " for decades , and while they may now be living in a " sex - obsessed culture , " it 's one we can teach them to navigate by separating fantasy from reality and relegating sex to a role worthy of its stature .
It should not be the be-all and end - all of their lives , but it does not have to be treated as something that will immediately taint them .
By the end of Prude , one might almost forget that sex is not just something foisted upon us by consumer culture .
It 's actually something teenagers and adults are naturally curious about .
Yes , they look to pop culture , adults and peers for answers , and certainly there are plenty of ill - suited role models for them .
But part of growing up is learning how to synthesize the information presented to you , and every time Liebau criticizes the likes of Britney , Paris , Rhianna and Lil ' Kim , she forgets that Elvis was seen as just such a threat in the 1950s .
There are a variety of instances in which you may be subjected to a polygraph , or lie detector examination .
These tests can be a source of tremendous anxiety , especially since it is all too common for innocent people to fail them for no reason , resulting in the denial of employment or false criminal accusations .
Why ?
Because polygraphs are far from perfect .
In fact , many experts consider them a farce , and almost all scientists who have studied them ( and even some polygraph administrators ) understand that polygraphs are seriously limited .
Fortunately , for this very reason they are easy to trick .
So , here are the top 10 tips for beating the lie detector test .
10 . Refuse
Refuse a polygraph test if you can .
For pre-employment screenings this will almost certainly ensure that you do n’t get hired , but it probably will not get you fired in most circumstances .
In the U.S. , private sector employers may not terminate employment or take other such adverse actions based solely on a polygraph refusal ( this protection usually does not cover government employees ) .
If your polygraph is part of a criminal investigation , you have a right to refuse ( in the U.S. , at least ) , and you should refuse , even if you are innocent , because of the possibilities of a “ false positive . ”
Refusal to submit to a polygraph is generally not admissible in court , and polygraphs themselves are always inadmissible .
9. Study !
Learn about polygraphs .
Since you ’re reading this article , you ’re on the right track , but if your career or court case depends on it , would n’t you do as much research as you can ?
Answer truthfully , now .
The most important thing to know is that polygraphy is not an exact science .
In fact , to the extent that it is a science at all , it is one in its infancy and one which frequently produces incorrect results .
8. Think Ahead
Find out what the tester is looking for .
A polygraph examination is administered to help find out specific information , such as whether you ’re a spy or whether you ’ve used drugs .
Prepare yourself in advance by thinking about what confessions they are looking for , what things you cannot admit .
The polygrapher will ask you many uncomfortable questions , but only certain ones are important .
If your test is prompted by a specific incident , you probably know what the examiner is looking for , but for pre-employment screening tests and the like , research the company or agency ’s policies to determine what you can and cannot admit .
7 . Think of it as a job interview
Approach your whole “ polygraph day ” as a test .
Treat the polygraph examination as an extreme job interview .
Dress conservatively and appropriately , and try to make a good impression before the test , and be sure to arrive on time — and , except in the direst of circumstances , do not reschedule or attempt to postpone the exam .
You would n’t fidget , do anything suspicious , or pick your nose during a job interview , would you ?
Well , the polygraph is an extreme interview because your every move is very likely being observed the moment you arrive at the testing location .
There may be hidden cameras in the waiting room and the restrooms , and there is almost certainly a camera or two - way mirror in the polygraph room .
Your polygraph examination begins long before you are hooked up to the machine , and ends only when you ’ve left the testing location .
6. Identify the Questions
Identify the types of questions you are being asked .
There are three basic types of questions you will be asked : relevant , irrelevant , and control .
Irrelevant questions are those that are obvious , such as “ What is your name ” or “ Have you ever eaten pasta ? ”
Relevant questions are the important ones , such as “ Did you leak that memo to the media , ” “ Have you ever stolen money from an employer , ” or “ Have you ever sold drugs ? ”
Control questions are those against which your reactions to relevant questions will be compared .
These are usually questions to which ( just about ) everybody can answer “ yes ” but which everybody is uncomfortable honestly answering , such as “ Have you ever cheated in a game , ” “ Have you ever told a lie , even a tiny white lie , to your spouse , ” or “ Have you ever stolen anything ? ”
Before the test the polygrapher will typically read you all the questions you are going to be asked .
This is a good time to mentally sort out the types of questions .
5. Stick to the Topic
Do n’t admit anything relevant .
The job of polygraphers is to extract confessions , and in one way , the whole examination is a complex ruse to trick you into confessing something .
Never confess relevant information .
No matter what the lines on the chart look like , nothing is more certain or damaging than your confession .
The polygrapher will most likely try to convince you that he or she can “ see ” a lie in your polygraph , even if there ’s nothing abnormal there .
Do n’t fall for it .
Obviously , however , you want to appear to be an honest person in general , so do n’t be afraid to make minor admissions to control questions ( see below ) — just make sure you do n’t admit anything in these that can invite further questioning or that may be construed as relevant .
4. Essential information only
Say only what you need to .
“ Yes ” or “ No ” answers should be all you need for most of the test .
Resist the temptation to explain your answers or to go into details , although the polygrapher may try to get you to do so .
Be courteous and cooperative , but do not offer any more information than is absolutely necessary .
Answer questions firmly , seriously , and without hesitation .
This is no time to joke around or try to be crafty .
You want to appear earnest , cooperative , and resolute .
3. I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL !
Conceal your knowledge of polygraphy .
The polygrapher may ask you , often before or after the test , if you ’ve done any research on polygraph tests or what you know about them .
Do not disclose that you ’ve done extensive research , and act as though you do n’t know much about polygraph examinations but that you do believe polygraphy to be a science and polygraphs to be reliable ( or at least do not exhibit any doubt as to their reliability ) .
The polygrapher may try to trick you by mentioning certain technical terms and acronyms , such as , “ Your test came back NDI . ”
While you know ( or will now know ) that “ NDI ” means “ no deception indicated , ” you need to act as though you have no idea what it means .
Too much knowledge of the process may make the polygrapher think you ’ve got something to hide , even if you do n’t .
2 . Manage your blood pressure
Throw off the machine ’s reading of the control questions by changing your blood pressure and heart rate .
It ’s difficult to do , but with practice , the next few methods and countermeasures will prompt your body to do so .
Do some of the following when replying to control questions :
Develop a breathing strategy .
Throughout the test ( except during control questions ) maintain a normal breathing rate of 15 - 30 breaths per minute .
Do not breathe too deeply .
Then alter breathing rate with control questions .
You can make it faster or slower , you can hold your breath for a couple of seconds after an exhalation , or you can breathe more shallowly , for example .
Do this for 5 - 15 seconds , and return to your normal breathing pattern before the next question .
As explained above , the polygrapher will compare your physiological responses to control questions to your responses to relevant questions .
If the deviation from normal during control questions exceeds the deviation from normal during relevant questions , you will pass .
If , however , you react more to a relevant question than to control questions , the polygrapher will perceive ( rightly or wrongly ) that you are lying in response to something relevant — you will fail the polygraph .
Do math in your head .
During control questions do something mentally complex .
For example , count backwards in your head as quickly as possible or do some quick long division , as you are answering the question .
Think about something exciting or frightening ; think of things that make you ecstatic , fearful , or frustrated .
Bite your tongue .
Bite the side of your tongue hard enough to cause pain , but not so hard as to draw blood .
Practice this in a mirror to be sure the polygrapher cannot detect it .
This is highly effective , but may be detectable if you have to speak for an extended period , because you ca n’t bite while you ’re speaking .
Only use this method if you can give a quick “ yes ” or “ no ” response , which , luckily , will be most of the time .
Insert a small nail or tack in the toe area of your shoe and press down on this during the control questions to elicit a pain response .
This is a sound method , but it is easily defeated if the polygrapher asks you to remove your shoes .
Contract your anal sphincter muscle when a control question is asked .
While also highly effective , this method may ( or may not ) be discovered with the use of pressure - sensitive seat pads that are now commonly used .
1. Handle the after - event
Handle the post - test interview .
After you ’re disconnected from the machine , the polygrapher may leave you in the room for a while and come back .
The polygrapher may then claim to “ know ” that you are lying about something .
This is a trick .
Remain calm , firmly , but politely repeat your denial , and do n’t change or argue your answers , even in the slightest way .
Decline extended post - test interviewing if possible .

From " The Spymaster , " below :
" I do n't know much about you , " I admitted to McConnell at the end of July , when we met for the first of a series of discussions in his temporary office , which is at Bolling Air Force Base , in Washington .
Despite his long career , there was little in the public record about his background .
" That 's a good thing , " he said .
" I 'm a spy . "
Ten years after leaving the government , McConnell was finally making real money -- two million dollars a year at Booz - Allen .
At Booz Allen , McConnell helped develop a program designed to protect the global financial network .
He and a team of veterans from the New York Stock Exchange and information - technology officers from major financial institutions put together a report that surveyed the system 's vulnerabilities , and submitted it to the President 's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection .
" Our study , which was unclassified , was so compelling that they classified it ! "
McConnell says , laughing .
McConnell 's team eventually won nearly three hundred million dollars in government contracts for Booz Allen .

The New Yorker , January 21 , 2008 [ published January 14 , 2008 ]
A REPORTER AT LARGE
THE SPYMASTER
Can Mike McConnell fix America 's intelligence community ?
Last May , the director of national intelligence , a soft - spoken South Carolinian named Mike McConnell , learned that three U.S. soldiers had been captured by Sunni insurgents in central Iraq .
As a search team of six thousand American and Iraqi forces combed through Babil Province , analysts at the National Security Agency , in Fort Meade , Maryland , began examining communications traffic in Iraq , hoping to pick up conversations among the soldiers ' captors .
To McConnell 's consternation , such surveillance required a warrant -- not because the kidnappers were entitled to constitutional protections but because their communications might pass electronically through U.S. circuits .
The kidnappings could have been just another barely noticed tragedy in a long , bloody war , but at that moment an important political debate was taking place in Washington .
Lawmakers were trying to strike a balance between respecting citizens ' privacy and helping law - enforcement and intelligence officials protect the country against crime , terror , espionage , and treason .
McConnell , who had been in office for less than three months when the soldiers were captured , was urging Congress to make a change in the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , which governs the process of eavesdropping on citizens and foreigners inside the U.S. and requires agencies to obtain a warrant within seventy - two hours after monitoring begins .
The act was a response to abuses of the Nixon era , when the U.S. government turned its formidable surveillance powers against peace activists , reporters , religious groups , civil - rights workers , politicians , and even members of the Supreme Court .
Over the years , the act had been amended many times , but McConnell believed that FISA -- a law written before the age of cell phones , e-mail , and the Web -- was dangerously outmoded .
" If we do n't update FISA , the nation is significantly at risk , " McConnell told me .
He said that federal judges had recently decided , in a series of secret rulings , that any telephone transmission or e-mail that incidentally flowed into U.S. computer systems was potentially subject to judicial oversight .
According to McConnell , the capacity of the N.S.A. to monitor foreign - based communications had consequently been reduced by seventy per cent .
Now , he claimed , the lives of three American soldiers had been thrown onto the scale .
McConnell is the head of the sprawling assemblage of covert agencies known as the " intelligence community " -- a term that first appeared in the minutes of a staff meeting of the Intelligence Advisory Committee , in 1952 .
That year , President Truman signed a secret memorandum creating the N.S.A. , which is still the largest of the sixteen intelligence bureaucracies .
The Pentagon has a Defense Intelligence Agency , and each military branch has its own intelligence shop .
There are three very expensive technical agencies : the N.S.A. , which is responsible for code - breaking , code - making , communications monitoring , and information warfare ; the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency , which makes maps and analyzes surveillance photographs ; and the National Reconnaissance Office , which provides satellite imagery .
The Central Intelligence Agency is in charge of human intelligence on foreign targets , although the Defense Intelligence Agency also conducts " humint " operations for the military .
Domestic intelligence is handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Drug Enforcement Administration , and divisions of the Department of Homeland Security .
The State Department has its own intelligence - analysis bureau , as do the Energy and Treasury Departments .
The intelligence community employs more than a hundred thousand people , including tens of thousands of private contractors .
And its official budget , which last year was $ 43.5 billion , omits the military 's intelligence operations , which , if included , would probably push the total annual cost past $ 50 billion -- more than the government spends on energy , scientific research , or the federal court and prison systems .
To call the disparate intelligence bureaucracies a community suggests that they share a collegial spirit , but throughout their history these organizations have been brutally competitive , undermining one another and even hoarding vital information .
Since the establishment of the C.I.A. , in 1947 , the fractious intelligence community has botched many of the major tasks assigned to it .
Its failures include the Bay of Pigs invasion , the unforeseen collapse of the Soviet Union , the inability to prevent the September 11th attacks , and the catastrophic assessment that Iraq , under Saddam Hussein , possessed weapons of mass destruction .
There have been successes -- in 2006 , American intelligence helped lead to the arrest in England of twenty - four conspirators who were plotting to blow up at least ten transatlantic airliners -- but they do n't begin to outweigh the damage caused by bungled operations and misguided analysis .
Over the past sixty years , frustrated Presidents and lawmakers have commissioned more than forty studies of the nation 's intelligence operations , to determine how to rearrange , reform , or even , in some cases , abolish them .
Most of these studies have concluded that the rivalries and conflicting missions of the warring agencies could be resolved only by placing a single figure in charge .
Yet , until September 11th , there was no political will to do so .
In 2004 , after the 9/11 Commission recommended the appointment of a powerful overseer , Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act , which created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , or O.D.N.I .
Dissenting lawmakers complained that the new office would simply add another tier of bureaucrats to an already congested roster .
Indeed , although the 9/11 Commission suggested that the O.D.N.I. needed no more than a few hundred employees , it has quickly expanded to some fifteen hundred .
Most of these additions , however , are transfers from other agencies , a maneuver that has rankled senior intelligence managers , especially in the C.I.A. , which fiercely opposed the establishment of the new office .
Until the 2004 law passed , the nominal leader of the intelligence community was the head of the C.I.A .
Now the agency reports to the D.N.I. , just as the intelligence branch of the Coast Guard does .
The reforms came at a time when the basic value of intelligence - gathering was in question .
" We have such a huge infrastructure that adds so little to our understanding and frequently gets us in trouble , " says Richard Clarke , who served as the counterterrorism coordinator under President Clinton and , until 2002 , in the current Administration .
" You 're left with the impression that it would n't make any difFerence if they did n't exist . "
In April , 2005 , Congress confirmed John Negroponte , then the U.S. Ambassador in Iraq , as the office 's first director .
General Michael Hayden , the head of the N.S.A. , became his deputy .
But Negroponte lasted only two years in the job before returning to the State Department , where he clearly felt more at home .
And Hayden left to lead the CI.A .
There were few candidates eager to replace Negroponte in the last two years of an embattled , lame - duck Administration .
And although the 2004 reforms had given the director of National Intelligence responsibility tor overseeing the community , his powers were limited .
The President turned to Mike McConnell , a retired admiral who had directed the N.S.A. from 1992 to 1996 , but who was not well known outside the intelligence community .
Sixty - three years old at the time , McConnell was part of the featureless parade of management consultants and security experts who work for federal contractors based in northern Virginia , near CI.A. headquarters .
McConnell was a senior vice - president of Booz Allen Hamilton , the oldest of these firms .
The war on terror and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were generating an economic boom in the Virginia suburbs , and McConnell , like many retired spooks , was reaping the benefits of his government experience and his top - secret clearance .
McConnell has pale , thin , sandy hair , blue eyes , and skin as pink as a baby's .
His back troubles him , and he walks with a slight stoop , which becomes more pronounced as the day wears on .
His friends describe him as quickminded and crafty , with an unusual ability to synthesize large amounts of information .
A workaholic , he regularly lugged two briefcases home each night .
Yet , ten years after leaving the government , he was finally making real money -- two million dollars a year at Booz - Allen -- and was looking toward a comfortable retirement , perhaps in a cabin in the Carolinas , where he could build birdhouses ( he and his wife , Terry , are members of a society whose purpose is to protect the Eastern bluebird ) and listen to soft rock and rhythm and blues .
He claims to be a terrific dancer .
In September , 2006 , McConnell was offered the D.N.I. job and refused it .
One of the major limitations of the post was that eighty per cent of the intelligence budget was controlled by the Secretary of Defense -- and at the time that was Donald Rumsfeld , whose contempt for the C.I.A. and other civilian intelligence agencies was well known .
Two months later , Rumsfeld resigned , and Robert M. Gates replaced him .
When Vice - President Dick Cheney approached McConnell again , over Christmas , he asked for time to think about it .
" My first phone call was to Secretary Gates , " McConnell recalls .
The two men had known each other since the first Gulf War , when Gates worked in the White House as deputy national - security adviser and McConnell was the intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Gates , a former C.I.A. director , had been offered the D.I.A. job before Negroponte , and turned it down .
" Mike had a lot of the same concerns I had with the 2004 act , in terms of the ability to get things done , " Gates told me .
" Under the legislation , the D.N.I. had the responsibility for executing the intelligence budget and assuring that everybody in the community obeyed the law , but he did n't have the authority to fire anybody . "
The community that both men had spent decades serving was in tumult .
Morale was low , especially after the W.M.D. disgrace , when many Americans blamed the intelligence community for dragging the country into an unnecessary conflict .
A number of experienced officers had walked away in shame and frustration .
Moreover , the nation that had launched a war in Iraq because of faulty intelligence was now losing the battle , in part because it was so poorly prepared to understand the enemy .
Al Qaeda , which the C.I.A. and the military had failed to vanquish in Afghanistan , was reconstituting itself there , as well as in Pakistan , Iraq , Somalia , and North Africa .
Meanwhile , North Korea had exploded a low - yield nuclear bomb , and China was emerging as a rival to American supremacy .
The need for reliable intelligence was arguably greater than it had been during the Cold War , when the enemy was easy to find , if hard to destroy ; now the enemy might be a small group of lightly armed men who could be anywhere , and whose capacity to cause great harm had been appallingly demonstrated .
Gates informed McConnell that he had recommended McConnell 's old friend Lieutenant General James Clapper to be Under - Secretary of Defense for Intelligence .
" I thought that , between Hayden , McConnell , Clapper , and myself , we could reach an agreement on some of the issues that had n't been resolved by the legislation , " Gates said .
If McConnell and Clapper took office , each of the major agencies would be led by a military man .
This unique alignment , Gates and McConnell believed , would offer the best chance that the intelligence community would ever have to reform itself .
Unsurprisingly , the model they had in mind was the American armed forces .
All four men were insiders who understood the culture of intelligence - gathering .
" There had n't been this kind of alignment of stars in the more than sixty years of my experience in the intelligence community , " Gates said .
The question was whether they could be sufficiently objective and forceful to reshape a subterranean branch of government that had failed so deeply in its mission .
McConnell accepted the post and in February , 2007 , he was sworn in .
Clapper 's wife gave McConnell and her husband clocks that counted down to the last second of the Bush Administration , on January 20 , 2009 .
That was the amount of time , McConnell believed , that he had to lead a revolution .
" I do n't know much about you , " I admitted to McConnell at the end of July , when we met for the first of a series of discussions in his temporary office , which is at Bolling Air Force Base , in Washington .
Despite his long career , there was little in the public record about his background .
" That 's a good thing , " he said .
" I 'm a spy . "
He told me that he was born in Greenville , South Carolina , in 1943 .
Working class .
My father grew up in a mill village .
In the Depression , he worked sixty hours for six bucks .
His view of the world was that it was n't right .
So he decided to become a union organizer . "
McConnell 's father campaigned against child labor and was an outspoken proponent of civil rights , at a time when that was genuinely dangerous .
McConnell recalled , " The ' n ' word ' was forbidden in my house , and it was n't uncommon for us to have black people come over to the house for a meal .
Kids I grew up with would absolutely reject any thought of that . "
He said of his father , " He pushed back against everything .
When I was ten , maybe thirteen years old , he described to me bureaucratic behavior and people being afraid of change .
He said that people never accept change willingly .
I remember it as clear as day , thinking , Change will never frighten me . "
McConnell 's parents were poor -- " They had , basically , nothing " -- so he got a student loan and a job and went to North Greenville Junior College , where he was elected student - body president in his second year ; he then transferred to Furman University , a private college , living in a closet in the gym during his first semester while he managed the basketball team .
In his senior year , he married his childhood sweetheart , Suzanne Gideon , in the first of two marriages .
It was 1965 , during the Vietnam War .
" Where I grew up , in South Carolina , there 's a war , you 're supposed to go , " . McConnell said .
He joined the Navy and , in August , 1967 , went to Vietnam , spending a year on a boat patrolling the Mekong River .
The lesson he learned from Vietnam was " Be careful what you get into . "
He went on , " During the latter stages of Vietnam , soldiers were fragging their own officers , and drugs were rampant .
The military was a shambles . "
Like the agencies of the intelligence community , the military 's various branches undermined rather than helped one another .
As McConnell put it , " The Navy has its own ground force , its own air force .
and its own ships .
So the view of the Navy is : " Why do we need anybody else ? "
A new generation of leaders at the Pentagon , McConnell said , decided that the military needed to be reformed .
" Guys like Colin Powell , they just made a decision -- ' This is our Army , we 're taking it back . '
And they did .
What that led to was an all - volunteer force , the most professional army in history . "
In 1986 , the Goldwater - Nichols Act restructured the military , despite resistance from the leaders of the uniformed branches .
The law established the Secretary of Defense as the top decision - maker and awarded battlefield commanders more control .
The 1991 Gulf War , with its coordinated use of overwhelming power , provided a stunning example of the restructured armed forces .
McConnell recalled , " Every service chief stood up and said .
' This is the greatest thing to happen to the United States military . ' "
The 2004 intelligence legislation was not nearly as comprehensive as Goldwater - Nichols , but McConnell came into office with a slate of reforms , called the Hundred - Day Plan , that was modelled on the streamlined military command .
He proposed a " culture of collaboration , " which would require agencies to work together .
The cost of one agency hiding intelligence from others was made dismally clear in the recent Inspector General report on the performance of the C.I.A. before 9/11 .
The report revealed that in March , 2000 , between fifty and sixty individuals within the agency had known that two future Al Qaeda hijackers were infiltrating America .
but nobody at the C.I.A. had informed the F.B.I .
McConnell 's hundred days ended in August .
He set up an executive committee made up of the heads of the most significant agencies , and took control of the budget for the community .
Some important advances were made in sharing intelligence and in prompting career employees to serve outside their home agencies , but he admits that his office should have been more realistic about how long it would take to bring about such profound changes .
In the fall , he established a Five - Hundred - Day Plan , which coincided with the number of days remaining on his countdown clock .
This second phase focuses on information technology and clearance issues .
The intelligence community is literally incapable of understanding the enemy , because substantial security barriers have been placed in the path of Americans who are native speakers of Arabic and other critical languages .
In the six years since September 11th , very little progress has been made in hiring people who might penetrate and disrupt Al Qaeda and its affiliates .
McConnell was undaunted .
" I grew up in this community , " he said .
" I served it as a consultant .
I 'm passionate about it .
So this job gives me the opportunity to make a contribution , even to the consternation of the bureaucracies , because I am going to force them to cooperate . "
In August , just before the congressional recess , members of the House and the Senate were frantically seeking a compromise on a FISA - reform bill .
McConnell explained one day over lunch at his office , " When the law was passed , in ' 78 , almost all international communication was wireless , " meaning that it relied mainly on satellites .
" Today , ninety per cent goes through a glass pipe " -- a fibre - optic cable .
" So it went from almost all wireless to almost all wire . "
He put down his sandwich and walked over to a world map on his wall .
" Terrorist on a cell phone , right here " -- he pointed at Iraq -- " talking to a tower , happens all the time , no warrant .
Tower goes up to a microwave tower , no warrant .
Goes up to a satellite , back to the ground station , no warrant .
Now , let us suppose that it goes up to a satellite , and in the process it does this " -- his finger darted to the U.S. before angling back to Pakistan .
" Gotta have a warrant !
So it was crazy . "
The changes to FISA that McConnell proposed were minor , in his view .
" Three things we wanted , " he told me , in characteristic bulletin language .
" First , we had to have a situation where it does n't require us to get a warrant for a foreign person in a foreign country .
Second point , we need the cooperation of the private sector .
The private sector is being sued for allegedly cooperating with the government . "
He was referring to reports that , even before 9/11 , many of America 's major telecommunications companies had diverted virtually all records of telephone and e-mail traffic from their routers into N.S.A. data banks , where it could be stored and examined .
McConnell wanted liability protection not only for the companies ' future cooperation but for their past actions as well ; however , he agreed to take the issue of retroactive immunity off the table if Congress would reconsider the matter after its recess .
( " We were in a pissing contest with the Administration , because they would n't give us the documents to show what they needed the immunity for , " Silvestre Reyes , of Texas , the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , told me . )
McConnell 's third point was uncontroversial : he wanted a warrant to be required whenever a person in the U.S. was the object of surveillance .
However , the reform bill before Congress , which Democrats in both houses had rejected , did not protect Americans -- travellers , soldiers , exchange students , diplomats -- who happened to be outside the United States .
As the vote on the legislation approached , the Administration let it be known that threats from Al Qaeda had increased in number ; there had even been signs , it claimed , of a plot to attack Congress .
Many lawmakers felt manipulated and suspicious .
In a meeting with McConnell , I said , " According to Senator Harry Reid , the legislation ' authorizes warrantless searches and surveillance of American phone calls , e-mails , homes , offices , and -- ' "
" Totally untrue ! " McConnell exclaimed .
'' I 'm telling you , if you 're in the United States you have to have a warrant .
Authorized by the court .
Period ! "
Critics argued , however , that the proposed law left a loophole .
If the Attorney General and the D.N.I. decided that a foreign target was a subject of interest , the law permitted them to conduct surveillance on any Americans who might be in touch with that person , to break into their homes , to open their mail , to examine their medical records -- all without a warrant .
Legislators worried that the law would permit the intelligence community to " reverse - target " Americans who happened to be making international calls but who had nothing to do with terrorism .
" That 's a violation of the Constitution , " McConnell said .
" We can't do that , would n't do that . "
Naturally , some innocent Americans would be overheard , he conceded .
" What do you do about it ?
It 's called ' minimize . '
Courts reviewed it -- it works .
You get an inadvertent collection ?
When you recognize what it is , you destroy it .
Exception : let 's suppose it was terrorism or crime .
In that case , as a community , it is our obligation to report it .
But to claim that this community is monitoring the e-mail and telephone calls of millions of Americans , and that we 're doing reverse - targeting , is clearly absurd . "
McConnell admitted that Congress had reason to be wary of the intelligence community 's intentions .
" In the forties , fifties , sixties , seventies -- every President used either law enforcement or intel to conduct activities in the interest of national security by tapping telephones of Americans , " he said .
FISA had been a useful corrective .
He summed up the law 's intent as follows : " You intel guys go off and do your foreign - intel mission , but if you ever do it in this country you gotta have a warrant , O.K. ? "
The intelligence agencies have always had a murky relationship with the law .
" We have to be at the edge of legality all the time , " Admiral William Studeman , who preceded McConnell as the director of the N.S.A. , told me .
" Otherwise , we can't do our job . "
He added , " In foreign environments , all espionage agencies break the laws every day -- but they 're somebody else 's laws .
Now there seems to be a notion that because we 're criminals overseas we 're criminals domestically . "
Six weeks after 9/11 , Congress passed the U.S.A. Patriot Act. The F.B.I. was given expanded authority to issue " national - security letters , " a form of subpoena entitling the bureau to pry into the private lives of American citizens and visitors who were not the subject of a criminal investigation and might not even have been suspected of being terrorists or spies .
There was no judicial oversight .
Unlike a FISA warrant , a national - security letter did not permit the government to eavesdrop on phone calls or read e-mails , but it did allow the examination of phone records , bank accounts , Web searches , and credit - card purchases .
The F.B.I. was required to prove a specific national - security need before serving such letters , but a recent Justice Department audit uncovered dozens of cases in which bureau officials appeared to have violated this rule .
' We found wholesale abuse of that authority , " Silvestre Reyes told me .
" It underscored the need for constitutional protections . "
I asked McConnell how the new FISA law would be different .
How could Americans be sure that the intelligence community would n't commit even more intimate invasions of privacy ?
" A national - security letter was a whole new tool , " he explained .
" Now , did the F.B.I. have the structure and experience and time to learn , the way you do in the FISA world ?
In fact they did not .
It was used in a sloppy way . "
He said that the FISA system , by contrast , was governed by a strict protocol that had been in place for decades .
( A special FISA court in Washington , established in 1978 , confidentially weighs all requests for FISA warrants . )
On August 1st , McConnell and his staff stayed up all night preparing their position on FISA for lawmakers .
Despite his long government service , McConnell had never been enmeshed in a partisan legislative debate .
" Mike McConnell is a first - rate professional , " Senator Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania , told me .
" But he 's a little out of his element in politics . "
The next afternoon , the top Democratic leaders , including Reid and Reyes , gathered in the office of Nancy Pelosi , the Speaker of the House , and placed a call to McConnell .
The Democrats presented him with their proposal , which stated , among other things , that if Congress was going to allow the President to conduct warrantless surveillance the power had to be limited to matters of terrorism .
McConnell responded that this would hamper the ability of the intelligence community to collect information about dangerous foreign powers such as Iran and North Korea .
He also rejected language in the bill requiring the Attorney General and the FISA court to establish guidelines for which kinds of contact between a targeted foreigner and a U.S. person merited a warrant ; he called the idea a " poison pill . "
The Democrats ceded on both points .
He pledged to get back to the leaders half an hour later , with a new draft of their bill which reflected his concerns .
When McConnell did n't call back , the Democrats telephoned his office .
His assistant told them that he was talking to the White House .
McConnell called back at around seven .
According to two people present in Pelosi 's office , McConnell apologized , saying that he bad been on the phone with " the other side " and that he could no longer abide by their compromise .
He told the Democrats , " I 've spent forty years of my life in this business , and I 've been shot at during war .
I 've never felt so much pressure in my life . "
Late that evening , McConnell 's office sent the legislators a sweeping revision that bore little resemblance to their bill .
Reyes , among others , felt betrayed .
" We had thought we were dealing in good faith , " he said .
( McConnell denies that he and the Democrats had a firm agreement . )
On Friday , August 3rd , in a furious scramble , the Democrats and the Republicans pushed rival bills to the floor .
McConnell happened to be on Capitol Hill , explaining some of the technical language to the senators , and was surprised to discover that the Senate was about to vote .
" At that point , I had seen neither version , " he said .
He was in the Vice - President 's office in the Senate , watching the debate on a monitor , as each side claimed to be sponsoring " McConnell 's bill . "
McConnell wrote a note officially rejecting the Democratic version , saying that it " creates significant uncertainty . "
The Republican bill , called the Protect America Act , passed that night .
The next day , the House , desperate to adjourn , passed the legislation , which was designated a placeholder that would expire in six months , allowing lawmakers to deliberate more fully after their break .
" Then all the press stuff started , " McConnell said .
" ' The White House rolled McConnell ! '
' The naive admiral learns a hard political lesson . '
I guess the part that bothered me a bit was the rhetoric coming off the Hill , impugning my integrity , saying I was less than honest . "
When asked if he had bowed to the White House , McConnell said , " Nothing could be further from the truth . "
Six mornings a week , McConnell awakens at four , does twenty minutes of back exercises , then prepares for his daily briefing of President Bush -- a task that was formerly the jealously guarded prerogative of the C.I.A .
The night before each meeting , .
McConnell receives a draft of the Presidential Daily Brief , a compendium of topical items .
At 6 A.M. , a dark armored Suburban arrives at his house , in northern Virginia , and takes him to the White House .
On the way , he says , he reads a summary of operational and intelligence traffic -- " messages , e-mails , or whatever " -- from the past twenty - four hours .
The Presidential briefing starts between seven - thirty and eight and rarely lasts longer than an hour .
In addition to Bush and Cheney , the core group includes Joshua Bolten , Bush 's chief of staff , and Stephen Hadley , the national security adviser .
" We take analysts into the Oval Office three or four times a week for what we call a ' deep dive , ' " McConnell said .
Once a week , the deep dive concerns Iraq .
The Secretaries of State and Defense usually attend .
" Sometimes we 'll go right out of the briefing in the Oval to the Situation Room , where we 'll meet with the National Security Council . "
A screen in the room displays live video feeds of Ryan Crocker , the Ambassador to Iraq ; General David Petraeus , the U.S. commander there ; and Admiral William J. Fallon , the CENTCOM commander .
McConnell went on , " Another day , we do Homeland Security , so in the room will be the core group , plus the Attorney General , the director of the F.B.I. , the Secretary of Homeland Security , and the adviser to the President for Homeland Security .
Another day , we could do a deep dive on the former Yugoslavia , Georgia , Russia , China -- whatever the issue is . "
By nine - thirty , McConnell is back in the Suburban , headed to Bolling Air Force Base .
His temporary office is in the Defense Intelligence Agency building there , a chilly steel - and - glass structure with a Scud missile erected beside the elevator bank and a pair of Saddam Hussein 's gold - plated automatic weapons displayed in the lobby .
His office is spare , except for a photograph of his children and a few treasured artifacts -- a Yemeni dagger and a blue vase from the People 's Liberation Army of China .
Through the large windows , one can see planes landing at Washington 's National Airport and marines running around a track .
He frequently leaves the office to testify before Congress , or flies off for a speech .
He usually arrives home around eight .
" My wife gets about fifteen minutes a day , " he said .
" She 's not a happy camper .
Now , I 'm not complaining .
This is a demanding job , but I love doing it . "
McConnell claims to be " apolitical , " by which he means nonpartisan .
" I 'm not a Republican or a Democrat , " he told me .
" My worry is good government . "
On another occasion , he said , " I always vote , and I 've voted for both parties . "
His political heroes are Lincoln , Churchill , and Franklin Roosevelt .
" The thing that always impressed me was the pressure on Lincoln , and how he stood up to it , " he said .
He noted the discord surrounding Lincoln 's decision to suspend habeas corpus during the Civil War .
" There are a lot of parallels .
The current Administration is accused of spying on Americans .
And I 'm right in the middle of that . "
McConnell often speaks admiringly of General Colin Powell , who , as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1990 , hired McConnell , then a Navy captain , to be his intelligence officer .
" I was impressed by his reputation and by his interview , " Powell told me .
McConnell was well versed in technical intelligence , but not in other important areas , such as ground warfare .
That did n't seem like such a liability at the time .
" It was going to be a quiet summer , so I hired him , " Powell said , laughing .
Four days later , Saddam Hussein 's troops invaded Kuwait .
It was McConnell who informed Powell that Iraqi troops had massed on the border .
At a speech last fall at the Woodrow Wilson International Center tor Scholars , in Washington , be recalled , " I 'm anticipating the question was going to be ' How many divisions . '
He said , ' Like , how many maneuver brigades ? '
I did n't even know what a maneuver brigade was .
. . .
So I now feel about two inches tall .
I said , ' Sir , I do n't know , but I 'll find out . ' "
Powell was not bothered by the reply .
He instructed McConnell in his rules for an intelligence agent : " Tell me what you know , then tell me what you don 't't know , and only then can you tell me what you think .
Always keep those three separated . "
Powell says that McConnell spent weeks carrying around flash cards of Army terms .
The government was desperate to determine whether Iraqi troops were merely on a maneuver or were poised for invasion .
Cheney , then the Secretary of Defense , was demanding a verdict , and the intelligence community was typically reluctant to render one .
Twenty - two hours before the invasion , McConnell correctly judged that Saddam intended to move into Kuwait .
His willingness to take a stand earned Cheney 's admiration .
Soon after the onset of Desert Storm , the American - led effort that repelled the Iraqi invasion , Powell had so much confidence in McConnell 's grasp of ground warfare that he charged him with delivering daily press briefings .
" He got so good that he started being parodied by ' Saturday Night Live , ' '' Powell recalled .
" That 's when I knew we 'd made a good decision . "
In 1992 , both Powell and Cheney sponsored McConnell 's candidacy to become the head of the N.S.A. , even though McConnell had been promoted to a one - star admiral only nine months earlier .
By law , the N.S.A position requires three stars ; thanks to his powerful patrons , McConnell received two additional ones .
When he took over the N.S.A , the Cold War had just ended and Congress had decided to extract a " peace dividend " from the intelligence community .
New hiring came to a near - halt just as the security challenges became far more diverse .
There was a surfeit of Russian linguists but scarcely anyone who , for instance , could speak Serbo - Croatian , during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia , or the Creole dialect of Haiti , when the Clinton Administration sent troops there to restore order .
The agency had to hire Haitian menial laborers in Washington and put them to work listening to intercepts in N.S.A. headquarters .
There was , however , an even greater challenge for the N.S.A. than hiring new linguists .
The Internet and e-mail were radically expanding the abilities of terrorists and rogue states to communicate .
" When I went there in ' 92 , the Internet existed -- it was called Arpanet -- but the World Wide Web did not , " McConnell recalled .
" Then the Web made the Internet accessible for everybody .
My world exploded . "
One afternoon , as McConnell and I were walking back to his office from the cafeteria , in the basement , we passed the security room , where a pair of guards monitored half a dozen screens displaying a video of the building 's grounds .
The setup was , by Hollywood standards , disappointingly low - tech .
I asked McConnell if he 'd seen " The Bourne Ultimatum , " in which Matt Damon 's character is pursued by C.I.A. officers with instant global access to surveillance cameras , banking transactions , and passport controls .
" Yeah , we can't do that , " McConnell admitted .
" That 's all horse pucky , "
The intelligence community has lagged significantly behind private industry in the development and use of innovative technology .
" There have been breakthroughs , " General Clapper , the Defense Under - Secretary , told me , citing the use of cell phones and computers on the battlefield , although he acknowledges that Al Qaeda has also made creative use of those technologies .
By comparison , during the Second World War the U.S. government developed advanced radar and jet engines , and invented the atomic bomb .
Six years of the war on terror have brought nothing nearly as significant ; instead , the intelligence community has only warily appropriated models whose usefulness is blindingly obvious .
In 2006 , the community adopted Intellipedia , a secure version of Wikipedia .
Blogging is now permitted on internal servers , giving contrarian opinion a voice .
There is a new " A - Space " -- based on sites such as MySpace and Facebook -- in which analysts post their current projects as a way of creating social networks .
The Library of National Intelligence is an online digest of official reports that will soon provide analysts who use it with tips , much the way Amazon and iTunes offer recommendations to their customers .
These innovations have not yet made their way to the analysts and agents in the field , however .
Despite such attempts to bring together resources and staff , the community still relies on more than thirty online networks and eighty databases , most of which are largely inaccessible to one another .
After the 2004 reforms , which mandated greater information sharing , the community turned to private industry for help in creating the National Counter - Terrorism Center , which is in northern Virginia , at an undisclosed location .
An engineer from Walt Disney Imagineering , the theme - park developer , designed it .
" Even the chairs in the lunchroom are the same ones we had at the Disney Studios , " a former Disney executive , who now works at the center , told me .
" The only difference is these chairs do n't have the mouse ears . "
She was one of several former Disney employees who signed up for government service after 9/11 .
The fantasy worlds that Disney creates have a surprising amount in common with the ideal universe envisaged by the intelligence community , in which environments are carefully controlled and people are closely observed , and no one seems to mind .
The center has a futuristic videoconference room , featuring a table that can change its shape and has pop -up computer consoles .
Three times a day , analysts gather around it to discuss the " threat matrix . "
The heart of the building is the operations center , a dim room where analysts from various agencies are illuminated by the lights of multiple computer monitors .
When I was there , Fox News was playing on a huge television screen at the front of the room .
Disney Imagineering also provided the O.D.N.I ..'s first science - and - technology director , Eric Haseltine , who joined the N.S.A. after September 11th .
He was dismayed by the lumbering pace of innovation , the absence of collaboration , and the lack of thought about how new products might be employed .
" Insufficient attention was being paid to the end user , " he said .
Much of the intelligence community is technophobic and is also hamstrumg by security concerns .
Only recently have BlackBerrys made their way into some agencies , and many offices do n't even have Internet connections .
" At Disney , we had to make technology work for a tour - year - old and a grandmother instantly , and be fun , " Haseltine said .
Haseltine and his successor , Steve Nixon , have set up an intelligence version of DARPA , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which was created in 1958 , after the Soviet launch of Sputnik , and led to the development of the Internet , the Global Positioning System , night - vision goggles , Predator drones , and Stealth aircraft .
( After 9/11 , DARPA also gave birth to Total Information Awareness , a program designed to sort through vast sets of data about individuals , including Americans , in order to identify potential terrorists .
Congress killed the program in 2003 , but many of its capabilities were passed along to other departments . )
Like DARPA , the O.D.N.I. version sponsors radical innovation -- " game - changing breakthroughs , " as Nixon puts it .
The program has only a few dozen employees , but it expects to collaborate with private businesses , nonprofits , and universities .
The most significant product of this effort : so far is Argus , a program that monitors foreign news reports and other open sources looking for evidence of bird die - offs , crop failures , an unusual number of death notices -- anything that could provide an early warning of an epidemic , nuclear accident , or environmental catastrophe .
The program , which began in 2004 , spotted the appearance of avian flu in 2006 and a recent outbreak of Ebola in Angola .
During flu season last year , the program tracked more than a thousand socially disruptive diseases simultaneously .
Argus now monitors a million Web pages in twenty - eight languages and in nearly every country in the world -- except the U.S. , where such scrutiny would stir concerns about domestic spying .
The intelligence community is also marshalling insights from the social sciences .
Psychologists , for example , are studying how terrorists behave when they are attempting to avoid detection ; agents will then be trained to look for examples of such behavior .
Nixon said , " We 're also looking at virtual worlds and gaming - immersive environments in which to train agents , " such as Second Life .
He conceded that such efforts were derivative .
" Our brightest people are working on things in the commercial environment .
The problem is that we do n't have a lock on that .
Technology is a two - edged sword for the intelligence community .
For instance , with biology , there could be a time in the not distant future when teen - agers can design biological components just as they do computer viruses today .
That 's why I think intelligence is as critical now as at any time in our nation 's history . "
At the N.S.A. , McConnell set up a new office to conduct information warfare against potential enemies , but he eventually realized that America , with its huge computer networks , was far more vulnerable to such attacks than its adversaries .
Ed Giorgio , a security consultant who worked at the N.S.A. under McConnell , and who is the only person to have been both the nation 's chief code breaker and its chief code maker , said , " Early on , Mike had what many directors of the N.S.A. have near the end of their tenure -- that is , an info - sec epiphany .
' If only I had paid more attention to our own systems ! ' " Practically nothing was being done to secure American computer networks , which the entire world routinely depended upon .
Information security became McConnell 's passion .
In the nineties , new encryption software that could protect telephone conversations , faxes , and e-mails from unwarranted monitoring was coming on the market , but the programs could also block entirely legal efforts to eavesdrop on criminals or potential terrorists .
Under McConnell 's direction , the N.S.A. developed a sophisticated device , the Clipper Chip , with a superior ability to encrypt any electronic transmission ; it also allowed law - enforcement officials , given the proper authority , to decipher and eavesdrop on the encrypted communications of others .
Privacy advocates criticized the device , though , and the Clipper was abandoned by 1996 .
" They convinced the folks on the Hill that they could n't trust the government to do what it said it was going to do , " Richard Wilhelm , who was in charge of information warfare under McConnell , says .
At Booz Allen , McConnell helped develop a program designed to protect the global financial network .
He and a team of veterans from the New York Stock Exchange and information - technology officers from major financial institutions put together a report that surveyed the system 's vulnerabilities , and submitted it to the President 's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection .
" Our study , which was unclassified , was so compelling that they classified it ! "
McConnell says , laughing .
McConnell 's team eventually won nearly three hundred million dollars in government contracts for Booz Allen .
Every day , the Defense Department detects three million unauthorized probes of its computer networks ; the State Department fends off two million .
Sometimes , these turn into full - scale attacks , such as an assault last spring on the Pentagon that required fifteen hundred computers to be taken off - line .
In May , the German government discovered that a spyware program had been planted inside government computers in several key ministries , and also in the office of Chancellor Angela Merkel .
The Germans blamed the Chinese Army .
The head of Britain 's M.I.5 , the domestic intelligence agency , recently said that Chinese and Russian spying was at such a high level that combatting it was diverting government resources from counterterrorism .
McConnell says that the U.S. faces similar problems .
" Chinese spying has gone up significantly , and Russian spying has n't decreased at all since the Cold War , " he says .
( A spokesman for the Chinese consulate called the German and American accusations " preposterous . " )
Ed Giorgio explained the situation to me : " There are forty thousand Chinese hackers who are collecting intelligence off U.S. information systems and those of our partners .
How many of them can read English ?
Almost every one of them .
If you ask how many intelligence - gathering people are doing similar things in Mike 's vast empire , the answer would be tiny .
And you wo n't find any who understand Mandarin .
We should never get into a hacking war with the Chinese . "
One day in May , at a meeting with the President and several cabinet members , McConnell asked for authority to wage information warfare against the tech - savvy insurgents in Iraq .
First , he described the three aspects of information - warfare operations .
Computer - network exploitation -- that is , the theft or manipulation of information -- is done by the N.S.A.
Computer - network attacks are the province of the Department of Defense .
The third element , computer - network defense , was not the specialty of any agency .
According to someone who was in the Oval Office , McConnell then said , " If the 9/11 perpetrators had focussed on a single U.S. bank through cyber - attack and it had been successful , it would have an order - of - magnitude greater impact on the U.S. economy . "
The President blanched and turned to the Secretary of the Treasury , Henry Paulson .
" Is that true , Hank ? " he said .
Paulson said that it was .
The President then charged McConnell to come up with a security strategy , not only for government systems but also for American industry and private individuals .
One proposal of McConnell 's Cyber - Security Policy , which is still in the draft stage , is to reduce the access points between government computers and the Internet from two thousand to fifty .
" The real question is what to do about industry , " McConnell told me .
" Ninety - five per cent of this is a private - sector problem . "
He claimed that cyber - theft accounted for as much as a hundred billion dollars in annual losses to the American economy .
" The real problem is the perpetrator who does n't care about stealing -- he just wants to destroy . "
The plan will propose restrictions that are certain to be unpopular .
In order for cyberspace to be policed , Internet activity will have to be closely monitored .
Ed Giorgio , who is working with McConnell on the plan , said that would mean giving government the authority to examine the content of any e-mail , file transfer , or Web search .
" Google has records that could help in a cyber - investigation , " he said .
Giorgio warned me , " We have a saying in this business : ' Privacy and security are a zero- sum game . ' "
With the cyber - security initiative , McConnell is asking the country to confront a dilemma : Americans will have to trust the government not to abuse the authority it must have in order to protect our networks , and yet , historically , the government has not proved worthy of that trust .
" FISA reform will be a walk in the park compared to this , " McConnell said .
" This is going to be a goat rope on the Hill .
My prediction is that we 're going to screw around with this until something horrendous happens . "
For all McConnell 's insistence on change , he often thinks like a traditional spy .
During one conversation , I asked McConnell , " Have we gotten meaningful information through torture ? "
" We do n't torture , " he responded automatically .
" O.K. , through aggressive interrogation techniques . "
" ' Aggressive ' is your word , " he said .
" Have we gotten meaningful information ?
You betcha .
Tons !
Does it save lives ?
Tons !
We 've gotten incredible information .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
K.S.M. No.3 . Go pull his testimony .
A lot of what we know about Al Qaeda and what we shut down came out of that . "
( The reliability of the confession of Mohammed , who after sustained abuse claimed a role in more than thirty criminal plots , has been widely questioned . )
He peered over his glasses .
" And this was a test for Mike McConnell .
' When Abu Ghraib happened , my view was that we had lost the moral high ground . "
McConnell had not yet returned to government when the Abu Ghraib scandal broke , but after becoming director of National Intelligence he received the still secret protocol that the White House had devised to govern future interrogations .
Shortly after Attorney General Alberto Gonzales came into office , in February , 2005 , he issued an opinion endorsing the most brutal interrogation techniques that the C.I.A. had ever used .
According to the Times , the agency had learned some of these methods from Egyptian and Saudi intelligence officials ; others were drawn from old Soviet techniques .
The methods included stripping a suspect naked and placing him in a cold cell ; manacling him in a painful posture ; subjecting him to deafening rock music ; head slapping ; and waterboarding , an act of simulated drowning that was used in the Spanish Inquisition .
Any one of these techniques would likely violate the international legal standards banning torture , such as the Geneva Conventions .
The C.I.A. had used " special methods of questioning " on about thirty people , McConnell learned .
" I had to sign off on that program , " McConnell told me .
" The President said we do n't torture anyone , but I had to convince myself by going through the whole process . "
He pored over the procedures that had been secretly authorized by the Bush Administration .
" I sat down with the doctors and the medical personnel who oversee the process , " he said .
" Our policies are not torture . "
I asked how he defined torture .
" There 's a history of people making claims that it 's not torture if you do n't force the failure of a major organ , " McConnell said , referring to the infamous 2002 memo by John Yoo , a Justice Department lawyer , who argued that an interrogation technique was torture only when it was as painful as organ failure or death .
" My view is , that 's kind of absurd .
It 's pretty simple .
Is it excruciatingly painful to the point of forcing someone to say something because of the pain ? "
McConnell leaned forward confidentially .
" Now , how descriptive do I want to be with you ?
I do n't want to tell you everything , and why is that ?
Look , these guys talk because , among other things , they 're scared . "
McConnell asserted that it was not difficult to evaluate the truthfulness of a confession , even a coerced one .
" And as soon as they start to talk we can tell in minutes if they are lying , " he said .
" One , you know a lot .
And you know when someone is giving you information that is not connecting up to what you know .
You also know when to use a polygraph . "
McConnell refused to specify what new methods had been approved for the C.I.A .
" There are techniques to get the information , and when they get the information it has saved lives , " he said vaguely .
" We have people walking around in this country that are alive today because this process happened . "
Could n't the information be obtained through other means ?
" No , " McConnell said .
'' You can say that absolutely . "
He again cited the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
" He would not have talked to us in a hundred years .
Tough guy .
Absolutely committed .
He had this mental image of himself as a warrior and a martyr .
No way he would talk to us . "
Among the things that Mohammed confessed to was the murder of Daniel Pearl .
And yet few people involved in the investigation of Pearl 's death believe that Mohammed had anything to do with the crime ; another man , Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh , was convicted of killing Pearl .
I mentioned McConnell 's hero , General Powell , whose disastrous speech to the United Nations , in February , 2003 , made the case to the world tor invading Iraq -- a case founded on faulty intelligence .
Part of Powell 's presentation was based on the testimony of Ibn al - Sheikh al - Libi , an Al Qaeda operative who was captured by Pakistani forces in December , 2001 .
The Pakistanis turned him over to the Americans .
According to Jack Cloonan , a former F.B.I. agent involved in the interrogation , Libi was providing useful and accurate intelligence until the C.I.A. took custody of him and placed him inside a plywood box for transport .
He was reportedly sent to Egypt and tortured .
( An agency spokesman said , " The C.I.A. does not transport individuals anywhere to be tortured . " )
Libi allegedly told his interrogators that the Iraqi military had trained two Al Qaeda associates in chemical and biological warfare .
This was the essence of Colin Powell 's claim : Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and was working with Al Qaeda .
Neither assertion was true .
How could we ever trust information obtained under torture when such methods had already led us into a catastrophic war ?
" Now , wait a minute , " McConnell said .
" You allege torture .
I do n't know .
Maybe it was .
I do n't know . "
He was n't in office at the time .
I asked what personal experiences informed his views .
McConnell recalled that before going to Vietnam he had participated in the military 's Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape program .
" You had to go through jungle training , get slapped around , knocked down , put in a box , physically abused , " he said .
" That 's to prepare you for what the enemy might do to you . "
McConnell was thrown into a covered pit with a snake .
There was no room to stand or move around .
" They would open up the thing and whack you a few times and close it down , " he said .
' They beat us up reasonably well . "
However , he knew that he was not going to die .
Waterboarding was not a part of the training when McConnell went through SERE , although it sometimes has been .
" You know what waterboarding is ? " he asked .
" You lay somebody on this table , or put them in an inclined position , and put a washcloth over their face , and you just drip water right here " -- he pointed to his nostrils .
" Try it !
What happens is , water will go up your nose .
And so you will get the sensation of potentially drowning .
That 's all waterboarding is . "
I asked if he considered that torture .
McConnell refused to answer directly , but he said , " My own definition of torture is something that would cause excruciating pain . "
Did waterboarding fit that description ?
Referring to his teen - age days as a lifeguard , he said , " I know one thing .
I 'm a water - safety instructor , but I can not swim without covering my nose .
I do n't know if it 's some deviated septum or mucus membrane , but water just rushes in . "
For him , he said , " waterboarding would be excruciating .
If I had water draining into my nose , oh God , I just can't imagine how painful !
Whether it 's torture by anybody else 's definition , for me it would be torture . "
I queried McConnell again , later , about his views on waterboarding , since this exchange seemed to suggest that he personaLly condemned it .
He rejected that interpretation .
" You can do waterboarding lots of different ways , " he said .
" I assume you can get to the point that a person is actually drowning . "
That would certainly be torture , he said .
That definition did n't seem very different from John Yoo's .
The reason that he could n't be more specific , McConnell said , is that " if it ever is determined to be torture , there will be a huge penalty to be paid for anyone engaging in it . "
In early September , German authorities arrested three Islamic radicals who were allegedly planning terrorist strikes against an American military base and the Frankfurt airport .
In a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , on September 10th , Senator Joseph Lieberman asked McConnell if the temporary FISA legislation that Congress had just passed contributed to the arrests of those men .
" Yes , sir , it did , " McConnell replied , explaining that , by monitoring the communications of the underground cell , the U.S. learned that the men had already obtained explosive liquids .
" The German authorities decided to move , " he said .
In fact , the information about the German cell had been obtained under the previous FISA law .
McConnell conceded the point two days later , after an article in the Times questioned his claim .
Later that month , McConnell appeared before congressional committees , seeking to make the provisional Protect America
Act a permanent Jaw .
He underscored
the need for FISA reform by citing the example of the three kidnapped American soldiers in Iraq .
( The body of one serviceman has since been discovered , the other two men remain missing . )
In a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee , McConnell asserted that beauracracy delays caused by requesting a FISA warrant had slowed the search in the critical moments after the soldiers ' capture .
The argument made a deep impression on the legislators .
Representative Heather Wilson , of New Mexico , said to McConnell , ' We had U.S. soldiers who were captured in Iraq by insurgents and . . . we were n't able to listen to their communications .
Is that correct , ?' she asked .
' If it was your kid , is that good enough ? '
I asked McConnell about the relevance of the soldiers ' kidnapping , since the FISA law allowed a three - day grace period , after the start of monitoring , to obtain a warrant .
" When people hear that story , they say , ' Well , do n't you have emergency authority ? ' " McConnell said , " Sure we do .
But the emergency authority still has to go through a process .
Somebody 's gotta approve it . "
He refused to be more specific about what , if anything , had prevented the intelligence community from monitoring the kidnappers immediately " If you understand it , and you write it down , then the bad guys understand it , " he said cryptically .
" I 've told you that this debate , this debate is going to cost American lives . "
He tapped the table for emphasis .
" This debate is going to cost American lives ! "
McConnell returned for another hearing on September 25th .
Many Democrats remained angry with him over his retreat from the compromise bill during the August FISA debate .
'' You gave assurances that were not fulfilled , and made agreements that were not kept , " Senator Jay Rockefeller , of West Virginia , had written him during the summer recess .
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , of Rhode Island , echoed these complaints .
" The stampede worked , " he wrote in a note .
'' You won .
But you did so at a substantial price , one that will be paid in rancor , suspicion , and distrust . "
Such emotions were very much in evidence as McConnell sat at the witness table in a wood - panelled hearing room .
The glowering face of Senator Patrick Leahy , of Vermont , loomed over the dais .
Before administering the oath to McConnell , he chided , " 1 hope we 'll not hear any more irresponsible rhetoric about congressional inquiries risking American lives . "
Many Democrats clearly regretted passing the temporary FISA bill .
Leahy , in his introduction , said that the act " provides no meaningful check by the FISA court , or by the Congress for that matter . "
Shortly after McConnell began his opening statement , Leahy testily cut him off .
He mentioned McConnell 's mistaken testimony about the relevance of the Protect America Act to the recent arrests in Germany .
" Now , I 'm just wondering , why did you testify to something that was false ? "
McConnell 's ears turned bright red .
He said that he had been referring to FISA in general , not the new reforms .
Leahy mentioned an attorney in his home state who is representing a client detained at the American - run prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
" He 's worried that his calls regarding his client are being monitored by the government , " Leahy said .
" He makes calls overseas , including to Afghanistan , on behalf of his client .
. . .
You can see why people worry . "
That month , McConnell 's office was forced to make another embarrassing disclosure .
Silvestre Reyes , the House Intelligence Committee chairman , demanded that the O.D.N.I. release a time line of the kidnapping of the American soldiers in Iraq .
McConnell had earlier testified that it took " somewhere in the neighborhood of twelve hours " to get the Attorney General to authorize an emergency FISA wiretap on insurgents .
The O.D.N.I.'s time line showed that the soldiers were kidnapped south of Baghdad on May 12th .
Over the next two days , intelligence officials picked up signals that they believed were coming from the kidnappers , and they received FISA authorization to target the communications of insurgents .
The record shows that the intelligence community had immediately assigned all available assets to search for the missing soldiers .
Then , on May 15th , at 10 A.M. , leaders from several key intelligence agencies met to discuss other options for " enhanced " surveillance .
( McConnell would not disclose what form of additional monitoring was being explored . )
By 1 P.M. , the N.S.A had determined that all the requirements for an emergency FISA authorization had been met .
But intelligence officials and lawyers continued to debate minute legal issues for four more hours .
At 5:15 P.M. , hours after the N.S.A. made its determination , and three days after the soldiers disappeared , Justice Department lawyers delayed the process further by deciding that they needed to obtain direct authorization from Attorney General Gonzales , who was in Texas making a speech .
Gonzales finally called back , at 7:18 P.M. , and within twenty minutes the enhanced surveillance began .
It was not the FISA law that retarded the intensified monitoring of the insurgents but , rather , internal wrangling between the Justice Department and the intelligence community .
That said , the confusion over the limits of American law when applied to a desperate situation in a foreign country underscored the need for legal clarity .
Despite his missteps , McConnell has so far succeeded in winning every important point in the FISA debate .
The bills that are now under consideration award the intelligence community nearly as much authority as it enjoyed under the President 's secret wiretapping program , although with somewhat more supervision and with the stipulation that warrants be obtained to monitor Americans inside the country .
The battle has harmed McConnell 's reputation , however .
" It is convenient to say , ' McConnell was a bad guy , McConnell broke faith ' -- it 's easy to say that because they lost ! "
McConnell said , " We went to the mat , and they lost . "
McConnell forced a debate upon the country that it was reluctant to have .
In agreeing to reform FISA along the lines that McConnell proposed , Congress has acknowledged that technology has created new tools for terrorists and made a salad out of existing laws that distinguish between foreign and domestic intelligence .
Instantaneous global communications , cell phones , the free flow of commercial data , an untethered Internet , and the unprecedented ease of travel have erased the once rigid distinction between what is native and what is foreign .
American law needed to reflect these changes .
But the reforms leave it up to the intelligence community to decide whether to monitor an American 's international communications without a warrant and what to do with that knowledge .
Moreover , by giving immunity to telecommunications companies for future actions , the legislation pressures them to turn over to the government any and all communication records , whenever they are asked for .
Unfortunately , intelligence officials have a poor record of safeguarding civil liberties within the country , nor do Americans have any obvious recourse if they learn that they have been spied upon .
When McConnell and I first met , he defended the President 's warrantless - wiretapping initiative .
To many , the program seemed to violate the spirit of FISA , because Americans were clearly involved in the conversations .
McConnell did n't see it that way .
" There 's no spying on Americans , " he had told me .
" The issue was if a known bad guy , somebody associated with Al Qaeda , calls into the United States , the President authorized the community to monitor that call .
If you have a different political point of view , you turn that into ' spying on Americans . ' "
" Let me make a disclosure , " I said .
" I have been monitored . "
I told him that , while I was researching " The Looming Tower , " a book about Al Qaeda , the F.B.I. had come to my house , in Austin , Texas , to ask about some calls that I had made from my home office .
I also said that a source in the intelligence community had read a summary of a telephone conversation that I had from my home with a source in Egypt .
" I 'm not surprised at that , " McConnell said .
" Because you were getting a phone call from some telephone number that 's associated with some known outfit -- O.K. , that 's monitored .
In my view , it should be . "
Actually , I had placed the call .
On another occasion , at McConnell 's prompting , I described more fully what had happened .
After I published a Profile of Ayman al - Zawahiri , the deputy of bin Laden , in this magazine , in February , 2002 , I was asked by one of his relatives , a respected architect in Cairo who had been a useful source , if I could learn whether all of Zawahiri 's children were dead .
An F.B.I. source told me that they were , and that there was no reason the family should n't know that .
I relayed the news to the architect .
( The F.B.I. official turned out to be wrong . )
Recently , a source in the intelligence community told me that a summary of that conversation was archived in an internal database .
I was surprised , because the FISA law stated that my part of the conversation should have been " minimized " -- redacted or rendered anonymous -- because I am an American citizen .
" He 's a terrorist , or he 's associated with terrorists , " McConnell said of my Egyptian contact .
" Now , if I 'm targeting , I 'm looking at his number .
If he places a call , I listen .
If he gets called , I listen .
I do n't know who is going to call him , but once I got it , I gotta deal with it .
Turns out it is Larry Wright .
You would have been reported as ' U.S. Person 1 . '
You would never have been identified , except if the F.B.I. learns that this unidentified U.S. person is talking to a known terrorist .
Then the F.B.I. would go in and request the identity of U.S. 1 . The N.S.A. would have to go through a process to determine if the request was legitimate .
So here 's what I think -- I 'm guessing .
You called a bad guy , the system listened , tried to sort it out , and they did an intel report because it had foreign - intelligence value .
That 's our mission . "
I then told him about the F.B.I. officials who visited my house .
" They were members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force , " I said .
They wanted to know about phone calls made to a solicitor in England who represented several jihadis I had interviewed for my book .
" The actual calls involved her telling me , ' Please do n't talk to my clients , ' " I said .
" Now if you ever became a target tor surveillance , they would go get a warrant and tap your telephone , " McConnell said .
" But they would have to have probable cause to do that . "
' What bothers me is that my daughter 's name came up in this , " I said .
The agents had told me they believed that she was the one making the calls .
That was ridiculous , hut it placed her on the F.B.I.'s link chart as an Al Qaeda connection .
" Her name is not on any of our phones , " I continued .
" So how did her name arise ;
" I do n't know , " McConnell admitted .
" Maybe you mentioned her name . "
" That troubles me , " I said .
" It may be troublesome , it may not be , " McConnell said .
" You do n't know . "
" That would make a great target , " McConnell observed in early October as his government jet passed over the two cooling towers of a power plant in Pennsylvania .
I had joined him on a trip to speak to a group of government contractors in Farmington , in the southwest corner of the state .
The twin stacks looked dismayingly vulnerable from the air , and I recalled that the 9/11 plotters had considered attacking nuclear plants before settling on the World Trade Center , the Pentagon , and the Capitol .
In July , the O.D.N.I. had released a National Intelligence Estimate titled " The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland . "
The N.I.E. , the most authoritative document that the intelligence community produces , represents the agencies ' coordinated judgments about the various perils the nation faces .
The reputation of the N .I.E. was seriously damaged , though , by the notoriously mistaken 2002 assessment that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
This N.I.E. had been in the works for three years , an indication of how cautious the community had become in issuing consequential new findings .
The new report declared that Al Qaeda was stronger than at any time since September 11th , and that it was " likely to continue to focus on prominent political , economic , and infrastructure targets with the goal of producing mass casualties , visually dramatic destruction , significant economic aftershocks , and / or fear among the U.S. population . "
It went on to say that the war in Iraq had helped the terrorist organization find new recruits .
The report reflects the continuing failure to capture or kill bin Laden and dismantle his organization .
" The trail is cold , " David Shedd , the deputy director of the O.D.N.I. for Policy , Plans and Requirements , admitted .
" It 's as hard a target as we 've ever faced , " McConnell bridled when I used the word " failure " to describe the bin Laden situation .
He said , ' We 're coming up on the sixth anniversary " -- of 9/11 -- " and we have not had a major terrorist event in the country . "
He claimed that the intelligence community had stopped " many , many " attacks on America in that span of time , but that most of those successful efforts were classified .
In late 2005 , the director of the C.I.A. at the time , Porter Goss , shuttered Alec Station , a counterterrorism unit devoted exclusively to tracking down bin Laden .
The C.I.A. now maintains that the unit was not actually disbanded but , rather , folded into the Counter - Terrorism Center .
And yet former agency officials criticize the absence of a clear leader in the fight against Al Qaeda .
" There 's a sense that there 's not a quarterback , " one of them told me .
" Part of me believes the people involved like this arrangement -- there 's no one really to blame . "
Bruce Riedel , a fellow at the Brookings Institution , who had a long career in the C.I.A. and also served in the current Administration as the senior director for Near East Affairs at the National Security Council , pointed to some recent successes : the capture in Afghanistan of Mir Amal Kansi , who murdered two C.I.A. employees outside the gates of the agency in January , 1993 , and the arrest in Pakistan of Ramzi Yousef , the mastermind behind the February , 1993 , bombing of the World Trade Center .
" They were in some ways harder targets , " Riedel said .
" The reason we have n't captured bin Laden , I think , is Iraq .
We took needed resources and transferred them out of the hunt for bin Laden . "
This happened , he told me , as early as the spring of 2002 , when the Bush Administration was already secretly preparing for war in Iraq .
" Who in American government is now responsible for the apprehension of Osama bin Laden ? " Riedel asked .
" There 's the director of the National Counter - Terrorism Center , but I doubt that 's his job .
The D.N.I .?
Who does the President think is responsible ? "
McConnell , when asked this question , said , " If the President picked a single person , he 'd probably point to Mike Hayden , the C.I.A. director .
At another level , he might say Secretary of Defense .
Depends on where bin Laden might be . "
And where was that ?
" He's in the border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan , " McConnell replied .
McConnell was referring , in part , to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , a mountainous expanse about the size of Massachusetts .
Between 2004 and 2006 , President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan struck deals with the chieftains inside the tribal areas which permitted them to police their own territory .
Al Qaeda and the Taliban quickly reconstituted themselves there .
Capturing bin Laden , then , would possibly mean invading Pakistan , with the likely consequence of destabilizing an already volatile country .
" You cannot indiscriminately attack a sovereign nation , " McConnell observed , though he promised that if American officials pinpoint bin Laden 's location " we 'll bring it to closure . "
For more than six years , Predator drones have crisscrossed the tribal areas , scanning the terrain for anyone who might resemble bin Laden .
In February , 2002 , a Predator near the border fired a Hellfire missile at a man because he was tall , killing him .
The United States has paid the Pakistani government more than ten billion dollars since September 11th for its help in tracking down bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders .
But for the past four years the special relationship with Pakistan has been unproductive ; in a recent interview with CBS , President Musharraf said of bin Laden , " We are not particularly looking for him . "
John McLaughlin , the former deputy director of the c.I.A. , told me , " It 's not too hard to figure out why we have n't gotten bin Laden .
We 're not there . "
Moreover , there is the quandary of what to do with bin Laden if he was actually captured .
Killing him would only insure his " martyrdom " and seal his legacy ; putting him on trial grants him a priceless venue for promoting his cause and invites acts of terror in response , including kidnappings designed to ransom the Al Qaeda leader .
Wayne Murphy , the assistant director of the F.B.I. for Intelligence , told me that the radicalization of young Muslims will continue , regardless of bin Laden 's mortal fate .
" In the end , I do n't know if the benefits of getting bin Laden would balance out , " he said .
" And I do n't know if it buys us anything .
Think about what we just went through with Saddam Hussein . "
There is another reason that we have n't captured bin Laden .
" Given the quality of Al Qaeda 's operational security , you need trusted people who can penetrate the organization , " Thomas Fingar , the deputy director of the O.D.N.I. for Analysis , said .
Yet the American intelligence community has traditionally been a white - male enclave .
Few agents can even pronounce Arabic names correctly .
On September 11th , there were only eight fluent Arabic - speaking agents in the F.B.I. ; now there are nine .
The U.S. government ranks language proficiency on a zero - to - five scale , in which five is the equivalent of a native speaker .
" Training a person up to a four - plus is almost impossible , " Philip Mudd , who is in charge of staffing and training two thousand analysts for the F.B.I.'s National Security Branch , told me .
" The people you want are first - generation immigrants .
But the security guys will say , ' Wait ! ' "
Although McConnell recognizes the need to hire Americans with native foreign - language skills , the Office of Management and Budget oversees the government security - clearance process , which takes months or even years to complete , especially for candidates who are intimately familiar with the cultures deemed most critical in terms of America 's safety .
" We have mounted an unprecedented effort to recruit affinity groups , " Michael Morell , the associate deputy director of the C.I.A. , told me .
The agency recently helped sponsor the Arab International Festival , in Dearborn , Michigan , the heart of the American -. Arab community .
But few of those possible recruits are willing to put their lives on hold for a year or more as they await clearance .
Michael Hayden , the C.I.A. director , told me that he could circumvent the security backlog in special cases , and he has done so on several occasions .
McConnell , upon landing in Farmington , delivered his speech before the government contractors .
" There was a study done in 1955 , " he told them .
" One conclusion it came to was that it was an abomination that the government takes fifteen months to clear someone !
I 'm happy to tell you we got that down to eighteen months . "
The contractors laughed in recognition .
" When I agreed to take the D.N.I. post , the first surprise was being told , ' Fill out the form , ' " McConnell continued .
" I 've been cleared for forty years !
Then the agent shows up .
He wants to know in am a Communist and do I advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. "
That experience prompted McConnell to reflect on what causes members of the intelligence community to turn into traitors .
" Look back at all the spies we 've had in our history , " he said .
" About a hundred and thirty .
How many did it for money ?
A hundred and twenty - eight . "
He contrasted the government 's security - clearing process with the vetting that multinational banks do for American and foreign employees -- the process can take less than ten working days .
The opportunities for fraud at such a hank are obvious , he noted : " If I can slow down the movement of money by one single second , I can make millions through arbitrage . "
How do companies prevent such losses ?
" Every keystroke can be monitored . "
McConnell advocates a simplified clearance procedure that will take a month or less .
Under his plan , it will be much easier for first - and second - generation Americans to enter the intelligence community .
The trade - off will be that they will be subjected to what he calls " life - cycle monitoring " -- that is , constant surveillance .
Flying back to Washington after the speech in Pennsylvania , McConnell said , " I 'm trying to change the rules , saying if you want to be in this community , here are the conditions of employment . "
He mentioned Jonathan Pollard , a former civilian analyst for U.S. Naval Intelligence , who pleaded guilty to espionage in 1986 .
" He transferred reams and reams and reams of data to the Israelis .
Well , in today 's world that stuff is not sitting on a shelf somewhere -- it 's in a database .
So if you want to transfer it you 've got to print it or get an electronic copy or whatever .
That 's what I mean by monitoring . "
I asked McConnell if he believed that Al Qaeda was really the greatest threat America faces .
" No , no , no , not at all , " he said .
" Terrorism can kill a lot of people , but it can't fundamentally challenge the ability of the nation to exist .
Fascism could have done that .
Communism could have .
I think our issue going forward is more engagement with the world in terms of keeping it on a reasonable path , so another ism does n't come along and drive it to one extreme or another .
And we have to have some balance in terms of equitable distribution of wealth , containment of contagious disease , access to energy supplies , and development of free markets .
There are national - security ramifications to global warming . "
He looked down at the patchwork quilt of the Pennsylvania countryside .
His thoughts quickly turned back to terrorism .
" One of the things I worry about most would be something like a pandemic , particularly if it could be weaponized , like avian flu , " he continued .
" You could turn that into a human virus .
You could have fifty million to five hundred million deaths . "
In 2005 , the intelligence community informed President Bush that the greatest danger in the Middle East came from Iran .
An N.I.E. on the subject declared that Iran intended to build a nuclear weapon .
Some of that information came from a purloined laptop containing drawings of an implosion device and information about the history of the Iranian nuclear effort .
But there was little supporting evidence , and the President was frustrated that reliable intelligence was so difficult to obtain .
Soon afterward , the C.I.A. created an Iran Operations Division .
There was already an Iran mission manager in the O.D.N.I. , whose job was to coordinate all the available resources in the community .
Those efforts were being folded into a new N.I.E. on Iran , which had been demanded by Congress ; the report , expected last spring , was mysteriously delayed .
In mid-November , McConnell said that he did not intend to declassify any part of the N.I.E .
On occasion , the key judgments of N.I.E. reports have been made public , though they are generally kept secret so that analysts can present their findings with candor .
" But here 's the real reason , " McConnell said .
" If I have to inform the public , I am informing the adversary . "
He used the example of code breakers in the Second World War .
" On Nebraska Avenue , where the Department of Homeland Security is located now , there was a girls ' school .
The nation recruited many young women gifted in science and math to that girls ' schooL
They were brought in and told , ' If you ever tell anybody what you are doing , you will go to prison for the rest of your life . ' "
The women operated the machinery that deciphered the German naval code , shaving months off the war .
" Now , that is secrecy in its most powerful form , " McConnell said .
" Changed the course of history , I would argue , for the good . "
Secrecy imposes its own risks , however .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , in 1991 , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , who was a distinguished social scientist before becoming a U.S. senator from New York , sought to understand why the American intelligence community had failed to anticipate the event .
Examining the history of the Cold War , Moynihan saw a series of misguided adventures steered by incorrect or poorly understood intelligence -- from the purported " missile gap " that never existed to the confident assumption that the Cuban people would rise up against Fidel Castro following an American - sponsored invasion .
In such instances , the community supported its findings with National Intelligence Estimates or authoritative studies that led American policymakers astray .
In a 1998 book titled " Secrecy , " Moynihan wrote that " too much of the information was secret , not sufficiently open to critique by persons outside government . "
Having served on the Senate Intelligence Committee , he had seen how the community hoarded secrets and overvalued them to the point of excluding common sense .
He spoke of a " culture of secrecy " that inevitably gave rise to conspiracy thinking and loyalty tests , and recommended that the C.I.A. be shut down .
McConnell strongly disputed Moynihan 's analysis .
Moreover , he told me that he intended to prosecute anyone who leaks classified information , such as the Iran N.I.E .
That has rarely been done in the past , largely because a trial would have the unwanted consequence of exposing secret sources and methods .
" I think we ought to step up and pay the price of going through an investigation , an indictment , and a trial -- and , hopefully , from my point of view , a conviction , " he said .
Like many reporters , I 've received classified information in the past ; it was often full of errors .
" Because it was secret , it had never been tested , " I said .
' The secrecy was actually self - destructive . "
" I disagree with that completely , " McConnell said .
" There 's as much misinformation and trash in the system on the outside as there is on the inside . "
Many newspaper articles about him , he noted , contained errors of fact and of interpretation .
" So it does n't surprise me that you would see a classified document that had some incorrect information in it . "
" You 'd want to prosecute a guy that leaked something to me ? "
" Absolutely , " McConnell said .
" He ought to be put in the slammer . "
" You 'd want to prosecute me as well ? "
" Depending on what you did with it . "
And yet , three weeks after our discussion , McConnell abruptly decided to declassify the key judgments of the N.I.E. , which was titled " Iran : Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities . "
Among the revelations was that Iran had decided in the fall of 2003 to halt a secret program to design nuclear weapons .
This finding reversed the 2005 assessment that had portrayed the Iranian regime as determined to build a nuclear arsenaL
If the former document had supported the Bush Administration 's aggressive posture toward Iran , the new one introduced a confounding note of uncertainty .
" We assess with moderate confidence that Tehran had not restarted its nuclear program as of mid-2007 , " the N.I.E. stated , in the probabilistic language of intelligence .
" But we do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons . "
The report came at a time when the Bush Administration was gathering international support at the United Nations to strengthen sanctions against the Iranian regime -- an effort that appears to have been quietly tabled .
John Bolton , the former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N , told the German magazine Der Spiegel that the N.I.E. was " politics disguised as intelligence , " and that the release of the document amounted to a " quasi- putsch " by the intelligence community .
Many Democratic political figures in Washington , however , welcomed McConnell 's decision .
" The key judgments show that the intelligence community has learned its lessons from the Iraq debacle , " Senator Rockefeller stated .
" This demonstrates a new willingness to question assumptions internally , and a level of independence from political leadership that was lacking in the recent past . "
I asked McConnell what had changed his mind .
" The fear that , if we did n't release it , it would leak , and the Administration at that point would be accused of hiding information , " he said .
He had a personal conflict as well : the new information was at odds with his own testimony about Iran before Congress , and with remarks that he had made in a background press briefing .
He knew how that might look if he kept the intelligence classified .
The N.I.E. had been nearly completed when , in July , new information caused the intelligence community to reevaluate its findings .
Iranian nuclear officials were overheard complaining about the suspension of the military program .
Analysis of photographs taken during a 2005 visit to Iran 's uranium - enrichment plant , in Natanz , suggested that it was not designed for the high level of enrichment required to make nuclear weapons .
" We had to stop and consider the new information , run it to ground , compare it to hundreds of sources of data , " McConnell said .
" Does it correlate ?
Is it misinformation ?
Is this a counterintelligence plan ? "
He compared the process to a trial : the data are evaluated in terms of the level of confidence the community places in their veracity .
' We also examine what 's missing , " McConnell continued .
" What are the gaps ?
What would let us know more ? "
From July to late November , Iran analysts vetted the information .
" Every source is challenged , " McConnell said .
" We do alternative analysis .
We take a set of smart people and say , ' All right , your mission is to figure out why we got this wrong .
What could be an alternative ? '
We finish that , we have a Red Team .
Red Team will attack and see if there are weaknesses .
Did we challenge our hypotheses in the right way ?
Did we put too much emphasis on some evidence ? "
All this was done in the reflected glare of the failures of the past .
" This community is consumed with not repeating the mistakes that were made in 2002 , " McConnell said .
" I will tell you , the tradecraft and the professionalism that went into this N.I.E. was probably the best we have ever known . "
While the intelligence community was digesting the new intelligence , the Administration continued its belligerent rhetoric toward Iran .
In October , Vice - President Cheney warned , " We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon , " and President Bush invoked the spectre of a Third World War if Iran continued its supposed secret weapons program .
Bush later said that McConnell had told him in August that there was new intelligence about Iran : " He did n't tell me what the information was .
He did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze . "
Later , Dana Perino , the White House press secretary , admitted that the President was also told in the August meeting that Iran might have halted its nuclear - weapons program .
" The President could have been more precise in that language , " Perino told reporters .
" But the President was being truthful . "
McConnell wondered why , if Iran had a nuclear - weapons program up until the fall of 2003 , it suddenly placed it on hold .
He said , " They 're still pursuing fissile material , they 're still building and testing and weaponizing missiles , so why did they do it ? "
He pointed to the invasion of Iraq earlier that year .
" Although we do n't have senior Iranian officials telling us , ' We did this because we were worried about where you crazy Westerners were going to go with this invasion , ' I believe , as an analyst , that certainly had some bearing on the decision . "
On Wednesday , November 28th , McConnell went to the White House for the daily briefing and shared the N.I.E.'s key judgments with President Bush .
He took with him the three principal analysts who had done the assessment .
Cheney was also present , as were members of the National Security Council .
" We handed the President the key judgments to read , which he skimmed through , " McConnell said .
" You could see him thinking about what this meant , how do we manage this information . "
Secretary Gates was present at the meeting .
" Mike was a little uneasy about releasing it , " he said .
" He does n't want his analysts to write key judgments with the notion that they are going to be declassified . "
Gates said that he was strongly in favor of releasing the findings , and , in the end , the decision was unanimous .
The decision to declassify the key judgments was painful not only for the Administration but also for the intelligence community , both because the new N.I..E. refuted a previous assessment and because it inevitably raised the question of whether this one was any more reliable .
McConnell also worried that the effect of the release would be to diminish the serious threat that he believes Iran still poses .
" What 's the difference between being on hold and not being on hold ? " he asked rhetorically .
" The Supreme Leader could say , ' Turn it back on . ' "
When we last spoke , McConnell said , " There 's no doubt in this observer 's mind that Iran is on the path to get a nuclear weapon .
It will force an arms race in the region . "
That would place the U.S. in a dangerous spot , for it stands as the security guarantor for many major oil producers .
I asked McConnell if he believed that , in releasing the key judgments of the N.I.E. , he had compromised sources and methods , which was the reason he had given previously for withholding the document .
" Our job is to steal the secrets of foreign governments , or foreign terrorist organizations , and so the more they know about the effectiveness of our tradecraft the more difficult it 's going to be for us , " he said .
" I think putting it out was the right thing , but , as the leader of this community , I 've got to tell you , we 're going to need better information in the future .
We got to go back and verify , ' Did they re-start it ? '
For the community I represent , I just made our life a lot harder . "
The clock on his desk showed that he had four hundred and two days , fifteen hours , seventeen minutes , and forty - five seconds left .

Michelle Obama : ' Black Americans will wake up and get it ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday November 12 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton 's lead among African Americans voters , who consistently favor the former first lady to Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) in presidential primary polling , is just a temporary phenomenon , according to Obama 's wife , Michelle .
" First of all , I think that that 's not going to hold , " Mrs. Obama said of Clinton 's current numbers in an interview with MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski .
" I 'm completely confident . "
Acknowledging a certain reluctance in the African American community to back her husband for president , she said that support would come -- but it would take time .
" Black Americans will wake up and get it , " Obama said .
" But what we 're dealing with in the black community is just the natural fear of possibility .
When I look at my life , the stuff that we 're seeing in these polls is played out my whole life : always been told by somebody that I 'm not ready , you know , I can't do something , my scores were n't high enough . "
Obama pointed to a specific skepticism about her husband 's chances to win the presidency among blacks , who she says have been repeatedly told by society that there are limitations on what an African American can achieve .
" There 's always that doubt in the back of the minds of people of color .
People who 've been oppressed and have n't been given real opportunities that you never really -- that you believe that somehow someone is better than you , " she continued . " Deep down inside you doubt whether you can do it , because that 's all you 've been told is ' no , wait . '
That 's all you hear . "
When Brzezinski related a personal anecdote about an African American flight attendant who had said Sen.
Obama could n't win " because he 's black , " the candidate 's wife sympathized .
" That 's right .
That 's the psychology that 's going on in our heads , in our souls , and I understand it , " she said .
" I know where it comes from .
You know , and I think that is one of the horrible legacies of racism and discrimination and oppression . "
Obama 's comments to Brzezinski were part of a longer MSNBC interview excerpted on the network 's Morning Joe program .
Following the clip , co-host Willie Geist took issue with with the remarks .
" She says black America is going to wake up .
On the other hand , there is the chance that black America just likes Hillary Clinton better and they 're voting for her , " said Geist .
" Black people are n't obligated to vote for Barack Obama . "
A recent Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll shows Obama trailing Clinton by nine percentage points -- 46 % to 37 % -- among blacks .
The following video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast on November 12 , 2007 .
A few years ago , Oprah sold her autobiography to a major New York publisher .
You can imagine the delight among booksellers .
At the last minute , she backed out , never really explaining why .
I wonder how many books she would have sold ?
A lot , certainly , but as many as the titles she regularly promotes ?
Here is a fascinating statistic :
Last month , I posted excerpts from my new book .
I also wrote a glowing post about Garr ’s new book on presentations .
Guess what ?
My stats show that I sold more copies of Garr ’s book than mine .
The truism of the web : people talking about you is far more effective than talking about yourself .
Clearly , just about everyone who reads my blog enjoys my writing .
You ’d think that a significant percentage would then hustle over to buy a copy on Amazon the moment they heard about it .
But , just as Oprah is at her best when she ’s talking about somebody else ’s book , something funny happens when a blogger talks about his work .
Cory and Mark both have terrific books out .
And as co-editors on the world ’s most popular blog , you ’d think that they could use boingboing to sell a ton of books .
But it does n’t happen .
Lucky for bloggers , if you write a good book , a few other bloggers will write about you and then the sales start happening .
Once again , what do you know , it takes patience .
It ’s not a direct , first - order promotional thing , the way old media is .
Instead , it ’s one thing causing something else , which leads to a conversation and then , maybe , a sale .
Interesting irrelevant aside : how come books get blurbed and promoted by other authors , but movies do n’t get blurbed and promoted by other directors and actors ?
Solar car could hit market soon
NOT A RACER
Although the model is inspired by a National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences race car , the market version will only be able to travel up to 70 kph
By Meggie Lu / STAFF REPORTER
For commuters worried about rising fuel prices , greenhouse gas emissions and the headache of finding parking , a compact solar - powered vehicle may be the answer -- and could be on the market within a year .
" At a time when carbon emission reduction and fighting global warming are top priorities of governments and people , a wholly solar - powered car would offer a good alternative for the green - minded , " the car 's research and development team leader , Ay Herchang ( 艾和昌 ) told the Taipei Times in a phone interview .
A prototype of the car was inspired by the Apollo , a solar car Ay and a team at National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences built to compete in races such as the Australian World Solar Challenge ( WSC ) , the professor of engineering said .
A drawing of the twin - seat , solar - powered vehicle developed by National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences .
GRAPHIC COURTESY OF NATIONAL KAOHSIUNG UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCI
" As [ our team ] has done quite well in the past 10 years at international solar car races -- this year ranking second out of more than 50 cars at the WSC -- we decided two years ago to broaden our advanced solar technology applications and make a car for the consumer market , " he said .
The WSC , which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year , requires participants to race solar - powered vehicles 3,000 km across various Australian terrains , he said .
Several obstacles had to be overcome to turn the one - seater solar race car capable of speeds up to 145 kph , into a domestic consumer vehicle , he said .
" With added seats and passengers , the car was bigger and heavier , which compromised its speed , " he said , adding that driving on the nation 's highways would be out of the picture .
A light - weight model is best ,
Ay said , as it requires less battery power to maintain speed .
When there is a lack of sunlight , the car runs on a solar - charged battery .
The final product of the team 's tweaking is a 250 kg two to three - seater that travels at up to 70 kph and comes with a price tag of about NT $ 800,000 , he said .
At 3 m by 1.3 m , it 's easy to park , too .
The battery can be charged with just a few hours sunlight and can power the car for three hours .
On vehicle safety , Ay said : " Parts of the car will be made with Nomex honeycomb , a material widely used in aircraft and aerospace components for its high strength , excellent impact and fire resistance as well as its light weight . "
Though solar - powered city roamers have already debuted on some European markets , the made - in - Taiwan version is half the weight and costs half the price , Ay said .
" Moreover , in Taiwan , with our abundance of sunlight , this car is a viable solution for us to save gas and the environment , " Ay said .
Hubbard 's Church ' Unconstitutional ' Germany Prepares to Ban Scientology
Germany 's interior ministers announced Friday that they consider Scientology to be unconstitutional .
They have asked the country 's domestic intelligence agency to prepare a dossier on the organization 's activities with a view to ban it next year .
Joined to a regular TGV train , this iDTGV , playing on the French word " idee " or " idea " , is operated privately , but owned by the national SNCF rail company and designed as a laboratory for future rail travel .
The iDTGV was launched in December 2004 and offers cheaper tickets , Internet reservations , and services aimed at pleasing passengers , including a soon - to - be launched party train , to help the SNCF better compete with low cost airlines .
In its early days the iDTGV angered the French rail unions who successfully fought to ensure that , although a subsidiary , the service still uses SNCF staff and equipment .
Sitting on a bar stool and watching the autumn - coloured countryside rush by , 27 - year - old Marine Oz , from Marseille , chose to sit upstairs on the double - decker train , which is split into two areas to accommodate different types of travellers .
Downstairs is peaceful with no noisy chat or mobile phones .
The top deck is designed for entertainment and interaction between passengers , including a service that helps them meet each other en route .
As the bar fills up , some passengers , many of them young professionals , browse a catalogue of DVDs and video games available for rental , while others peruse magazines .
Nearby , a couple of young workers from an AIDS charity set up a stall .
" What 's the difference between this bar and those on other trains ? " says Patrice , one of the conductors .
" Well , people are more open .
We sometimes have concerts on board too . "
Since the start , iDTGVs , which now travel to around 20 French towns and cities , have hosted a string of events , from food and wine tastings to massages and cabarets .
They have shuttled some three million passengers across the country and management claims to have helped the national rail operator inch up its market share , even though the traffic only represents a fraction of all TGV activities .
While the cheap , self - printed tickets - which are checked before boarding instead of en route as on normal trains - are the iDTGV 's main draw , other initiatives have had varying degrees of success .
A website designed to introduce passengers to each other to set up meetings or car shares , or discuss common interests during the journey , has been slow to take off .
Although an average of eight people register and contact each other before boarding each train , conductors report that seats reserved for the service are always empty .
Pierre Frederic Imbert , 34 , who works in Marseille , says he was tempted to sign up .
" But there 's a risk , because the journey lasts three hours so if you find someone strange you 're in trouble . "
iDTGV management maintain they have had positive feedback and dismiss any teething problems as part of the experiment .
Initially available for a small fee , the service was recently made free of charge to attract more users .
Meanwhile , another new project may help passengers actually find each other once they are on board : an intranet service for online chat and downloading music and information on the train 's destinations .
As the iDTGV slides through the French countryside towards the Mediterranean , travelling at around 300 kilometres ( 186 miles ) per hour and joined to a regular TGV , many comment that the conductors appear more friendly than on normal trains .
They carry electronic devices to identify passengers and their seat numbers , and help people to change seats if they wish .
They also upgrade passengers to first class on their birthdays , and make sure the calm areas remain quiet .
Jean , a conductor , says he enjoys the different atmosphere and appreciates the absence of ticket checks .
But he is less enthusiastic about some of the new proposals , including plans for a slow , cheap overnight train , without sleeping berths but carrying a DJ , to take partygoers to several seaside destinations from Paris , due to be launched in April 2008 .
" We 're afraid that they 'll be loads of youngsters smoking , drinking , taking drugs and trashing the expensive train seats , " he says as the train pulls into the platform .
Back in Paris , management dismiss the workers ' fears .
Ludovic Bonnet , communications and marketing director , underlines that the industry needs to experiment and evolve to prepare for when Europe 's national rail networks open up to competition in around 2010 .
Giving passengers choices about how they will travel is the key to keeping them happy , he says .
" The problem with communal transport is that it 's communal .
Sometimes it's a good surprise to meet the others you are travelling with , sometimes it 's not . "

[ IFP received this email update from Brad Newsham – founder of the ‘ Beach Impeach ’ projects ]
A Short Sweet Impeachment Story
Every day I try to do one thing , usually small , to forward
impeachment .
Here ’s the story of yesterday :
My friend Cynthia Papermaster sent me an email with the names and
phone numbers ( below ) of the six Democratic members of the House
Judiciary subcommittee who have waffled on Kucinich ’s “ Impeach Cheney ”
bill .
It ’s been sitting in their subcommittee since last April .
So I
started dialing .
Each time a staffer answered I would say something
like this : “ I ’m calling to ask ( the congressperson ) to please move
forward on the Impeach Cheney bill .
You do know the one I ’m talking
about ? ”
All six staffers had near - identical responses : “ I certainly do ! ”
Me : “ You ’ve been getting a lot of calls on this ? ”
Them : “ Oh , I think it ’s plenty safe to say that , Yes , we have indeed
been getting a LOT of calls on this . ”
Me : “ Is ( the congressperson ) going to move on it ? ”
Them : “ Well , s/he ’s certainly listening to all the input . ”
The sixth call , to the Honorable Melvin Watt of North Carolina , had a
surprise ending .
When I asked the staffer if he ’d been getting a lot
of calls , he said :
“ In all the time I ’ve been here , we have never gotten as many calls
on any subject as we ’re getting on this one .
It is nonstop ! ”
“ Really ! ”
“ Oh , I ca n’t tell you … ”
Me : “ So , is there any hope ? ”
“ You know , ” he said , “ I wish I had something to tell you .
But I ’m
really just a cog in the wheel . ”
“ Oh , I ’m a cog in the wheel , too , ” I said .
And then , since we were
now just two humans talking , I just threw this out there : “ You know , I
live out in the San Francisco Bay Area , and last year I organized four
‘ Beach Impeach ’ events where … ”
“ You ’re kidding ! ” he said .
“ I ’m sitting here right this minute
looking at a picture of one of them ! ”
“ Really ! ”
You spend as much time and energy and money as I did , as we
all did , on making those events happen , and in the end it ’s easy to
think they made no difference at all .
And then this !
My whole body was
instantly tingling .
“ Oh , that ’s fantastic ! ”
He says , “ Oh , yeah — this is great , man !
That ’s a lot of people —
you organized that ? ”
“ I did .
How ’d you get the picture ? ”
“ Well , I first saw it in the news way back when .
And now people send
us the postcards all the time .
I ’ve got a couple more here on my desk
somewhere .
People send them with their emails , too .
Someone sent us a
blowup photo , and that ’s what I ’m looking at right now . ”
Our conversation went on for a while , but that was the important
part :
You never know .
You never know what sort of ripples , what sort
of difference all our little ( and big ) acts will create .
Although it
can often seem that we ’re nothing but a bunch of crazy dreamers , and
although it seems that the media has been aggressively ignoring us for
years now , there are a LOT of us out here , and if we just keep it
up …
Less than two years before I watched Nixon ’s helicopter fly away
from the White House for the very last time , he was reelected in a
historic landslide .
You just simply never know .
( If you ’ve got a few
minutes to make calls , or even a single call , the numbers are below . )
Keep the faith .
Beach Impeach 5 is happening on April 26 , at Ocean Beach in San
Francisco . Helicopter (s ) overhead at 11 a.m. sharp .
Details being
arranged .
Stay tuned .

Counterterrorist Shannen Rossmiller monitors jihadist chatter online . *
Photo : Todd Hido * " Look , " Shannen Rossmiller says , pointing at her computer screen .
She 's in an online chat room , and the name Terrorist11 has just popped up .
" He 's one of the more popular guys . "
To get here , she signed onto alfirdaws.org .
Then she clicked into the Paradise Jihadist Supporters Forum .
The site is in Arabic , so she turns on the basic Google text translator that renders the discussion into clumsy phrases .
" Take a charge with caution , " warns one jihadist posting , " this thread is monitored . "
Meanwhile , Terrorist11 is praising the 2004 Madrid train bombings and posting videos of the dead for other jihadist wannabes to enjoy .
Old news , terrorism - wise .
Rossmiller flips her blond hair .
She looks bored .
" They are just flaming , ranting and raving , " she says .
" Do you want to see some blood and guts ?
Let 's go find it . "
In her small , one - chair home office in Montana , I sit beside Rossmiller on a little tiled table normally reserved for a lamp .
Outside , the vistas stretch across Big Sky Country to the Elk Horn Ridge Mountains .
Inside , Rossmiller shows me what she does as perhaps America 's most accomplished amateur terrorist hunter .
We 're monitoring jihadist chatter , and she has warned me that we 're not likely to come across anything too dangerous .
Home - brew cyber - counterterrorism , it turns out , is a lot like most police work — weeks of tedious beat patrols punctuated by occasional bursts of excitement .
And the section of the Internet populated by terrorists is a lot like the rest of the Internet — only instead of commenting on , say , a video of 1,500 prison inmates performing Michael Jackson 's " Thriller , " everyone 's chatting about the death of Americans .
Rossmiller hopes to find some people discussing an actual upcoming plot and then join the conversation .
But it 's mostly just idle banter today .
We come upon a thread in which participants are discussing a Baghdad sniper who has been killing US soldiers .
" They call him Juba , " Rossmiller says .
She suspects there is n't a single sniper but rather a cell , and that the thread is designed to create an identity for Juba , a hero who might attract others to the cause .
It 's hard for me to pay attention to Rossmiller .
I 'm distracted by a little GIF that pops up at the end of one person 's posts .
It 's a 1.5 - second cartoon of an American GI poking up from the hatch of a tank , getting shot in the head , and slumping over dead .
Rossmiller is rushing to the next page , but I ask her to scroll back so I can stare at the clip again .
The little GIF 's repetition has an adolescent playfulness to it , so loopy and horrifyingly goofy , so Internet -y , I can't stop staring .
Hatch , headshot , slump .
Hatch , headshot , slump .
Hatch , headshot , slump .
Hatch , headshot , slump .
Shannen Rossmiller grew up on a Montana wheat farm .
She is blond and slim :
When she was a cheerleader in high school , she typically wound up at the top of the human pyramid .
Her husband runs a wireless Internet company , and they have three children .
After college , she was appointed a local judge in a small Montana town , where she and her family still live and which she 'd rather not identify .
Although she 's happy to talk about what she does , she fears for her safety :
She has received phone threats , and her car got shot up once , an incident she attributes directly to her counterterrorism work .
Now 38 , Rossmiller spends her weekdays in Helena working in the civil litigation department of the attorney general 's office .
She gets up at 4 am and does her hunting predawn .
On the weekends , she tracks down killers while relaxing in the bosom of her family .
Some days she 's at the computer when her kids — two young daughters and a son who graduated from high school earlier this year — wake up .
" I 'll say , ‘ You get your own breakfast ; there 's a Jimmy Dean sausage in the kitchen . '
Meanwhile , back in Kurachi ... "
She has long had an attraction to criminally deviant minds .
In the seventh grade , Rossmiller made a poster for school that explored the " mind of the serial killer , " from Vlad the Impaler to Ed Gein , who had a habit of wearing the tanned skins of his victims .
Now she can pursue her childhood obsession with a utilitarian twist :
She goes right inside the minds of killers , and , if it works out , she catches them .
Photo : Todd HidoRossmiller developed her remarkable talent for chatting up terrorists after September 11 , when she started going into online forums and cajoling valuable information from other visitors .
She has passed along numerous case files to federal authorities .
Her information has led US forces abroad to locate Taliban cells in Afghanistan , discover a renegade stinger - missile merchant in Pakistan , and help another foreign government identify a ring of potential suicide bombers .
She has also assisted in nabbing two domestic would - be terrorists and seen them both convicted of felonies : National guardsman Ryan Anderson received five concurrent life sentences , and Michael Reynolds , convicted in July and awaiting sentencing , faces a similar fate .
Timothy Fuhrman , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Salt Lake City office , says Rossmiller was " instrumental in the successful outcome of those cases . "
Rossmiller succeeds by exploiting a fundamental flaw in al Qaeda 's famously decentralized organization .
The absence of a strict hierarchy makes it pretty easy for a cunning person to mix among the terrorists .
So she poses as a potential al Qaeda soldier looking for like - minded comers .
She creates multiple characters and uses her older and more respected personae to invite the new ones into private forums .
There are other self - taught counterterrorists like her , but they tend to translate and discuss , lurk and report .
Rossmiller works the terrorism boards as if she were playing a complex videogame .
Her characters come complete with distinct personalities and detailed biographies that are as richly conceived as any protagonist on an HBO series .
She keeps copies of everything , time - stamps files , and takes screenshots .
She has an Excel spreadsheet that details the 640 people with whom she has had contact on these boards since 2002 .
Rossmiller admits that all this makes for a bit of a weird hobby .
But not only has she gotten an amygdala 's - eye view of America 's adversaries , she may well have pioneered a new form of intelligence - gathering .

Like most Americans , Rossmiller woke up on September 11 , 2001 , and could n't believe what she was seeing on TV .
She could barely get her kids ready for school .
At work , the television was on all day , drawing her in .
That night , she decided to relax in the family 's Jacuzzi .
She slipped and fell hard to the ground , knocking her head .
When Rossmiller came to , she had an excruciating hairline fracture in her pelvis .
After a stay at the hospital , she spent six weeks in bed at home , flat on her back , watching nonstop cable news about the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the threats from a new kind of terrorism .
" The painkillers and the muscle relaxers affect your mentality .
You 're in a depressed state anyway .
I think that contributed a lot to how I got radicalized . "
Rossmiller admits to a certain tunnel vision when she decides she 's going to master some field of knowledge — her husband , she says , sees her as a kind of idiot savant .
Every time she heard a scholar quoted on television , she 'd ask her husband to fetch their book .
" I bought The Koran for Dummies , and then I bought a Koran . "
As her health returned , she read textbooks on Arabic , took a nine - week online language course , and began quietly lurking around jihadist Web sites .
" I just clicked around and looked at the pictures , " Rossmiller says .
At first she was at the mercy of mediocre shareware translators .
" The stupid machine would translate sentences like ‘ Respect my mustache !
I have a happy mustache ! ' " she says , bursting into a fit of giggles .
But then she started her online courses and bought high - quality translation software .
In February 2002 , as her Arabic improved and she became more comfortable with her software skills , she wrote herself a goal : " I was going to try to talk to these people as someone not me . "
She quickly encountered technical obstacles :
For instance , it would be easy for someone to figure out that her email was originating in the US , specifically in Montana .
So she invested in a proxy server application , which creates a fake IP address off a known IP server someplace real .
That way , Rossmiller could send her email as someone living , say , in Yemen , and anyone closely examining the email header would see that the message did appear to come from Yemen .
Rossmiller researched the area she was purporting to be emailing from and learned the neighborhood so she could casually mention a nearby restaurant or mosque , sometimes even the name of a local imam .
Rossmiller registered on several major sites , including arabforum.net .
" I just wanted to see if I could post something in Arabic and have them respond .
Someone would say a car bomb went off and killed three infidels and praise be Allah .
And every Joe was going , ‘ Praise be Allah . '
So I added a simple greeting and said , ‘ Praise be Allah . ' "
No one outed her , so she decided to add a few words of what she considered to be plausible terrorist chatter .
" I went to bed but could n't sleep , " she says .
" So , finally , I went to see if I got a nibble .
My thought was that I would get around 10 to 12 replies , but it was a total dud . "
She squints a bit while admitting this , as if embarrassed that she did n't succeed in her first spin as a terrorist .
She began making her postings more sophisticated , and she started watching overseas news programs on cable TV .
She worked references to local events into her messages , and suddenly her postings began to draw comments .
And she quickly mastered the rather baroque salutations that open many missives in Islamic culture .
For instance , when she first wrote to Ryan Anderson , her character decreed how " Allah is ever forgiving of the faithful and most beneficent and merciful .
It is never too late to feel the call of the will of Allah . "
Rossmiller took language from Mohammed Atta 's favorite poem and included it in some of her flowery posts .
She got a lot of hits and replies , so she 's been laying down the purple prose ever since .
" I would change and tailor it to what I needed , " she says .
She knew that Arabic communication and speech often quote the Koran , so she would page through it , learning the stories and noting suitable verses .
" These are handy little things to adjust for different occasions , " she says , " like Hallmark cards for jihad . "
In May 2002 , Rossmiller saw a post from a man in Pakistan who said he had access to Stinger missiles he wanted to sell .
She wrote back to the person she now identifies in her files as Rocket Man , posing as someone interested in purchasing his wares .
After a few exchanges , she abruptly threatened to cut off contact unless he provided proof he was who he said he was .
" And I 'll be gol - danged if a few days later , a nice little zip file appears with pictures of him sitting on some crates . "
The inventory numbers of the Stingers were clearly visible .
Rossmiller then realized that her hobby had turned into something that needed attention from the FBI .
Rossmiller put a file together and drove to the FBI office in Great Falls , about an hour away from her home .
But she wound up just circling the building and never going in .
" I chickened out , " she says .
" I thought they 'd lock me up .
So I put all the information into little digital files and sent them to the FBI tip line . "
She included her name , social security number , educational background , and a note saying , " I am not a crazy person . "
Within a week , she got a phone call from the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force in New Jersey , and the Feds began working on the case .
She later learned that the inventory numbers matched those on Stingers the US had supplied to the mujahideen — likely remnants of their war against the Soviets in 1980s .
She caught her next big break a year later when she was poking around a Yahoo chat group called bravemuslims .
Mostly she had been watching and listening , learning the styles and attitudes that marked the conversations at these sites .
One day she saw a post from someone named Amir Abdul - Rashid who wrote a garbled Arabic greeting , " Wa salaam alaaykum , " and then went on in English : " Just curious , would there be any chance a brother who might be on the wrong side at the present , could join up ... defect so to speak ? "
Rossmiller wrote back as Abu Khadija , email address khadija1417@hotmail.com , to say that she was organizing some training camps in Pakistan and noted firmly , " To receive an order , contact me . "
And the guy did .
Pretty soon , it became obvious to Rossmiller that he was an American .
He asked to write in English and confided that he was " due to enter the war zone " and " unfortunately due to my position , I will be bearing the arms of the enemy . "
Rossmiller realized he was an American soldier and saw that his IP address put him in Washington state .
After a few more back - and - forths , she learned his real name was Ryan Anderson and that he was a tank crew member in the Army National Guard , destined to ship out for Iraq soon .
Many of Anderson 's emails with Rossmiller were full of chatty banter , the kind people use when they 're thrilled with a new online friend — except that every once in a while , he would throw in riffs about killing Americans or Arabs .
But he would also offer upbeat raves about his fellow soldiers .
In one email he cheerfully describes his commanding officer as " a really cool guy , and a vet of a couple of other deployments including Gulf War I . "
Later he flattered Khadija by describing how tough terrorists are and how they are " a real Alliance of Evil like our C in C says ... ( yes , I still like George Bush , even though he 's sending us there , he 's the guy I voted for , and I 'll probably vote for him again ... ) . "
For weeks , Rossmiller , posing as Khadija , had regular exchanges with Anderson .
In notes replete with emoticons , Anderson told her that he would be going to Iraq .
This was a time when few knew how the US military intended to station itself in Iraq , and yet he explained that his exact destination would be " Baghdad proper — something my CO called the ‘ Green Zone , ' we 're not supposed to talk about it to the newspapers for some reason but I guess family and friends are OK , so I 'm not too worried about telling you :) . "
Anderson wrote that he got " a copy of the Qur'an " for his PDA and then became " so conflicted about all this . "
He continued , " What am I to do if I must fire on someone attacking me when I wish I was with them ? "
As he prepared to ship out , he wrote , " Our oppertunities are coming to an end . "
And , indeed , they did — with his arrest on charges of attempted espionage and trying to aid the enemy .
When Rossmiller was summoned to the witness stand of a military court in Fort Lewis , Washington , she described publicly for the first time her methods and techniques .
She explained how difficult some of this work was — she trawled through sites for a year and a half before coming upon Anderson .
She also described how easily she could gain certain types of information , like how she had typed Anderson 's email address into Google and quickly discovered not only her contact 's name but also his Army email address , as well as menacing pictures of him clutching rifles and handguns .
After her testimony , Rossmiller says , the FBI made her an intelligence asset .
She now has a contact at the Great Falls FBI field office , an agent named Mark Seyler .
His boss , Timothy Fuhrman , would not comment on Rossmiller 's claim that she has sent the FBI more than 200 of her " packages " since 2002 , saying that he would rather keep the details of her intelligence role restricted to what is already on the public record .
He did say that " we can always learn from her . "
In fact , it 's distinctly possible that Rossmiller , alone at her computer , has a better track record than the Justice Department .
A Washington Post analysis in 2005 of the 400 - plus people charged with terrorism - related crimes by the federal government found that only 14 of those convicted actually had any ties at all to al Qaeda or its network .
Rossmiller 's cases have come with solid backup , while the feeble evidence in the other high - profile Justice Department cases makes many prosecutors roll their eyes .
Consider the seven Miami men arrested in the summer of 2006 and hyped as desiring to wage a " ground war " against the US and intending to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago .
They turned out to be a bunch of trash - talking blowhards whose plans were formulated while smoking pot in an empty warehouse .
In contrast , the man Rossmiller most recently implicated — Michael Reynolds — had prepared meticulous plans to blow up pipelines and was shopping online for used gas trucks to implement his plot .
The Pennsylvania resident was arrested after traveling 2,000 miles to southern Idaho , lured by Rossmiller into a supposed meeting with a financial backer .
" When I was in the White House and doing terrorism , the holy grail was ‘ actionable intelligence , ' and she brings a form of actionable intelligence , " says Roger Cressey , a White House counterterrorism official in both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations .
( He learned of Rossmiller after he left the government . )
The FBI , on the other hand , has failed in every attempt to modernize its technology since 2001 , and it so restricts the software available to agents that they can't even begin to match what Rossmiller does .
" The FBI is a dinosaur in many respects , " says Cressey .
Rossmiller agrees .
" I went to a meeting in Great Falls , and we got to talking , and someone had to look something up online , " she says .
" I asked , ‘ What do you use for Internet access ? ' and one agent said , ‘ We have to go to the public library down the street . ' "
She also tells a story about another agent who had to get permission to open a Yahoo account because it violated office regs .
" They were n't allowed , " she says .
Some of Rossmiller 's tactics are taken straight from the hacker playbook .
For instance , on several occasions she has sent individuals in foreign countries images altered to conceal , say , a keylogger that uploads everything the recipient types , including passwords .
One key logger recipient was a Middle Eastern journalist who had been a known contact of al Qaeda members .
Rossmiller passed along the information she got to government officials .
But many of Rossmiller 's most innovative techniques are shockingly simple .
To get a good ID of some of her targets , she bullies them into filling out an oath of allegiance known as a bayat .
Her bayat is hilariously blunt .
Here are the first few lines translated :
Oath of Allegiance to the Jihad
My legal name is ...
The son of ...
My family 's tribe ...
My country ...
The contact information for the leadership for my family
If it is Allah 's will I become a martyr in the cause of Jihad my family members shall be contacted ...
Early computer hackers did this , too .
Despite their reputations for technical wizardry , much of the information they obtained was procured through " social engineering " — calling up people and bullshitting them out of their login names and passwords .
To succeed at social engineering , you must maintain a strong dominant character , and Rossmiller is quite good at this .
The most important strategy , she says , is attitude : A true terrorist has to possess a certain kind of haughtiness .
Not anger or even belligerence but a subtle pushiness , even mild disdain for other jihadists .
" If I 'm posing as a courier , financier , or recruiter , I try to take the upper hand , " she says .
" A lot of times there will be talk about a private forum .
I 'd message someone and take a demanding tone .
‘ What is this ?
Why did n't I know about this ? '
I always take a demanding tone , and usually there 's some little Joe who will give me an invite . "
Then , once in private contact with someone , she will chastise them for talking too much in public .
She 'll often propose a method for private communication , such as sending notes as text in an online greeting card ( which is hard to search or scan for ) .
Once a kind of bare trust is established , she will , like a good con artist , push her mark away , refusing him , telling him he 's not worth her time .
Then he will come right back , often with surprising offerings of information to prove that he is the real thing .
" If they could see me , little blond me , they 'd go crazy , " she says in a burst of hearty laughter .
Much of Rossmiller 's success can be credited to her understanding that the chattiness and chumminess that often cinches digital friendships applies in terrorist chat rooms just as it does in Yahoo Nascar forums .
This skill was on display when she struck up an online correspondence with a jihadist in the Middle East named " Hakim " ( for Rossmiller 's protection , his name has been changed ) .
On this mission , Rossmiller assumed the identity of a particularly murderous terrorist known as Abu Musa .
She befriended Hakim , who lived in a country bordering Iraq and was looking to travel there , possibly for martyrdom , with 10 other people .
The talk quickly turned to personal travails , and soon Hakim was complaining about the biggest obstacle to his desired glory as a martyr : his mother .
Hakim , it turned out , lived alone with her , and , because of that , was having trouble finding the time to go fight in Iraq .
" I am trying to send her to live with a brother of mine who lives in a country close by , " he wrote , " if Allah will . "
( The cliché of the reactionary blogger as angry vigilante plotting schemes from his mother 's basement appears to be universal . )
Hakim seemed to be a big fan of orotund flourishes , and Rossmiller happily indulged him .
" Brother in Allah ...
I still pray to Allah that my message arrives to you and you are in the more perfect of the health and the good health and protected from the eyes of the spies and polytheists and the cross slaves , " she wrote him in Arabic .
Hakim also happily filled out the bayat form , giving Rossmiller all his real data , including address and phone numbers .
As usual , Rossmiller , aka Abu Musa , bragged about participating in events at which her presence could n't easily be corroborated ( such as fighting in Fallujah a few weeks before ) .
But then Abu Musa made a mistake :
He told Hakim he was located in a village that turned out to be just a cab ride away from Hakim , who then wanted to visit .
Rossmiller had already alerted her contact in the federal government about Hakim .
Now , this contact explained , he needed her to play for time while he contacted local authorities .
Suddenly Abu Musa found himself summoned to Syria for an important mission .
When Abu Musa returned after a week , Hakim was briefly suspicious but then returned to being chatty and revved up for jihad .
Abu Musa had ordered him to create a new email account and a new password so they could be safe .
" And he 's a good boy , " Rossmiller says .
" Here , he 's made an email account .
I love the password .
123456 . "
Soon , Hakim is comfortable enough to tell Abu Musa that he and his friends are ready to go to Iraq and that he needs some ingredients for a bomb .
This email is amazingly long , detailed , revealing , and inadvertently funny .
Sure , he 'd need " 1000 sulfur Match sticks , " potassium nitrate , acetone , glycerin , and potassium permanganate .
But he also wanted a food processor , a fan , a hair dryer , two cell phones , a remote control , a knife , and Scotch tape .
Abu Musa agrees to send a contact to meet in the public area of an upscale neighborhood , and Hakim gives specific details as to his dress and appearance .
Hakim is hopeful , praying for " Allah 's mercy and its blessings and pray to Allah that it keeps us and protects us from the cunning of the enemies . "
And then , his last words : " We meet on our date God willing . "
" All I know , " Rossmiller says , " is that he showed up , and it played out to script . "
He led his new contact to a warehouse where the other brothers were training .
The local authorities took over from there .
Rossmiller jokes that she 's needed to become twisted herself to deal with all the beheading videos she 's had to watch .
But after a few days of hanging around her , it 's clear that she 's not in the least bit abnormal .
Her gallows humor is just a way of dealing with the world she lives in .
( Imagine the kind of jokes you 'd have to tell yourself if the hookers and chop - shop thugs in your Grand Theft Auto game were real . )
In fact , her main motivation seems to be literary .
She really loves creating these characters and playing them .
She cares for them on some level , the way a novelist might .
She keeps files on them .
She clips pictures off the Internet to give them faces .
She gives each a birthday , a hometown , and a biography to make them believable to the people she chats with .
" Do you want to see Abu Musa ? " she asks me suddenly , as if he were hiding in the closet .
She clicks on some files and up comes a picture of a fairly dashing man with a pair of hip glasses and one of those jaw - defining beards .
He 's wearing a fashionable kafia around his neck , and his posture is catalog - ready .
Of course , Abu Musa is his jihadi name .
His " real " name is Walid Ali Mustaffa .
She scrolls through his biography .
On December 17 , 2003 , Abu Musa was involved in a truck explosion that killed nearly 30 people outside the Mount Lebannon Hotel in Baghdad .
" Those are real events , " says Rossmiller , who has , of course , extensively researched the explosion .
" He could have been involved in that . "
Not long after his interactions with Hakim , Abu Musa was martyred by Rossmiller .
" Abu Musa had been used enough , " she says , pointing at the screen .
" Here 's the last one , " she says .
" An insurgent gun battle in Ramadi .
August 21 , 2005 .
That 's when he dies . "
Rossmiller is serious , almost solemn .
" I have a hard time letting go of these guys , because I kinda become them .
When you develop a personality , you essentially morph into it .
It 's hard to let it go .
He 's the one I cried the most for . "

Last week , Chris Dodd promised to filibuster any version of the FISA bill including a provision for retroactive immunity for telecom companies that helped the Bush administration engage in warrantless wiretapping .
At the time , Dodd stood alone on a filibuster , though Obama had issued a statement against immunity .
Then Biden said he would join in .
Today , both Obama and Clinton issued statements offering conditional support for a filibuster .
The Obama campaign issued the following statement :
" Senator Obama has serious concerns about many provisions in this bill , especially the provision on giving retroactive immunity to the telephone companies .
He is hopeful that this bill can be improved by the Senate Judiciary Committee .
But if the bill comes to the Senate floor in its current form , he would support a filibuster of it . "
Clinton said :
HRC : I am troubled by the concerns that have been raised by the recent legislation reported out of the Intelligence Committee .
I have n't seen it so I can't express an opinion about it .
But I do n't trust the Bush Administration with our civil rights and liberties .
So I 'm going to study it very hard .
As matters stand now , I could not support it and I would support a filibuster absent additional information coming forward that would convince me differently .
Obama 's is clearly the stronger statement - after all , he appears to have read the bill .
That said , both Obama and Clinton took an important step in expressing a willingness to support a filibuster of at least one version of the bill .
The question is , will they insist on a bill that goes the distance and unequivocally oppose any legislation that provides amnesty to telecoms ?
We need to make sure they stand firm rather than looking for a hedge .
They 're both aware there are serious issues with this bill , but no doubt they 're feeling pressure from their consultants and the Beltway pundit class to make this problem go away .
Let 's make them feel the pressure from our side to complete this step toward defending the Constitution against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Both leading candidates should join Chris Dodd in firmly vowing to oppose any bill that gives retroactive immunity to law - breaking phone companies who helped Bush illegally spy on innocent Americans .
On November 30th , the former President of Italy , Francesco Cossiga , wrote in Italy 's largest newspaper
Mr. Cossiga joins a very long list of top military leaders , intelligence professionals , scientists , structural engineers , architects , members of Congress , 9/11 Commissioners , legal scholars , heroic first responders , family members of 9/11 victims and psychiatrists who question the government 's version of 9/11 .
The above is a rough translation using Babelfish .
Someone who speaks fluent Italian will be able produce a much more accurate translation .
Mr. Cossiga previously stated , in 2001 :
The mastermind of the attack must have been a “ sophisticated mind , provided with ample means not only to recruit fanatic kamikazes , but also highly specialized personnel .
I add one thing : it could not be accomplished without infiltrations in the radar and flight security personnel . ” ( p. 36 - 37 )
Note : Criticizing Zionism , as Mr. Cossiga does , is not the same as being anti-semitic .
See this , this and this .
The Gavel :
Unfortunately , the House Republicans sustained Bush 's veto , by narrowly denying the two - thirds necessary to override the veto : 260 in favor of passage versus 152 against , despite the veto - proof margin in the Senate , meaning 42 Republicans voted with the Democrats .
Rep. Charlie Rangel :
“ I stand in support of overriding the President ’s veto , not for the reasons given by Chairman Dingell — that it ’s the right and moral position — because that has existed all of the time and yet we ’ve been unsuccessful .
But I would say to the gentleman from Texas that since the last time this has come up , the President has admitted we are going toward a recession and that economy may be jeopardized unless the Congress supported a stimulus package .
It would just seem to me that if it ’s recognized that our states are going to go into deficit , our governors are going to have serious problems , and that it is very possible if not likely that services for our kids will be further cut under Medicaid , it would seem to me that a legitimate argument could be made that by providing care for these 11 million children it allows the parents to know that they ’ll be able to be more productive knowing that their kids are covered by health insurance .
It ’s sad that the poor now have to be used merely as a vehicle to stimulate our economy but had we taken care of these people … perhaps we ’d be not going through this struggle .
So it occurs to me that this is another opportunity that the minority would have , not just to do the moral thing but to do the economic thing , and to be of some assistance to the governors who are screaming out for the continuation of this program , indeed the expansion of it . ”
ATLANTA ( CNN ) --
The price of gasoline has hit a new record high , averaging $ 3.07 for a gallon of self - serve regular in the United States , a survey reported Sunday .
When inflation is factored in , the new price trails the all - time high in March 1981 .
At the time , gasoline cost $ 1.35 a gallon -- in today 's dollars , that 's $ 3.13 a gallon , said Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the Lundberg Survey .
Still , in raw numbers , the $ 3.07 beats the previous high of $ 3.03 in August of 2006 .
The survey , which took into account the prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide on May 4 , found a 19 - cent jump from the previous survey two weeks earlier .
Last month there was " substantial evidence " that gas prices would fall , but a series of " incidents " at a dozen refineries worldwide led the price to reverse course , Lundberg said .
In some cases , refineries began scheduled maintenance , but in other cases they experienced accidents that led some to shut down entirely and others to limit their capacity , she said .
Also , demand for gasoline grows at this time of year as Americans drive more in the warmer weather , she said .
The price of $ 3.07 is 12 cents higher than the survey found a year ago .
The city with the lowest average price found in the latest survey was Charleston , S.C. , where a gallon of self - serve regular cost $ 2.80 , the survey found .
The highest average was $ 3.49 in San Francisco .
Average prices in some other cities :
Memphis 2.84
Houston 2.86
Atlanta 2.94
Boston 2.95
Salt Lake City 3.03
Las Vegas 3.12
Long Island 3.18
Chicago 3.31

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
How much do you need to retire ?
Whatever your magic number is , few would say $ 25,000 .
And yet , there are a lot of people in that boat , according to a survey released Wednesday .
Nearly half of all workers saving for retirement have savings that fall short of the $ 25,000 mark , according to the 2007 Retirement Confidence Survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and Matthew Greenwald & Associates .
Predictably , the youngest workers ( ages 25 - 34 ) dominate this group - 68 percent of them have less than $ 25,000 earmarked for their later years .
But so do half of workers age 35 to 44 and a third of workers age 45 to 55 and over .
Overall , 40 percent of respondents said they are not currently saving for retirement while 34 percent said they did n't have any retirement money saved whatsoever .
A full 25 percent , meanwhile , said they had no savings at all - retirement or otherwise .
While financial pressures can play a big role in how much one saves , so , too , may your expectations : 30 percent of workers said they thought they would need to have a nest egg worth less than five times their current income to live in retirement , while 27 percent thought they needed between five and 10 times their income in savings .
All but the lowest earning men should have accumulated in a nest egg 12 times their income by the time they retire , EBRI estimates .
That 's $ 900,000 for a man earning $ 75,000 .
A woman , because of a higher life expectancy , should have 14 times her income .
Some might say that 's on the high end - especially if you 're in line to receive a pension and employer - paid health benefits in retirement .
But both defined benefit pensions and paid retiree health benefits are becoming the exception rather than the rule , a fact not reflected in workers ' expectations .
Sixty - two percent surveyed said they expected to receive a pension when they retire , even though only 41 percent of them said they knew of a pension they or their spouse had coming .
No one rule of thumb can ever provide you with an amount to save that 's perfect for your situation .
Too many factors go into the equation .
Among them : your life expectancy and health risks , your investment risks and your spending habits .
Having said that , there are some sound principles to go by .
First , contribute to your 401 ( k ) at work and contribute at least enough to qualify for the full matching contribution from your employer .
( Here 's a look the top 5 401 ( k ) flubs and how to avoid them . )
Next , aim to build a nest egg that , in combination with your Social Security benefits and pension benefits if you have them , will be large enough to generate at least 70 percent to 80 percent of your pre-retirement income .
Ibbotson Associates , a provider of asset allocation and other investment research , recommends that you aim to replace 80 percent of your net pre-retirement income - that is , your gross pre-retirement income minus what you contribute to retirement savings annually .
So if you make $ 60,000 and have been saving $ 10,000 a year , your net pre-retirement income is $ 50,000 .
Your goal would be to have a nest egg that , in combination with your Social Security benefits , could provide you with 80 percent of that a year ( or $ 40,000 on an inflation - adjusted basis ) .
According to Ibbotson 's calculations , if you 're making $ 60,000 at age 35 and have nothing in retirement savings , you should aim to save 14.6 percent of your income - or $ 8,760 a year .
If your employer matches 3 percent of your salary ( $ 1,800 ) - you only need to save 11.6 percent ( $ 6,960 ) .
If you have some savings already , Ibbotson recommends reducing that 11.6 percent savings rate by 0.55 percentage points for every $ 10,000 saved .
So if you already have $ 20,000 socked away , you may only need to save 10.5 percent ( 11.6 - ( 2 x 0.55 ) ) or $ 6,300 .
This assumes you 're single and want to have at least enough in retirement to buy a lifetime annuity that , with your expected Social Security benefits , can provide you with 80 percent of your net pre-retirement income .
Keep in mind , though , you may need much more than 80 percent of your preretirement income if you have a long - term health crisis , but if you 're looking for a savings benchmark to start with , that 's as fair as any .

Bones reveal the darker side to building Ancient Egypt
Bone discovery
Skeletal remains from a lost city in the middle of Egypt suggest many ordinary people died in their teenage years and lived a punishing lifestyle .
Many suffered from spinal injuries , poor nutrition and stunted growth .
The remains were found at Amarna , a new capital built on the orders of the Pharaoh Akhenaten , 3,500 years ago .
Hieroglyphs written at the time record that the Pharaoh , who was father of Tutankhamun , was driven to create a new city in honour of his favoured god , the Aten , with elaborate temples , palaces and tombs .
Along with his wife Nefertiti , he abandoned the capital Thebes , leaving the old gods and their priests behind and marched his people 200 miles ( 320 km ) north to an inhospitable desert plain beside the River Nile .
The city , housing up to 50,000 people , was built in 15 years ; but within a few years of the Pharaoh 's death , the city was abandoned , left to the wind and the sand .
The bones reveal a darker side to life , a striking reversal of the image that Akhenaten promoted
Professor Barry Kemp
Disease found
For more than a century archaeologists looked in vain for any trace of Amarna 's dead .
But recently archaeologists from a British - based team made a breakthrough when they found human bones in the desert , which had been washed out by floods .
These were the first bones clearly identifiable as the workers who lived in the city ; and they reveal the terrible price they paid to fulfil the Pharaoh 's dream .
" The bones reveal a darker side to life , a striking reversal of the image that Akhenaten promoted , of an escape to sunlight and nature " says Professor Barry Kemp who is leading the excavations .
Painted murals found in the tombs of high officials from the time show offering - tables piled high with food .
But the bones of the ordinary people who lived in the city reveal a different picture .
" The skeletons that we see are certainly not participating in that form of life , " says Professor Jerry Rose , of the University of Arkansas , US , whose anthropological team has been analysing the Amarna bones .
" Food is not abundant and certainly food is not of high nutritional quality .
This is not the city of being - taken - care - of . "
The population of Amarna had the shortest stature ever recorded from Egypt 's past , but they would also have been worked hard on the Pharaoh 's ambitious plans for his new capital .
The temples and palaces required thousands of large stone blocks .
Working in summer temperatures of 40C ( 104 F ) , the workers would have had to chisel these out of the rock and transport them 1.5 miles ( 2.5 km ) from the quarries to the city .
Reconstruction of Amarna which was six miles ( 10 km ) across
City scale revealed
The bone remains show many workers suffered spinal and other injuries .
" These people were working very hard at very young ages , carrying heavy loads , " says Professor Rose .
" The incidence of youthful death amongst the Amarna population was shockingly high by any standard . "
Not many lived beyond 35 .
Two - thirds were dead by 20 .
But even this backbreaking schedule may not be enough to explain the extreme death pattern at Amarna .
Even Akhanaten 's son , Tutankhamen , died aged just 20 ; and archaeologists are now beginning to believe that there might also have been an epidemic here .
This corroborates the historical records of Egypt 's principal enemy , the Hittites , which tell of the devastation of an epidemic caught from Egyptians captured in battle around the time of Tutankhamen 's reign .
It appears this epidemic may also have been the final blow to the people of Amarna .

The seed vaults are at the end of a 120 m long tunnel
The temperature inside the Svalbard Global Seed Vault will drop to - 18C ( 0 F ) in order to preserve the seeds .
Built deep inside a mountain , it aims to safeguard the world 's crops from future disasters , such as nuclear wars , asteroids or dangerous climate change .
The first seeds are scheduled to arrive at the Arctic site in mid-February .
The Norwegian government is paying the $ 9 m ( £ 4.5 m ) construction costs of the vault , which will have enough space to house 4.5 million seed samples .
The collection and maintenance of the seeds is being co-ordinated by the Global Crop Diversity Trust , which has responsibility of ensuring the " conservation of crop diversity in perpetuity " .
" The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , " said Cary Fowler , the Trust 's executive director .
" At these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 1,000 years . "
Future proof
The seed vault will be built 120 m ( 390 ft ) inside a mountain on Spitsbergen , one of four islands that make up Svalbard .
The site , roughly 1,000 km ( 600 miles ) north of mainland Norway , was chosen as the location for the vault because it was very remote and it also offered the level of stability required for the long - term project .
The vast collection is intended to act as insurance against disasters so food production can be restarted anywhere on the planet following a regional or global catastrophe .
" It is very satisfying to see the vault evolve from a bold concept to an impressive facility that has everything we need to protect crop biodiversity , " said Terje Riis - Johansen , the Norwegian Agriculture and Food Minister .
Engineers are using the surrounding rock and permafrost as a " cold store " , an energy efficient approach that has become popular in Norway .
" We believe the design of the vault will ensure that the seeds will stay well preserved even if forces such as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility , " explained project manager Magnus Tveiten .
We 've all heard about credit scores , but not many of us know exactly how they work or why they benefit us .

A man in Sweden did n't like the way his son - in - law was acting , so he sent a note to the FBI accusing the guy of being an Al Qaeda operative just before he took a trip to the USA .
When he landed , the DHS held him in a cell for 11 hours , then deported him .
Ca n't be too safe , dontcha know .
The wife did n't want him to travel since she was sick and wanted him to help care for their children , regional daily Sydsvenska Dagbladet said without disclosing the couple 's names .
When the husband refused to stay home , his father - in - law wrote an email to the FBI saying the son - in - law had links to al - Qaeda in Sweden and that he was travelling to the US to meet his contacts .
He provided information on the flight number and date of arrival in the US .
The son - in - law was arrested upon landing in Florida .
He was placed in handcuffs , interrogated and placed in a cell for 11 hours before being put on a flight back to Europe , the paper said .

Benjamin Bernanke , a former member of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve , is all but certain to be confirmed by the Senate as the next Chairman of that institution .
He may find that the adulation given to Mr. Greenspan does not carry over into his tenure so easily , especially if he continues to help Congress run up huge deficits .
Mr. Bernanke is a consummate Fed insider , widely seen by the financial press as the logical heir to Alan Greenspan .
In fact , judging by his public statements he may be more like Greenspan than Greenspan himself .
What I mean is that Mr. Bernanke appears to have embraced the idea that the Federal Reserve can create prosperity more than Mr. Greenspan ever did .
Like his predecessor , Mr. Bernanke views our system of fiat currency as a tool for creating wealth out of thin air by producing more dollars , whether paper or electronic .
But he seems to take things further than Greenspan by refusing even to consider the destructive consequences of monetary expansion .
In fact , he earned dubious notoriety for this quote in a 2002 speech discussing the supposed threat of deflation in the American economy : " The U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press , that allows it to produce as many dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
" But there is a cost , and it 's a heavy one .
It 's called monetary inflation , which destroys the value of the dollar and punishes those who save and invest .
The money supply , as measured by the Fed 's own M3 figure , has increased about 5 times since 1980 .
Yet for years officials at the Fed have insisted that inflation is firmly in check .
Inflation is not in check , as anyone who examines the cost of housing , energy , medical care , school tuition , and other basics can attest .
In one sense the remarkable rise in housing prices over the last decade really just represents a drop in the value of the dollar .
The artificial boom in the 1990s equity markets , engineered by Mr. Greenspan 's relentless monetary expansion and interest rate cutting , ended badly for millions of Americans holding overinflated stocks .
What will happen when the same thing happens with housing ?
The fundamental question is whether a central bank can manage the supply of money and credit better than the free market otherwise would .
We should n't kid ourselves about the true nature of the Fed , which is inherently incompatible with real free market capitalism .
Centralized planning of the money supply is a form of economic control that significantly affects prices , wages , and production levels .
Remember how market economists once criticized central planning of prices , wages , and production levels in the former Soviet Union ?
I encourage all Americans to learn more about the Federal Reserve System and what it means for our economic future .
An excellent resource is economist Murray Rothbard 's book What Has Government Done to our Money , which provides a brief yet devastating critique of centralized banking and the reckless government spending it enables .
We need to demystify the Federal Reserve to understand the enormous political and economic impact of a system that essentially allows government to print money at will to pay its bills .

It ’s a lonely job , working the phones at a college rape crisis center .
Day after day , you wait for the casualties to show up from the alleged campus rape epidemic — but no one calls .
Could this mean that the crisis is overblown ?
No : it means , according to the campus sexual - assault industry , that the abuse of coeds is worse than anyone had ever imagined .
It means that consultants and counselors need more funding to persuade student rape victims to break the silence of their suffering .
The campus rape movement highlights the current condition of radical feminism , from its self - indulgent bathos to its embrace of ever more vulnerable female victimhood .
But the movement is an even more important barometer of academia itself .
In a delicious historical irony , the baby boomers who dismantled the university ’s intellectual architecture in favor of unbridled sex and protest have now bureaucratized both .
While women ’s studies professors bang pots and blow whistles at antirape rallies , in the dorm next door , freshman counselors and deans pass out tips for better orgasms and the use of sex toys .
The academic bureaucracy is roomy enough to sponsor both the dour antimale feminism of the college rape movement and the promiscuous hookup culture of student life .
The only thing that does n’t fit into the university ’s new commitments is serious scholarly purpose .
The campus rape industry ’s central tenet is that one - quarter of all college girls will be raped or be the targets of attempted rape by the end of their college years ( completed rapes outnumbering attempted rapes by a ratio of about three to two ) .
The girls ’ assailants are not terrifying strangers grabbing them in dark alleys but the guys sitting next to them in class or at the cafeteria .
This claim , first published in Ms. magazine in 1987 , took the universities by storm .
By the early 1990s , campus rape centers and 24 - hour hotlines were opening across the country , aided by tens of millions of dollars of federal funding .
Victimhood rituals sprang up : first the Take Back the Night rallies , in which alleged rape victims reveal their stories to gathered crowds of candle - holding supporters ; then the Clothesline Project , in which T - shirts made by self - proclaimed rape survivors are strung on campus , while recorded sounds of gongs and drums mark minute - by - minute casualties of the “ rape culture . ”
A special rhetoric emerged : victims ’ family and friends were “ co- survivors ” ; “ survivors ” existed in a larger “ community of survivors . ”
An army of salesmen took to the road , selling advice to administrators on how to structure sexual - assault procedures , and lecturing freshmen on the “ undetected rapists ” in their midst .
Rape bureaucrats exchanged notes at such gatherings as the Inter Ivy Sexual Assault Conferences and the New England College Sexual Assault Network .
Organizations like One in Four and Men Can Stop Rape tried to persuade college boys to redefine their masculinity away from the “ rape culture . ”
The college rape infrastructure shows no signs of a slowdown .
In 2006 , for example , Yale created a new Sexual Harassment and Assault Resources and Education Center , despite numerous resources for rape victims already on campus .
If the one - in - four statistic is correct — it is sometimes modified to “ one - in - five to one - in - four ” — campus rape represents a crime wave of unprecedented proportions .
No crime , much less one as serious as rape , has a victimization rate remotely approaching 20 or 25 percent , even over many years .
The 2006 violent crime rate in Detroit , one of the most violent cities in America , was 2,400 murders , rapes , robberies , and aggravated assaults per 100,000 inhabitants — a rate of 2.4 percent .
The one - in - four statistic would mean that every year , millions of young women graduate who have suffered the most terrifying assault , short of murder , that a woman can experience .
Such a crime wave would require nothing less than a state of emergency — Take Back the Night rallies and 24 - hour hotlines would hardly be adequate to counter this tsunami of sexual violence .
Admissions policies letting in tens of thousands of vicious criminals would require a complete revision , perhaps banning boys entirely .
The nation ’s nearly 10 million female undergrads would need to take the most stringent safety precautions .
Certainly , they would have to alter their sexual behavior radically to avoid falling prey to the rape epidemic .
None of this crisis response occurs , of course — because the crisis does n’t exist .
During the 1980s , feminist researchers committed to the rape - culture theory had discovered that asking women directly if they had been raped yielded disappointing results — very few women said that they had been .
So Ms. commissioned University of Arizona public health professor Mary Koss to develop a different way of measuring the prevalence of rape .
Rather than asking female students about rape per se , Koss asked them if they had experienced actions that she then classified as rape .
Koss ’s method produced the 25 percent rate , which Ms. then published .
Koss ’s study had serious flaws .
Her survey instrument was highly ambiguous , as University of California at Berkeley social - welfare professor Neil Gilbert has pointed out .
But the most powerful refutation of Koss ’s research came from her own subjects : 73 percent of the women whom she characterized as rape victims said that they had n’t been raped .
Further — though it is inconceivable that a raped woman would voluntarily have sex again with the fiend who attacked her — 42 percent of Koss ’s supposed victims had intercourse again with their alleged assailants .
All subsequent feminist rape studies have resulted in this discrepancy between the researchers ’ conclusions and the subjects ’ own views .
A survey of sorority girls at the University of Virginia found that only 23 percent of the subjects whom the survey characterized as rape victims felt that they had been raped — a result that the university ’s director of Sexual and Domestic Violence Services calls “ discouraging . ”
Equally damning was a 2000 campus rape study conducted under the aegis of the Department of Justice .
Sixty - five percent of what the feminist researchers called “ completed rape ” victims and three - quarters of “ attempted rape ” victims said that they did not think that their experiences were “ serious enough to report . ”
The “ victims ” in the study , moreover , “ generally did not state that their victimization resulted in physical or emotional injuries , ” report the researchers .
Just as a reality check , consider an actual student - related rape : in 2006 , Labrente Robinson and Jacoby Robinson broke into the Philadelphia home of a Temple University student and a Temple graduate , and anally , vaginally , and orally penetrated the women , including with a gun .
The chance that the victims would not consider this event “ serious enough to report , ” or physically and emotionally injurious , is exactly nil .
In short , believing in the campus rape epidemic depends on ignoring women ’s own interpretations of their experiences — supposedly the most grievous sin in the feminist political code .
None of the obvious weaknesses in the research has had the slightest drag on the campus rape movement , because the movement is political , not empirical .
In a rape culture , which “ condones physical and emotional terrorism against women as a norm , ” sexual assault will wind up underreported , argued the director of Yale ’s Sexual Harassment and Assault Resources and Education Center in a March 2007 newsletter .
You do n’t need evidence for the rape culture ; you simply know that it exists .
But if you do need evidence , the underreporting of rape is the best proof there is .
Campus rape researchers may feel that they know better than female students themselves about the students ’ sexual experiences , but the students are voting with their feet and staying away in droves from the massive rape apparatus built up since the Ms. article .
Referring to rape hotlines , rape consultant Brett Sokolow laments : “ The problem is , on so many of our campuses , very few people ever call .
And mostly , we ’ve resigned ourselves to the under-utilization of these resources . ”
Federal law requires colleges to publish reported crimes affecting their students .
The numbers of reported sexual assaults — the law does not require their confirmation — usually run under half a dozen a year on private campuses and maybe two to three times that at large public universities .
You might think that having so few reports of sexual assault a year would be a point of pride ; in fact , it ’s a source of gall for students and administrators alike .
Yale ’s associate general counsel and vice president were clearly on the defensive when asked by the Yale alumni magazine in 2004 about Harvard ’s higher numbers of reported assaults ; the reporter might as well have been needling them about a Harvard - Yale football rout .
“ Harvard must have double - counted or included incidents not required by federal law , ” groused the officials .
The University of Virginia does not publish the number of its sexual - assault hearings because it is so low .
“ We ’re reticent to publicize it when we have such a small ‘ n ’ number , ” says Nicole Eramu , Virginia ’s associate dean of students .
Campuses do everything they can to get their numbers of reported and adjudicated sexual assaults up — adding new categories of lesser offenses , lowering the burden of proof , and devising hearing procedures that will elicit more assault charges .
At Yale , it is the accuser who decides whether the accused may confront her — a sacrifice of one of the great Anglo - Saxon truth - finding procedures .
“ You do n’t want them to not come to the board and report , do you ? ” asks physics professor Peter Parker , convener of the university ’s Sexual Harassment Grievance Board .
The scarcity of reported sexual assaults means that the women who do report them must be treated like rare treasures .
New York University ’s Wellness Exchange counsels people to “ believe unconditionally ” in sexual - assault charges because “ only 2 percent of reported rapes are false reports ” ( a ubiquitous claim that dates from radical feminist Susan Brownmiller ’s 1975 tract Against Our Will ) .
As Stuart Taylor and K. C. Johnson point out in their book Until Proven Innocent , however , the rate of false reports is at least 9 percent and probably closer to 50 percent .
Just how powerful is the “ believe unconditionally ” credo ?
David Lisak , a University of Massachusetts psychology professor who lectures constantly on the antirape college circuit , acknowledged to a hall of Rutgers students this November that the “ Duke case , ” in which a black stripper falsely accused three white Duke lacrosse players of rape in 2006 , “ has raised the issue of false allegations . ”
But Lisak did n’t want to talk about the Duke case , he said .
“ I do n’t know what happened at Duke .
No one knows . ”
Actually , we do know what happened at Duke : the prosecutor ignored clearly exculpatory evidence and alibis that cleared the defendants , and was later disbarred for his misconduct .
But to the campus rape industry , a lying plaintiff remains a victim of the patriarchy , and the accused remain forever under suspicion .
So what reality does lie behind the campus rape industry ?
A booze - fueled hookup culture of one - night , or sometimes just partial - night , stands .
Students in the sixties demanded that college administrators stop setting rules for fraternization .
“ We ’re adults , ” the students shouted .
“ We can manage our own lives .
If we want to have members of the opposite sex in our rooms at any hour of the day or night , that ’s our right . ”
The colleges meekly complied and opened a Pandora ’s box of boorish , sluttish behavior that gets cruder each year .
Do the boys , riding the testosterone wave , act thuggishly toward the girls ?
You bet !
Do the girls try to match their insensitivity ?
Indisputably .
College girls drink themselves into near or actual oblivion before and during parties .
That drinking is often goal - oriented , suggests University of Virginia graduate Karin Agness : it frees the drinker from responsibility and “ provides an excuse for engaging in behavior that she ordinarily would n’t . ”
A Columbia University security official marvels at the scene at homecomings : “ The women are shit - faced , saying , ‘ Let ’s get as drunk as we can , ’ while the men are hovering over them . ”
As anticipated , the night can include a meaningless sexual encounter with a guy whom the girl may not even know .
This less - than - romantic denouement produces the “ roll and scream : you roll over the next morning so horrified at what you find next to you that you scream , ” a Duke coed reports in Laura Sessions Stepp ’s recent book Unhooked .
To the extent that they ’re remembered at all , these are the couplings that are occasionally transformed into “ rape ” — though far less often than the campus rape industry wishes .
The magazine Saturday Night : Untold Stories of Sexual Assault at Harvard , produced by Harvard ’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response , provides a first - person account of such a coupling :
What can I tell you about being raped ?
Very little .
I remember drinking with some girlfriends and then heading to a party in the house that some seniors were throwing .
I ’m told that I walked in and within 5 minutes was making out with one of the guys who lived there , who I ’d talked to some in the dining hall but never really hung out with .
I may have initiated it .
I do n’t remember arriving at the party ; I dimly remember waking up at some point in the early morning in this guy ’s room .
I remember him walking me back to my room .
I could n’t have made it alone ; I still had too much alcohol in my system to even stand up straight .
I made myself vulnerable and even now it ’s hard to think that someone here who I have talked and laughed with could be cold - hearted enough to take advantage of that vulnerability .
I ’d rather , sometimes , take half the blame than believe that a profound evil can exist in mankind .
But it ’s easy for me to say , that , of the two of us , I ’m the only one who still has nightmares , found myself panicking and detaching during sex for many months afterwards , and spent more time looking into the abyss than any one person should .
The inequalities of the consequences of the night , the actions taken unintentionally or not , have changed the course of only one of our lives , irrevocably and profoundly .
Now perhaps the male willfully exploited the narrator ’s self - inflicted incapacitation ; if so , he deserves censure for taking advantage of a female in distress .
But to hold the narrator completely without responsibility requires stripping women of volition and moral agency .
Though the Harvard victim does not remember her actions , it ’s highly unlikely that she passed out upon arriving at the party and was dragged away like roadkill while other students looked on .
Rather , she probably participated voluntarily in the usual prelude to intercourse , and probably even in intercourse itself , however woozily .
Even if the Harvard victim ’s drunkenness cancels any responsibility that she might share for the interaction ’s finale , is she equally without responsibility for all of her behavior up to that point , including getting so drunk that she ca n’t remember anything ?
Campus rape ideology holds that inebriation strips women of responsibility for their actions but preserves male responsibility not only for their own actions but for their partners ’ as well .
Thus do men again become the guardians of female well - being .
As for the story ’s maudlin melodrama , perhaps the narrator ’s life really has been “ irrevocably ” changed , for which one sympathizes .
One ca n’t help observing , however , that the effect of this “ profound evil ” on at least her sex life appears to have been minimal — she “ detached ” during sex for “ many months afterwards , ” but sex she most certainly had .
Real rape victims , however , can fear physical intimacy for years , along with suffering a host of other terrors .
We do n’t know if the narrator ’s “ look into the abyss ” led her to reconsider getting plastered before parties and initiating sexual contact with casual acquaintances .
But if a Harvard student does n’t understand that getting very drunk and becoming physically involved with a boy at a hookup party carries a serious probability of intercourse , she ’s at the wrong university , if she should be at college at all .
A large number of complicating factors make the Saturday Night story a far more problematic case than the term “ rape ” usually implies .
Unlike the campus rape industry , most students are well aware of those complicating factors , which is why there are so few rape charges brought for college sex .
But if the rape industrialists are so sure that foreseeable and seemingly cooperative drunken sex amounts to rape , there are some obvious steps that they could take to prevent it .
Above all , they could persuade girls not to put themselves into situations whose likely outcome is intercourse .
Specifically : do n’t get drunk , do n’t get into bed with a guy , and do n’t take off your clothes or allow them to be removed .
Once you ’re in that situation , the rape activists could say , it ’s going to be hard to halt the proceedings , for lots of complex emotional reasons .
Were this advice heeded , the campus “ rape ” epidemic would be wiped out overnight .
But suggest to a rape bureaucrat that female students should behave with greater sexual restraint as a preventive measure , and you might as well be saying that the girls should enter a convent or don the burka .
“ I am uncomfortable with the idea , ” e-mailed Hillary Wing - Richards , the associate director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Women ’s Resource Center at James Madison University in Virginia .
“ This indicates that if [ female students ] are raped it could be their fault — it is never their fault — and how one dresses does not invite rape or violence .
. . .
I would never allow my staff or myself to send the message it is the victim ’s fault due to their dress or lack of restraint in any way . ”
Putting on a tight tank top does n’t , of course , lead to what the bureaucrats call “ rape . ”
But taking off that tank top does increase the risk of sexual intercourse that will be later regretted , especially when the tank - topper has been intently mainlining rum and Cokes all evening .
The baby boomers who demanded the dismantling of all campus rules governing the relations between the sexes now sit in dean ’s offices and student - counseling services .
They cannot turn around and argue for reregulating sex , even on pragmatic grounds .
Instead , they have responded to the fallout of the college sexual revolution with bizarre and anachronistic legalism .
Campuses have created a judicial infrastructure for responding to postcoital second thoughts more complex than that required to adjudicate maritime commerce claims in Renaissance Venice .
University of Virginia students , for example , have at least three different procedural channels open to them following carnal knowledge : they may demand a formal adjudication before the Sexual Assault Board ; they can request a “ Structured Meeting ” with the Office of the Dean of Students by filing a formal complaint ; or they can seek voluntary mediation .
The Structured Meetings are presided over by the chair of the Sexual Assault Board , with assistance from another board member or senior staff of the Office of the Dean of Students .
The Structured Meeting , according to the university , is an “ opportunity for the complainant to confront the accused and communicate their feelings and perceptions regarding the incident , the impact of the incident and their wishes and expectations regarding protection in the future . ”
Mediation , on the other hand , “ allows both you and the accused to discuss your respective understandings of the assault with the guidance of a trained professional , ” says the school ’s sexual - assault center .
Rarely have primal lust and carousing been more weirdly paired with their opposites .
Out in the real world , people who regret a sexual coupling must work it out on their own ; no counterpart exists outside academia for this superstructure of hearings , mediations , and negotiated settlements .
If you ’ve actually been raped , you go to criminal court — but the overwhelming majority of campus “ rape ” cases that take up administration time and resources would get thrown out of court in a twinkling , which is why they ’re almost never prosecuted .
Indeed , if the campus rape industry really believes that these hookup encounters are rape , it is unconscionable to leave them to flimsy academic procedures .
“ Universities are equipped to handle plagiarism , not rape , ” observes University of Pennsylvania history professor Alan Charles Kors .
“ Sexual - assault charges , if true , are so serious as to belong only in the criminal system . ”
Risk - management consultants travel the country to help colleges craft legal rules for student sexual congress .
These rules presume that an activity originating in inchoate desire , whose nuances have taxed the expressive powers of poets , artists , and philosophers for centuries , can be reduced to a species of commercial code .
The process of crafting these rules combines a voyeuristic prurience and a seeming cluelessness about sex .
“ It is fun , ” writes Alan D. Berkowitz , a popular campus rape lecturer and consultant , “ to ask students how they know if someone is sexually interested in them . ”
( Fun for whom ?
one must ask . )
Continues Berkowitz : “ Many of the responses rely on guesswork and inference to determine sexual intent . ”
Such signaling mechanisms , dating from the dawn of the human race , are no longer acceptable on the rape - sensitized campus .
“ In fact , ” explains our consultant , “ sexual intent can only be determined by clear and unambiguous communication about what is desired . ”
So much for seduction and romance ; bring in the MBAs and lawyers .
The campus sex- management industry locks in its livelihood by introducing a specious clarity to what is inherently mysterious and an equally specious complexity to what is straightforward .
Both the pseudo - clarity and pseudo - complexity work in a woman ’s favor , of course .
“ If one partner puts a condom on the other , does that signify that they are consenting to intercourse ? ” asks Berkowitz .
Short of guiding the thus - sheathed instrumentality to port , it ’s hard to imagine a clearer signal of consent .
But perhaps a girl who has just so outfitted her partner will decide after the fact that she has been “ raped ” — so better to declare the action , as Berkowitz does , “ inherently ambiguous . ”
He recommends instead that colleges require “ clear verbal consent ” for sex , a policy that the recently disbanded Antioch College introduced in the early 1990s to universal derision .
The university is sneaking back in its in loco parentis oversight of student sexual relations , but it has replaced the moral content of that regulation with supposedly neutral legal procedure .
The generation that got rid of parietal rules has re-created a form of bedroom oversight as pervasive as Bentham ’s Panopticon .
But the post -1960s university is nothing if not capacious .
It has institutionalized every strand of adolescent - inspired rebellion familiar since student sit -in days .
The campus rape industry may decry ubiquitous male predation , but a campus sex industry puts bureaucratic clout behind the message that students should have recreational sex at every opportunity .
In late October , for example , New York University ’s professional “ sexpert ” set up her wares in the light - filled atrium of the Kimmel Student Center .
Along with the usual baskets of lubricated condoms , female condoms , and dental dams ( a lesbian - inspired latex innovation for “ safe ” oral sex ) , Alyssa La Fosse , looking thoroughly professional in a neatly coiffed bun , also provided brightly colored instructional sheets on such important topics as “ How to Female Ejaculate ” ( “ First take some time to get aroused .
Lube up your fingers and let them do the walking ” ) and “ Masturbation Tips for Girls ” ( “ Draw a circle around your clitoris with your index finger ” ) .
In a heroic effort at inclusiveness , she also provided a pamphlet called “ Exploring Your Options : Abstinence , ” but a reader could be forgiven for thinking that he had mistakenly grabbed the menu of activities at a West Village bathhouse .
NYU ’s officially approved “ abstinence options ” include “ outercourse , mutual masturbation , pornography , and sex toys such as vibrators , dildos , and a paddle . ”
Ever the responsible parent - surrogate , NYU recommends that “ abstinence ” practitioners cover their sex toys “ with a condom if they are to be inserted in the mouth , anus , or vagina . ”
The students passing La Fosse ’s table showed a greater interest in the free Hershey ’s Kisses than in the latex accessories and informational sheets ; very occasionally , someone would grab a condom .
No one brought “ questions about sexuality or sexual health ” to La Fosse , despite the university ’s official invitation to do so .
NYU is not about to be daunted in its mission of promoting better sex , however .
So it also offers workshops on orgasms — “ how to achieve that ( sometimes elusive ) state ” — and “ Sex Toys for Safer Sex ” ( “ an evening with rubber , silicone , and vibrating toys ” ) in residence halls and various student clubs .
Similarly , Brown University ’s Student Services helps students answer the compelling question : “ How can I bring sex toys into my relationship ? ”
Brown categorizes sex toys by function ( “ Some sex toys are meant to be used more gently , while others are used for sexual acts involving dominance and submission . . . such as restraints , blindfolds , and whips ” ) and offers the usual safe - sex caveats ( “ If sharing sex toys , such as dildos , butt plugs , or vibrators , use condoms and dental dams ” ) .
UCLA ’s Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center advises on how a man might “ increase the amount of time before he ejaculates ” ; Tufts University ’s 2006 Sex Fair featured a “ Dildo Ring Toss ” and dental - dam slingshots ; and Barnard College suggests that participants in sadomasochistic sex , “ where ‘ no , please do n’t ’ . . . can be a part of the fun , ” agree on a “ safeword ” that “ will stop all play immediately . ”
A Princeton student who thinks that a “ docking sleeve ” may be some kind of maritime hardware , or a “ suction device ” something used for plumbing , had better bone up , so to speak , before playing the school ’s official “ Safer Sex Jeopardy ” game , because these objects are in the “ grab bag ” categories of penile toys and nipple toys , respectively .
Encyclopedic knowledge is advisable : game developers list six types of vibrators , including the “ rabbit vibrator , ” and eight kinds of penile toys , including the “ pocket pussy . ”
By now , universities have traveled so far from their original task of immersing students in the greatest intellectual and artistic creations of humanity that criticizing any particular detour seems arbitrary .
Still , the question presents itself :
Why , exactly , are the schools offering workshops on orgasms and sex toys instead of on Michelangelo ’s Campidoglio or Pushkin ’s Eugene Onegin ?
Are students already so saturated with knowledge of Renaissance humanism or the evolution of constitutional democracy , say , that colleges can happily reroute resources to matters readily available on porn websites ?
Columbia University ’s Go Ask Alice website illustrates the dilemma posed by a college ’s simultaneous advocacy of “ healthy sexuality ” and of the “ rape is everywhere ” ideology .
Go Ask Alice is run by Columbia ’s Health Services ; it answers both nonsexual health queries and such burning questions as : “ Sex with four friends — Mutual ? ” and “ Will it ever be good for me ? ” ( from a virgin ) .
In one post , titled “ I ’m sure I was drunk , but I ’m not sure if I had sex , ” Alice takes up the classic hookup scenario : a girl who has no recollection of whether she had intercourse during a drunken encounter and now wonders if she ’s pregnant .
Alice ’s initial reaction is pure hip - to - free - love toleration : “ Depending upon your relationship with your partner , you may want to ask what happened .
Understandably , this might feel awkward and embarrassing , but the conversation might . . . help you to understand what happened and what steps you might decide to take . ”
Absent that pesky worry about insemination , there would presumably be no compelling reason to engage in something as “ awkward and embarrassing ” as a post - roll - in - the - hay conversation .
But then a shadow passes over the horizon : the date - rape threat .
“ On a darker note , ” continues Alice , “ it ’s possible your experience may have been non-consensual , considering that you were drunk and do n’t remember exactly what happened . ”
Alice recommends a call to Columbia ’s Rape Crisis / Anti-Violence Support Center ( officially dedicated to “ speaking our truths about sexual violence ” ) .
Alice ’s advice shows the incoherence of the contemporary university ’s multiple stances toward college sex .
It ’s hard to speak your truths about sexual violence when your involvement with your potential date - rapist is so tenuous that it ’s awkward to speak to him .
And the support center ca n’t know whether the encounter was consensual .
But Alice declines to condemn the behavior that both got the girl into her predicament and erased her memory of it .
The only lesson that Alice offers is that the girl might — purely as an optional matter — want to think about how alcohol affected her .
As for rethinking whether she should be getting into bed with someone whom , Alice presumes , she would be reluctant to contact the next day , well , that never comes up .
Members of the multifaceted campus sex bureaucracy never seem to consider the possibility that the libertinism that one administrative branch champions , and the sex that another branch portrays as rape , may be inextricably linked .
Modern feminists defined the right to be promiscuous as a cornerstone of female equality .
Understandably , they now hesitate to acknowledge that sex is a more complicated force than was foreseen .
Rather than recognizing that no-consequences sex may be a contradiction in terms , however , the campus rape industry claims that what it calls campus rape is about not sex but rather politics — the male desire to subordinate women .
The University of Virginia Women ’s Center intones that “ rape or sexual assault is not an act of sex or lust — it ’s about aggression , power , and humiliation , using sex as the weapon .
The rapist ’s goal is domination . ”
This characterization may or may not describe the psychopathic violence of stranger rape .
But it is an absurd description of the barnyard rutting that undergraduate men , happily released from older constraints , seek .
The guys who push themselves on women at keggers are after one thing only , and it ’s not a reinstatement of the patriarchy .
Each would be perfectly content if his partner for the evening becomes president of the United States one day , so long as she lets him take off her panties tonight .
One group on campus is n’t buying the politics of the campus “ rape ” movement , however : students .
To the despair of rape industrialists everywhere , students have held on to the view that women usually have considerable power to determine whether a campus social event ends with intercourse .
Rutgers University Sexual Assault Services surveyed student athletes about violence against women in the 2001 – 02 academic year .
The female teams were more “ direct , ” the survey reported , in “ expressing the idea that women who are raped sometimes put themselves in those situations . ”
A female athlete told interviewers : “ When we go out to parties , and I see girls and the way they dress and the way they act . . . and just the way they are , under the influence and um , then they like accuse them of like , oh yeah , my boyfriend did this to me or whatever , I honestly always think it ’s their fault . ”
Another brainwashed victim of the rape culture .
Equally maddening must be the reaction that sometimes greets performers in Sex Signals , an improvisational show on date rape whose venues include Harvard , Yale , and schools throughout the Midwest .
“ Sometimes we get women who are advocates for men , ” the show ’s founders told a Chicago public radio station this October , barely concealing their disbelief .
“ They blame the victim and try to find out what the victim did so they wo n’t do it . ”
Such worrisome self - help efforts could shut down the campus rape industry .
“ Promiscuity ” is a word that you will never see in the pages of a campus rape center publication ; it is equally repugnant to the sexual liberationist strand of feminism and to the Catherine Mac - Kinnonite “ all - sex - is - rape ” strand .
But it ’s an idea that wo n’t go away among the student Lumpenproletariat .
Students refer to “ sororistutes ” — those wild and crazy Greek women so often featured in Girls Gone Wild videos .
And they persist in seeing a connection between promiscuity and the alleged campus rape epidemic .
A Rutgers University freshman says that he knows women who claim to have been sexually assaulted , but adds : “ They do n’t have the best reputation .
Sometimes it ’s hard to believe that kind of stuff . ”
Rape consultant David Lisak faced a similar problem this November : an auditorium of Rutgers students who kept treating women as moral agents .
He might have sensed the trouble ahead when in response to a photo array of what Lisak calls “ undetected rapists , ” a girl asked : “ Why are there only white men ?
Am I blind ? ”
It went downhill from there .
Lisak did his best to send a tremor of fear through the audience with the news that “ rape happens with terrifying frequency .
I ’m not talking of someone who comes onto campus but students , Rutgers students , who prowl for victims in bars , parties , wherever alcohol is being consumed . ”
He then played a dramatized interview with a student “ rapist ” at a fraternity that had deliberately set aside a room for raping girls during parties , according to Lisak .
The students were n’t buying it .
“ I do n’t understand why these parties do n’t become infamous among girls , ” wondered one .
Another asked : “ Are you saying that the frat brothers decided that this room would be used for committing sexual assault , or was it just : ‘ Maybe I ’ll get lucky , and if I do , I ’ll go there ’ ? ”
And then someone asked the most dangerous question of all : “ Should n’t the victim have had a little bit of education beforehand ?
We all know the dangers of parties .
The victim had miscalculations on her part ; alcohol can lead to things . ”
In a column this November in the University of Virginia ’s student newspaper , third - year student Katelyn Kiley gave the real scoop on frat parties :
They ’re filled with boys hoping to have sex .
She did not call these boys “ rapists . ”
She did not demonize their sex drive .
She merely offered some practical wisdom to the “ scantily clad ” freshman girls trooping off to Virginia ’s fraternity row : “ That frat boy really is just trying to get into your pants . ”
Most disturbingly , she advised the girls to exercise sexual control : “ So dance with that good - looking guy .
If he offers , you can even go up to his room to get a mixed drink .
. . .
Flirt .
But it ’s probably a good idea to keep your clothes on , and at the end of the night , to go home to your own bed .
Interestingly enough , that ’s how you get them to keep asking you back . ”
You can read thousands of pages of rape crisis center hysteria without coming across such bracing common sense .
Amazingly , Kiley has n’t received any of the millions of dollars that feminists in the federal government have showered on campuses to prevent what they call rape .
Some student rebels are going one step further : organizing in favor of sexual restraint .
Such newly created campus groups as the Love and Fidelity Network and the True Love Revolution advocate an alternative to the rampant regret sex of the hookup scene : wait until marriage .
Their message would do more to return a modicum of manners to campus male — and female — behavior than endless harangues about the rape culture ever could .
Maybe these young iconoclasts can take up another discredited idea : college is for learning .
The adults in charge have gone deaf to the siren call of beauty that for centuries lured people to the classics .
But fighting male dominance or catering to the libidinal impulses released in the 1960s are sorry substitutes for the pursuit of knowledge .
The campus rape and sex industries are signs of how hollow the university has become .
As Eric Alterman has written , he ’s the “ journalist ” of “ perpetual wrongness ” ( as well as an “ apparatchik ” of the first order and a “ right - wing holy warrior ” ) .
And for that , he ’s perpetually hired or published : Fox News , the Washington Post op - ed page , Time Magazine , and most recently , the New York Times where , in his very first column , he made a goof that had to be corrected at the bottom of column two ( and where , with his usual perspicacity when it comes to the future , he predicted an Obama victory in the New Hampshire primary ) .
Liberal websites devote time to listing his many mistakes and mis-predictions .
In a roiling mass of neocons , right - wingers , and liberal war hawks , he ’s certainly been in fierce competition for the title of “ wrongest ” of all when it came to the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
( “ Iraq ’s always been very secular ? ” )
I hardly have to spell out the name of He Who Strides Amongst Us , the editor of Rupert Murdoch ’s Weekly Standard .
But , okay , for the one person on the planet who does n’t know  it ’s Bill Kristol .
The notorious Mr. Kristol , the man whose crystal ball never works .
But is n’t it the essence of American punditry that serial mistakes do n’t matter and no one is ever held to account ( as in this primary season ) for ridiculous predictions that add up to nothing ?
As New York Times editorial page editor Andy Rosenthal put it after his paper signed Kristol to a one - year contract , “ The idea that The New York Times is giving voice to a guy who is a serious , respected conservative intellectual  and somehow that ’s a bad thing ?
How intolerant is that ? ”
How intolerant indeed !
Since no one in the mainstream is accountable for anything they ’ve written , the management of the Times can exhibit remarkable tolerance for error in its gesture to the neocon right by hiring a man who ’s essentially never right .
His has been a remarkable winning record when it comes to being right ( - wing ) by doing wrong .
Former Saturday Night Live contributor Jonathan Schwarz pays homage to that record in what follows .

The Lost Kristol Tapes
By Jonathan Schwarz
Imagine that there were a Beatles record only a few people knew existed .
And imagine you got the chance to listen to it , and as you did , your excitement grew , note by note .
You realized it was n’t merely as good as Rubber Soul , or Revolver , or Sgt. Pepper ’s .
It was much , much better .
And now , imagine how badly you ’d want to tell other Beatles fans all about it .
That ’s how I feel for my fellow William Kristol fans .
You loved it when Bill said invading Iraq was going to have “ terrifically good effects throughout the Middle East ” ?
You have the original recording of him explaining the war would make us “ respected around the world ” and his classic statement that there ’s “ almost no evidence ” of Iraq experiencing Sunni -Shia conflict ?
Well , I ’ve got something that will blow your mind !
I ’m talking about Kristol ’s two - hour appearance on C - Span ’s Washington Journal on March 28 , 2003 , just nine days after the President launched his invasion of Iraq .
No one remembers it today .
You ca n’t even fish it out of LexisNexis .
It ’s not there .
Yet it ’s a masterpiece , a double album of smarm , horrifying ignorance , and bald - faced deceit .
While you ’ve heard him play those instruments before , he never again reached such heights .
It ’s a performance for the history books  particularly that chapter about how the American Empire collapsed .
At the time Kristol was merely the son of prominent neoconservative Irving Kristol , former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle ( aka “ Quayle ’s brain ” ) , the editor of Rupert Murdoch ’s Weekly Standard , and a frequent Fox News commentator .
He had n’t yet added New York Times columnist to his resumé .
Opposite Kristol on the segment was Daniel Ellsberg , famed for leaking the Pentagon Papers in the Vietnam era .
Their discussion jumped back and forth across 40 years of U.S. - Iraqi relations , and is easiest to understand if rearranged chronologically .
So , sit back , relax , and let me play a little of it for you .
To start with , Ellsberg made the reasonable point that Iraqis might not view the invading Americans as “ liberators , ” since the U.S. had been instrumental in Saddam Hussein ’s rise to power :
Here ’s how he put it :
“ ELLSBERG : People in Iraq … perceive Hussein as a dictator …
But as a dictator the Americans chose for them .
“ KRISTOL : That ’s just not true .
We ’ve had mistakes in our Iraq policy .
It ’s just ludicrous  we did n’t choose Hussein .
We did n’t put him in power .
“ ELLSBERG : In 1963 , when there was a brief uprising of the Ba’ath , we supplied specifically Saddam with lists , as we did in Indonesia , lists of people to be eliminated .
And since he ’s a murderous thug , but at that time our murderous thug , he eliminated them …
“ KRISTOL : [ surprised ]
Is that right ?…
“ ELLSBERG : The same thing went on in ’ 68 .
He was our thug , just as [ Panamanian dictator Manuel ] Noriega , and lots of other people who were on the leash until they got off the leash and then we eliminated them .
Like [ Vietnamese president ] Ngo Dinh Diem . ”
Ellsberg here is referring to U.S. support for a 1963 coup involving the Ba’athist party , for which Saddam was already a prominent enforcer  and then another coup in 1968 when the Ba’athists consolidated control , after which Saddam became the power behind the nominal president .
According to one of the 1963 plotters , “ We came to power on a CIA train . ”
( Beyond providing lists of communists and leftists to be murdered , the U.S. also gave the new regime napalm to help them put down a Kurdish uprising we ’d previously encouraged . )
James Crichtfield , then head of the CIA in the Middle East , said , “ We really had the t’s crossed on what was happening . ”
This turned out not to be quite right , since factional infighting among top Iraqis required the second plot five years later for which , explained key participant Abd al - Razzaq al - Nayyif , “ you must [ also ] look to Washington . ”
Yet it appears clear on video that Kristol is genuinely startled by what Ellsberg was saying .
Consider the significance of this .
Any ordinary citizen could easily have learned about the American role in those two coups  former National Security Council staffer Roger Morris had written about it on the New York Times op - ed page just two weeks before the Kristol - Ellsberg broadcast .
And Kristol was far more than an ordinary citizen .
He ’d been near the apex of government as Quayle ’s chief of staff during the first Gulf War in 1991 .
He ’d been advocating the overthrow of the Saddam regime for years .
He ’d co-written an entire book , The War Over Iraq : Saddam ’s Tyranny and America ’s Mission , calling for an invasion of that country .
Nevertheless , Kristol was ignorant of basic , critical information about U.S. - Iraq history .
Iraqis themselves were not .
In a September 2003 article , a returning refugee explained the growing resistance to the occupation : “ One of the popular sayings I repeatedly heard in Baghdad , describing the relations between the U.S. and Saddam ’s regime , is ‘ Rah el sani ’ , ija el ussta ‘ 
‘ Gone is the apprentice , in comes the master . ' ”
What this suggests about the people running America is far worse than if they were simply malevolent super - geniuses :
They do n’t know the backstory and could n’t care less .
It ’s as though we ’re riding in the back seat of a car driven by people who demanded the wheel but are n’t sure what the gas pedal does or what a stop sign actually looks like .
Moreover , when Ellsberg tells Kristol this information , he demonstrates no desire to learn more ; nor , as best as can be discovered , has he ever mentioned it again .
Really ?
Those colored lights mean something about whether I ’m supposed to stop or go ?
Huh .
Anyway , let ’s talk more about how all of you complaining in the back seat hate freedom .
Later , when the discussion gets closer to the present , Kristol ’s demeanor changes .
He appears to be better informed and therefore shifts to straightforward lies :
“ ELLSBERG :
Why did we support Saddam as recently as when you were in the administration ?
And the answer is 
“ KRISTOL : We did n’t support Saddam when I was in the administration .
“ ELLSBERG : When were you in the administration ?
“ KRISTOL : 89 to 93 . ”
This is preposterously false .
First of all , Kristol worked in the Reagan administration as Education Secretary William Bennett ’s chief of staff  when the U.S. famously supported Saddam ’s war against Iran with loans , munitions , intelligence , and diplomatic protection for his use of chemical weapons .
After George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988 , Kristol moved to the same position in Vice President Quayle ’s office .
During the transition , Bush ’s advisors examined the country ’s Iraq policy and wrote a memo explaining to the incoming President the choice he faced .
In a nutshell , this was “ to decide whether to treat Iraq as a distasteful dictatorship to be shunned when possible , or to recognize Iraq ’s present and potential power in the region and accord it relatively high priority .
We strongly urge the latter view . ”
And Bush chose .
Internal State Department guidelines from the period stated , “ In no way should we associate ourselves with the 60 year - old Kurdish rebellion in Iraq or oppose Iraq ’s legitimate attempts to suppress it . ”
( Saddam ’s gassing of the Kurdish town of Halabja had occurred less than a year before . )
Analysts warning of Iraq ’s burgeoning nuclear program were squelched .
The Commerce Department loosened restrictions on dual - use WMD material , while Bush the elder approved new government lines of credit for Saddam over congressional objections .
And Saddam was receiving private money as well : most notably from the Atlanta branch of Italian bank BNL .
BNL staff would later report that companies wanting to sell to Iraq were referred to them by Kristol ’s then - boss , Vice President Quayle .
One Quayle family friend would end up constructing a refinery for Saddam to recycle Iraq ’s spent artillery shells .
The Bush Justice Department prevented investigators from examining transactions like this , while Commerce Department employees were ordered to falsify export licenses .
As Kristol and Ellsberg discuss the buildup to the 1991 Gulf War , Kristol , of course , continues to fiddle with reality :
“ KRISTOL : So you were against the liberation of Kuwait .
“ ELLSBERG : No , on the contrary .
At that time , a number of four star military people , former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who were foursquare for containing Saddam , preventing him by military means from getting into Saudi Arabia …
When it came to expelling him from Kuwait , they wanted to give the blockade and the embargo [ more time ] , on the belief of people like Admiral Crowe that that would be preferable to the deaths that would be involved in trying to expel him militarily .
We did n’t test that theory .
“ KRISTOL :
The argument was not that the sanctions could get him out of Kuwait .
The argument was that we could keep him out of Saudi Arabia .
Who seriously thought he could be expelled from Kuwait by sanctions ?
“ ELLSBERG : Practically everyone who testified before Senator Nunn , who is no left - wing radical .
And Senator Nunn himself .
You ’ve forgotten the history of that .
“ KRISTOL : I remember the history vividly . ”
Ellsberg is correct , of course : On November 28 , 1990 , former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral William Crowe testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee and its chairman Sen. Sam Nunn ( D - Ga . ) .
Crowe stated : “ [ W ]e should give sanctions a fair chance …
I personally believe they will bring [ Saddam ] to his knees ”  by which Crowe meant Iraq would be “ pushed out of Kuwait . ”
The same message was delivered by General David Jones , another former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman .
The next day , the lede in a page one New York Times story was that Crowe and Jones had “ urged the Bush Administration today to postpone military action against Iraq and to give economic sanctions a year or more to work . ”
It ’s not like Kristol could have missed all this , since the Bush administration immediately disputed such commentary  and one of its point men for the push back was none other than Dan Quayle .
An early December 1990 article about a Quayle speech reported : “ [ Quayle ] specifically cited the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee ” where “ voices have argued that the Bush Administration should allow time for economic sanctions against Iraq to work , getting President Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait voluntarily rather than using force to dislodge him . ”
( Unfortunately , there ’s no available reporting on whether Quayle ’s chief of staff wrote this speech for him . )
Then there ’s Kristol ’s curious explanation of his views on how the Gulf War ended  that moment when George H.W. Bush called upon the Iraqi people to overthrow Saddam and then , despite having smashed Saddam ’s army and controlling Iraq ’s air space , let the dictator ’s helicopter gunships take to the air and crush a Shi’ite uprising .
There were even reports the administration forbade the Saudis from aiding the uprising and that U.S. troops blew up caches of Iraqi weapons rather than allow the rebels to use them .
Kristol , however , uses his courtier ’s skills to remake reality more pleasingly :
“ KRISTOL : I was unhappy in 1991 when we stopped the war and left this brutal tyrant in power .
I think we betrayed the people who rose up against Saddam , a genuine popular uprising .
That was a big mistake on the part of the Bush administration .
A political mistake and a moral mistake . ”
So that ’s clear : Kristol feels the decision was immoral .
Or… was it ?
“ KRISTOL : I do n’t think these were simply immoral decisions by the president .
These were judgment calls .
There were reasons .
There were arguments .
There were n’t simply 
“ ELLSBERG : But they were immoral 
“ KRISTOL : Well , no , that ’s not so easy to call a political decision an immoral decision .
That ’s fancy footwork for you !
On the one hand , Kristol wants us to know that the decision was indeed “ a moral mistake . ”
The implication is that he should be respected in the post- invasion moment of 2003 as the sort of sensitive tough guy who would indeed invade Iraq to make up for past decisions that lacked morality .
On the other hand , we ’re talking about a former Republican president and the present President ’s father .
A straightforward declaration of “ immorality , ” if pursued far enough , could easily hurt future employment prospects .
Kristol has absolutely perfect pitch , managing to strike a blow for moral beauty in politics while maintaining career viability .
Ellsberg then asks questions aimed at just this issue :
“ ELLSBERG : Did you consider doing more than disagree ?
Perhaps putting out the word of your dissent ?
Perhaps resigning with documents and revealing those to the press and the Congress ?
“ KRISTOL [ scoffing ] : I had no documents to put out .
There were no secrets about the President ’s policy …
We did n’t want to occupy Baghdad .
The rebellion would have failed anyway .
We would have gotten in deeper . ”
Hmmm .
No secrets about Bush the elder ’s policy .
Yet there was something that most certainly was secret about the rebellions at end of the Gulf War : Saddam was using chemical weapons to put down the Shi’ite uprising in the south .
Rumored since 1991 , this has been confirmed by the most impeccable source imaginable  the CIA ’s final 2004 report on Iraq ’s WMD .
According to the report , the Iraqi military used Sarin nerve agent , dropped from the helicopters the U.S. had given them permission to fly .
The CIA goes onto to suggest the U.S. government knew about this at the time , describing “ reports of attacks in 1991 from refugees and Iraqi military deserters . ”
And Gulf
War veterans have said they passed such reports up the chain of command .
Did Kristol know it then ?
Probably not .
But even today there ’s no sign he knows : he and the Weekly Standard appear never to have mentioned it .
As with the coups in 1963 and 1968 , Kristol ’s ignorance is of a peculiarly convenient variety .
In any case , here ’s what Kristol did know : the Bush administration made the choices it did at war ’s end not because , as Kristol says , they felt “ the rebellion would have failed . ”
Their fear was exactly the opposite : that the rebellion would succeed .
Yes , the Bush administration preferred Saddam gone , but it wanted him replaced by some other , more amenable group or leader from the Sunni military elite .
It most certainly did not want a popular uprising that might leave a largely Shiite government in power in Baghdad , potentially close to Iran .
Even worse was the possibility Iraq could fracture , with power shifting to the oil - rich Shi’ite south .
As an administration official told Peter Galbraith , then a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer , “ [ O ] ur policy is to get rid of Saddam Hussein , not the regime . ”
Later , New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman explained that Washington was looking for “ the best of all worlds : an iron - fisted Iraqi junta without Saddam Hussein . ”
Kristol ’s predictions that March day in 2003 are every bit as on target as his descriptions of the past .
When Ellsberg raises the possibility of the new Iraq war coming to resemble Vietnam in some fashion , Kristol insists that this is utterly preposterous : “ It ’s not going to happen .
This is going to be a two - month war . ”
Here ’s the exchange when they turn to what will happen to Iraq ’s Kurds :
“ ELLSBERG : The Kurds have every reason to believe they will be betrayed again by the United States , as so often in the past .
The spectacle of our inviting Turks into this war … could not have been reassuring to the Kurds …
“ KRISTOL : I ’m against betraying the Kurds .
Surely your point is n’t that because we betrayed them in the past we should betray them this time ?
“ ELLSBERG : Not that we should , just that we will .
“ KRISTOL : We will not .
We will not . ”
This past December , we did .
The Bush administration officially looked the other way while Turkey carried out a 50 - plane bombing raid on Iraqi Kurdistan against the PKK , a Kurdish rebel group .
Ken Silverstein of Harper ’s reprinted an email from a former U.S. official there that said , in part :
“ The blowback here in Kurdistan is building against the U.S. government because of its help with the Turkish air strikes .
The theme is shock and betrayal …
The people killed and wounded were villagers , not PKK fighters or support people .
The initial explanation from Washington that the United States did not authorize the Turkish strike is bullsh*t , and every Kurd here knows it . ”
No mention of the bombing has appeared in the Weekly Standard .
It ’s fair to assume , however , that Kristol will eventually call America ’s actions there “ a moral mistake , ” while emphasizing that “ these were judgment calls .
There were reasons .
There were arguments . ”
Back in 2003 , Kristol was also quite certain , almost touchingly so , that the Bush administration would be well served by relying on Iraqi exiles :
“ KRISTOL : We have tens of thousands of Shia exiles [ who ] have come back to help contribute to the liberation of Iraq .
“ ELLSBERG : I ’m afraid the people who propose this war have failed one lesson of intelligence history , which is not to rely too much on the knowledge of people who have left the country …
The people who ’ve come to this country may very well underestimate the desire of those people not to be governed by foreigners . ”
This lesson of history goes back a long way .
Book II , Chapter XXXI of Machiavelli ’s Discourses on Livy is titled “ How Dangerous It Is to Believe Exiles ” :
“ It ought to be considered , therefore , how vain are the faith and promises of those who find themselves deprived of their country … such is the extreme desire in them to return home , that they naturally believe many things that are false and add many others by art , so that between those they believe and those they say they believe , they fill you with hope , so that relying on them you will incur expenses in vain , or you undertake an enterprise in which you ruin yourself …
A Prince , therefore , ought to go slowly in undertaking an enterprise upon the representations of an exile , for most of the times he will be left either with shame or very grave injury . ”
The Weekly Standard ‘s archives show Kristol has published quite a few articles on how political correctness in elite U.S. universities is strangling the teaching of the Western canon .
And you can understand where he ’s coming from :
While Kristol himself received a PhD in government from Harvard , it obviously was during a period when radical multiculturalists had completely expunged Machiavelli from the curriculum .
When will the PC brigade ever learn ?
Teaching Toni Morrison starts wars .
Finally , there ’s the most telling moment of the entire two hours , when a caller asks Kristol something he does not at all expect :
“ CALLER : I wonder how we reconcile these views with how we treat the American Indians ?
“ KRISTOL : [ raising eyebrows , chuckling ]
Well , I think the American Indians are now full citizens of the United States of America .
We have injustices in our past in treating the American Indians .
I ’m for equal rights for American Indians and for liberating the people of Iraq from this horrible tyranny . ”
Kristol obviously finds the caller ’s perspective ridiculous .
But the man had , in fact , asked the most profound question possible .
After all , there is a deep cultural connection running from our conquest of the continent to the invasion of Iraq .
While Americans have mostly forgotten this , the early settlers did not perceive themselves as simply pushing Indians out of the way .
Rather , they came here with the very best of intentions .
The 1629 seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony is a picture of an American Indian , who is saying , “ Come over and help us . ”
Three hundred seventy - three years later in 2002 , Ahmed Chalabi was being paid by the U.S. government to tell Americans to come over and “ help the Iraqi people . ”
In his book The Winning of the West , Teddy Roosevelt wrote that no nation “ has ever treated the original savage owners of the soil with such generosity as has the United States . ”
In 2004 , Fred Barnes wrote ( in the Weekly Standard ) that the invasion of Iraq might be “ the greatest act of benevolence one country has ever done for another . ”
Kristol finishes the C - Span show with a crescendo :
“ The moral credentials of this war are strong .
We ’ll see if we follow through .
I agree with Mr. Ellsberg on this , if we ’re not serious about helping the Iraqi people rebuild their country and about helping promote decent democratic government in Iraq … it will be a much less morally satisfying and fully defensible war …
I ’m happy to be held to a moral standard .
I ask that it be a serious moral standard . ”
So , there you have it : a complex , rich experience to be savored by anyone who enjoys watching a master at the very peak of his craft .
Yet trying to encapsulate Kristol ’s now almost five - year - old chilling performance by turning it into a bitter joke only takes us so far .
After all , the joke is on us .
Kristol indeed has been held to a moral standard , but it ’s the moral standard of Rupert Murdoch and , more recently , the New York Times .
What we learn from this dusty vinyl LP is that some of the most powerful men and institutions in our country are genuinely depraved .
They provide Kristol with his prominence not in spite of performances like this one , but precisely because of them .
Kristol is giving them just what they want .
The fact that he ’s a propagandist straight out of Pravda ‘s archives makes the same impression on them as the fact that John Lennon was a great songwriter might make on you or me .
Of course he is .
That ’s why we bought the album .

Mr. Gates no longer attends senior leadership team meetings , and earlier this month he made what company executives described as a farewell appearance at the annual Microsoft sales force meeting in Orlando , Fla .
When Mr. Gates finished his speech to the thousands of sales people at the meeting , they gave him a five - minute standing ovation , underscoring the bond the company still retains with its co-founder , according to a person who attended the event .

But as he cedes Microsoft ’s technology leadership to Mr. Mundie and Mr. Ozzie , the company is struggling with a radical transition in the computer industry .
Six months ago , Microsoft shipped its long - delayed Windows Vista operating system , and there is widespread belief within the industry that the era of such unwieldy and vast software development projects is coming to an end .
Ubiquitous broadband networks and high speed wireless networks have for the first time given rise to meaningful alternatives to bulky and costly personal computers .
In their place are a proliferating collection of smart connected devices that are tied together by a vast array of Internet - based information services based in centralized data centers .
The industry is rushing to “ software as a service ” models ranging from Salesforce.com , a San Francisco company that sells business contact software delivered via Web browsers , to Apple ’s iPhone , which is designed as a classic “ thin client , ” a computer that requires the Internet for many of its capabilities .
It is a vision that Microsoft itself has at least partially embraced .
Microsoft , in contrast , is calling its strategy “ software plus services , ” an approach that is intended to protect the company ’s existing installed base .
During the interview , all three executives indicated that Microsoft is now moving quickly to offer new Internet services for personal computer users .
Centralized data storage will make it possible for PC users to gain access to most or all of their information from all of the different types of computers they use , whether they are desktops , laptops or smartphones , and wherever they are located .
During the transition , Mr. Gates has also stayed closely involved in shaping Microsoft ’s strategy in the search market where it has been assiduously attempting to catch Google and Yahoo .

LOS ANGELES , Nov. 8 — At least two major television studios , 20th Century Fox and CBS Paramount , have sent breach - of - contract letters to the show runners on their current series who have stopped performing their production duties once they went on strike with other television writers .
The move is an escalation of hardball tactics by the studios .
This week , the studios said they expected that the show runners — the writer - producers who oversee some of the biggest hits on television — would continue to work on the shows by performing nonwriting duties .
But after many of the industry ’s top show runners said publicly that they did not intend to do any work as long as the strike by members of the Writers Guild of America continued , the studios began notifying the writer - producers that they would no longer be paid as producers if they failed to show up at work .
CBS Paramount — the studio behind hits like “ CSI ” and its spinoffs and “ Rules of Engagement , ” which are broadcast on CBS , and “ Medium , ” on NBC — began sending the letters this week after some show runners did not show up for work once the writers ’ strike began on Monday , according to a person involved in the production of network television shows who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
Last January in Freehold Township , N.J. , a car driven by a 17 - year - old high school student , with two fellow students as passengers , passed a car being driven by another teenager at 70 miles an hour in a 50 - mile zone .
The passing vehicle crashed into an oncoming van .
Three boys and the 68 - year - old van driver were killed .
It is an all too familiar tale , prompting parents and school officials alike to wonder why risky behavior is so common among teenagers and what might be done to curtail it .
Is it that teenagers think that they are immortal or invulnerable , immune to the hazards adults see so clearly ?
Or do they not appreciate the risks involved and need repeated reminders of the dangers inherent in activities like driving too fast , driving drunk , having unprotected sex , experimenting with drugs , binge drinking , jumping into unknown waters , you name it ?
None of the above , says Valerie F. Reyna , professor of human development and psychology at the New York State College of Human Ecology at Cornell .
The facts are quite the opposite .
Scientific studies have shown that adolescents are very well aware of their vulnerability and that they actually overestimate their risk of suffering negative effects from activities like drinking and unprotected sex .
For example , a study by researchers at the University of California , San Francisco , found that teenagers were more likely than adults to overestimate risks for every outcome studied , from low - probability events like contracting H.I.V. to higher - probability ones like acquiring more common sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant from a single act of unprotected sex .

There are billions of galaxies in the visible universe .
How Big is the Universe ?
by Brent Tully
How big is the universe ?
Could it be infinitely large ?
If the universe has an edge , what is beyond the edge ?
And if the universe had a beginning , what was going on before that ?
Our experience of the everyday world does not prepare us to grasp the concept of an infinite universe .
And yet , trying to imagine that the cosmos actually has a boundary does not make things any easier .
There is an edge to what we are able to see and could ever possibly see in the universe .
Light travels at 300,000 kilometers per second .
That 's top speed in this universe — nothing can go faster — but it 's relatively slow compared to the distances to be traveled .
The nearest big galaxy to our Milky Way , the Andromeda galaxy , is two million light - years away .
The most distant galaxies we can now see are 10 or 12 billion light - years away .
We could never see a galaxy that is farther away in light travel time than the universe is old — an estimated 14 billion or so years .
Thus , we are surrounded by a " horizon " that we cannot look beyond — a horizon set by the distance that light can travel over the age of the universe .
This horizon describes the visible universe — a region some 28 billion light years in diameter .
But what are the horizons of a civilization that inhabits the most distant galaxies we see ?
And what about galaxies at the limits of their vision ?
There is every reason to think that the universe extends a long way beyond the part of the universe we can see .
In fact , a variety of observations suggest that our visible patch may be a small fraction — maybe an infinitely small fraction — of the whole universe .
This view of the universe fits with the currently popular idea that the universe began with a vast expansion of size .
The idea describes a kind of undirected energy present in the vacuum of space , called scalar fields , that somehow got channeled into a process called " inflation . "
By conservative estimates , the universe expanded so much during this period that something the size of an atom inflated to the size of a galaxy .
If this grand idea is correct , then the universe is larger than we ever could have imagined .
But the question remains :
Is there a boundary , and if so , what lies in the voids beyond ?
The answer , according to some cosmologists , is truly mind - boggling .
If the universe sprung forth in this manner , then probably inflation has occurred in other places , perhaps an infinite number of places , beyond our horizon and outside of our time .
The implication is that there are other universes , perhaps similar to ours or vastly different , each in its own space and begun in its own time .
The universe began with a vast explosion that generated space and time .
Inflation implies a vastly expanded concept of what the universe is .
But the concept is also helping us to understand the universe we see around us .
Take , for example , the recent observation that the universe is not only expanding — a fact astronomers have known for over seven decades — but actually accelerating outward .
That discovery is the subject of NOVA 's program " Runaway Universe . "
While we can never directly " see " the whole of the universe or glimpse its farthest horizons , we can discover how it is behaving — how fast it 's growing , whether its growth will one day come to a halt , and what forces have been driving its evolution on the largest of scales .
The evidence for the cosmic acceleration — the observations of distant exploding stars called supernovae ( see Birth of a Supernova ) — provides a window onto these behaviors .
The discovery of cosmic acceleration was made by examining the light of supernovae .
We astronomers believe we know the intrinsic brightness of a particular kind of supernovae , called " Type Ia , " so we can calculate how far such an object must be from us by its apparent , or measured , brightness .
We also know how fast the supernovae — and the galaxies they 're in — are rushing away from us by measuring their " redshift . "
Redshift refers to a color shift in the light of galaxies toward the red end of the spectrum as they race away from us .
The faster a galaxy is moving away , the redder its light becomes .
( For more on this phenomenon , go to Moving Targets . )
What we are looking for in this combination of redshift and distance is the " growth rate " of the universe going back in time .
This growth rate tells us about the gravity of all the matter in the universe — if there is a lot of matter it will slow down the growth rate over time .
Take the case of a universe with so much matter that gravity arrests the expansion and everything finally collapses in on itself .
We call that a " closed " universe .
In such a universe , the expansion would have once been much faster .
To get to the separations between galaxies that we see now would have taken a relatively short time .
Granted , the numbers associated with " relatively short " might still seem daunting .
A second possibility might be a universe that is practically empty , often called an " open " universe .
Yes , there must be enough stuff in it to permit the existence of observers like us , but suppose the total amount of matter has negligible gravitational influence on the expansion .
This universe is just cruising at the same expansion rate now as in the past .
Compared with the first possibility , the closed universe , expansions in the past would have to have been slower to get the presently observed separations between galaxies .
And it would mean that a distant supernova observed to be rushing away from us at such - and - such a speed ( redshift ) is farther away in this case , compared to the dense , closed universe case .
In the closed universe case , since expansion was faster in the past , one does n't have to go so far away ( back in time ) to arrive at a specified redshift .
See a comparison between open and closed universes .
Flash required
So does either of these possibilities describe our universe ?
No !
The one that comes closest is the " open " universe .
However , the supernovae are too faint — that is , they are so far away that even that model does n't allow the supernovae to travel as far away as astronomers observe .
Our universe , the real one , must have been loitering after its initial inflationary period , but then put its foot to the accelerator recently to produce the present separations of galaxies .
Whatever could produce that acceleration ?
Certainly there is nothing in our Earthly experience that prepares us for such a possibility .
This is where the theory of inflation comes into play .
Now about two decades old , inflation entertains the idea that there is a kind of energy that causes space to expand .
This energy competes with gravity , though certainly not on local scales .
However , should this form of energy come to dominate , watch out !
While gravity tries to crush , this energy — call it vacuum energy , or the scalar field , or the energy represented by the Cosmological Constant in Einstein 's equations describing the dynamics of the universe — tries to expand the fabric of space , pushing everything apart .
The basic proposition of the inflation model is that this form of energy once dominated gravity and caused our universe to burst forth .
It turns out that the basic inflation picture satisfies a number of observed facts about the universe .
One fact is particularly interesting because the better our observations become the more tightly they agree with a prediction of the inflation model .
This is that the universe should be " flat " — no overall curvature of space .
Spectacularly convincing evidence — recent measurements of irregularities in the microwave background radiation — supports this proposition .
More about experiments on microwave background radiation .
The microwave radiation comes to us from the time in the past when the universe was a primordial fireball .
We see a " surface " like we see the " surface " of the sun .
We can't look into the sun ( or a cloud in the sky ) because of scattering of light .
As with the sun and its spots , the surface of last scattering of the primordial fireball had structure caused by localized regions that were hotter or cooler , less or more dense .
The most pronounced of these structures at the cosmological surface of last scattering were governed by the distance that acoustic ( pressure ) waves could travel in the age of the universe back then , when the universe was about a half million years old .
The size of these irregularities gives us a ruler !
The radiation was emitted so long ago , so far away , that it has been redshifted down to millimeter wavelengths .
So now millimeter experiments determine the angular size of the clumps caused by acoustic oscillations in the cooling universe at the surface of the last scattering .
We know how big the clumps were — a couple hundred thousand light years across .
The relation between their real size , their distance , and the angular size that we observe is governed by the geometry of the universe .
A universe dense with matter will distort the final size one way , an empty or almost empty universe will distort another way , and the flat universe of the inflation model will produce yet a different image , which we would intuitively call undistorted .
Lo and behold , the results are in agreement with the flat universe of inflation .
This is not the full story .
The theory of inflation predicts a precise recipe of how structure would form from little things merging into big things and tells us how many little things there should be for each big thing .
The observations match with expectations if the mix of energy and matter is the same as that suggested by the supernovae experiments .
Inflation also solves the old controversy over the Hubble Constant , the relationship between the rate galaxies are flying apart and the distances between them .
If the Hubble Constant is large then galaxies are relatively close together and the implied age of the universe is way too short if the universe has been briskly expanding .
The universe can not be younger than things in it .
However , if the universe has been loitering and is now accelerating , then it is old enough and a large Hubble Constant is still possible .
And we can actually make a direct measurement of the mass density of the universe by looking at the motions of galaxies that slosh in the gravitational wells of the matter .
We find something that has come to be called " dark matter " there .
If the universe is " flat , " then this state is achieved through the sum of the mass and energy density .
Measurements of gravity perturbations reveal just the needed complement of matter offsetting the repulsive energy indicated by the supernova measurements .
The last couple of years have seen a remarkable convergence of evidence , all suggesting that we live in a universe with a few percent of the normal matter of our everyday experience , maybe 25 % of something called " dark matter , " which is a name given to hide our ignorance of what it is , and 75 % of this energy that wants to push space apart — call it " dark energy . "
If true , then relatively recently in the history of the universe the " dark energy " has become dominant over " dark matter . "
During the transient dominance of dark matter , it caused the collapse into all the structure of the universe that we have come to know and appreciate .
Maybe we should be less enamored of dark energy .
But it is the delight of physicists because it might provide a laboratory for the moment of creation .
It may be that the present source of repulsion is quite different from the primordial situation .
Certainly the energy density levels and time scales are vastly different .
However , if we can understand the mechanism of the present acceleration perhaps we can get a clue about the acceleration at the first instant of our time .
A complicated scenario indeed !
So how big is the universe in the inflation model ?
It begs the question of what is going on at the boundaries and whether information could be communicated across universes .
We suppose not .
It may well be that only a tiny part of even our own universe is in our horizon , within the domain that we might hope to know .
Brent Tully , an astronomer at the University of Hawaii , works on problems having to do with the formation of structure and distribution of dark matter in the universe .
The discovery of a tight correlation between the rotation rates and absolute luminosities of galaxies became known as the " Tully - Fisher " relation and provides one of the best ways of measuring the size and age of the universe .
Tully was Science Advisor and Co-Producer of the NOVA film " Runaway Universe . "

BBC News , Orissa
Some of the displaced are in a refugee camp in the town of Bamunigan
Hundreds of families in a remote region of the eastern Indian state of Orissa remain homeless and without support after a wave of violence swept the region last month .
The minority Christian community in Kandhamal district , many of whom are forest tribal people and low - caste Dalit converts from Hinduism to to Christianity , say they 've been targeted by radical Hindu nationalist organisations seeking to put an end to the church and its activities in the region .
This is rejected by the Hindu groups who say the violence is the consequence of local issues unconnected with their presence in the area .
The district has remained under night - time curfew since the tensions erupted and has been largely inaccessible to foreign journalists until now .
Repeated pattern
Father Ravi Samasundar stands amid the burned out ruins of his church in the town of Bamunigan .
Lakhanananda Saraswati says he was attacked by a mob
" They brought oil , and kerosene , piled everything they could find in the middle of the church and set fire to it .
They destroyed or looted everything . "
Across this remote region , deep in the highland forests , the pattern was repeated over and over .
Churches were ransacked , entire villages razed and their inhabitants forced to flee into the forests .
The violence , which began on Christmas Eve , has now largely abated , but the plight of the people has not .
Many are now living in the shells of their burned out homes , all their possessions lost .
The conflict has pitted Hindu against Christian , tribal against non-tribal .
All share some responsibility for what has happened , all have suffered .
Years of relatively peaceful co-existence of these communities , living a fragile rural existence , has been shattered .
Seething
The Christian community blames the virulently anti-Christian rhetoric of Hindu nationalist organisations ; and one person in particularly , a revered local holy man , Lakhanananda Saraswati .
Father Ravi Samasundar seethes with anger at what has been happening .
" Saraswati speaks against Christianity , against the priests , against the nuns , " he says .
Hindu activists accuse the local Christian community of stirring up trouble by making " unreasonable " demands - a reference to their attempts to be granted the same preferential access to jobs and education given to low - caste Hindus and tribal communities .
" Political parties or organisations have nothing to do with this .
It is a clear social problem " , says Jagabandhu Mishra , editor of Rashtra Deepa - a newspaper in the local Oriya language , which reflects the more extreme views of the Hindu nationalists .
When I met Mr Misra in his office , the front page of a recent addition of the paper lay on the desk between us .
It accused the ' Sons of Jesus ' of attacking Hindus , and reported on a Christian mob brutally injuring the local Hindu leader Saraswati , an event which triggered much of the worst violence , and which subsequently turned out to be entirely false .
Was there , I asked , a campaign of conversion , or re-conversion of Christians to Hinduism in the area ?
" If those Hindus who converted to Christianity want to come back , " he told me , " the door is now open to them . "
Christian mob
No side is left blameless in this conflict .
After the initial attacks on church institutions and the shops and homes of Christian families , Christian mobs responded in kind .
A Hindu woman walks through her destroyed village
In the village of Gadapur , Hindu families , standing amid the charred rubble of their homes , told me how a mob of tribal Christians had descended on them , forcing them to flee into the forest , before destroying every shop and dwelling in the village .
For those now living in makeshift tents , or in the ruins of their old homes , aid from the state government has been limited : a few tents , some plastic sheeting , food and cooking utensils .
But far more is needed on a sustained basis .
Ministers from the Hindu nationalist BJP - controlled state government have toured the area , made promises , but pledged little constructive support for those in most need .
Perhaps more alarmingly , NGOs and church organisations have been banned from offering direct assistance .
The official reason given is that by helping one community and not another , they may provoke further violence .
Interest rates
Church and other aid organisations , desperate to help their local communities see sinister motives at work .
This elderly Hindu woman lives with her adopted Christian son
" This conflict is fought in the name of religion , " says NGO worker Kailash Chandra Dandpath , " but the real motives are economic and political .
" The business community here , with its links to the Hindu nationalist organisations , were once in complete control here .
They 'd lend money to the tribals and the Dalits at incredibly high rates of interest , up to 120 % per year , and then the debtor would have to sell his farm produce to the lender at a price controlled by the businessmen . "
Mr Dandpath is describing the system still widely practiced in India , of bonded exploitation , where a family might well be indebted to the lender for generations .
" What 's happening now " , says Mr Dandpath , " is that the farmers , the most marginalised of whom are from tribal and Christian communities , are being linked by the NGOs to local banks , lending at perhaps 10 % interest a year - ten times less .
" This is clearly a threat to the businessmen .
And they are trying to break this link , using religion as an excuse ... in India , the easiest method of politics is to take religion to divide and rule . "
The dynamics of conflict are rarely easy to dissect .
There are always economic and social divisions within society to be exploited by those more rich and powerful , particularly when the existing order is threatened .
And there 's no doubt that the diverse communities in Kandhamal district have suffered a terrible tragedy in recent weeks , which threatens to break down the existing delicate social order there forever .

Yesterday , I discovered that The Times ( UK ) , a well - respected newspaper owned by News Corp. , is involved in an extensive campaign to spam social media websites with links to Timesonline .
co.uk articles .
Since 2004 , The Times retained the established SEO consulting firm Sitelynx to handle their search engine marketing .
Working on behalf of The Times , a Sitelynx employee posted thousands of links to community and social news websites , including Mahalo , Del.icio.us , StumbleUpon , Metafilter , Yahoo !
Answers , Ma.gnolia , and Netscape ’s Propeller .
His actions were done without any disclosure of his affiliation to Sitelynx or The Times and were , in some cases , posted under the assumed identity of his wife .
Update : The Times did n’t know what Sitelynx was doing , the Sitelynx employee was fired suspended , and The Sun is also involved .
See the updates at the bottom of this entry .
What do the creators of Del.icio.us , Metafilter , and Mahalo think of this ?
I asked them !
The accounts were all created by Piotr ( or Peter ) Wyspianski , an SEO Manager at Sitelynx since June 2007 .
( Though his Linked In resume says “ Executive . ” )
Before coming to Sitelynx , Piotr had a history of promoting his own business , an online jewelry store called Signature Gems , by using his profiles on sites like Myspace , Flickr , and Yahoo 360 to manipulate his search engine rankings .
After coming to Sitelynx , he continued to use this technique to promote The Times .
( A full breakdown of his accounts on each site is below . )
For me , it ’s disappointing to see a well regarded , legitimate newspaper using these tactics to gain headway against their online competitors .
Founded in 1785 , The Times is one of the world ’s longest - running papers , the namesake for the New York Times and the paper that originally commissioned Times New Roman .
I ’m sincerely hoping that The Times did n’t authorize undisclosed , deceptive spamming in their partnership with Sitelynx .
It ’s even possible that Wyspianski is a rogue SEO working autonomously , and Sitelynx is n’t even aware of his actions .
To find out , I contacted Graham Hansell yesterday , the founder of Sitelynx and head of strategy , but he did n’t respond .
I ’m not having any luck finding an appropriate contact at The Times either , but if you know someone there who can help address these questions , please get in contact with me immediately by email or IM .
( Update : The Times contacted me , see more in the updates below . )
This quote from a 2004 article , which seems to be The Times ’ only public statement on working with Sitelynx :
Simon Christy , marketing manager at Times Online , which has just signed up Sitelynx to improve its search visibility , agrees .
“ In the past it has been down to the techies to get their heads around SEO , but it ’s now moved into the remit of marketers , ” he says .
“ I see it as the fundamental building block or starting point for any search marketing strategy .
Once you have the natural side sorted , then you can start spending money on the PPC side . ”
Each of the accounts below is used exclusively for posting links to Timesonline .co.uk , his jewelry business , or a combination of both .
( In case the accounts get removed , I ’ve included the date he began posting and a rough count of the number of Times links . )
Mahalo. 25 links .
Joined on January 24 .
Eight links were accepted , making him the 51st most popular Mahalo user .

( In particular , I ’m stunned that he did n’t go after Digg . )
Update ( January 31 )
Tom Whitwell , Times Online ’s Communities Editor ( and author of the outstanding Music Thing blog ) , contacted me this morning .
Apparently , Sitelynx fired suspended Piotr Wyspianski .
“ We did n’t realize Sitelynx were doing this kind of linkspamming , ” he said .
“ They were paid to do link building , not just dropping bulk links . ”
Also , with help from Eliot Phillips of Propeller , we identified a second Sitelynx employee that ’s been promoting links for sister newspaper The Sun , albeit on a much smaller scale .
The Propeller username was “ silvermoon78 , ” which the Propeller team confirmed was created using the same IP address as Piotr Wyspianski .
Looking for this username on Twitter gives us a name , Sibylle Bernardakis , the Online PR Manager of Sitelynx .
Aside from Propeller , Sibylle was submitting and promoting The Sun links on Digg.com since at least November 2006 , but her account was removed late last year .
On StumbleUpon , using another username , she ’s posted 789 links to Times , Sun , and London Paper articles over the last two years ( though only added the Sitelynx disclosure earlier today ) .
( As some commenters pointed out , Piotr also promoted on Digg , but not often . )
After I relayed this new information , Tom said , “ We just spoke to The Sun , he ’s going to talk to his people at Sitelynx . ”
Graham Hansell , founder of Sitelynx , instant messaged me today .
( He apologized for not responding earlier , as he was on holiday . )
He stated that Piotr was not fired , but suspended from Sitelynx , pending an investigation following UK HR law .
In an email to me , Graham said , “ Piotr Wyspianski did indeed work for Sitelynx from July 2007 but only as an onsite SEO consultant to bring awareness and training to journalists at the Timesonline .
co.uk about issues raised by the Search Engine Friendly demands of News journalism . ”
“ From that perspective he has been working with Timesonline .
co.uk but was not authorised to distribute links even though low volume link building through online PR is a recommendation , ” Graham wrote .
“ He has now been removed from the account and will be disciplined in due course for unauthorised activities . ”
I asked Graham about Sibylle Bernardakis , “ Aside from the fact that she was trained to do it and Piotr was not , what ’s the practical difference between , for example , her 790 StumbleUpon links and Piotr ’s 330 links on Propeller ? ”
Graham responded , “ She has followed our policy for submissions — Disclaimers where possible , latest news only , direct linking ( no redirect ) to valuable content , no hidden links or promotional content . ”
I pointed out that it appeared Sibylle never disclosed her affiliations before she modified her profiles earlier today .
Graham replied , “ That I am not aware of and will investigate .
I do n’t believe that to be true and we are obviously reviewing our internal policy for greater transparency . ”
Thanks , Graham !

The industry ’s new round of muscle - flexing comes as the political and cultural environment for video games has improved significantly .
Image Michael Gallagher , of the Entertainment Software Association , said donations will let politicians know we are behind them . 
Credit ... Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times
The high - water mark of political dudgeon about games came in 2005 when scenes of mild sexual provocation were discovered hidden with the code for the game Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
In the wake of the controversy Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed legislation to increase federal regulation of the game industry .
That proposal , however , found little traction on Capitol Hill .
Meanwhile , federal courts have consistently invoked the First Amendment in striking down state attempts to regulate games more strictly than other media .
Now , Senator Clinton has appeared to make peace with the game industry , perhaps recognizing that while games were largely a children ’s pastime in the 1980s , those children have now grown up , are voting , and are still enjoying video games .
The average age of a gamer is now near 30 , according to industry surveys .
“ Games are a way that more and more people are spending their leisure time , and you do yourself a disservice as a candidate to attack how people spend that leisure time , ” Robert A. Kotick , chairman of Activision , a top independent game publisher , said .
Mr. Kotick described the new PAC as “ a great first step ” but he cautioned that the film and music industries would still enjoy far more sway in Washington than the game industry , not least because “ people like Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen help raise millions of dollars for candidates . ”
( In any case , the game industry is usually aligned with the music and film industries when it comes to lobbying efforts . )
Along with the evolving political climate , games have also become more accessible and less threatening in the broader culture .
Nintendo ’s
Wii console , introduced in 2006 , has been a big part of that shift , drawing in both children and older players with its simple point - and - wave control scheme .
Music - oriented game franchises like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero have become mass - market hits , while middle - aged women have become the top audience for puzzle games like Bookworm .
From Greg
Ip at the WSJ : Fed Joins Other Banks in Measures To Inject More Funds Into Markets
The Federal Reserve has joined with four other major central banks to announce a series of measures designed to inject added cash into global money markets in hopes of thawing a credit freeze that threatens their economies .
The Fed said today it would create a new " term auction facility " under which it would lend at least $ 40 billion and potentially far more , in four separate auctions starting this week .
The loans would be at rates far below the rate charged on direct loans from the Fed to banks from its so - called " discount window . "
But the new loans can still be secured by the same , broad variety of collateral available that banks pledge for discount window loans .
...
The Fed also said it had created reciprocal " swap " lines with the European Central Bank , for $ 20 billion , and the Swiss National Bank , for $ 4 billion .
These will enable the ECB and SNB to make dollar loans to banks in their jurisdiction , in hopes of putting downward pressure on interbank dollar rates in the offshore markets , principally the London Interbank Offered Rate , or Libor , market .
The inability of foreign central banks to inject funds in anything other than their own currency has been a factor creating the squeeze on bank funding in those markets .
...
The new " term auction facility " overcomes the principal obstacles the Fed has faced using its two main tools for injecting liquidity .
Open market operations can be used to inject cash at the federal funds rate , which is relatively cheap , but only against a limited range of collateral .
The discount rate , on the other hand , is half a point higher than the federal funds rate and banks are reluctant to access it for fear of the stigma of being seen to be desperate for funds .
The new loans will be auctioned off with a minimum rate linked to the expected actual federal funds rate over the duration of the loan .
Since the federal funds rate is expected to decline over the next two months , when the loans will be outstanding , the loan rate could end up being close to or even below the current federal funds rate .
The path ahead is uncertain .
There are strong private incentives to market players to recognise early and transparently their exposures to off - balance sheet entities and to accelerate the re-pricing of asset - backed securities .
Policy actions must be supportive of this process .
Injections of liquidity in normal money market operations against high quality collateral are unlikely by themselves to bring down the LIBOR spreads that reflect a need for banks collectively to finance the expansion of their balance sheets .
To do that , general injections of liquidity against a wider range of collateral would be necessary .
But unless they were made available at an appropriate penalty rate , they would encourage in future the very risk - taking that has led us to where we are .
All central banks are aware that there are circumstances in which action might be necessary to prevent a major shock to the system as a whole .
Balancing these considerations will pose considerable challenges , and in present circumstances judging that balance is something we do almost daily .
The key objectives remain , first , the continuous pursuit of the inflation target to maintain economic stability and , second , ensuring that the financial system continues to function effectively , including the proper pricing of risk .
If risk continues to be under - priced , the next period of turmoil will be on an even bigger scale .
The current turmoil , which has at its heart the earlier under - pricing of risk , has disturbed the unusual serenity of recent years , but , managed properly , it should not threaten our long - run economic stability .
emphasis added
So much for discouraging future risk taking .
Here is what the BofE's Mervyn King said in September :
The idea of lending “ quickly , freely and readily ” during a crisis , but at a penalty rate , and only on good collateral , comes from Walter Bagehot 's 1873 “ Lombard Street ” .

Last updated at 11:57 03 January 2008
The girl is 15 years old but looks much younger .
Her face has the fine - boned elegance typical of her native Somalia , but her accent belongs to the streets of East London .
She is plainly terrified .
That much is clear from the way she avoids eye contact and constantly fidgets in her chair .
" Promise you wo n't print my name or anything ? " she implores repeatedly .
" Promise no one will ever know that I 've spoken to you ?
If people in my community find out , they 'll say that I 've betrayed them and I 'll have to run away .
And anyway , I do n't want my parents to be sent to jail . "
With great courage , this British - Somali girl - she asks that we call her " Lali " - is about to describe a barbaric act of ritualised cruelty which has been perpetrated against her .
Knowing the danger to which she is exposing herself , her anxiety is entirely understandable .
For by speaking about it , Lali will break the ultimate taboo among Britain 's 600,000 ethnic Africans .
In Norway , where this brutal act is also prevalent , a young Somali woman was recently beaten , almost to death , for talking to TV documentary programme - makers .
It is known by a variety of names , the most common of which are female genital mutilation ( FGM ) , female circumcision , or simply " cutting " - a word which somehow conveys the raw pain its prepubescent victims suffer .
Most people will be unfamiliar with this practice , which involves removing part or all of the clitoris , the surrounding labia ( the outer part of the vagina ) and sometimes the sewing up of the vagina , leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood .
It is carried out for a variety of cultural reasons .
Such is the secrecy that surrounds the practice that even those aware that it occurs in large swathes of Africa and Asia will be shocked to learn that it is prevalent in Britain .
During a highly disturbing , four - month investigation , however , we uncovered evidence that thousands of British - African girls , in towns and cities throughout the country , have been forcibly " cut " .
By conservative estimates , 66,000 women and girls living in Britain have been mutilated .
This figure , accepted by the Metropolitan Police , came in a report by a volunteer organisation funded by the Department of Health and carried out with academics from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and the City University .
And thousands more girls are at imminent risk as families club together to fly professional " cutters " from Africa to Britain .
These women " elders " perform the crude operation for up to £ 40 a time , often on kitchen tables or floors , without anaesthetic , using filthy , blunt knives , razor blades or scalpels .
Many readers will be distressed by our report , but this practice is an abomination which has no place anywhere , let alone in a civilised society , and if it is to be expunged then this is a story that must be told .
There is no way of escaping the unpalatable terminology , just as there is no way for girls like Lali to escape the unsterile knife which cuts them as they are held down and which will result in a lifetime of physical and psychological pain .
Some people say the practice is to increase the sexual pleasure of the man , but this is only one appallingly outdated reason why many womenfolk from 28 African and some Middle Eastern countries , most of which have sizeable representation in Britain , are treated like this .
It is also done to demonstrate their virginity on their wedding night ; and because " uncut " girls with the ability to enjoy love - making are considered more likely to be promiscuous , unhygienic , and prone to diseases such as Aids .
Attempts are also made to justify this iniquitous practice on religious grounds .
Some hard - line Muslims insist that women must undergo genital cutting to remain faithful to the purest teachings of Islam - although , in truth , it is not even mentioned in the Koran , and only ambiguously in the Hadith ( a collection of oral traditions about the life of the prophet Mohammed ) .
Several leadings Imams have openly condemned the practice .
This , though , does not deter its proponents , who maintain that it is their inalienable right to live according to their traditional beliefs and customs , rather than conform to British values .
Indeed , some argue that the freedom to carry out FGM is a fundamental principle of our multi-cultural society .
Whatever the arguments , the fact is that genital mutilation is a reality , and the Metropolitan police is so concerned that it recently set up a special unit to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators .
Heading the unit is Detective Inspector Carol Hamilton , herself a mother , who was horrified when she discovered what was happening to other people 's daughters .
The Met team also educates regional police forces about FGM , and speaks to mosques , community groups and local authorities .
Usually their visits are well - received , but we found that at least one London council declined to publish material highlighting the suffering and danger the practice causes - for fear of offending ethnic African residents .
This kind of attitude incenses Detective Inspector Hamilton .
" We are all becoming very culturally sensitive , " she says .
" People are a bit frightened of saying ' You can't do this here ' because people shoot back with ' But it 's our culture ' .
" But it 's not : this is just plain cruel .
I wo n't be put off by the politically correct argument .
We have to be seen to be strong on this .
I do n't care about human rights - I care about the rights of the child .
Everything else has to go out of the window .
" We have one rule in child protection : the child is of paramount importance .
I stick by that firmly . "
Together with the Waris Dirie Foundation , an international campaign group formed by the Somali - born supermodel who suffered genital mutilation as a five - year - old child , the Met announced a £ 20,000 reward last July for information leading to the conviction of anyone who performs or abets cutting .
Under the 2003 Female Genital Mutilation
Act , those involved could be jailed for 14 years .
Yet the fact that no one has been prosecuted says much about the problems the police are facing .
" There are thousands of girls being cut in your country , " says Waris Dirie spokesman Walter Hutschinger .
" We are sure it 's going on , and on a very big scale .
Your law is one of the most comprehensive in the world , but it is useless if nobody will help to implement it .
" We have been contacted by girls from all parts of Britain - London , Cardiff , Sheffield , Birmingham , Liverpool , Reading , Slough , Milton Keynes , Crawley - anywhere there are big African communities .
" Many of these girls know they are about to be cut and are desperate for help , but they are even more afraid of what might happen to them if they come out in the open .
" One young woman wrote recently to tell us that she was about to be taken home to Somalia to be cut , and she was terrified because her older sister had died after cutting .
[ To avoid detection , the mutilation is often done in a girl 's native country . ]
" She was thinking of running away - but she did n't know where she could go or what she would do .
The girl says genital mutilation has destroyed her family .
We wrote back offering a meeting , but she has not been back in touch . '
During our investigation , we found similar difficulty finding girls willing publicly to condemn a practice whose " virtues " are impressed upon them from infancy so that they are effectively brainwashed into believing it to be an essential step towards womanhood .
Lali is so determined that other girls should be spared the misery she has endured since the cutter came to call four years ago that , last week , she bravely told us her story .
She was three years old when her family left impoverished , war - ravaged Somalia and settled in the East End of London , where her early childhood life seemed immeasurably better .
Everything changed for Lali when she was 11 years old .
One morning , her mother told her , quite casually , that they were to visit another Somali girl , whom she liked .
" I thought I was just going to play with my friend , so I was happy , " Lali says quietly , avoiding eye contact .
Soon after she arrived at the friend 's anonymous council house , however , cold reality dawned .
In fact , Lali 's mother had secretly joined together with several other women to pay for a " cutter " to travel to London from Mogadishu to circumcise their daughters .
" They believed it had to be done , otherwise we would never get a husband , ' Lali shrugs .
What happened next was like a scene from medieval times .
Her mother , other female relatives and family friends suddenly grabbed Lali and grappled her to the floor .
Then , on cue , the strange woman came in , like a torturer with her bag of implements .
" They held me down , and when the woman began cutting I screamed , so my friend 's sister put her hand tightly over my mouth , " she says .
" I had known her and these other women all my life , and now they were doing ... this . "
The cutting often results in life - threatening complications such as septicaemia , haemorrhaging or cysts , but in this respect Lali was fortunate .
Outwardly , at least , she quickly recovered and returned to school , too frightened and ashamed to tell her teachers and friends about her ordeal .
However , the legacy of the atrocity inflicted on her when she was 11 years old will always remain .
When a marriage is arranged for her , sex will be a painful duty to be endured .
If she is lucky enough to avoid the pre-natal complications frequently caused by genital mutilation and have children , she will almost certainly have to undergo a Caesarean section .
" It is the most traumatic rite of passage , " says Comfort Mohmoh , a doctor who runs a Well Woman Clinic at London 's St Thomas ' Hospital and has performed a number of successful operations to reverse genital mutilation - a procedure possible only in less severe cases .
She sees from 400 to 500 cases a year .
" These women get abdominal pains , backache , extremely painful periods , recurring urinary infections and , inevitably , a great deal of pain during intercourse . "
Lali is already encountering some of these physical problems , yet in some ways the emotional and psychological damage is even worse .
" What happened to me has totally broken my trust in the women I loved , " she told us .
" I did n't believe my mother could let this happen .
My love for her has changed .
" It hurt so much .
I would never let my children suffer this .
I do n't believe this is right .
It 's a stupid , old - fashioned custom .
Why can't we forget it ? "
This alienation between mothers and daughters , of course , is another subtle way in which the practice subjects African women to male authority .
Among the many otherwise educated and reasonable British - African men we spoke to , however , few were willing to call a halt .
With breathtaking sadism , their attitude was summed up by one man during an internet chat forum for Somalis living in Britain .
" They should get their kintirs [ Somalian for clitoris ] cut off if they can't control their passions , " was his message to liberated female compatriots .
One lone voice was Asif , a 26 - year - old Somali mechanic who came to London at 15 - though his reasoning was hardly reassuring .
" We call these girls ' table - tops ' because they are like wood , " he told us .
Rapping his fist on the table , he added : " Who wants to make love to this ?
I would never allow this to happen to my daughters . "
As Detective Inspector Hamilton has discovered , however , he is very much in the minority .
" I met one group of Somalis and got the message that cutting was even stronger here than in Somalia , " she says .
" Here , it seems , they feel the need to keep their traditions going .
" But detection is very difficult .
If somebody rings and tells us a girl has been subjected to it , how do you check that ?
Especially when the family seem quite reasonable and say they do n't believe in it , but refuse permission for the children to be medically examined . "
Perhaps we should take a lead from France , whose methods of prevention have been strengthened following a landmark case in 1999 , when a woman of West African origins was jailed for eight years for cutting 48 young children .
Now all French children of African background are closely scrutinised by social workers and doctors during infancy , and any abnormal behaviour or prolonged absence from school is immediately investigated .
It is also considered a duty of French doctors to examine any ethnic African girls they suspect have been mutilated and , waiving usual patient confidentiality rules , report their parents to the police if their suspicions are confirmed .
In this age of political correctness , no doubt , factions in Britain will argue that such interventionist activity is discriminatory and a breach of human rights .
There will also be those who believe female genital mutilation to be an issue for the African community to resolve , arguing that our overstretched police and health professionals have more pressing matters to address .
Detective Inspector Hamilton was persuaded otherwise when she sat through a graphic video showing a cutter at work .
With its haunting screams and bloodied instruments , this real - life horror film changed her life .
" These little girls should n't have to live in that other world , " she says .
" They go to school here .
Their homes and friends are here .
They are our little girls .
They are British .
What is happening to them is barbaric - and it must be stopped . "

There might be some people who will still insist that there are no terrorists in this world , but the latest fighting in Pakistan proved one thing - that terrorists are present .
Terrorists iaround the country have suddenly launched a full - scale war against the armed forces .
Poor and innocent people have also been falling prey to the latest fighting .
This is an establsihed fact that rulers have created terrorists for keeping themselves in power .
But now the rulers of Pakistan cannot deceive the world .
Now the truth is coming to the fore .
Daily Times in its editorial discussed the situation in Pakistan .
The army has engaged the terrorists in Darra Adam Khel inside the NWFP after four ammunition trucks meant for its frontline troops were captured by the Taliban .
The Darra , lying between Peshawar and Kohat , was “ regular ” only in name because illegal weapons have been made here by local craftsmen for the last 150 years and Pakistan has done nothing to “ normalise ” the town , letting it remain wild like the rest of the Tribal Areas .
But Darra is close to Aurakzai and South Waziristan tribal agencies and is the lifeline of the rebellious Taliban .
The army had to go in and engage because munitions had been intercepted and stolen .
According to local sources , the trucks contained enough ammunition to last the Taliban two years .
This means that the battle has come into a chunk of “ settled ” territory .
The Taliban and their extremist supporters have been challenging the state in many parts of Pakistan .
But this is the first time a major battle is being fought by the army with heavy artillery , tanks and helicopter gunships .
There were earlier incidents in Darra which clearly indicated that the Taliban were consolidating themselves in the area but action was avoided in favour of parleys and other methods of negotiation that did not work .
Next door Kohat too was targeted and despite the fact that a cantonment exists there , not much action was taken to stop the activities of the Taliban and their sympathisers in the city .
In fact out of all the settled areas of the NWFP Kohat has remained the most loyal stronghold of pro-Taliban elements who remain prepared to give shelter to the “ foreigners ” who escaped to the Tribal Areas from Afghanistan after the Tora Bora offensive in 2001 .
The End
Fans of the Clash , and other music lovers , will no longer be fighting the law every time they fill up their iPod , under government proposals unveiled yesterday .
Owners of digital music players will be acting lawfully when they transfer music from their computer to a digital player or copy a CD for their own use , under proposed amendments to bring copyright law into the digital age .
Consumers who have been technically breaking the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 by copying tracks from CDs to their PC or digital player , or making an extra copy to play in the car , will now be able to do so for private use .
Record labels accept that consumers should not be punished for shifting music from one format to another , but some are concerned it will increase the perception that music can be freely copied with impunity .
The minister for intellectual property , Lord Triesman , said : " In an increasingly digital world we need to be sure that our copyright system keeps up with the times and works effectively .
This consultation ... explores where the boundaries lie between strong protection for rights - holders and appropriate levels of access for users . "
Last year 's Gowers review of intellectual property recommended the law be relaxed to reflect the march of technology , but also suggested that punishments for large scale piracy be toughened .
The proposals suggest a new exemption for parodies of copyrighted works , while changes for libraries would allow for the copying of broadcasts for preservation purposes .
Consumers would not be allowed to sell or give away the original once they had copied it .
The National Consumer Council 's director of policy , Jill Johnstone , said the current situation was " confusing for consumers and it brings the law into disrepute " .
She said the council supported the changes , but said they needed to be easily understood by consumers .
Geoff Taylor , chief executive of the music industry trade body the BPI , said : " We look forward to working with government throughout the consultation ; the key thing for us is that any changes to the law achieve the stated aim of clarifying the law for consumers , while not doing harm to rights - holders . "
British Music Rights , which represents composers and songwriters , said any changes to the law must be " tightly drawn " .
Legal experts said it made sense to tidy up a law that had been proved impractical and unworkable , but said it could have harmful consequences for a record industry that has been brought to its knees by digital piracy in recent years .
Hamish Porter , a partner at law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse , said : " There is a danger that it will be interpreted by the young as a green light to burn CDs for their friends . "
A Death in Edmonds Last New Year 's Eve , Danielle McCarthy took ecstasy for the first time with some friends .
The Puyallup teenager died on New Year 's Day .
The State of Washington has charged McCarthy 's friends in her death .
But what if the drugs did n't kill McCarthy ?
Maxwell Holyoke - Hirsch
Danielle McCarthy was like a lot of 16 - year - olds .
She wore Hollister - brand clothes , worked at Orange Julius at the mall , and attended one of those giant suburban high schools .
Until December 2006 , she 'd never taken ecstasy .
But she knew plenty of people at Rogers High School in Puyallup , Washington , who had used it , including Donalydia Huertas , a fellow junior .
Danielle and her school buddy Kelsey Kerston thought ecstasy was dangerous — " you can die on the first try , " Danielle and Kelsey agreed — but at some point , without telling Kelsey , Danielle changed her mind .
With New Year 's
Eve approaching , Danielle decided to spend $ 50 she had saved for a navel piercing on ecstasy instead .
Kelsey would be with them on New Year 's Eve , but Kelsey was n't supposed to know that Danielle and Dona were high .
At 8:00 p.m. on December 31 , the girls met at Dona 's house .
Photos from a digital camera show them posing , puckering , and gussying themselves up in front of a vanity mirror .
Two cars full of friends arrived to pick the girls up at 9:00 p.m. and take them to a house party in Edmonds .
David Morris , a 20 - year - old friend of Dona 's , drove a Jeep that had room for just two passengers .
Dona and Danielle rode in the Jeep .
Kelsey rode in another vehicle — throughout the night Kelsey was the odd girl out .
The red Cherokee drove north on I - 5 .
David handed over pills of ecstasy to Dona , and Dona handed him cash .
Both girls took a pill .
The two cars arrived in Edmonds about an hour later .
Ryan Mills , 19 years old , was hosting a New Year 's Eve party at his mother 's house .
Mills 's mother was away .
Inside , about 18 people in their late teens and early 20s were smoking pot and drinking .
Danielle opened a can of beer , but Dona warned her not to drink — alcohol and ecstasy are a bad combination , she said .
Danielle chugged it anyway .
Kelsey was drinking shots of Vox vodka .
Less than an hour later , still before midnight , about eight of the revelers decided to leave for a party in Seattle 's University District .
On the way , the cars stopped at a gas station to rendezvous with a friend whose clutch had burned out on the freeway .
Danielle told Dona that the ecstasy " was n't kicking in . "
Dona and Danielle both took another pill .
The New Year arrived as they sat in the parking lot .
When they reached the party on Greek Row , Danielle got out of the car and immediately became ill , vomiting again and again .
She urinated on herself .
David and Dona cleaned her up and took care of her .
Guys in the group returned periodically , one with a bottle of Aquafina , but Danielle could n't hold down water .
Dona assured friends that Danielle was fine , insisting she just had too much to drink .
At 3:30 a.m. , the frat - row parties died down .
Danielle slumped with her head down on the drive back in the Jeep .
Back in Edmonds , Dona and David helped Danielle walk back into Ryan Mills 's house .
Danielle was still somewhat coherent but she was slipping in and out of consciousness , periodically waking up to vomit .
If there was any suspicion that Danielle was having a bad reaction to the ecstasy or that something else was seriously wrong , what happened next should have confirmed it :
At around 4:00 a.m. Danielle tensed up .
She began to shake .
She looked like she was having a seizure .
Nobody called 911 .
Danielle 's seizure lasted about five minutes , and after it ended she appeared to fall asleep .
Other people began going to sleep in various rooms of the house .
Some members of the group said they woke up at 6:30 a.m. , but others claimed it was n't until 8:30 a.m. that Ryan Mills started dinging a cowbell to wake the group .
Danielle looked terrible .
Her face was cold to the touch ; her lips were blue .
So , once again , the group had to make a decision .
They could call 911 , they could drive Danielle to the hospital , or they could take matters into their own hands .
Some guys carried Danielle to a tub they had filled with warm water , where Dona splashed water on Danielle 's face .
But Danielle was unresponsive .
After 15 minutes , one of them lifted Danielle 's arm and let go .
Instead of relaxing , Danielle 's muscles stiffened and her hand hardened into a cup .
Everyone panicked .
But they still did n't call 911 .
Ryan Mills , the host of the party , went online and found Danielle 's symptoms were consistent with an ecstasy overdose .
But Ryan did n't want anyone to call 911 .
" We were all scared because we had , like , a party there the night before , " Mills would later tell investigators .
" We did n't want anyone to get in trouble . "
Most of the people at the house had taken ecstasy , and at this point David and Dona were admitting that Danielle had , too .
Calling 911 guaranteed that they would be arrested .
So , instead , David and Dona wrapped Danielle in a comforter , hoisted her into the Cherokee , and drove her to Stevens Hospital .
They carried her into the emergency room .
At 9:43 a.m.— nearly eight hours after Danielle 's first symptoms , and five and a half hours after the apparent seizure — a doctor reported that her body was cold to the touch .
Her jaw was already set in rigor mortis .
That is how 16 - year - old Danielle Dawn McCarthy died , on New Year 's Day 2007 , according to records at the Snohomish County Superior Court — records that charge David Morris and Donalydia Huertas with homicide .
In Washington , when a person dies from taking an illegal drug , the individual who supplied the drug has committed " controlled - substances homicide , " according to a law passed in 1987 .
It 's the equivalent of holding a gun dealer liable if someone shoots himself .
" It was clear who gave her the drugs and who sold her the drugs , " said Deputy Prosecutor Coleen St. Clair of the Snohomish County Superior Court , who is handling the case .
A detective interviewing David Morris on New Year 's Day had ascertained that he'd sold Dona and Danielle the ecstasy and placed him under arrest .
But Dona , who gave Danielle the drugs , and was just 17 at the time , was n't charged until May 2007 .
The penalty for administering a lethal dose of a drug is usually 51 to 68 months in prison for adults .
The penalty for juveniles is typically a month in jail .
" [ Huertas ] was made a plea offer [ in juvenile court ] and she rejected it , " said St. Clair , " and if you do n't accept the state 's plea you 'll be charged with what you should have been charged with to begin with . "
Huertas is now charged with manslaughter in the first degree — in adult court — in addition to the drug - homicide charge .
If she 's found guilty , Dona Huertas could be sent to prison for six and a half to eight and a half years .
" The difference is the controlled - substances homicide is a strict liability crime , " St. Clair said , but the first - degree manslaughter charge is reserved for reckless disregard .
To demonstrate Dona 's disregard , an affidavit pieces together an account of the night 's events to argue that Dona repeatedly rejected efforts to save Danielle .
The most damning evidence is about a dozen quotes attributed to Dona over the evening by Danielle 's friend Kelsey Kerston , who recounted the night 's events , with her father by her side , to a King County detective .
" Please do n't let me die , " Danielle begged while vomiting next to the car , according to Kelsey .
When Kelsey offered to help , Dona allegedly told her , " Shut the fuck up and get the fuck away ....
Danielle does n't need your help .
There 's nothing wrong with her ....
Stop asking and shut the fuck up , and get the fuck out of here . "
When Kelsey demanded to know whether Danielle had taken drugs , Dona allegedly barked , " Shut the fuck up .
She 's not on anything . "
Incriminating details — but this is Kelsey 's version of events , and the rest of her story does n't match those provided by other witnesses .
For example , while Kelsey went inside one of the parties on Greek Row , Dona and David tended to Danielle — by the account of a half - dozen witnesses — for nearly three hours .
But when the detective asked Kelsey how long the group was in the University District , Kelsey insisted they were only on Greek Row for 20 to 25 minutes , " and then we went straight back to Ryan Mills 's house . "
The detective also asked about the car ride to Seattle .
DETECTIVE : " Anything happen between the party [ in Edmonds ] and getting to [ the party in the University District ] ?
I mean , as far as stopping anywhere , anything like that ? "
KELSEY KERSTON : " Um-um . "
DETECTIVE : " Somebody 's car break down ? "
KELSEY KERSTON : " No . "
DETECTIVE : " No ? "
KELSEY KERSTON : " Um-um . "
...
DETECTIVE : " So you left [ Edmonds ] at 11:30 , let 's say , so you got there and you already went to the gas station according to what you 're saying . "
KELSEY KERSTON : " I just , I should n't like , I should not have drink [ sic ] , that 's all I 'm saying . "
...
DETECTIVE : " Okay .
So that 'd be two and a half , three hours . "
KELSEY KERSTON : " We were not there that long . "
DETECTIVE : " Okay . "
KELSEY KERSTON : " We were n't . "
Kelsey forgot spending a significant amount of time at a gas station and appears to have lost track of about three hours that night , and excuses the lapses by explaining she " should n't have drink . "
And Dona , on ecstasy , is alleged to have screamed expletives at Kelsey .
( The drug , methylenedioxymethamphetamine , or MDMA , overwhelms the user with such intense feelings of love and happiness that the drug was recently approved federally for clinical trials to treat post - traumatic stress disorder . )
Nevertheless , prosecutors used Kelsey 's account of the night to make their case in an affidavit of probable cause .
None of the holes in the case excuses Dona , David , Kelsey , or anyone else in the group for failing to call 911 .
But despite an entire group 's failure to respond , the charges brought against two individuals rely heavily on the testimony of one person — whose accounts of the evening are spotty .
( I called Kelsey Kerston , but her mother refused to let me speak with her .
I also spoke to Danielle 's parents ; they agreed to meet for an interview and then cancelled .
David Morris ' attorney said he could not answer questions about the case .
And Dona Huertas ' attorney did not return my calls . )
On November 30 , 2007 , David made a plea agreement with prosecutors , agreeing to testify against Dona in exchange for a shorter sentence .
The deal may seem odd , because everyone saw that Danielle was seriously ill , knew she had taken ecstasy , and did n't call for help .
And Danielle , according to Kelsey , even asked people not to let her mom find out .
So everyone at the party bears some responsibility for what happened that night .
But pinning the blame on a single participant — with all parties testifying against that one defendant , who is left with no one else to snitch on — is a classic drug - law enforcement technique .
And , characteristic of drug enforcement 's racial disparity in prosecutions , the person who stands to serve the harshest penalty is the only non-Caucasian directly involved in the case , Dona Huertas .
Huertas is currently free on bail ; her trial begins in Snohomish County Superior Court on January 25 .
" This is a hot charge right now , " says Douglas Hiatt , a criminal defense attorney defending a client facing similar accusations in Lewis County .
A recent flourish of newspaper articles indicates rising popularity for the controlled - substance - homicide charge among Washington prosecutors .
( The state attorney general 's office failed to respond to my requests for records related to the number of charges and prosecutions . )
In a similar case in Clark County , just across the Columbia River from Portland , 19 - year - old Stetzon W. Sharp reportedly supplied a 15 - year - old girl with ecstasy at a party in his apartment .
After the girl complained she was too warm , partygoers rushed her to a hospital — much quicker to act than Danielle 's friends — but brain swelling and seizures took her life within a couple hours .
A Clark County judge sentenced Sharp to more than eight years in prison .
In every fatal overdose case , the drugs came from someone .
But as the prosecutor , St. Clair , explained , the controlled - substance - homicide charge is uncommon because in most cases the overdose victim is " alone when they were found so you can't make that connection " to the supplier .
But instead of preventing overdose deaths , prosecutions like these may result in more deaths .
The state of Washington 's position is clear :
If someone calls 911 when a friend is overdosing , not only does the witness risk charges for possessing or selling drugs ( which 911 callers in these situations have feared since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act ) , but he or she could be charged with homicide , too .
The end result ?
Overdose victims — who might survive with prompt medical care — may be abandoned and left to die .
" It goes in the wrong direction and cuts against overdose prevention , overdose reporting , and taking someone to the hospital , " says defense attorney Hiatt .
" If I give you the drugs , I 'll be less likely to take you to the hospital . "
I can relate .
When I was 17 , a friend who had taken five hits of LSD showed up at my house during a small party .
He misheard a conversation and believed we thought he was gay .
He began to worry that his attraction to women was a charade — it was n't — and then spiraled into an acid- induced state of terror .
He began babbling like R2 - D2 , holding his breath until his head looked like a plum , and trying to claw out his eyes .
I called 911 .
A fleet of screaming ambulances and police cars arrived at my parents ' house .
I did n't think twice about opening the door and directing them to my deranged shell of a friend .
But no sooner had they crossed the threshold than a cadre of police officers escorted me to the basement , where they handcuffed me to a chair .
Officers interrogated me for hours , threatening to search my house .
( My parents are out of town so I can't give you permission , officer , and besides , there 's no acid at the house , nope , and he took it before he arrived , yup . )
The officers finally left , but not until midmorning .
My wrists were bruised from the cuffs and I 've never looked at a police officer quite the same way again .
I spent the next couple of months explaining to my scowling parents and suspicious neighbors that I did the right thing : I called 911 when a friend overdosed .
But I ended up being treated like a criminal .
" I read a story about four or five years ago about a drug overdose downtown , " says Adam Kline , state senator of Washington 's 37th District ( around Seattle 's Mount Baker neighborhood ) .
" People stood around watching ; nobody dared call the cops , and the guy died on the street , " says Kline .
" I imagine the very rational fear of arrest .
It has got to cloud people 's judgment . "
Monte Levine , a member of the Kitsap County Substance Abuse Advisory Board , says , " There is a balance of weighing personal fear over doing what is right and humane . "
A woman near Levine 's Bremerton home had that fear become reality : " A person was overdosing and she called to save the person 's life , " he says .
" She was arrested . "
When mothers abandon their unwanted newborns — which happens with alarming frequency — they must decide whether to leave an infant in a Dumpster , where the child is likely to die , or in a public place , where the child 's likelihood of survival is higher but so are the chances that the mother will be seen by witnesses , arrested , and prosecuted .
The pandemic of abandoned newborns in the 1990s spawned a popular movement to declare emergency rooms and other medical facilities " safe havens " where mothers could abandon newborns without risking arrest .
In 2002 , the Washington State Legislature passed such a law .
A law that encourages people to call 911 when someone is overdosing would be grounded in the same impulse :
It 's better to save lives than to prosecute every crime .
But saving the lives of newborn babies is an easy sell and saving the lives of drug users is not .
But a life is a life to Senator Kline , who introduced legislation that would provide amnesty to people who call 911 to report an overdose .
The bill , first introduced in 2005 and reintroduced in 2007 ( remaining active in the 2008 session ) , states , " A person shall not be charged , subject to civil forfeiture , or otherwise prosecuted for a [ drug offense ] if ... the person reported the drug overdose to law enforcement or summoned medical assistance at the time it was witnessed .... "
But the bill , SB 5348 , includes two exceptions :
The bill stipulates that people can still be prosecuted in cases where the person who reported the overdose sold the drugs to the victim or in cases where the victim dies and controlled - substance - homicide charges result .
Those exceptions undermine the bill 's intent .
Taking drugs is often communal , and buying them is also a group activity , where one person obtains the drugs from a dealer and others reimburse that person for the cost of the drugs , but no profit is made on this second " sale . "
To complicate matters , the bill applies only to cases where the person reporting the overdose believes there is a threat to the victim 's life .
So , basically , witnesses have to wait until they 're certain that the overdosing person is dying before they call 911 — and if the person does die , the proposed law offers no protection .
Kline concedes the bill has flaws , but believes the concessions are necessary if the bill , which in its three years has never reached a floor vote in the state senate , is to become law in 2008 .
" In a perfect world , " says Kline , " there would be an absolute privilege to call the cops or the medics when there is an imminent threat on the life of a human being , and there would be no exceptions . "
But it is n't a perfect world , or a perfect legislature , so Kline says the exceptions are necessary .
But if Kline 's bill were to become law , would drug users understand the specific circumstances under which they would have immunity ?
Let 's say another man is dying of a drug overdose on a downtown street .
Would the people watching even know of the law ?
And if they did , would they know that the law 's protections were ambiguous and assume that first - responding officers would construe the law narrowly , and choose not to call 911 ?
In New Mexico , drug users know about a " Good Samaritan " law enacted there this June — the first of its kind to become law — but " they think it 's a joke , " says Reena Szczepanski , director of the Drug Policy Alliance 's New Mexico office , one of the legislation 's backers .
" They think the DEA will try to get around it . "
Szczepanski says the New Mexico Department of Health distributes palm - sized cards to drug users about the limitations of immunity .
One side explains that people calling 911 for overdose victims wo n't be arrested for drug possession ; the other says there are no protections from charges for drug dealing , outstanding warrants , or parole or probation violations .
In cases where people have called 911 to report an overdose in New Mexico , " police have arrived before the ambulances , " says Szczepanski , and " put everyone on the floor to secure the scene while their friend is dying on the floor . "
What message do these heavy - handed tactics send ?
" Do n't even try saving your friend 's life , " says Szczepanski , " we 're going to arrest you . "
It may have been easy to save Danielle McCarthy 's life .
" MDMA use in sufficient dose or under the right circumstances can be fatal , but that is very rare , " explains Dr. Thomas Martin , of the Washington Poison Center and an associate professor at the University of Washington .
" An overdose from two pills is very unlikely . "
According to a statement issued February 5 , the Snohomish County Medical Examiner 's Office ruled that Danielle 's official cause of death was acute intoxication of ecstasy .
But McCarthy 's toxicology report indicates she had a postmortem concentration of only 0.31 milligrams of MDMA per liter of blood .
Although a handful of fatalities with MDMA in that concentration have been reported , that dose is generally considered nontoxic .
( Other MDMA users have been documented with 20 times the concentration of MDMA found in Danielle 's blood — and they exhibited only a hangover and hypertension . )
Danielle 's toxicology report also showed slight presence of MDA , a drug very similar to MDMA , and caffeine .
This indicates the pills she consumed were not completely pure , which , in pills sold as ecstasy , is very common .
But unreleased portions of Danielle 's toxicology report reveal something unusual : a high level of ketones , acids produced by the body when it breaks down fat for energy , and glucose at 500 milligrams per deciliter in Danielle 's urine .
( Information regarding the toxicology report was provided to The Stranger by a confidential source . )
If this information is accurate , Danielle McCarthy may have been suffering from undiagnosed diabetes .
" This presentation of a very high glucose level and high levels of ketones could have been due to a complication of undiagnosed diabetes known as diabetic ketoacidosis , " says Martin .
Ketoacidosis causes nausea and vomiting and can induce a diabetic coma — the same symptoms reportedly exhibited by Danielle on the night she died .
If Danielle had been taken to a hospital , these symptoms could have been treated quickly ; regulating her blood sugar and providing other basic medical treatment could have saved her life .
" I think that it is only apparent that MDMA use preceded a downward spiral that led to her death but did n't necessarily cause or contribute to it , " Martin says .
However , he notes , " if she did have a seizure , that is less common in DKA [ diabetic ketoacidosis ] and more common with MDMA toxicity . "
The extent to which MDMA is actually toxic has been the source of controversy .
George Ricaurte of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and colleagues concluded in 2002 that the drug causes severe neurotoxicity .
Users are virtually guaranteed , the scientist reported , to develop Parkinson 's disease or similar nervous - system conditions as they age .
However , the findings , after being widely accepted , were dismissed the next year .
Ricaurte admitted the researchers accidentally injected primate test subjects with methamphetamine , not ecstasy , after two labels on the bottles were switched .
In the vast majority of ecstasy - related fatalities , it is not toxicity that kills the victims , but complications , such as heatstroke , dehydration , or , as may have been the case with Danielle , the drug triggering a preexisting medical condition .
" Some patients tolerate a certain level well ; others don't , " says William T. Hurley , MD , of the Washington Poison Center .
" Anyone with a challenged reserve , due to a disease like untreated diabetes , would do less well with MDMA toxicity . "
If Danielle was an undiagnosed diabetic , other drugs — even legal ones , such as diet Red Bull or pseudoephedrine — could have triggered her downward spiral .
She may have started down the same physiological path of lightheadedness , nausea , and ketoacidosis .
In any of these other scenarios , however , Danielle or someone around her would almost certainly have called 911 .
Everyone likes to believe they would immediately call 911 if they witnessed an overdose .
But the fact is , the fear of being arrested and sent to prison for 5 to 10 years could make even the most compassionate person take pause .
Is the person actually that sick ?
What if he is just passed out ... would he want to wake up under arrest in a hospital room ?
If I call 911 , what will happen to all the people at this party — will they be sent to prison because of my phone call ?
These ramifications may vex a reasonable person — and certainly one who is high and panicked .
If I had known as a teenager what I know now about how Washington 's law enforcement handles overdoses , and how the police would treat me , in this situation I probably would have disposed of any evidence that could be used against me , my friends , or my tripping friend before I called for help .
But that time would also waste precious minutes , delaying treatment , all to avoid a potential criminal prosecution .
It was the fear of criminal prosecution that prevented Danielle 's friends from doing the right thing and saving her life on that New Year 's Day .
The negligence of her friends , ecstasy , possibly undiagnosed diabetes , and strictly punitive drug policies all conspired to kill Danielle McCarthy .
But only Donalydia Huertas is on trial .
TPM Reader RL throws in the towel :
I actually like the idea of a unitary executive , because it implies that there could be a unitary citizen .
I have begun to consider myself a unitary citizen .
I am allowed ( by virtue of the definition of a unitary executive ) to pick and choose the laws I would like to follow , kind of Thoreau like .
I also like the idea of retroactive immunity paired with the unitary citizen .
I could decide not to follow a stupid law and then forgive myself afterwards .
But it begins to sound like ( horrors ) anarchy .
Maybe that ’s what we now have as a form of government : unitary anarchy .
I like it .
It works for me !
Summary : AJAX , rich Internet UIs , mashups , communities , and user - generated content often add more complexity than they 're worth .
They also divert design resources and prove ( once again ) that what 's hyped is rarely what 's most profitable .
... dangerous for your profits , that is .
If you focus on over - hyped technology developments , you risk diverting resources from the high - ROI design issues that really matter to your users — and to your profits .
Unlike some older technologies ( notably , Flash and PDF ) , Web 2.0 ideas are not inherently bad for users .
They can be highly effective ; we sometimes see examples of usability - enhancing Web 2.0 designs in our studies .
But it 's more common to find Web 2.0 ideas that either hurt users or simply do n't matter to users ' core needs .
While the latter case might seem innocent , irrelevant website " enhancements " diminish profits because they indicate a failure to focus on those simpler design issues that actually increase sales and leads .
While there 's no single definition of the much - abused " Web 2.0 " term , I 'll look at four trends that are often considered its defining elements :
" Rich " Internet Applications ( RIA )
Community features , social networks , and user - generated content
Mashups ( using other sites ' services as a development platform )
Advertising as the main or only business model
AJAX and " Rich " Internet UI : Too Much Complexity
There 's no doubt that the pageview model of interaction provides a scaled - back UI .
But this also means that it 's a simple UI .
When all they can do is click a link to get a new page , users know how to operate the UI .
People are in control of their own user experience and thus focus on your content .
" Rich " Internet UIs highlight the more flexible GUI design options that we 've enjoyed in personal computing since 1984 .
Such interfaces can work well , especially for actual applications that offer true functionality and thus require a full GUI .
But if you 're just designing a website , the more advanced UIs often confuse users more than they help .
Why ?
Because users engage less with websites than with apps .
( And many applications are ephemeral apps that also have low user engagement . )
Take the most famous example of rich UI : AJAX , which lets designers update part of a page , rather than taking users to an entirely new page .
Because less data download is required , these smaller updates are typically faster , decreasing response times .
Only a fool would deny the importance of response time and download speeds for the Web user experience .
After all , we 've known since 1968 that speedy interfaces feel better and support flow .
So yes , faster is better .
But only if users continue to understand what 's happening .
We recently tested about 100 e-commerce sites and found many problems with AJAX shopping carts .
In particular , users often overlooked modest changes , such as when they added something to the cart and it updated only a small area in a corner of the screen .
It 's deadly for e-commerce sites when users can't operate the shopping cart , so it 's usually best to stick to simple shopping - cart designs that everybody understands .
To get the required response times , spend your money on bigger servers and better hosting providers .
And stick fewer gadgets on each page : these days , slow response times are often caused by too many complex , dynamic design elements that eat up server time .
As illustrated in a sidebar , an AJAX feature can work well on a website .
And our testing did find one usable AJAX shopping cart .
As always , the real question is not technology , but usability .
If you use technology right , it can help sales .
Still , the risk is typically too high with new technology because best practices have n't jelled yet .
You can't just emulate designs you see around the Web — they 're likely to be bad because they were hacked together by geeks drunk on the newest and coolest tech .
And , sadly , " newest and coolest " usually translates into " untried and unusable " — and thus money - losing .
Community and User - Generated Content : Too Few Users
User - generated content can be a great supplement to your own content .
The most famous example is Amazon 's book reviews , which date from 1996 ( not exactly " 2.0 . " ) .
Communities , which were the main recommendation in the 1997 book Net.
Gain , are also an old idea .
Community features are particularly useful on intranets , and many of the Intranet Design Annual winners offer them .
The reasons communities work better on intranets also explains why they 're often less useful on the open Internet :
A company 's employees are an actual community with a crucial shared interest : succeeding in business .
: succeeding in business .
Employees are pre-vetted : they 've been hired and thus presumably have a minimum quality level .
In contrast , on the Web , most people are bozos and not worth listening to .

Although some intranet communities — such as those around internal classified ads — are aimed at lightening up the workplace , most intranet communities are tightly focused on company projects .
Discussions stay on topic rather than wandering all over the map .

Discussions stay on topic rather than wandering all over the map .
Intranet users are accountable for their postings and care about their reputation among colleagues and bosses .
As a result , postings aim to be productive instead of destructive or flaming .
for their postings and care about their reputation among colleagues and bosses .
As a result , postings aim to be productive instead of destructive or flaming .
Small groups of people who know each other are less susceptible to social loafing , so more users contribute to intranet community features .
In contrast , Internet communities suffer from participation inequality , where most users never contribute and the most active 1 % of people dominate the discussions .
Realistically , most business tasks are too boring to support community features .
The fact that the city Sanitation Department will pick up Christmas trees sometime after December 25 is n't likely to inspire a longing to discuss shared experiences on the department 's site .
Users will visit the site to find the pick - up dates and rules .
Nonetheless , the Christmas tree pick - up page is an example of how government websites can offer taxpayers great ROI : if done right , this one page will save the city from answering endless phone calls — each costing $ 10 or more .
Often , such boring , workhorse stuff is where the money is .
Mashups : Co-Branded Confusion
One of the defining ideas of " Web as platform " is that it lets developers merge the features of different sites into a single service .
If you 're a business , doing this is dangerous for two reasons :
Co-branding confuses users , who find it much easier to understand the simpler model of one site = one company .
Users are confused when other companies sell on Amazon .
Similarly , our studies of investor - relations sites found that individual investors were confused when a corporate site 's IR area linked to a third - party site for quarterly reports and the like .

Users are confused when other companies sell on Amazon .
Similarly , our studies of investor - relations sites found that individual investors were confused when a corporate site 's IR area linked to a third - party site for quarterly reports and the like .
Having part of your site effectively under another company 's control means that you 're at that company 's mercy if they decide to change the terms of service .
For example , the outside provider might decide to throw in advertisements from your competitors .
Not material you want to promote to your hot prospects .
Finally , a " mashed " service will never have usability as good as one that 's designed specifically for your needs .
In testing store finders and other locators , we found that the most usable maps were custom drawn to highlight a specific store and included surrounding landmarks , recommended parking facilities , and information on how to best access the location using public transportation .
A general mapping service does n't know your customers ' needs and thus can't draw the map that will bring in the most customers .
Of course , if you 're a small company , borrowing features from an outside service can help you add functionality to your site .
But if you 're big , the profits from an optimal user experience usually beat the cost of its creation .
Advertising - Funded Business Models : Bubble 2.0
The number of companies that chase the same advertising dollars as their only business model is a sure sign that we 're at the peak of Bubble 2.0 .
It would be much more sustainable if companies aimed to create services that users valued enough to pay for .
Right now , considerable advertising money is sloshing through the Web because most marketing managers remain clueless about how it works .
They think that because search advertisements generate lots of business , other Web ads must work just as well .
What a fallacy — brought on by ignorance of the basic Web user experience .
People go to search engines when they 're explicitly looking for a place to do business .
This is why search engines profit from sucking up the work of content sites ( where users exhibit strong banner blindness ) .
Marketing managers wo n't remain clueless forever .
Sooner or later they 'll discover that Web advertising offers almost no ROI .
Only two forms of Web ads actually work : search ads and classified ads ( such as eBay and real estate listings ) .
A third type of Internet advertising that might work are video ads , because video is a linear media form ( in contrast to nonlinear website navigation ) .
At this point , we do n't have enough user research about Internet video to say for sure .
Hyped Websites : Unrepresentative for Business Sites
In 1997 , I said that atypical examples are poor indicators of what you should do with your site .
In 2006 , I said this again , using examples that were widely hyped that year .
Sadly , many Internet managers continue to make this mistake and ask their team to emulate approaches highlighted in the news stories they read .
So , I 'll say it for the third time :
If you 're a mainstream business site ( including government and non-profit sites ) , your user experience needs are very different than those of the few hot sites that attract all the attention .
As an example , a smaller e-commerce site should not emulate Amazon.com 's design .
While they do many things right , there are also many ways in which Amazon deviates from the mainstream guidelines for e-commerce user experience .
They can ( and probably should ) deviate because of their unique position ( which you do n't have ) .
By definition , any website that gets extensive press coverage is unrepresentative for the vast majority of sites .
The media covers only " exciting " stories — not everyday business .
The most - hyped site right now , Facebook , is the " Iron Chef " of the Internet .
The Iron Chef competition makes for great TV , but has nothing to do with running a restaurant as a successful business .
After all , chefs are n't typically assigned a " mystery ingredient " shortly before dinnertime that they must feature throughout a multi-course meal .
Broccoli ice cream ?
Not if you want to make money and bring the diners back .
Like Iron Chef , Facebook has much drama that makes for good press coverage , but most of its features are worthless for a B2B site that , say , is trying to sell forklift trucks to 50 - year - old warehouse managers .
Instead of adding Facebook - like features that let users " bite " other users and turn them into zombies , the B2B site would get more sales by offering clear prices , good product photos , detailed specs , convincing whitepapers , an easily navigable information architecture , and an email newsletter .
Adapt a Few Web 2.0 Features , but Focus on Core Services
As I 've noted , there are many reasons not to get caught up in the Web 2.0 hype .
Still , Web 2.0 has some good ideas that can benefit mainstream websites .
The problem is that different sites need different subsets of the Web 2.0 features .
As an extremely rough guideline , here 's the percentage of Web 2.0 infusion that might benefit different types of user experience :
Informational / Marketing website ( whether corporate , government , or non-profit ) : 10 %
website ( whether corporate , government , or non-profit ) : 10 % E - commerce site : 20 %
site : 20 % Media site : 30 %
site : 30 % Intranets : 40 %
40 % Applications : 50 %
Applications score so high because users perform actions repeatedly and thus truly benefit from rich UI possibilities .
In contrast , mainstream websites have very few repeated actions that justify the added complexity of a full GUI 's shortcuts .
For website usability , the problem is not whether a specific operation takes 1 second or 10 seconds ; people typically perform each operation only once or twice .
The problem for websites is the 5 – 10 minutes users lose when they do something wrong because the site is too complicated .
( After such an experience , they usually leave — and you lose the business . )
Simplicity is more important than efficiency for done - once actions .
Take drag - and - drop : when used right , it can expedite application interactions .
But on a corporate site , the lack of perceived affordances can cause users to overlook important options .
( And , of course , when used wrong , fancy interaction techniques also doom applications , which is why it 's important to follow application usability guidelines if that 's your game .
The fact that a technique is " 2.0 " is more likely to harm than help your users if implemented with poor usability . )
The bottom line ?
While a modest 2.0 infusion can be beneficial , advanced features are rarely the most important contributor to good user experience or profitable websites .
If you get caught up in the hype , you divert attention and resources from the simpler things that really matter .
This opportunity cost is the real reason to take it easy on Web 2.0 .
Before throwing spending money at " 2.0 " features , make sure that you have all the " 1.0 " requirements working to perfection .
Of the 149,784,002 sites on the Web , maybe a handful can make this claim .
Most sites do n't even use the customers ' terminology in headlines and page titles — if you want one quick action item to improve site profitability through better SEO ranking , more clickthroughs , and better understanding of your services , rewriting the first two words of your microcontent will beat any technology any day .

For most people , it 's enough to see their paper plane fly for a few feet .
The Japanese , however , want to send one 240 miles .
. . through space .
They have revealed plans to launch a heat - resistant version from the international space station and track its descent at up to 15,200mph .
Scroll down for more ...
The idea is to pioneer a lightweight generation of gliders that could study the atmosphere .
The 8in - long paper dart – shaped like the Space Shuttle and weighing 11 oz – has been treated with a chemical so it can survive temperatures of 200c as it
re-enters the Earth 's atmosphere .
A 3in-long prototype has been tested in a wind tunnel at the University of Tokyo at temperatures up to 300c .
Engineers hope the dart will be launched in November when Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata starts work on the space station .
One of them , Professor Shinji Suzuki , said : " We do n't know where it will land
but if origami planes successfully fly from space , the new design concept of
space re-entry vehicles can be explored . "
The dart would have to be released during a space walk or jettisoned from an airlock .
Scroll down for more ...
It would continue at the same speed as the space station , but its orbit would gradually decay .
If it survives the descent , it is most likely to end up in the sea .
And if someone finds the dart before them , the engineers at Tokyo University
have written a message in several languages saying : " This plane flew from
the International Space Station .
" Please return the plane to Japan Origami Plane Association . "
In 1999 the leader of the Japan Origami Plane Association , Takuo Toda , approached Professor Suzuki to see if he could help design a three metre aeroplane for a television programme .
The plane was also designed like a space shuttle and flew successfully from the top of a mountain .
Following the project Mr Toda decided to push the boundary further and asked Professor Suzuki if he would help launch a plane from space .
They have spent the intervening years developing a plane that will not burn - up on re-entry .
The mission would follow a distinguished history of pointless experiments in space .
Over the last 10 years , the Space Shuttle has been used to discover how ants make tunnels in zero gravity , what happens to spiders in space and how roses release their perfume in orbit .
In August 2005 , the main purpose of Discovery space shuttle mission was repair damage caused to its underbelly during its launch .

Mr Machimura 's comments might not have been serious
Earlier , in response to a question from an opposition lawmaker , the Japanese government issued a statement saying it could not confirm any cases of UFOs .
But Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura later told reporters he believed they were " definitely " real .
It is the sort of question politicians dread but , under Japanese rules , are unable to ignore .
A member of the opposition asked the government what its policy was to deal with UFOs .
He said work should begin urgently to try to confirm whether or not they exist because of what he called " incessant " reports of sightings .
The Japanese civil service swung into action .
In a statement it said that should a flying saucer be spotted in the country 's airspace , a fighter would be scrambled to attempt visual confirmation .
But it emphasised that the government was not aware of cases where a UFO from space had been discovered .
Most alerts turned out to be birds or other objects .
' Not confirmed '
The document revealed that Japan has not yet planned what to do should aliens arrive here .
Many UFO sightings can be easily explained
The government 's chief spokesman Nobutaka Machimura drew laughter from reporters when he admitted that this was a " stereotypical " response from the bureaucrats .
Perhaps with his tongue a little in his cheek he insisted that he believed UFOs did " definitely " exist .
Questioned about the existence of alien spaceships , Japan 's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda thought about it and then answered carefully .
He said he had " not yet confirmed " whether they existed .
The conspiracy theorists will note that the answer was not a " no " .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. government antitrust lawyers have spent nearly 10 months so far investigating Sirius Satellite Radio Inc 's SIRI .
O plan to acquire rival XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc XMSR.O , despite company hopes that the deal would be approved by the end of 2007 .
The delay may be due to the complexity of the issues raised by the merger of the only two U.S. satellite radio companies -- or because the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) is putting together a case to block the deal in federal court , analysts at Stifel Nicolaus said in a research note on Thursday .
Alternatively , top officials at DOJ may be leaning toward approval but might still be weighing arguments from staffers who oppose the deal , Stifel Nicolaus said .
“ Like many others , we believed it was likely that the DOJ would have reached a decision before the winter holidays , ” Stifel Nicolaus said .
Washington , D.C. , antitrust lawyer Andre Barlow , of the firm Doyle , Barlow & Mazard , said some analysts may have underestimated the complexity of the investigation .
“ It certainly was n’t as imminent as ( some ) projected , ” Barlow said , referring to previous rumors that the government was about to make a decision .
Asked by Reuters about the ongoing review , Sirius and XM issued a joint statement saying : “ As the companies said from the outset , we expected to complete the processes at DOJ and the FCC so that the regulators could make their decisions and the merger could close by the end of 2007 .
We have fully complied with the requests from both agencies .
The ball is now in their court and we look forward to their determinations . ”
A key antitrust issue in the case is whether the combined satellite radio company would still face enough competition from free , over - the - air radio and new technologies .
The deal , announced on February 19 , 2007 , would bring entertainers such as Oprah Winfrey and shock - jock Howard Stern under one roof .
Sirius and XM , both of which are losing money , each currently charge subscribers about $ 13 a month for more than 100 channels of news , music , talk and sports .
Barlow said the DOJ antitrust division is probably in the latter stages of reviewing the deal .
But he said a final decision could still take some time because the proposed deal raises complicated questions about emerging technologies and how officials should view the radio business .
“ It is a complicated deal to review , ” Barlow said .
The traditional radio industry , as well as some consumer groups and U.S. lawmakers , have criticized the deal as anti-competitive .
But the satellite radio companies argued that they face plenty of competition from traditional radio stations and from the growing popularity of iPods and other personal audio players .
To allay critics ’ concerns , the two companies promised that after the merger , they would offer several new packages starting at lower prices , which they say would give consumers more programming choices than XM or Sirius could provide individually .
In November , one industry analyst said an antitrust decision by the department could be imminent and he believed the deal would be approved .
Two U.S. lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee responded with a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey , saying they were concerned about reports that officials might intend to approve the merger over objections of career attorneys at the Justice Department .
The Sirius - XM deal is also being examined by the Federal Communications Commission , which is expected to follow the Justice Department ’s lead .
The FCC is studying whether the deal would be in the public interest -- and whether to enforce a 1997 FCC order prohibiting the two companies from merging .
Shareholders from both companies approved the merger on November 13 .
XM shareholders would get 4.6 shares of Sirius common stock for every share of XM owned .
Shares of XM , which closed at $ 13.98 the day before the February 19 deal announcement , have been volatile ever since .
XM dipped below $ 11 a share in May and then nearly hit $ 16 in late November .
On Thursday , XM was trading at $ 12.57 , up 15 cents .
The share price of Sirius , meanwhile , had a 52 - week peak of $ 4.26 just before the deal was announced and was trading late Thursday at $ 3.12 , up 7 cents .
You can tell almost as much about a country from the things they want you to see as the things they would prefer you did n't .
And just now one of things Israel really wants the outside world to see is daily life as it is lived in the depressed southern town of Sderot .
A " new town " created as a regional centre in the 1950s to accommodate the early waves of mainly north African refugees , Sderot was once distinguished only by middle - brow ordinariness and its relaxed lifestyle in the sun .
More recently , it has stamped itself on Israel 's political and psychological map as the chief target of Palestinian rockets .
The town 's vulnerability is apparent as you approach from the north .
The urban sprawl of Gaza City is clearly visible on the near horizon – just across what could one day be the border of a Palestinian state .
The distance – or lack of it - places Sderot just within the 10 km range of Qassam rockets fired from the village of Beit Hanoun , essentially a northerly suburb of Gaza City .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Israel fears that , as the still quite amateurish rocketry of the Palestinian militants improves , other , much bigger , places – such as Ashkelon , which has a population of 110,000 – will come within range .
For the moment , though , it is Sderot that bears the brunt .
Life here is measured in intervals of 15 seconds .
It is how long the people of Sderot have between the sounding of the sirens and the inevitable explosion .
Civic life is almost non-existent .
People are on edge , unwilling to plan anything in advance , entertaining – if at all – at home , and fearful of dropping their children at school , lest it is the last time they see them .
Sitting in the spacious dining room of her house in Sinai Street , Shula Sasson explains , with the weary voice of experience , that 15 seconds is not long enough for anyone except the most agile to get to the safer downstairs from upstairs .
" If you have to carry a small child , you have n't a hope . "
So the upstairs of their large house is hardly used .
Mattresses are piled up behind the settee .
Everyone – seven people – now sleeps in the living room .
A child of Sderot , Mrs Sasson was born in the fifties to Libyan - Jewish refugees and remembers happy childhood days , a close sense of community , with a sense of safety .
She shows off an extension built by her grown - up son with his pay - off from the army .
It includes a " safe " room , with a metal door and strengthened walls .
At about 6 ft by 4ft , it is just about big enough for everyone to squash in .
After next door was hit last year , her 13 - year - old son has taken to sleeping there every night – " like a dog in a kennel " .
Shula remembers to the minute when the rocket hit next door : 4.15 pm on a Thursday .
She saw the rocket coming in , heard the crashing and smashing as " windows , doors , everything exploded " , and recalls the red - hot debris that she found on her porch .
More than half of next door 's roof was ripped off , and the house stands , apparently abandoned .
The neighbours , who were not at home at the time , were evacuated ; the Sassons have adopted their dogs , which mill around the tiled courtyard .
And there , as the sun suddenly comes out , and the lush greenery casts its shade , you catch a glimpse of the agreeable life for which Mrs Sasson is so nostalgic .

Now , though , hardly anyone walks outdoors unless they have to .
Once - pleasant residential streets are deserted .
Bus shelters double as rocket - shelters .
At the Superdahan supermarket in what passes for the centre of Sderot , the manager , Dan Dahan , offers a range that would put most small British supermarkets to shame .
He stocks everything any household would need , with colourful racks of fresh vegetables and fruit .
He wonders , though , how much longer he will be able to stay in business .
And if the supermarket closes , then so probably will the other remaining shops .
Increasingly he has to collect goods from the wholesalers himself ; no one will deliver in Sderot any more .
His trade has halved in past year .
It is not only because about 30 per cent of the population has left , it is because the exiles were the better - off residents , the ones without mortgages or with money to spare , who could afford to move .
He observes , too , that shopping habits have changed .
" Children are taken straight home from school by their parents ; they do n't drop in to buy sweets . "
There is fear in Sderot - fear of rockets and fear for the psychological damage to the next generation .
But there is subdued anger , too .
Far from hailing Israel 's withdrawal from Gaza or the recent resumption of the peace process , Mrs Sasson and her family feel abandoned .
Like Mr Dahan , she accuses the government of treating the residents of Sderot as " second - class citizens " .
If Sderot were wealthier , if the majority of its population were of European origin , if it were closer to Jerusalem – their inference is – then perhaps the government would have been tougher in its response .
As elsewhere in Israel , there was scorn in Sderot for the shutdown of the power station in Gaza – blamed on Israel – and the candle - carrying Palestinian children .
The whole episode was dismissed as a Hamas publicity stunt .
What Israel seems to have learnt , however , is that it is not just with rockets , but with publicity that this conflict is increasingly being fought .
Edwards : " The Clinton campaign has no conscience "
Edwards responded sharply to a Clinton aide 's criticism today , intensifying a back - and - forth that began at last night 's debate , after Clinton said Nataline Sarkisyan could be alive if the patients bill of rights , which he'd boasted of championing , had passed .
" The Clinton campaign has no conscience , " Edwards said , after Clinton spokesman Jay Carson said Edwards does no more than " read articles about people who need help and talk about them . "
" The idea that everything is about them [ suggests ] that they have no conscience , " Edwards said of the Clinton campaign , my colleague Josh Kraushaar reports .
" I 'm very surprised by the comments . "
Clinton , at her avail just now , responded .
" That 's just totally untrue , " she said of any implication she 'd blamed Edwards for the death during the debate , something his aides have suggested .
" He answered a question about what his greatest accomplishment was in the Senate by trying to mislead people that a bill he worked on became law . "
CORRECTION : An earlier version of this item indicated that Edwards was responding to Clinton .
He was responding to Carson .

News is reporting that a French company has developed a pollution - free car which runs on compressed air .
India 's Tata Motors has the car under production and it may be on sale in Europe and India by the end of the year .
The air car , also known as the Mini- CAT or City Cat , can be refueled in minutes from an air compressor at specially equipped gas stations and can go 200 km on a 1.5 euro fill - up -- roughly 125 miles for $ 3 .
The top speed will be almost 70 mph and the cost of the vehicle as low as $ 7000 .
The car features a fibreglass body and a revolutionary electrical system and is completely computer - controlled .
It is powered by the expansion of compressed air , using no combustion at all , and the exhaust is entirely clean and cool enough for use in the internal air conditioning system .
Tata Motors is known for its interest in innovation and has been selling compressed gas buses since 2000 .
It is currently working on producing the world 's cheapest car , which will be almost 100 % plastic and will sell in India for about $ 2500 .
Tata is also expanding into the world market .
It acquired Korea 's Daweoo in 2004 and is now the top bidder to purchase the originally British Jaguar and Land Rover lines from the United States ' troubled Ford Motor Company .

Former top White House aide Scooter Libby sentenced to 30 months in jail Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday June 5 , 2007 Print This Email This Federal District Judge Reggie B. Walton sentenced former top White House Aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby to 30 months in federal prison Tuesday morning in Washington , DC .
The sentence came in spite of the pleadings of many Libby friends and associates who said his commitment to public service justified leniency .
Libby will also pay a $ 250,000 fine , and be subject to two years of probation .
" Many defendants are first offenders , most defendants have family .
We need to make clear that the truth matters and one 's station in life does not matter , " said Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald , who also serves as the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , according to a summary of the proceedings at the blog Firedoglake .
Fitzgerald was harshly critical of Libby for lying , which he said impacted his investigation .
" We had to ... chase down rabbit holes that he took us down by lying to us , " the federal prosecutor said .
Fitzgerald also said that in the course of the investigation , the grand jury had " to sort through this fun house of mirrors . "
A Libby attorney , Theodore Wells , had argued that the former top aide to President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had faced " Public humiliation , " and given " exceptional public service to the nation , " which justified a court decision not to incarcerate him .
Libby 's own remarks were brief .
He expressed gratitude to the court for treating him kindly , and said he was ready for the sentence .
" Now I realize fully the Court must decide on punishment , and I hope the Court will consider my whole life , " he said .
Judge Walton did not seem persuaded by the pleadings of the ex-White House aide 's attorneys .
" I 've watched these proceedings with a sense of sadness because I have the highest respect for government servants .
It is important that we expect and demand a lot of people who are in those situations .
They have a certain high level obligation when they occupy that situation .
In this situation Libby failed to meet the bar , " the federal district judge said .
Libby was investigated in the course of a federal probe into the outing of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
Wilson 's husband , Ambassador Joseph Wilson , was sent to the African nation of Niger to investigate the veracity of claims that Iraq under Saddam Hussein had sought supplies of uranium for a nuclear weapons program in contravention of United Nations sanctions .
Special Counsel Fitzgerald indicted Libby on six charges in the course of the investigation , though Libby has not been charged with the actual outing of Wilson .
Libby 's jury trial concluded on March 6 .
He was found guilty of two counts of perjury , one obstruction of justice count , and one count making a false statement to federal investigators .
He was found not guilty on one other false statement charge .
Fitzgerald had sought the maximum sentence for Libby .
" Because the investigation defendant was convicted of endeavoring to obstruct focused on violations of the [ Intelligence Identities Protection Act ] and the Espionage Act ... the court must calculate defendants offense level by reference to the guidelines applicable to such violations , " Fitzgerald wrote in his sentencing recommendation to the judge .
Judge Walton in the hearing weighed whether or not the sentencing should be ' cross - referenced , ' or considered in light of the investigation of the outing of Valerie Plame Wilson 's identity .
A Walton judgment in favor of cross-referencing meant the difference between as much as 37 months in jail and as little as 15 months in jail .
To reduce the sentence , Libby 's attorney , William Jeffress , argued before Walton that the former White House aide had not participated in the underlying crime that triggered the investigation he is accused of obstructing .
That Libby had not himself been engaged in the outing of Valerie Plame 's identity as an agent of the CIA was a mitigating factor , he argued .
Judge Walton suggested in his follow - ups with Jeffress that Libby 's obstruction might have made it difficult to determine who was responsible for that crime .
Jeffress also continued to argue that Wilson was not truly covert , and that her husband had outed her on a variety of occasions in conversation with ' total strangers . '
A key part of Libby 's plea for leniency were the 160 letters written by individuals in an out of government attesting to his character .
Attorneys for Libby read excerpts from some of these letters in court .
Many of the letters were posted at the website The Smoking Gun .
" I know Mr. Libby to be a patriot , a dedicated public servant , a strong family man , and a tireless , honorable , selfless human being , wrote former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
" I would never have associated the actions for which he was convicted with his character .
Nor do I believe that they will ever be repeated .
Having served in the White House and under pressure , I have seen how difficult it is to recall precisely a particular series of events , " wrote Henry Kissinger , who served in the administration of President Richard Nixon and has advised President Bush on foreign policy issues .
The plans that Libby 's legal team has for an appeal of the verdict are not known , nor is it known whether President Bush will pardon the former aide .
No longer the plucky underdog , the growing renewables industry risks losing its license to operate unless it generates co-benefits .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush vetoed a bill on Tuesday that would force him to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq this year as a condition of funding the war , angering Democrats who vowed to fight on .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ Setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a deadline for failure , and that would be irresponsible , ” Bush said in a nationally televised speech shortly after issuing only the second veto of his presidency .
Bush ’s rejection of the legislation came on the four - year anniversary of his 2003 speech announcing the end of major combat operations in Iraq beneath a “ Mission Accomplished ” banner , an event roundly condemned by war critics .
“ Stop the war now , ” shouted a handful of protesters outside the White House gate .
In vetoing a $ 124 billion bill to fund wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , Bush said he was stopping legislation that “ substitutes the opinions of politicians for the judgment of our military commanders . ”
Under the legislation , which won the support of only four Republicans in Congress , American troop withdrawals would begin as early as July 1 and no later than October 1 , with the nonbinding goal of removing all combat troops by March 31 .
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives planned to hold a veto override vote on Wednesday , and while they did not have the votes to override his veto , they vowed to keep fighting for a change in course .
“ The president wants a blank check .
The Congress is not going to give it to him , ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California .
Bush invited congressional leaders to the White House to discuss next steps , saying , “ I ’m confident that with good will on both sides , we can agree on a bill that gets our troops the money and flexibility they need as soon as possible . ”
“ GREAT DISTANCE ”
Pelosi promised to work with Bush to find common ground , “ but there is a great distance between us right now . ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada added , “ If the president thinks that by vetoing this bill , he will stop us from working to change the direction of this war , he is mistaken . ”
Nearly $ 100 billion of the $ 124 billion bill would fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan this year .
The rest would fund domestic projects
Bush claims are either wasteful or not urgent , ranging from health care for poor children and farm aid to rebuilding southern states hit by 2005 hurricanes and increasing the minimum wage .
Anticipating that they will not be able to override the veto , congressional leaders are negotiating over new approaches for getting the war funds into the pipeline with conditions that Bush would accept .
Among ideas circulating on Capitol Hill are including “ benchmarks ” for measuring the Iraqi government ’s progress in stabilizing the country , where violence has been particularly gruesome recently .
It is unclear whether that progress would be tied to aid to Iraq or some sort of language on U.S. troop levels .

Russert predicts Paul could beat Giuliani in Iowa David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday January 2 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Republican presidential contender Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) could be poised to beat Rudy Giuliani -- once perceived as a frontrunner for the GOP nomination -- in Thursday 's Iowa caucus voting , according to NBC's Tim Russert .
Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe program for a discussion about the latest Iowa polling numbers , Russert said Paul could realistically score a fourth place showing in the state .
" Having gone around and watching this thing , " said Russert , " to say for example Huckabee wins , Romney is two .
McCain comes in third .
Thompson is out -- he has already said if he 's not two , he 's out .
I think Ron Paul has a chance of coming in fourth here .
I really do . "
Assuming former Sen. Fred Thompson ( R - TN ) took fifth , Russert added that it appeared likely Giuliani could slip to a lowly sixth place finish .
Conservative pundit and two - time Republican presidential aspirant Pat Buchanan said he believed the former New York mayor was now facing an uphill fight for his party 's nomination .
" I think Rudy is toast ... I mean , you can't go 0 - 4 , 0 - 5 , and come back and win Florida , " said Buchanan of the possibility that Giuliani could fair poorly in the opening contests of the primary season .
Giuliani has not campaigned heavily in Iowa , choosing instead to adopt a national strategy focused on other states , such as Florida , that vote later in the primary process .
More than twenty states , including New York and California go to the polls on February 5 .
" When you get to Florida and the February 5th states , " Giuliani told Fox News , " we 're ahead in some cases by large percentages and in some case by closer percentages .
We believe it 's a good strategy and it 's going to work . "
The latest poll from Iowa 's Des Moines Register tallies Giuliani 's support in the state at five percent .
Paul and Thompson each notch nine percent .

Hard Disk Drive Performance Comparison Guide
Hard disk drives , also known as hard drives or simply HDDs , are critical components of every computer .
Although flash - based SSDs ( solid state drives ) are making some inroads , the ubiquitous hard disk drive is still the ultimate storage choice for most users .
Hard disk drives provide a large amount of data storage at low cost .
Perfect for storing bloated software and all sorts of " interesting stuff " that we download from the Internet .
Of course , the hard disk drive is more than just a repository for our data , or a place to store the games we play .
It affects the performance of our PCs , especially how long it takes to launch applications or games , or open up files .
Its performance is also critical if you are low on RAM because your PC will use more virtual memory .
This is where the Hard Disk Drive Performance Comparison Guide comes in .
In this article , we will be comparing the performance of all the hard disk drives we can get our hands on .
This would be similar to our Solid State Drive Performance Comparison Guide .
It may start off small , but we intend to keep adding new hard disk drives and even new benchmarks as we go along .
Let 's take a look at the hard disk drives we have rounded up for this comparison .

Testing Methodology
We tested in Windows 7 and Windows Vista , with the latest updates .
We chose to use our " old faithful " benchmarks , IO Meter 2008 and WinBench 99 2.0 , with the following tests :
Business Disk WinMark 99
High - End Disk WinMark 99
Disk Transfer Rate ( Beginning )
Disk Transfer Rate ( End )
Platter Data Transfer Profile
Business Disk WinMark 99 is a real - world simulation based on three office application suites - Microsoft Office 97 , Lotus SmartSuite and Corel WordPerfect Suite 8 , as well as a web browser , Netscape Navigator .
They are quite dated , but should still reflect the usage patterns of users in an office environment using such applications .
The test runs through a script that keeps multiple applications open , while it performs tasks that switches between those applications and Netscape Navigator .
The result is the average transfer rate during the script run .
High - End Disk WinMark 99 is a real - world simulation based on AVS / Express 3.4 , FrontPage 98 , MicroStation SE , Photoshop 4.0 , Premiere 4.2 , Sound Forge 4.0 and Visual C++ 5.0 .
However , it differs by running the applications serially , instead of simultaneously .
There are individual results for each application but in this comparison , we will be looking only at the weighted average score , which is the average transfer rate during the tests .
Unfortunately , WinBench 99 seemed to have some issues with Windows Vista , or the current Vista driver for the SATA controller .
It would register a SetFilePointer error in the Disk Access Time test .
So , we were not able to obtain any Disk Access Time results .
In addition , it would keep crashing if the hard drive was tested with a single partition .
This is likely due to a limit on the size of the partition that is supported by WinBench 99 .
We came up with a workaround by dividing the hard drive into several partitions of equal sizes .
We tested each partition individually and averaged the results .

As recent developments in the Linux kernel have shown , the process scheduler is a very important component of a modern operating system .
David Chisnall examines the conflicting requirements for a good scheduler .

The Linux world recently saw some controversy over the introduction of a new scheduler .
While the politics behind this decision are somewhat interesting , they ’re not the topic of this article , which seeks to explain exactly what a scheduler does , and how it works .
Virtual Virtualization
The basic task of a modern operating system is virtualization .
Our friends over at Microsoft seem to have just realized this fact , and are trying to re-brand old operating system contexts as " virtualization " in order to be fully buzzword - compliant .
Virtualization of resources is important , because it allows us to run more than one program on a single computer .
Some of the earliest home computers did n’t do this at all ; each program came on its own tape and used the computer ’s resources to the full .
Even systems such as CP / M and MS - DOS did some basic virtualization by splitting the disk into files , thereby allowing different programs to share the same disk .
Each file is , conceptually , a virtual disk .
DOS also performed some virtualization of the computer ’s memory , allowing small programs ( .COM files ) that could fit into a single 8086 segment ( 64KB ) to install themselves in some memory that would n’t be given to other programs and could handle certain interrupts .
Later , windowing systems helped to virtualize the screen ; individual applications would draw in a virtual screen ( window ) and then the windowing system would arrange these screens .
All of these options use some kind of spatial partitioning .
Both disks and RAM are split into variable - sized blocks .
The CPU is slightly different .
With a modern multicore processor , you could allocate one core to each process , but you would quickly run out of cores by doing so .
The solution is to make all the processes take turns using the CPU .
Hearsay , secrecy were fair game at Hamdan ' free - for - all ' Jason Rhyne

Print This Email This Amnesty observer : Bush tribunal law allows countless ways to launder evidence From a bird 's eye view , the military commission hearings held earlier this month in the case of alleged al - Qaeda associate Salim Ahmed Hamdan might have been mistaken for a typical American courtroom scene : Evidence was introduced , witnesses were cross-examined , and the accused , who for five and a half years has been detained at the US military base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , was represented by a team of defense lawyers .
But it should n't be mistaken for justice , say some human rights advocates who observed the hearings .
The pre-trial proceedings in Hamdan 's case , carried out under provisions set forth by the controversial 2006 Military Commissions
Act , were held to determine whether the detainee can be designated as an unlawful military combatant -- a distinction that would allow military prosecutors to try him on charges of conspiracy and providing material support for al - Qaeda terrorists .
However , the two - day hearing sessions were marked by hearsay evidence , denied witness requests and challenging time constraints , Jumana Musa , the advocacy director for domestic human rights and international justice at Amnesty International USA told RAW STORY .
Taken into custody by US forces in Afghanistan in 2001 , the Yemen - born Hamdan alleges that he was routinely beaten , subjected to subfreezing temperatures and threatened with death and torture by his US guards there .
Later , after being transferred to Guantanamo , he says he faced eight months of maddening solitary confinement .
Although Hamdan 's lawyers do n't deny their client once served as a driver for Osama bin Laden , the defense maintains he was little more than a hired hand for the group , and should be afforded rights under the Geneva Conventions as a prisoner of war .
During his recent hearing , however , an Army major offered new testimony that would seem to implicate Hamdan more directly in al - Qaeda activities .
He said he saw two surface - to - air missiles in a car -- which the major was told belonged to Hamdan -- shortly after the detainee was captured .
Testimony was ' hearsay upon hearsay '
But the major 's testimony was not based on a first - hand account , said Musa , who was one of a handful of human rights observers who traveled to Guantanamo for the hearings .
" He 's reporting on what he was told when he got on the scene , and he certainly seemed like a straight shooter , he was there , " Musa said , but added that his testimony would n't necessarily even be admissible were Hamdan being tried in conventional American court .
" It 's hearsay upon hearsay , " she added , describing the military commission 's willingness to accept hearsay evidence as " far more broad that anything you would allow into a US courtroom . "
A differing standard on the admissibility of evidence are just one of the ways in which the military tribunals part company with the strict legal conditions of civilian court .
The attorney also raised questions about the testimonies of two federal interrogators who had questioned Hamdan .
As reported by the Los Angeles Times , Robert McFadden , an agent with the Department of Defense , testified " that Hamdan confessed in May 2003 to making weapons pickups and deliveries for Bin Laden .
Hamdan also said he had pledged allegiance to Bin Laden -- on condition that Al Qaeda remained focused on fighting for liberation of the Arabian peninsula and against ' Jews and crusaders , ' not other Muslims ... "
Another official who interrogated Hamdan , FBI agent George Crouch Jr. , said Hamdan told him he had driven bin Laden and his son on a " road trip " following the Sept. 11 attacks in an apparent effort to evade the Americans , according to the New York Times .
" I think the issue there though is these were interrogations done without attorneys , " Musa told RAW STORY .
" He was told , 'if you tell us what you know , you can go home ' ... he talked a lot .
He was told it would help him go home and now he 's being tried as unlawful military combatant . "
Musa warns that the tribunals offer no true way of knowing if incriminating statements have been extracted from detainees through harsh interrogation techniques or torture .
" The reality of the situation is , the way it was written , there 's 162 ways to launder evidence , " she said .
" Maybe that information was obtained through waterboarding somebody , but you 'll never know , because that information was classified . "
Revelations that the CIA destroyed at least two videotapes showing severe interrogations used on al - Qaeda detainees came to light as the Hamdan hearings were underway .
In a recent piece at Salon , Hina Shamsi , an ACLU attorney who observed the hearings , also cautioned about potential loopholes in the commissions legislation .
" For the first time in U.S. history , and under pressure from the Bush administration , in the Military Commissions Act , Congress explicitly authorized an American tribunal to permit evidence obtained through ' cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment ' as long as it was obtained before Dec. 31 , 2005 , " writes Shamsi .
" Even though the Military Commissions Act prohibits evidence obtained through torture , it could still come in because of this cruel treatment loophole , combined with the other provisions that permit secret evidence and evidence from second - and third - hand sources . "
Lawyer complains Gitmo justice being ' run on a clock '
The judge for the hearing , Navy Capt .
Keith Allred , denied a defense request to call as witnesses so - called " high - value detainees , " including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who Hamdan 's lawyers had hoped might contradict government assertions that Hamdan was more than casually associated with the al - Qaeda organization .
Prosecutors had argued that the requested high - value witnesses were only accessible to individuals with specialized clearance -- and that the two - day hearing did n't allow enough time to carry out the required clearance process .
" A lot of that is put out there as protecting sources and methods , " Musa told RAW STORY .
" It 's extremely problematic when you 're seeking to keep someone from speaking to a witness , and I 'm not saying there are no security concerns , but concerns have been amplified for wrong reasons . "
The attorney said that the finite time allowed for the hearing presented a serious challenge for the defense .
" The judge seemed to be making every accommodation , " she said , but added that as the end of the hearing approached , there " appeared to be more of an imperative to finish for Friday .
A lot of stuff was left hanging ... usually justice is n't run on a clock . "
The loose ends are being handled by email and phone calls , she said , and a written ruling on Hamdan 's status will be issued by the judge .
Although Musa had praise for the conduct of officials involved in the status hearing , she suggested that the commission structure itself was fatally flawed .
" When the system itself is rigged , good staffing does n't fix it .
It 's the system , it 's not the actors involved . "
In many ways , Hamdan has become a test case for the constitutionality of the Bush administration 's push for detainee tribunals .
In 2004 , a DC district court found the Bush - backed trials for Hamdan to be unlawful , but that decision was overturned by a three - judge panel of the DC federal appeals court , which included the future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , John Roberts .
Hamdan 's case later advanced to the Supreme Court , which found tribunals in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions -- but Congress swept quickly into action , trumping the high court with its passage of the Military Commissions Act .
Defenders of the trials contend that as non-US citizens , foreign detainees are not entitled to the full scope of habeas corpus rights which guarantee an individual the right to challenge their detainment in court .
" Congress cannot ' suspend ' habeas corpus by denying it to people who have no right to it in the first place , " wrote Andrew McCarthy in a 2006 opinion piece about the Military Commissions Act published at the conservative National Review Online .
After the Act 's passage , President Bush had lauded the measure .
" Under this program , suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country .
Information we have learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad , " he said .
" By authorizing the creation of military commissions , the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes . "
A Pentagon spokesman did not respond to RAW STORY 's request for comment on the Hamdan hearings .
The Supreme Court may be poised to a offer definitive ruling on on the matter , and heard oral arguments earlier this month about whether the Constitution allows for Congress to block detainees ' access to civilian courts .
But for now , critics of the legislation allowing the trials believe that Hamdan -- along with the 80 additional detainees the US plans to prosecute for their alleged terror links -- are facing long odds of receiving true justice via a military tribunal .
" I think the legislation that set it up was abominable , " Musa told RAW STORY .
" In this system , " she said , " it really is a free - for - all . "
LABOUR conditions in China can be notoriously lousy .
Reports abound of sweatshops , workers ' protests and this year even of officials condoning the luring of children into slavery .
A new law on employment contracts , coming into effect on January 1st , will in theory improve workers ' lots , but is creating more headaches .
The law is supposed to provide greater job security .
Workers with ten years or more of service will have open - ended contracts and companies will have to inform unions before sacking anyone .
Employers fear the law will mean bigger severance payments .
The unions will also have the power to negotiate collective contracts .
But the law has many detractors .
Some allege it will take China back to the “ iron rice bowl ” era of Maoist days when jobs were for life and the economy was crippled by a lack of incentive .
Others , conversely , argue that it will strengthen state - controlled unions but do little for downtrodden workers .
Both sides agree it has loopholes , which companies have been racing to exploit .
The Chinese press has cited numerous attempts by enterprises to circumvent the law .
Huawei , China 's best - known maker of telecommunications equipment , has attracted special notice .
It has been accused of asking some 7,000 employees with more than eight years of service to resign to compete for new short - term posts .
The aim , allegedly , was to reclassify them as new employees .
The new law has been a boon to the All - China Federation of Trade Unions ( ACFTU ) , an umbrella for all China 's unions that is in effect an arm of government .
In recent years it has seen its power eroded as state - owned industries have collapsed and the private sector has flourished , eschewing niceties such as unions and Communist Party cells .
After persuading Huawei , which denied trying to evade the law , to revise its plans , the ACFTU this week issued a stern warning to other companies not to try anything similar .
It said a “ small number ” were laying off large numbers of workers in advance of the new law .
This , it said , was threatening the success of efforts to build a “ socialist harmonious society ” and should be “ resolutely stopped ” .
But for all the ACFTU 's propaganda , few expect it to emerge as a strident new champion of workers ' rights .
Independent trade unions will remain in effect illegal .
China has no plans to reintroduce the right to strike , which it abolished in 1982 as it began to fret about the example set by the Solidarity trade - union movement in Poland .
The role of the ACFTU , in the government 's eyes , is to prevent worker unrest .
One of the main aims of the new law is to counter the widespread complaints in China that the country has been over - zealous in its embrace of capitalism .
These complaints became particularly shrill in June , after reports emerged that local officials in the northern province of Shanxi had allowed rural brick kilns to lure hundreds of people , including children , to work in slave - like conditions .
The new law had been publicly debated long before the scandal surfaced .
But its critics say the government rushed to push it through the rubber - stamp legislature in June in order to assuage public anger over the kilns .
One of the law 's most outspoken critics is Dong Baohua of the East China University of Political Science and Law , who helped draft China 's first labour law in 1994 .
Among Mr Dong 's complaints is that the new law does nothing to improve the lot of tens of millions of migrant workers from the countryside .
They make up most of the unskilled labour in urban areas and are the most frequent victims of poor labour conditions .
China 's official trade unions have yet to build a network among such workers .
Nor will the law help people such as Shanxi 's slaves , who suffer not from a lack of legal protection but from poor enforcement .
Mr Dong also says the new law will not cut the number of labour disputes , which have become increasingly common in recent years ( see chart ) .
For all the ACFTU 's fulminations , critics say many companies will continue efforts to evade the law or else simply ignore it .
But in an interview published by one of China 's biggest - circulation newspapers , Southern Weekend , Mr Dong argued that China could also end up like France , with its economy numbed by costly employment benefits and strikes triggered by any effort to reform them .
That , he said , would be the “ most terrifying ” outcome for China .
The party would agree .

QuickTime flaw Could be next Menace for Users
In the United States , the fourth Friday in November is commonly referred to as " Black Friday " and traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season , coming the day after Thanksgiving and forming part of an informal four or five day weekend .
Windows QuickTime users might be marking Black Friday for another reason this year , with the emergence of a new threat to QuickTime , just two weeks after the latest version ( 7.3 ) was released .
A proof - of - concept exploit for a remote code execution vulnerability with the way that QuickTime interprets RTSP ( Real Time Streaming Protocol ) responses was posted on Black Friday , marking one of the first public disclosures of this vulnerability affecting the latest QuickTime versions .
Normally there is some delay between proof - of - concept and public exploit code being published , with many proof - of - concept releases going no further than the initial publication .
With this particular vulnerability , two exploit samples were released within 24 hours of the initial proof - of - concept .
At this stage , Apple have yet to release any information about the vulnerability , but there is mitigation advice available for concerned users and administrators .
There has also been no confirmation that the vulnerability affects the OS X version of QuickTime , but there is the possibility that it is also vulnerable given historical problems with QuickTime 's RTSP support on OS X .
With the widespread coverage of OS X - specific malware earlier this month , and the ease with which this new exploit could be integrated with a malicious media stream , users and administrators of both OS X and Windows systems , who also have QuickTime installed , need to be cautious about their risk exposure and mitigate as appropriate against this new threat .

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , who built his fortune on innovations in information technology , announced a plan yesterday that will allow emergency 911 call centers and the popular 311 service line to receive digital photos and videos from callers .
The city will be the first in the nation to incorporate digital images into its 911 system , Mr. Bloomberg said , calling it a “ revolutionary innovation in crime fighting . ”
“ If you see a crime in progress or a dangerous building condition , you ’ll be able to transmit images to 911 , or online to nyc.gov , ” the mayor said in his annual State of the City address .
“ And we ’ll start extending the same technology to 311 to allow New Yorkers to step forward and document nonemergency quality of life concerns , holding city agencies accountable for correcting them quickly and efficiently . ”
John Feinblatt , the mayor ’s criminal justice coordinator , could not say how long it will take to implement the plan , but said it would be fairly inexpensive because the technology already exists .
The candidates have spent a year and tens of millions of dollars in Iowa , and Thursday night the first actual voters offered their first assessments .
Some candidates and their strategists were hoping the caucuses and the New Hampshire primary next week would settle the race , weeding out the contenders for the two major parties ’ presidential nominations .
Watching the campaign in cold , snowy and mostly empty Iowa , we were hoping for something else  that this year ’s Iowa - New Hampshire rush to judgment will be the last .
For all of Thursday night ’s drama , the results in Iowa did not preclude a race going into New Hampshire , and , we hope , beyond  to South Carolina , Florida and the cluster of primaries on Feb .
5 . Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton , but she ’s got plenty of money left , and John Edwards got a boost .
Mike Huckabee ’s win was unlikely to deter Mitt Romney or the Republicans who did not contest Iowa : John McCain and Rudolph Giuliani .
Keeping this race alive so significant numbers of Americans in more populated states can participate would begin to make up for the ludicrous spectacle of the past year , which enriched the television networks and the political consultants ( some $ 300 million already spent ) far more than it enriched the political dialogue .
We hope both parties will wake up and end the undemocratic system in which the choice of a new president rests far too heavily on nonbinding votes in January by voters that do n’t necessarily represent the rest of the country .
We do n’t question the enthusiasm or the commitment of the people of Iowa and New Hampshire .
But Iowa , where a huge turnout amounts to less than 10 percent of the population , is about 92 percent white , more rural and older than the rest of the nation .
New Hampshire has a non-Hispanic white population of about 95 percent .
Iowa ’s Democrats are more liberal and more protectionist than the nation ’s Democrats .
Its Republicans are more conservative , and religiously driven , than the nation ’s Republicans .
And yet , The Boston Globe reported that Mr. Romney spent $ 7 million on ads in Iowa .
That ’s nearly $ 4 per registered voter .
Iowa and New Hampshire Republicans are about to start choosing a standard - bearer for the 2008 elections .
If members of the GOP want to rescue their party from its disastrous decline in the public ’s trust , they must reject the shameless , dishonorable , dishonest former governor of Massachusetts , Willard Mitt Romney .
Recently , the Boston Phoenix broke the story that Mitt Romney ’s claim to have seen his father march with Martin Luther King Jr. was , to put it bluntly , a lie .
Further reporting has now clearly demonstrated that George Romney never marched with King .
The story spread like wildfire , forcing Romney to offer a humiliating dissertation on his interpretation of the word “ saw . ” CNN , the New York Times , Hardball with Chris Matthews , and the rest of the punditry pounced on the story , as did the blogosphere — from the left , right , and center of the ideological spectrum .
The reason the story made such waves , and the reason the Romney campaign fought so hard to stop it ( even , knowing it was false , putting forward two “ witnesses ” to describe an easily disproven event ) , is that it confirms and epitomizes what everyone already knows about Romney .
Pundits and commentators describe this Romney trait as an “ authenticity problem , ” or “ questions about his sincerity . ”
We call it lying .
It is something he does repeatedly , on issues large and small .
On the presidential campaign trail , he had previously been caught lying about his mythical exploits as a “ lifelong hunter ” ; a non-existent 2002 NRA endorsement ; an inflated $ 3 billion state budget deficit ; and fictional steps taken to combat methamphetamine .
He has told ever - changing tales to explain his purely opportunistic 180 - degree turns on important issues .
There is nothing new here .
It is Romney ’s character through - and - through — he is a slick salesman who will say anything , regardless of the truth or the consequences , in his vain quest for self - promotion .
In his first race for public office , in 1994 , he fabricated stories of his mother ’s abortion - rights activism , and falsely claimed to have had no knowledge of , or authority over , the heartless sacking of employees at a company bought by his leveraged - buyout firm .
As far back as 1978 , we now learn , Romney was so bold a liar as to claim , to the Boston Herald , that he personally had marched with Dr. King .
Nothing has changed about his character since .
This newspaper called for Romney ’s resignation as governor , when it became clear that he was acting not for the good of the citizens of the commonwealth , but to create blurbs for the campaign pamphlets that would soon be sent to Republicans in Iowa and South Carolina .
National candidates have been forced to end their campaigns over much lesser evidence of character flaws : Joe Biden for plagiarism , Gary Hart for philandering , Thomas Eagleton for depression .
Romney ’s own father dropped out after speaking the truth , with poor choice of words , about what he saw happening in Vietnam .
Gross habitual deception of the public , it seems to us , is a far worse trait to find in a presidential candidate .
It is , of course , exactly the trait the American public has learned to associate with the GOP .
Mind you , lies and deception are not exclusive to any one party or era .
But it ’s hard to top the Republican Party of the past several years .
The Republican president , George W. Bush , has lied his way into war , and into all - time record disapproval ratings .
His vice - president , Dick Cheney , makes Bush look like an Honest Abe .
Their top advisors — people like Karl Rove and Scooter Libby — have been caught out as liars .
Their former secretary of state , Colin Powell , lied to the United Nations ; their current secretary of state , Condi Rice , lied to Congress ( more than once ) ; their former secretary of defense , Don Rumsfeld , lied ; their former attorney general , Alberto Gonzalez , lied .
Republican leaders covered up for Mark Foley , when they knew he was stalking young Congressional pages .
And we could go on and on .
As recently as 2006 , the Republican Party dominated the national political landscape .
The entire executive branch of the federal government , the majority leadership of both houses of Congress , and the governors of nearly all of the country ’s largest states were Republicans .
Today , the GOP is in total disrepute and disarray — which is why an undistinguished one - term former governor of a mid-sized state can be a front - runner for the party ’s nomination .
Romney has bet his campaign on a belief that he can hoodwink Republican voters in Iowa and New Hampshire into believing his latest set of self - promotional pablum .
We urge those voters to strongly reject his sales pitch , and restore some small amount of dignity to the Grand Old Party .
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - A Pakistani television channel broadcast on Sunday grainy still pictures of what it said appeared to be two men who attacked and killed opposition leader Benazir Bhutto .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Former prime minister Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack on Thursday as she stood up through the sun-roof of her bullet - proof vehicle to wave to supporter as she left an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi .
The government has blamed al Qaeda .
Dawn News
Television showed three pictures it said it had obtained from an amateur photographer .
One showed two men standing in the crowd outside the rally ground before Bhutto left .
One was a clean - cut young man wearing sun glasses , a white shirt and dark waist coat .
Behind him stood a man with a white shawl over his head , who Dawn said was believed to be the bomber .
Two other photographs showed the clean - cut man pointing a pistol at Bhutto as she left the rally .
He appeared to be about 10 feet from Bhutto , standing on the left of her vehicle , pointing the gun with his right hand as she faced away from him .
Authorities said three shots were fired at Bhutto moments before a suicide bomber set off explosives .
As well as Bhutto , 23 people were killed .
Authorities have not said how many attackers they believed were involved .
Senior police and government officials declined immediate comment saying a four - officer team was handling the investigation .
The government said Bhutto was killed when the force of the blast smashed her head into a lever on the sun-roof , which fractured her skull .
Her party dismisses that as “ ludicrous ” saying she was killed by a bullet in the head .
Doctors did not carry out a post - mortem of Bhutto ’s body on the instructions of her family , officials say .
The Interior Ministry said on Saturday her body could be exhumed for more tests if her party wanted .
Your Weekly World Tools Printer Friendly SEVEN CONGRESSMEN ARE ZOMBIES !
At least seven U.S. congressmen are boot - licking zombies controlled by Haiti 's supersecret AIH intelligence agency , but here 's the clincher : Nobody can figure out who they are because the living dead -- with their shuffling gait , wrinkled skin and glassy stares -- are indistinguishable from all the senior - citizen politicians on Capitol Hill .
So says the FBI in a frightening internal report that suggests the House of Representatives " could become a nest of zombies within the next 10 years . . . and the American public would be none the wiser . "
" It 's a serious situation with national security implications that do not bode well for our future as a free nation , " says a senior FBI official who leaked portions of the report to journalists in Washington .
" By definition , zombies have limited mental faculties , no emotion , no free will , and they are only able to function at the behest of voodoo priests who control their every move .

How many times have you left your Mac on , and later while you ’re out and about you wish you would have turned the thing off or put it to sleep ?
Would n’t it be nice to be able to put it to sleep remotely with a quick email or text message ?
You can , and it ’s easier than you ’d think .
You ’re just a simple AppleScript and a few Mail rules away from putting your Mac to sleep from virtually anywhere .
We ’ll show you how to do it , but if you ’re still confused then a screencast demonstrating the technique is also available :
Note : A alternate version of this lets you use SSH or an iPhone for remote sleep of a Mac too .
Use whichever method you prefer .
The easiest approach to this uses AppleScript and a Mail rule to accomplish remote sleep via an inbound email to the Mac that is awake .
The method goes like this :
How to Sleep a Mac Remotely via an Email
This will use a simple AppleScript an Mail Rule to allow for remote sleep via email to the Mac running the script .
Here ’s how to set this up :
Launch Script Editor ( in / Applications -> Utilities ) , and create a new Apple Script
The new AppleScript should be containing the following three lines : tell application " Finder "
sleep

Residents lined up to ask questions of Representatives Nadler , Clarke , and Weiner at a Town Hall meeting held in Park Slope ’s Old Church .
Brooklyn residents lashed out at local congressman over their inability to end the war in Iraq at a Park Slope meeting recently .
What was billed as a town hall discussion on why the US was still in Iraq and the best way of getting out quickly turned heated , Brooklyn Representatives Anthony Weiner , Yvette Clarke and Jerrold Nadler withstood over two hours of sometimes hostile questions about the ongoing war in an event sponsored by the Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats at Old First Church .
All representatives spoke forcefully against the war and advocated a quick withdrawal from the country .
In opening remarks , Rep. Nadler called the U.S. presence in the country “ stupid ”  and said that the threat of Al Queda in Iraq was greatly exaggerated .
“ Al Queda is not a problem , ”  said Nadler .
“ If we left tomorrow , the Sunnis and the Shiites would fight each other to see who could eliminate Al Queda first , ”  comments which reflected recent analysis suggesting that the terrorist group enjoys little popular support in the country .
Rep .
Clarke expressed frustration at the inability of the Democratic majority to withdraw , saying that a number of newly elected members of Congress were concerned about maintaining their seats .
“ Sometimes you feel like you ’ve been stabbed in the back by one of your own , ”  Rep .
Clarke said .
Rep .
Clarke drew cheers when she suggested that impeachment proceedings were in order .
A woman held up a sign which read in red block letters “ IMPEACH . ” 
Weiner sounded a similar note to the others saying that removing the U.S. from the country would “ remove an irritant ”  from the country .
Rep .
Weiner , however , came under withering criticism – perhaps unexpectedly for the strongly anti-war congressman – for his refusal to support the initiation of impeachment proceedings against President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
While stating that the two leaders had done “ impeachable things , ”  Weiner said that impeachment proceedings would occupy the congress and prevent them from doing anything else with their majority .
The position elicited a mix of applause and boos as subsequent questioners expressed strong disagreement .
“ It blows my mind that you equate impeachment with looking backwards , ”  said one .
The moderator was forced several times to remind audience members to keep their questions to under a minute .
Eventually , Rep. Nadler came to a haggard - looking Weiner ’s defense , saying that he agreed with him .
New York Senators Clinton and Chuck Schumer were invited to the forum but declined to attend .
Both leaders were mentioned in passing by questioners , eliciting boos from the audience .
Rep .
Nadler mounted a strong defense to a Green Party representative who said her party would under no circumstances vote and in 2002 voted to authorize military action in Iraq .
“ If you think there ’s no difference between the Republicans and Hillary Clinton , ”  said Nadler , enumerating topics on which they different .
“ you are not living in the real world . ” 
Former Congressional Representative Major
Owens spoke briefly , drawing enthusiastic cheers from the audience .
“ Oh , what fools we mortals “ “ we Brooklynites be “ “ if we do n’t rise up against this , ”  Owens said .
After two hours , Rep. Weiner withdrew , citing another meeting .
One of his impeachment interrogators , Laurie Arbeiter of Park Slope , followed Weiner into the hallway and confronted him .
An argument ensued .
“ How are you going to let these two criminals get away with this ? ”  said Arbeiter , at the height of the disagreement .
“ I disagree with you and I told you so , ”  said Weiner , vehemently .
“ You said they were impeachable offenses , ”  said Arbeiter .
“ Impeachable offenses ” ¦ ” 
Weiner turned to address a more gentle question from another attendee , and Arbeiter withdrew , unsatisfied .
In interviews prior to the meeting , attendees expressed frustration and exhaustion with the agonizingly long war .
“ I ’m absolutely weary , but I ’ve come out of the rage and depression ”  said Laura Gillespie , a teacher and Park Slope resident .
“ Because they invited all these reps out her I decided to step out .
“ I think it ’s important to let [ the representatives ] know we have n’t gone to sleep , ”  said her husband , Michael Smith , a musician .
“ Our eyes may be droopy , but we ’re still here . ” 
Throughout the evening , a computerized tally projected on the a screen kept track of the amount of money the war has cost Brooklyn .
It currently stands at over $ 4 billion dollars .
At the end of the discussion , the total had increased by another $ 220,000 dollars .
KABUL , Afghanistan  Afghanistan 's upper house of parliament lauded the death sentence handed down against a local journalist who was found guilty of insulting Islam , an official said Wednesday .
In a statement signed by Sibghatullah Mojaddedi , the chamber 's chairman , the Senate also condemned what it called " international interference " to have the sentence annulled , spokesman Aminuddin Muzafari said .
The journalist , 23 - year - old Sayed Parwez Kaambakhsh , was sentenced to death last week by a three - judge panel in the northern city of Mazar - i- Sharif for distributing a report he printed off the Internet to journalism students at Balkh University .
The article asked why men can have four wives but women can't have multiple husbands .
The court in Mazar - i- Sharif found that the article humiliated Islam .
Members of a clerical council also pushed for Kaambakhsh to be punished .
" That issue was not in the ( Senate 's ) agenda , but when lawmakers gathered on Tuesday they insisted on talking about that case , " Muzafari said .
Following a debate , lawmakers decided to issue the statement supporting the court 's decision , he said .
Kaambakhsh has appealed his conviction and the case will now go to an appeals court .
President Hamid Karzai will have the final say in the matter .
International human rights groups have condemned the sentence and called on Afghan authorities to quash it .

Rudy Giuliani has a firefighter problem .
Following up on earlier criticism , a group of 9/11 family members and firefighters met on Monday at Dartmouth College to launch a campaign against the former New York City mayor and current Republican presidential candidate for what they deem to be massive failures before , during and after the attacks of 9/11 .
But at least one member of the FDNY continues to offer his support to the former mayor -- and may be getting paid for it .
John R. Orlando , who serves with Engine 216 in Brooklyn , New York , has been cited prominently as a Giuliani supporter .
Last June , in a New York Times article detailing the mixed reviews Giuliani has among the city 's 11,000 - membered firefighting force , Orlando said he regularly saw Giuliani at fires despite suggestions otherwise .

“ You know , in the years after her husband signed Nafta , Senator Clinton would go around talking about how great it was and how many benefits it would bring , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Now that she ’s running for president , she says we need a time - out on trade .
No one knows when this time - out will end .
Maybe after the election . ”
Mr. Obama , who has won 21 states in the Democratic presidential nominating fight , is working to add Wisconsin to his string of victories by tapping into an anti-war sentiment .
As he pointed out his opposition to the war , he linked Mrs. Clinton with Senator McCain as he pointed out the failures of Washington .
“ It ’s a Washington where politicians like John McCain and Hillary Clinton voted for a war in Iraq that should ’ve never been authorized and never been waged  a war that is costing us thousands of precious lives and billions of dollars a week , ” Mr. Obama said .
In his speech in Janesville , Mr. Obama proposed creating a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank to invest $ 60 billion over 10 years and create nearly 2 million new jobs in the construction field .
He said the program would be paid for by ending the Iraq war .
He also renewed his call to create an energy plan to invest $ 150 billion over 10 years to establish a “ green energy sector ” to add up to 5 million jobs in the next two decades .
“ It ’s time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put Iraq back together and start spending the money on putting America back together instead , ” Mr. Obama said .
He added , “ We ’ll also provide funding to help manufacturers convert to green technology and help workers learn the skills they need for these jobs . ”
Mrs. Clinton , speaking before an enthusiastic crowd on Wednesday morning in McAllen , Texas , also struck economic themes , saying she offered solutions for voters ’ financial struggles while Mr. Obama offered “ rhetoric . ”
The New York Democrat blasted her Democratic rival for the nomination for having “ a plan that fails to provide universal health care , fails to address the housing crisis , and fails to immediately start creating good - paying jobs . ”
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Norway , which last year set what it called the world ’s most ambitious target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , said on Thursday it aimed to go “ carbon neutral ” in 2030 , which is 20 years earlier than its previous target .
The new target was set when the Labour - led coalition government reached agreement with three opposition parties to bring the goal forward from 2050 .
The government said last year that Norway would aim to cut net emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to nil by 2050 by reducing emissions at home and investing abroad in environmental projects that will give Norway CO2 reduction credits .
The plan includes offsetting Norwegian emissions by spending around 3 billion crowns ( $ 553.1 million ) per year to combat deforestation in developing countries .
Forests act as a sink for CO2 , the main greenhouse gas blamed for causing global warming .
Under the Kyoto Protocol curbing greenhouse emissions , countries do not get credit for the effect of their own forests , but they can get credits by planting trees in developing lands .
“ The parties now think it is realistic to assume reductions in Norwegian climate gas emissions of 15 - 17 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents by 2020 when forests are included , ” the government said in a statement .
Three million metric tons of that reduction would come from Norway ’s forests absorbing carbon , it said .
The initial target was to cut 13 - 16 million metric tons of CO2 .
Achieving the target will require cutting Norway ’s total emissions by two - thirds domestically , the statement said .
Environmental groups said the deal was too vague , and Oil and Energy Minister Aaslaug Haga acknowledged : “ We do n’t know how we will achieve the goals yet , and that is challenging . ”
A “ significant sum ” of money will be earmarked for investment in renewable energy , mass transport and measures to reduce emissions from the transport sector , while tax on diesel fuel will rise by 0.1 crowns ( $ 0.018 ) per liter and on gasoline by 0.05 crowns , the government said .
“ Both carrot and stick will be used to promote more environmentally friendly behavior and to reduce climate gas emissions , ” the centre - left coalition said .
Finance Minister Kristin Halvorsen of the Socialist Left ( SV ) party said the policy would lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions both in Norway and abroad .
“ The agreement gives Norway a far - sighted climate policy that can stand independently of shifting governments , ” Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said in the statement .
MOON LANDING
Stoltenberg , who heads the Labour Party , has said Norway ’s policy on cutting CO2 emissions is the world ’s most ambitious and he has likened the challenge of fighting climate change to a “ moon landing ” for the 21st century .
Norway , with a population of just 4.7 million , is the world ’s fifth - biggest exporter of oil and Western Europe ’s biggest exporter of natural gas .
Endowed with rivers and waterfalls , it gets almost all its own electricity from non-polluting hydroelectric stations .
But the Nordic country aims to begin burning natural gas for power generation in the future to satisfy growing demand .
The government wants emissions from such power plants to be captured and buried , a technology still under development .
“ The agreement implies technologies that are not known yet , ” Stoltenberg told a news conference .
The government said it would spend an extra 70 million crowns ( $ 12.91 million ) this year on research into renewable energy and carbon capture and storage this year , and funding for such research would rise to at least 600 million in 2010 .
The least popular American president in recent history appeared on Fox News Sunday a couple of days ago .
Polls suggest that Americans have grown weary of George W. Bush and annoyed with many of his key policies .
They , and much of the world , can't wait to see him retire .
But what Americans still admire , it seems , is the philosophical outlook by which Bush identifies himself .
He came to power promising to create a legacy of conservatism .
After seven ruinous years , the word " conservative " remains in vogue .
When a Fox interviewer asked the president about the likely Republican nominee in the 2008 campaign , Bush praised John McCain as a " true conservative . "
He added " that if John is the nominee , he has got some convincing to do to convince people that he is a solid conservative . "
I 'm intrigued by the power of that word .
What kind of rhetorical magic allows it to survive the ineptitude , the callousness , the countless failures of the Bush administration – and to remain a shining standard by which Republicans are judged ?
To lay my cards on the table , I fervently hope that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are " true liberals . "
But whichever of them wins the Democratic nomination , that person will need to convince large numbers of Americans that he or she is not , in fact , " a solid liberal . "
On McCain 's website , a section headlined " Why John McCain " begins by announcing : " John McCain is an experienced conservative leader in the tradition of Abraham Lincoln , Theodore Roosevelt , and Ronald Reagan .
He is a common sense conservative ... "
By highlighting the phrase " common sense , " and by allying himself with Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt , McCain is signalling a sharp break with the neo-cons who infested the White House under Bush .
That 's a political point .
The larger cultural point is that conservatism remains a quality every Republican candidate for president strives to demonstrate .
The word itself is unassailable .
By contrast , Clinton and Obama would run a mile from the term " liberal . "
Clinton did exactly that on a CNN debate last July .
Asked if she 's a liberal , she replied :
" It is a word that originally meant that you were for freedom ... willing to stand against big power and on behalf of the individual .
Unfortunately , in the last 30 , 40 years , it has been turned upon its head and it has been made to seem as though it is a word that describes big government , totally contrary to what its meaning was in the 19th and early 20th century . "
Clinton preferred to label herself a " modern progressive " – the word " progressive , " she noted , " has a real American meaning . "
In truth , it has no clear meaning ; but what matters to Clinton and Obama alike is that it can't be hurled as a rhetorical insult .
" Liberal " can .
In the dim swamps of talk radio and loony - tune blogs , people rant about the " L word " as if it were on a par with the N word .
Powerful lobbies in the United States have made " liberal " a quasi-insult .
Why , I 'd like to know , does nobody complain about the C word ?
Perhaps it 's because liberals – who include , by American standards , the vast majority of Canadians – are nicer than conservatives .
More likely , it 's because " conservative " enfolds the term " conserve . "
And it 's part of liberal values , as I understand them , to conserve the natural world and hold onto the best of the past .
What liberal values never entail is the kind of reckless stupidity that involves launching pre-emptive wars , wrecking the environment and saddling the public with enormous debt .
Leave that to conservatives .

After a year on the market , Vista has had fewer security vulnerabilities discovered than XP did in its first year .
According to a post on the Windows Vista Security blog , Vista has had 36 fixed and 30 unfixed security vulnerabilities , compared to 68 fixed and 54 unfixed vulnerabilities in XP .
Patches have been issued on 9 occasions so far with Vista , compared to 26 for XP .
The number of vulnerabilities is not the only thing that Microsoft is boasting about .
Not only have there been fewer flaws , but those flaws have — according to Microsoft 's own categorization — been less severe than those XP suffered .
This is because of Vista 's " defense - in - depth " approach to security .
Two features in particular are credited with the improvement ; IE Protected Mode , and User Access Control .
Together , these mean that even when malicious code runs , it can't do the damage that it would do on XP .
13 vulnerabilities had their impact assessment lowered by this extra protection : 12 by UAC , one by protected mode .
This apparent success might redress some of the criticisms that have been leveled at UAC .
During Vista 's beta period , it was widely derided as annoying and intrusive , and although it was streamlined a little for release ( and will see further refinements in Service Pack 1 ) , it is still felt by many to be sufficiently irritating to disable .
Its ability to mitigate security vulnerabilities , however , means that it 's worth paying the price of annoyance .
UAC does n't make the security flaws disappear , but it does make them much safer .
In the words of Austin Wilson , director of Windows Client Security Product Management and author of the blog post , " This is a great illustration of the importance of User Account Control and why we included it in the product " .
So it looks like Microsoft 's commitment to security is paying off ; Vista has fewer security flaws , and those flaws it does have are often mitigated by its new features .
As Wilson wrote , " Windows Vista is proving to be the most secure version of the Windows to date . "
Nonetheless , the reception Vista has received among corporate customers remains lukewarm .
With fewer vulnerabilities and fewer patch events , Vista should be more attractive to those corporate customers .
So it is perhaps no surprise that the blog post contains a healthy dose of propaganda .
A report commissioned by Microsoft extols the TCO reductions that Vista can provide for mobile computer users — $ 251 a year in savings , if all the best practices are followed .
TCO savings are always welcome , but convincing enterprise IT departments to give up on tried and true Windows XP ( and in many cases , Windows 2000 ) has proven to be a tough task .
The " wait for SP1 " mantra has long been a core tenet of Windows administration — with its improved security and SP1 just around the corner , Microsoft will be hoping that Vista will finally get the corporate buy - in it deserves .

Deaths peaked in May when 126 American soldiers died in coalition assaults on insurgent strongholds .
The second half of the year saw violence drop dramatically with the American surge of 30,000 extra troops and a freeze on activities by some militias .
As of last night in Baghdad , 21 deaths were reported in December , one more than in February 2004 , the month with the lowest death toll .
The 899 American troop deaths in 2007 surpassed 2004 when 850 US soldiers were killed .
The US military deaths are dwarfed by Iraqi civilian casualties , although the fluctuations show the same pattern .
It is difficult to obtain accurate figures on civilian casualties but the Associated Press said Iraqi civilian deaths peaked in May with 2,155 killed , falling to 718 in November and 710 in December .
Over the year , 18,610 Iraqis were killed .
In 2006 , the only other full year an AP count has been made , 13,813 civilians were killed .
The civilian toll was compiled by AP from hospital , police and military officials , as well as accounts from reporters and photographers .
Insurgent deaths were not included .
Other counts differ and some are much higher .
The US military commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , yesterday used the more recent statistics to give an upbeat assessment of the security situation in Iraq .
Overall violence across the country was down roughly 60 % since June , he said , and the favourable security situation would allow some US troops to return home during the coming year as responsibilities were handed over to the Iraqi army .
Petraeus also drew attention to the significance of Sunni tribal leaders transferring allegiance to the Iraqi government .
In the western province of Anbar , and in Baghdad , coalition of Iraqis known as Awakening Councils or Concerned Local Citizens groups that receive US money and expertise have been joined by Sunni Arabs previously opposed to the invasion .
Their coalition in Anbar province , a Sunni stronghold , now numbers 70,000 fighters .
These Sunnis are threatened by Osama bin Laden in a video released on Saturday that is the fifth message attributed to him in 2007 .
Bin Laden warned Sunni Arabs who had joined the US initiatives that they had " betrayed the nation and brought disgrace and shame to their people .
They will suffer in life and the afterlife . "
Along with the increase in American troops , Iraq 's lessening violence has been attributed to a freeze on activities by the Mahdi Army , the militia of radical Shia cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
British military casualties were also higher in 2007 than 2006 .
According to Ministry of Defence statistics released at the end of November , 46 soldiers had died in 2007 compared with 29 the year before .
Like America , the first half of the year was worse for British forces than the second half .
Of the 46 deaths in total for 2007 , 29 were in the first six months of the year as opposed to 17 in the second half .
Unlike the American figures , UK military deaths in 2004 were the lowest since the beginning of British operations in Iraq , known as Operation Telic , in March 2003 .
In total , 174 British personnel have died in Operation Telic .
The Constitution of the United States of America ... that unique document that has stood this country so well , and has set " standards " for the world to emulate , for more than 200 years ... is n't good enough for Mike Huckabee .
Perhaps Huckabee should be running for president on a small " padded " island somewhere in the middle of the North Atlantic where he can do no harm to our Constitution , the American people , himself and others .
If Mike Huckabee wins the Republican nomination it 's because his god , is watching out for fools like him who tread where the sane would n't dast to go .
Other than being certifiable , the only logical explanation for Huckabee 's irrational proposal to change the Constitution must have resulted from him having been swept away in the tidal euphoria of crazed end - of - days - rapturing Christian zealots in South Carolina .
While caught up in the crashing waves of fervent religious zealotry , Huckabee forgot that Earth - bound microphones were open for the entire country -- most of which has their feet planted firmly on middle - of - the - road , moderate terra firma -- to hear his insane ramblings about changing the Constitution so it is in conformity with god 's standards .
Quote Huckabee : " I have opponents in this race who do not want to change the Constitution .
But I believe it 's a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god .
And that 's what we need to do -- to amend the Constitution so it's in God 's standards rather than try to change God 's standards so it lines up with some contemporary view . "
That contemporary view Huckabee is referring to IS THE CONSTITUTION .
I 've asked this before , and I 'm sure I will ask it again : Which god ?
There are so many current ones that are worshiped all over the Earth , and that does n't count all the old ones who reigned supreme , the secret ones , the new one that will pop up tomorrow , or the ones who are worshipped in other galaxies in the universe .
The Christian god ?
The Muslim god ?
The Jewish god with the unpronounceable name , because his name is not to be spoken ?
Flora ?
Loki ?
Odin ?
Thor ?
Minerva ?
Zeus ?
Hera ?
Luna ?
Isis ?
Osiris ?
Quetzalcoatl ?
Poseidon might be most appropriate , because rumor has it that we all sprang from the primordial ooze at the bottom of the sea in and around the volcanic smokers .
Neat place to come from .
It 's gorgeous down there .
Fascinating tube worms that look more like gorgeous flowers than something you 'd bait a hook with , or slitherings things that plow up the earth to make planting easier .
It 's full of an infinite number of creatures living in harmony when they are n't eating each other for dinner .
Maybe Pandora , because whenever god is invoked all kinds of trouble springs up .
How about Niobe ?
We all come into the world crying .
The list goes on forever .
So , Mr. Huckabee , in which god 's image will you standardize the Constitution of the United States of America ... that single unique document that has made the United States of America the greatest country on this puny , insignificant planet ...
The greatest country in the world that is , until men the likes of you came along .
No .
237 , 16 - Nov-07 --
Child mortality in Iraq has spiralled because of the tense security situation , deteriorating health services and lack of medical supplies , say experts .
According to a report released in May 2007 by aid agency Save the Children , “ Iraq ’s child mortality rate has increased by a staggering 150 per cent since 1990 , more than any other country . ”
The report , entitled State of the World ’s Mothers 2007 , said that some 122,000 Iraqi children - the equivalent of one in eight - died in 2005 , before reaching their fifth birthday .
More than half of the deaths were among newborn babies in their first month of life .
“ Even before the latest war , Iraqi mothers and children were facing a grave humanitarian crisis caused by years of repression , conflict and external sanctions , ” said the report .
“ Since 2003 , electricity shortages , insufficient clean water , deteriorating health services and soaring inflation have worsened already difficult living conditions . ”
The study listed pneumonia and diarrhoea as major killers of children in Iraq , together accounting for over 30 per cent of child deaths .
“ Conservative estimates place increases in infant mortality following the 2003 invasion of Iraq at 37 per cent , ” it said .
In the capital of Baghdad , there are four paediatric hospitals and three gynaecological hospitals , as well as individual children ’s wards in other medical institutions .
The city ’s central paediatric hospital is in the capital ’s Islam neighbourhood - a volatile area which is hard for families and medical staff to reach .
The hospitals fall short in providing quality care because they do not have enough medical supplies or staff - who , in many cases , have fled to other countries .
Experts draw parallels between the dire state of Iraq ’s health care system today and the way it was when the country was under sanctions during the 1990s , when there was a similar limited supply of drugs and other medical resources .
The UN Security Council imposed economic sanctions against Iraq in 1990 , following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and these continued until 2003 .
In 2000 , the UN children ’s agency UNICEF published a survey which showed the mortality rate among Iraqi children under five had more than doubled in the government - controlled south and centre of Iraq during the sanctions .
At the time , Anupama Rao Singh , a senior UNICEF official , said in an interview with Reuters that around half a million children under the age of five had died in Iraq since the international embargo was imposed .
“ In absolute terms , we estimate that perhaps about half a million children under five years of age have died , who ordinarily would not have died had the decline in mortality that was prevalent over the 70s and the 80s continued through the 90s , ” she said .
Mohammed Zahraw , a paediatrician with the ministry of health ’s inspector - general ’s office , said that similar threats to children ’s health exist today – and that these are compounded by the lack of security which now prevails in Iraq .
" In the past [ infant deaths ] were caused by the economic sanctions and the lack of medicine and medical supplies .
The same problem exists now , in addition to the deteriorating security situation .
This is particularly true in Baghdad , where it ’s difficult to access hospitals , " he said .
Fahima Salman , the head of the inspector - general ’s monitoring force , said the primary reason for high infant mortality in Iraq is a lack of drugs and medical supplies .
The inspector - general ’s office at the health ministry is tasked with inspecting hospitals and reports back to the ministry on the sanitation , performances and needs of health facilities .
Salman said that poor security and a lack of transport meant that it was hard to transfer drugs and supplies to hospitals and clinics .
This means that families of patients usually buy basic medicine , such as antibiotics and hydrocortisone , on the black market and bring the medicine to the hospital or clinic .
" We , as the inspector general 's office , visit health facilities to determine the level of shortages and note the difficulties , ” said Salman .
“ We try to provide what we can … but we still face major challenges . "
Sometimes , drug deliveries fail to reach the ministry of health ’s warehouses , and go missing en route .
Amal Abdul - Amir , a paediatrician at the Yarmook Teaching Hospital in Baghdad ’s Karkh area , said that infants were also dying because paediatricians and gynaecologists had fled the country in droves , resulting in a lack of skilled staff .
“ People are turning to midwives who do not necessarily have experience with births or emergency cases , ” she explained .
“ This is causing the number of infant mortalities to rise . "
In hospitals throughout the country , it is not uncommon to hear the wails of grieving mothers , such as 30 - year - old Zaineb Mohammed , whose two - month - old baby died after she failed to get him to hospital in time .
She told IWPR that en route to the hospital in the impoverished Baghdad suburb of Sadr City , her family was repeatedly stopped at roadblocks and checkpoints erected to combat security problems there .
The delays caused the child ’s condition to worsen and when they finally arrived there were n’t paediatric specialists to treat her .
Mohammed has vowed not to have another child .
" I do n’t think that I can bear to lose another baby to the poor health and public services in Iraq , " she said .

Before the invasion of Iraq , while millions demonstrated in the streets , often waving homemade placards with " No Blood for Oil " -- or equivalents like " Do n't Trade Lives for Oil " and like " How Did USA 's Oil Get under Iraq 's Sand ? " -- the Bush administration said remarkably little about the vast quantities of petroleum on which Saddam Hussein 's regime was perched .
The President did , however , speak reverently about preserving not Iraq 's " energy reserves " but its " patrimony , " as he so euphemistically put it .
The American mainstream media followed suit , dismissing arguments about the significance of Iraqi and Middle Eastern oil as the refuge of , if not scoundrels , then at least truly simpleminded dissidents who knew not whereof they spoke .
Generally , in our news pages and on the TV news , with Iraq at the edge of a shock - and - awe invasion , Iraqi energy reserves were dealt with as if no more than a passing thought , as if the Middle East 's main export was hummus .
Little has changed .
When former Fed chief Alan Greenspan recently indicated in passing in his memoir that the war was " about oil , " there was a brief firestorm of scorn in Washington ; an administration spokesperson termed it " Georgetown cocktail party analysis " ( " A refill of crude , please , straight up " ) and Greenspan quickly began to backtrack under the pressure .
Oil ?
Who us ?
The Bush administration 's plans to protect the Oil Ministry in Baghdad and Iraq 's major oil fields amid otherwise unchecked chaos in April 2003 were certainly noted in the news , but went largely uncommented upon ( unless you were an Internet news jockey ) .
Here 's the strange thing about the Iraq oil " debate " in our media world .
Call me crazy , but if you were going to invade Iraq and oil was n't right at the forefront of your brain , you would be truly derelict , even if you had n't run a major energy services corporation or had n't had a double - hulled oil tanker named after you .
Jack Miles , author of the Pulitzer - Prize - winning book God : A Biography and the first writer to consider Iraqi casualties at Tomdispatch ( or probably much of anywhere else ) back in July 2003 , now takes up the oil endgame -- of which , except in the Web world , there has largely been neither a beginning game .
nor a middle game .
Tom
By December 31 , 2008 , according to Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari , the government of Iraq intends to have replaced the existing mandate for a multinational security force with a conventional bilateral security agreement with the United States , an agreement of the sort that Washington has with Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , and several other countries in the Middle East .
The Security Council has always paired the annual renewal of its mandate for the multinational force with the renewal of a second mandate for the management of Iraqi oil revenues .
This happens through the " Development Fund for Iraq , " a kind of escrow account set up by the occupying powers after the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime and recognized in 2003 by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 .
The oil game will be up if and when Iraq announces that this mandate , too , will be terminated at a date certain in favor of resource - development agreements that -- like the envisioned security agreement -- match those of other states in the region .
The oil game in Iraq may be almost up .
On September 29th , like a landlord serving notice , the government of Iraq announced that the next annual renewal of the United Nations Security Council mandate for a multinational force in Iraq -- the only legal basis for a continuation of the American occupation -- will be the last .
That was , it seems , the first shoe to fall .
The second may be an announcement terminating the little - noticed , but crucial companion Security Council mandate governing the disposition of Iraq 's oil revenues .
" Iraq 's neighbors Iran , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia .
have outlawed foreign control over oil development .
They all hire international oil companies as contractors to provide specific services as needed , for a limited duration , and without giving the foreign company any direct interest in the oil produced . "
By contrast , the oil legislation now pending in the Iraqi parliament awards foreign oil companies coveted , long - term , 20 - 35 year contracts of just the sort that neighboring oil - producers have rejected for decades .
It also places the Iraqi oil industry under the control of an appointed body that would include representatives of international oil companies as full voting members .
The news that the duly elected government of Iraq is exercising its limited sovereignty to set a date for termination of the American occupation radically undercuts all discussion in Congress or by American presidential candidates of how soon the U.S. occupation of Iraq may " safely " end .
Yet if , by the same route , Iraq were to resume full and independent control over the world 's third - largest proven oil reserves -- 200 to 300 million barrels of light crude worth as much as $ 30 trillion at today 's prices -- a politically incorrect question might break rudely out of the Internet universe and into the mainstream media world , into , that is , the open :
Has the Iraq war been an oil war from the outset ?
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan evidently thought so or so he indicated in a single sentence in his recent memoir : " I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . "
When asked , Gen. John Abizaid , former CENTCOM commander who oversaw three and a half years of the American occupation of Iraq , agreed .
" Of course it 's about oil , we can't really deny that , " he said during a roundtable discussion at Stanford University .
These confessions validated the suspicions of foreign observers too numerous to count .
Veteran security analyst Thomas Powers observed in the New York Review of Books recently :
" What it was only feared the Russians might do [ by invading Afghanistan in the 1980s ] the Americans have actually done -- they have planted themselves squarely astride the world 's largest pool of oil , in a position potentially to control its movement and to coerce all the governments who depend on that oil .
Americans naturally do not suspect their own motives but others do .
The reaction of the Russians , the Germans , and the French in the months leading up to the war suggests that none of them wished to give Americans the power which [ former National Security Adviser Zbigniew ] Brzezinski had feared was the goal of the Soviets . "
Apologists for the war point out lamely that the United States imports only a small fraction of its oil from Iraq , but what matters , rather obviously , is not Iraq 's current exports but its reserves .
Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , media mogul Rupert Murdoch said , " The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy , if you could put it that way , would be $ 20 a barrel for oil . "
In the twenty - first century 's version of the " Great Game " of nineteenth century imperialism , the Bush administration made a colossal gamble that Iraq could become a kind of West Germany or South Korea on the Persian Gulf -- a federal republic with a robust , oil - exporting economy , a rising standard of living , and a set of U.S. bases that would guarantee lasting American domination of the most resource - strategic region on the planet .
The political half of that gamble has already been lost , but the Bush administration has proven adamantly unwilling to accept the loss of the economic half , the oil half , without a desperate fight .
Perhaps the five super - bases that the U.S. has been constructing in Iraq for as many as 20,000 troops each , plus the ill - built super - embassy ( the largest on the planet ) it has been constructing inside the Green Zone , will suffice to maintain American control over the oil reserves , even in defiance of international law and the officially stated wishes of the Iraqi people -- but perhaps not .
Blackwater and the Sovereignty Showdown
In any case , a kind of slow - motion showdown may lie not so far ahead ; and , during the past weeks , we may have been given a clue as to how it could unfold .
Recall that after the gunning down of at least 17 Iraqis in a Baghdad square , Prime Minister al - Maliki demanded that the State Department dismiss and punish the trigger - happy private security firm , Blackwater USA , which was responsible for the safety of American diplomatic personnel in Iraq .
He further demanded that the immunity former occupation head L. Paul Bremer III had granted , in 2004 , to all such private security firms be revoked .
Startled , the Bush administration briefly grounded its diplomatic operations , then defiantly resumed them -- with security still provided by Blackwater .
Within days , though , Bush found himself face - to - face in New York with al - Maliki for discussions whose topic National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley revealingly named as " Iraqi sovereignty . "
Who would blink first ?
We 're still waiting to see , but in the wake of an Iraqi investigation ended with a demand for $ 8 million compensation for each of the 17 murdered Baghdadis , Blackwater is reportedly " on its way out " of security responsibility in Iraq , probably by the six - month deadline that al - Maliki has demanded .
Despite its disgrace , the well - connected private security company continues to win lucrative State Department security contracts .
Blackwater expert Jeremy Scahill told Bill Moyers that losing the Iraq gig would only slightly affect Blackwater 's bottom line , but could grievously inconvenience U.S. diplomatic operations in Iraq .
In forcing such a crisis on the State Department , the al - Maliki government , whose powerlessness has been an assumption unchallenged from left or right ( in or out of Iraq ) , suddenly looks a good deal stronger .
But oil matters more to Washington than Blackwater does .
In September , when the effort to enact U.S. - favored oil legislation -- a much - announced " benchmark " of both the White House and Congress -- collapsed in Iraq 's legislature , the coup de grace seemed to be delivered by a wildcat agreement between the Kurdistan Regional Government and Hunt Oil of Dallas , Texas , headed by Ray L. Hunt , a longtime Bush ally and a member of the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board .
This agreement , undertaken against the stated wishes of the central government , provides for the separate development of Kurdistan 's oil resources and puts the Kurds in blatant , preemptive violation of the pending legislation .
It makes , in fact , such a mockery of that legislation that the prospect of its passage before the Development Fund mandate expires is now vanishingly small .
Endgame for Iraqi Oil ?
If the mandate expires and the law is not passed , then what ?
Then others in Iraq may well seek to follow the Kurdish example and cut comparable deals with whomever they wish .
The central government , even if it has lost effective control of the Kurdish north and the Sunni west , could well ratify resource - separatism by contracting for the development of the oil resources in the territory generally remaining under its control .
Thus , a new , Iran- allied , oil - rich , nine - province Shiite Iraq could match Kurdistan 's deal with one of its own , perhaps even with ready - and - willing China .
Will any combination of American military and diplomatic pressure suffice to stop such an untoward outcome ?
Clearly , some in Washington still think so .
Shortly before the collapse of the Iraqi oil legislation effort , Bush 's Commerce Department began quietly advertising for an Arabic - speaking legal advisor to help it in " providing technical assistance to Iraq to create a legal and tax environment conducive to domestic and foreign investment in Iraq 's key economic sectors , starting with the mineral resources sector . "
( Read : starting with oil . )
As it happens , the job description overlaps heavily with that of the Development Fund for Iraq 's existing International Advisory and Monitoring Board , whose responsibility , according to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 , has been to see to it " that all export sales of petroleum , petroleum products , and natural gas from Iraq .
shall be made consistent with prevailing international marketing best practices . "
Is the Commerce Department already planning for the demise of this board ?
Like the super - embassy and the super - bases , this bit of Commerce Department staffing - up bespeaks the urge to continue an invasive American presence in Iraq , including Iraq 's energy sector , long after December 31 , 2008 .
But if the occupation is shut down legally after that date and if Iraqi control over Iraqi oil reverts -- legally , at least -- to something close to pre-war status , that Commerce Department expert may find him or herself playing a less - than - major role in Baghdad .
Instead , expect a new role for Iraq 's hitherto excluded pool of domestic expertise .
The Iraq National Oil Company began operations back in 1961 ; its legacy includes a skilled work force of trained oil workers .
Notable , in fact , among those opposed to the failed oil legislation is the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions .
Its members object to provisions in the legislation that permit the hiring of foreign oil workers rather than Iraqis and -- in classic Bush Administration fashion -- exclude the union from any participation in contract negotiations .
The Federation 's protests have attracted a letter of support signed by six Nobel Peace Prize laureates .
Even with Iraqi expertise duly factored in , oil remains a complicated business , and foreign expertise and capital will remain indispensable in Iraq .
Still , for the Shiite - dominated central government , the most trusted foreign supplier of supplementary expertise , manpower , and even capital would seem to be Iran .
For now , the United States is paying many of the salaries in Baghdad ; but Iran 's president , predicting an American withdrawal , has lately declared his readiness to " fill the [ regional power ] gap , with the help of neighbors and regional friends like Saudi Arabia , and with the help of the Iraqi nation . "
This invitation to regional collaboration will surely strike the less populous , militarily more vulnerable Saudis as disingenuous in the extreme , but Iran may be hard to stop .
As former ambassador Peter Galbraith has explained : " Since 2005 , Iraq 's Shiite - led government has concluded numerous economic , political , and military agreements with Iran .
The most important would link the two countries ' strategic oil reserves by building a pipeline from southern Iraq to Iran , while another commits Iran to providing extensive military assistance to the Iraq government . "
On Oct. 17 , the al - Maliki regime flexed its supposedly non-existent muscle yet again by awarding $ 1.1 billion in contracts to Iran and China to build enormous power plants in Baghdad 's Shiite Sadr City and between the two Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala .
The prospect that , in the endgame for Iraqi oil , the victor might be Shiite Iran ( and indirectly Communist China ) may help explain recent American calls for the replacement of the devoutly Shiite Prime Minister al - Maliki .
Yet , even if American pressure leads to al - Maliki 's ouster , the Iraqi parliament cannot be ousted with him .
The prime minister 's announcement that the next renewal of the multi- force mandate would be the last came , in fact , in response to a binding resolution in parliament that the next renewal , unlike previous ones , may not be at the request of the prime minister alone , but only with the advice and consent of parliament .
It has voted once already , in a non-binding resolution , to require the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal .
Fragile as it is , the government of Iraq enjoys international legal recognition , and the underestimated al - Maliki is evidently not without resources when it comes to asserting Iraqi sovereignty over American autonomy within Iraq 's borders .
In " Blackwatergate , " he found a remarkable pressure point , declaring that no new law would be passed in Iraq until the Blackwater matter was resolved to his satisfaction .
Nor was al - Maliki necessarily whistling in the dark when he warned his American critics , " We can find friends elsewhere . "
The expiration date that Iraq has now set for the operation of a multinational force on its territory coincides almost exactly with the end of the Bush administration .
As that date nears , the endgame question may become :
How far can the administration go in repudiating its own erstwhile agenda and returning Iraq to its pre-war status -- that is , to U.S. - backed Sunni domination of Iraqi domestic politics .
That would , of course , result in armed Iraqi hostility to the administration 's enemy of enemies in the region , Iran , and a resigned return to collaboration with the Saudi - dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) in the management of the world oil market , all under a largely offshore U.S. military umbrella .
Will the fallback dream now be the one the President 's father entertained after Gulf War I -- the creation in Baghdad of a kinder , gentler Saddam Hussein with whom , to use the classic phrase , the U.S. can " do business " ?
Time will tell , but not too much time .
The eerie silence of the Bush administration about oil grows all the more deafening as the price of crude climbs toward $ 100 a barrel .
Blood for oil may never have been a good deal , but so much blood for no oil at all may seem a far worse one .
