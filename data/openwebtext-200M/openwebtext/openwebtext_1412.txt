The Business Management Europe Group today posted this break down of what are arguably the two biggest pieces of media ever released .
The chart breaks down the money comparison , along with a variety of other fun factoids .
Check it out , and what are some thoughts , did they earn their keep ?
Last week I was at party held by my wife ’s coworker .
The coworker ’s husband is a friend of mine who I usually see at these types of events .
He runs a hedge fund and is always worth an hour of interesting conversation .
Among the wide variety of topics we discussed was why he “ hates tech ” and why he thinks the lack of an IPO market is the tech industry ’s own fault .
We ’ll call him John .
I should be clear – John does n’t hate technology .
He has tons of it .
He does n’t hate the people in technology .
What he hates is the governance he ’s observed as a public company investor that he views as commonplace among tech companies .
His specific gripe ?
Tech companies never pay out their earnings as dividends .
His view is that there is no way to be a truly long - term investor in tech companies because management never allows companies to transition from growth companies to mature , income - oriented ones .
The only way to win is to get in and trade out when you think the cycle is peaking .
I ’m not sure John is wrong .
The nature of technology is such that for most ( not all ) companies there is a period of extraordinary value creation followed by a period where the market moves on , at least partially .
The rational thing to do at that point is to alter the strategic objectives of the company from rapid growth to efficiency and profit - maximization , but this almost never happens in tech .
To use John ’s examples , look at Wang , Yahoo and Palm .
Each had an extraordinary story at one point and generated significant cash flow .
And each in turn reinvested that cash flow into unprofitable businesses rather than pay it out to investors .
Why did they do this ?
You can take it from one of several directions .
The canonical argument is that tech companies always need to be reinvesting , that if they pay cash out they will be left behind .
And yet … these companies got left behind anyway .
Would n’t their investors ( in whose interest management supposedly runs the company ) be better off with dividends than the outcomes they ’ve received in these companies ?
The alternative argument is that management would rather empire - build than reward shareholders .
Perhaps the best example is Microsoft .
Microsoft is a mature tech company and has been operating for about 30 years .
It is profitable ( $ 4.5B in operating profit in the most recently - reported quarter ) .
It has been profitable for years .
Yet Microsoft , as of today , pays just 1.8 % dividend yield and holds $ 52B in current assets .
Why does a business with relatively low CapEx have so much cash ?
Because it can .
And what are they doing with that cash ?
Mostly they are ( in my view ) “ investing ” it in an unprofitable attempt to be an internet company , which they are n’t and never have been .
They are buying share for Bing but it ’s negative - NPV growth .
I would argue that Microsoft is the perfect example here because it utterly dominated the best businesses to be in from 1980 to 2000 – desktop software and operating systems .
For that 20 - year period Microsoft was the most profitable company in technology .
Now , however , these businesses are flat or in decline .
If I ’m an investor , do I want Microsoft spending all those retained earnings trying to beat Google or Apple in areas where Microsoft has no advantage ?
No .
I want those retained earnings paid to me , and if I want exposure to the web I ’ll go buy Google or Apple stock ( or any other company who I think is poised to dominate an important area ) .
This is a classic agency problem .
It is extremely unappealing to Microsoft ’s management to acknowledge that the company ’s dominance is waning and that the shareholder - maximizing course of action is to run the company efficiently , decrease investment in the web and run a desktop software business as profitably as it can for as long as it can while paying out as much cash to shareholders as possible .
How much fun would that be ?
“ Killing Google ” is much more fun .
Except it does n’t really work .
Ultimately , I had a hard time disagreeing with John that tech companies fundamentally break the implicit agreement with their shareholders .
I ’m not at all sure I agree that this is the reason for the weak IPO market ( in fact I think it ’s a small component at best ) but his points were thought - provoking .
Tech companies almost never acknowledge that they are dividend stories even though it ’s frequently appropriate .

January 31 , 2010 -- Climate and Capitalism --
For more than two centuries , the idea that the world ’s ills are caused by poor people having too many babies has been remarkably successful at diverting attention from the complex social causes of poverty and injustice .
Forty years ago , Paul Ehrlich ’s bestseller The Population Bomb applied the idea to environmental problems :
The causal chain of deterioration is easily followed to its source .
Too many cars , too many factories , too much detergent , too much pesticide , multiplying contrails .
Inadequate sewage treatment plants , too little water , too much carbon dioxide – all can be traced easily to too many people . [ 1 ]
Ehrlich ’s book convinced many environmentalists , and led to the formation of a variety of groups that focused solely on the supposed evils of overpopulation .
Today , as women ’s rights activist Betsy Hartmann warns in a recent article , populationist arguments are back – but now groups such as the US - based Population Connection ( formerly Zero Population Growth ) and the UK ’s Optimum Population Trust have added a “ faux feminist twist ” to their attacks on the reproductive rights of Third World women .
Along with the bad news that women ’s fertility is destroying the planet comes the good news that family planning is the solution .
In other words , you do n’t have to feel guilty about blaming poor women for the world ’s problems because you can help them improve their lives by having fewer babies . [ 2 ]
What ’s worse , she writes , these arguments are n’t just being promoted by the population zealots in ZPG and OPT :
In fact , perhaps what is most distressing about the current population control resurgence is how many liberal feminists and progressive media outlets are jumping on board .
There ’s even an attempt by the Sierra Club and others to bring reproductive justice activists into the fold in the name of ‘ Population Justice . ’
The assumption is that we live in a win - win world where there ’s no fundamental contradiction between placing disproportionate blame for the world ’s problems on poor women ’s fertility and advocating for reproductive rights and health .
That prompted an outraged reply from Laurie Mazur , the founder of Population Justice and editor of A Pivotal Moment : Population , Justice and the Environmental Challenge .
Betsy Hartmann implies that everyone working on population - environment issues is part of a misogynistic plot to bring back ‘ population control . ’
I ’m here to tell you she is wrong .
I am a lifelong , card - carrying feminist and political progressive .
I am passionately committed to sexual and reproductive health and rights , to environmental sustainability , and to closing the inequitable divide between men and women , rich and poor .
And I believe that slowing population growth — by ensuring that all people have the means and the power to make their own decisions about childbearing — will contribute to those ends . [ 3 ]
Mazur is undoubtedly sincere , but in my opinion Hartmann ’s criticisms and concern are fully justified .
In this article I focus on some specific problems with the “ Population Justice ” concept that Mazur defends .
I wo n’t repeat the broader criticisms of the population growth explanation for climate change that I and others have made elsewhere . [ 4 ]
A new conversation ?
Mazur presents herself as the voice of reason in the “ polarised debate ” between population extremists like Paul Ehrlich on one side , and people like Betsy Hartmann , whom she labels “ population deniers ” , on the other .
Mazur calls for a “ a new conversation about population and the environment ” , with a goal of “ slowing population growth ” but doing so without coercion , respecting women ’s need for reproductive health services and right to make their own choices .
But that ’s not a new conversation .
For two decades , even the most reactionary population control outfits have given lip service to women ’s rights and voluntary birth control – but they still blame poor women ’s fertility for environmental problems , and call for reducing the birth rate in the Third World as the sine qua non of any solution .
The anti-immigrant Optimum Population Trust , for example , says that it favours “ non-coercive policies to limit and stabilise population growth ” and talks of “ empowering women to control their own fertility ” .
In language similar to Mazur ’s , OPT says , “ All environmental problems , and notably those arising from climate change , would be easier to solve with a smaller future population . ” [ 5 ]
The similarities are n’t coincidental .
In the early 1990s , liberal feminists associated with the US Clinton administration blocked with population control advocates to outvote the Vatican at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development .
Defeating the religious right was important , but in the process the population controllers learned to hide their views behind feminist vocabulary – and some liberal feminists adopted the “ too many babies ” ideology .
Mazur ’s approach reflects the views of the latter group .
Non-coercive population reduction ?
Mazur tries to distance herself from hardcore populationism by rejecting “ coercive population control ” .
Coercion not only violates women ’s rights , she writes , it is n’t necessary .
“ We now know that the best way to slow population growth is not with top - down ‘ population control , ’ but by ensuring that all people are able to make real choices about sexuality and reproduction . ”
Of course it ’s vitally important that women everywhere have the right and power to make real choices , but is a focus on slowing population growth the way to accomplish that ?
Have n’t decades of experience shown that women ’s right to choose is undermined when reproductive health programs are driven by environmental and population concerns ?
The line between coercive and non-coercive birth control programs is not easily drawn : programs motivated by overpopulation arguments tend to promote population reduction , regardless of the actual needs of the communities and individuals involved .
That ’s especially true in the impoverished countries that population programs usually target , where poor women have long been deprived to the power to make choices about many aspects of their lives .
Project staff who believe they are protecting the environment frequently pressure women to accept sterilisation or unsafe long - term contraceptives .
Supposedly voluntary programs have included coercive elements such as denying women access to other services if they do n’t attend lectures on the importance of having fewer babies , or dividing people into teams that compete for maximum participation in family planning services . [ 6 ]
It ’s noteworthy that the Optimum Population Trust , despite its proclaimed belief in voluntary programs , also calls for “ national tax and benefits systems to provide incentives to parents to have one or two children only ” .
For the poor , being denied such benefits could very well be a form of coercion .
A particularly brutal case of hidden coercion occurred in Peru in the late 1990s , when a supposedly voluntary family planning program led to the involuntary sterilisation of more than 200,000 Indigenous women , while the country ’s president was sanctimoniously declaring his government ’s support for gender equality and reproductive rights at international women ’s conferences .
An essay included in Mazur ’s own book concludes that this horrendous campaign was a direct result of the program ’s focus on reducing Peru ’s birthrate .
The first lesson of that experience , the authors write , is that “ human rights abuses are likely where reproductive health services are seen as a means to an end , rather than as an end in themselves ” . [ 7 ]
That ’s an important lesson for anyone who considers promoting family planning as a way to reduce population and greenhouse gas emissions .
Why Third World women ?
Mazur says that she wants to reduce emissions by slowing population growth – but if that ’s so , why does her project place so much emphasis on the fertility of the poorest women in the world ?
Per capita emission rates in the United States , Canada and Australia are the highest in the world .
If more babies equals more emissions , should n’t Mazur ’s group emphasise population reduction in rich countries , where each avoided birth will have a greater effect than dozens in the global south ?
In A Pivotal Moment , Mazur poses that question herself , and gives a strange answer :
The answer lies in the future .
The developing countries are where the lion ’s share of population growth will occur , and they are also where development must occur for half of humanity to escape from grinding poverty .
The affluent countries can reduce emissions by reducing the vast amounts of waste in our systems of production and consumption .
But the developing countries are not likely to raise their standards of living without more intensive use of resources and higher emissions .
Let ’s get this straight .
Most emissions come from the developed countries , but they can clean up their act .
However , for some reason poor people trying to get out of poverty can’t use low - emission technology , so let ’s make sure there are fewer of them .
Instead of dealing with the real problems that exist in the global North today , Mazur would have us target poor women in the global South because of what they might do in the future .
This makes no sense .
Not only do Third World countries have low overall emission rates , but within those countries women are low emitters – and the poorest women produce the lowest levels of all .
They are the first and greatest victims of global warming , and they bear the least responsibility for causing it – but Mazur tells us that that their fertility is the problem we should address .
It ’s difficult to see either feminism or justice in that .
Mazur ’s approach directs attention away from the huge ecological debt that rich countries owe to the global South .
A central focus for the global climate justice movement is the demand for repayment of that debt , both in financial contributions and through massive transfer of low - emissions technology that can enable economic development without promoting climate change .
Achieving this wo n’t be easy – but populationists who start from socially conservative assumptions do n’t even consider the possibility of transforming the way the global economy works .
In Hartmann ’s words : “ Missing from the equation is any notion that people are capable of effecting positive social and environmental change , and that the next generation could make the transition out of fossil fuels . ”
The wrong way to go
For the poorest women in the world , winning unrestricted access to high - quality health services , including safe birth control and abortion , would be a huge victory .
But linking that campaign to global warming is the wrong way to go .
The name “ Population Justice ” sounds good , but the project rests on an illusion , on a self - defeating attempt to combine incompatible causes .
As the feminist scholar Asoka Bandarage wrote following the 1994 Conference on Population and Development :
As liberal feminist activists form alliances with population control advocates and depend on the latter ’s monetary and institutional support , they , too , come to accept the neo-Malthusian position which reduces ‘ women ’s rights ’ to ‘ reproductive rights , ’ which in turn are equated with ‘ population policies ’ . …
[ S ] ubsuming women ’s issues within the neo-Malthusian framework leads to a neglect of the social structural roots of women ’s subordination . [ 8 ]
The combination of population reduction and women ’s rights was already like oil and water .
Adding CO2 reductions to the mix only makes things worse , treating the fight for women ’s rights as an instrument for achieving technical goals , not as a demand for justice in its own right .
By adapting to populationist prejudices , the Population Justice project is heading down a dangerous road .
It is adding a liberal voice to the efforts of bigots and misogynists to blame Third World women for global warming , and by doing so it undermines both women ’s rights and the fight against climate change .

Officials from the migration agency said they were hoping to give people the means to create temporary housing , and the power to build where they wanted .
They acknowledged that it could be five years before most people moved back into houses , which means that under the current best - case situation , Port - au - Prince , Haiti ’s capital , will soon be blanketed with hundreds of thousands of simple structures that designers describe as “ garden sheds ” and others see as shanties .

It reflects what emergency shelter experts here describe as an emerging consensus , born in part from the aftermath of the Asian tsunami in 2004 .
There , aid groups that built concrete homes in large tracts found that few people were interested in moving from where they had lived before the disaster .
Transitional shelters were quicker to set up and allowed people to stay put while continually improving their own homes over time .
The model , cited by a senior shelter adviser , is Sri Lanka , where residents using building materials and design guidelines from aid groups built 56,000 transitional shelters in seven months , housing 92 percent of the displaced families in about a 550 - mile area .
But in Haiti , the challenge will be even greater .
There is a hard deadline : hurricane season starts on June 1 .
And compared with Sri Lanka , there are far more Haitians without homes , and in a densely packed urban area with rubble crowding nearly every street .
Mr. Turner , along with Haitian government officials , said that the shelter plan would work only if demolition and debris removal moved quickly .

In themselves , the revelations in the Foreign Office document contained little that was not already known from previous disclosures by the Central Intelligence Agency about the so - called stress techniques used by American interrogators while questioning terrorist suspects after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks in the United States .
What was starkly new , however , was the Foreign Office ’s conclusion that the treatment Mr. Mohamed endured , had it been carried out under the authority of British officials , would have breached international treaties banning torture .
It was the first time that Britain has been so blunt about its disapproval of the interrogation techniques approved by former President George W. Bush and curtailed last year by President Obama .
“ Although it is not necessary for us to categorize the treatment reported , it could readily be contended to be at the very least cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment by the United States authorities , ” the document posted on the Foreign Office Web site said .
The court order , issued by a three - judge panel , could have been further appealed by the Foreign Office .
Mr. Miliband told the Commons that the government had decided not to pursue the case because the judges had reaffirmed the so - called control principle governing intelligence - sharing relationships .
That rule , as Mr. Miliband put it , holds “ that intelligence material provided by one country to another remains confidential to the country that provided it , and that it will never be disclosed directly or indirectly by the receiving country , without the permission of the provider of the information . ”
Mr. Miliband said that he had discussed the case with Mrs. Clinton by telephone on Tuesday night , and that Britain was pledged to “ work carefully with the United States in the weeks ahead to discuss the judgment and its implications ” for future intelligence sharing .
In response to opposition questioners , he hinted at continuing American disquiet , saying that it was “ too early to come to this House and say that this will have no effect ” on American - British intelligence relationships .
The foreign secretary said that what had persuaded Britain not to mount a further appeal  and by implication , what had opened the door to American agreement that the secret information could be released  was a United States district court ruling in December in Washington , D.C. , which he said had “ made a finding of fact ” in respect to Mr. Mohamed ’s allegations of mistreatment that closely paralleled what was revealed in the Foreign Office document .
Mr. Miliband was at pains to say that the government acknowledged that Mr. Mohamed had been right to allege that he had been mistreated .
In fact , he said , “ this judgment is not evidence that the system is broken ; rather it is evidence that the system is working and the full force of the law is available when citizens believe they have just cause . ”

How bad is it ?
When Matt of Creative Minority Report tipped me to it this morning , I had to track it down to make sure it was on the level .
A woman in Campbell County , Virginia smothered her newborn infant , and police are powerless to do anything about it :
The caller said a woman in her early 20s was in labor .
When deputies arrived , they discovered the baby had actually been born around 1:00 a .m. , about ten hours earlier .
Investigators say the baby was already dead when deputies got there .
Investigators tell WSLS the baby ’s airway was still blocked .
They say the baby was under bedding and had been suffocated by her mother .
Investigators say because the mother and baby were still connected by the umbilical cord and placenta , state law does not consider the baby to be a separate life .
Therefore , the mother cannot be charged .
“ In the state of Virginia as long as the umbilical cord is attached and the placenta is still in the mother , if the baby comes out alive the mother can do whatever she wants to with that baby to kill it . “ , says Investigator Tracy Emerson .
“ She could shoot the baby , stab the baby .
As long as it ’s still attached to her in some form by umbilical cord or something it ’s no crime in the state of Virginia . “
Law enforcement officials have repeatedly attempted to get the law changed , asking state legislators to do something about the gap in protection for newborns .
Why have Virginia legislators failed to act ?
They ’re afraid of running afoul of the abortion industry :
The Campbell County Sheriff ’s Office and Commonwealth ’s Attorney ’s office worked unsuccessfully to get the law changed after another baby died in the county in a similar case .
Emerson says they asked two delegates and one state senator to take the issue up in the General Assembly .
He says the three lawmakers refused because they felt the issue was too close to the abortion issue .
Er , what ?
I ’m not aware of fourth - trimester abortions being legal anywhere in the US .
In fact , I doubt that third - trimester abortions are legal in Virginia , either .
Ironically , if the baby had been killed by someone else in an assault on the mother before its birth , that person would have been charged with murder , which sets up a really interesting double standard .
Are legislators in Virginia so afraid of the abortion industry that they ca n’t take steps to protect full - term babies after their birth ?
Sounds like Virginians need a new class of lawmakers .
Update : Caleb Howe
Tweets that one state legislator is now on the case :
State Senator Steve Newman announced today that the Division of Legislative Services has begun drafting legislation to ensure that a life cannot be legally taken after a child is born not withstanding its connection to the umbilical cord .
The bill will amend Section 18.2 of the Code of Virginia which is the criminal code .
Newman stated , “ It is difficult to believe that the current Code could have such a flaw that would allow anyone to take the life of a born child .
While I will not comment at this time on the case in Campbell County , it is abundantly clear that Virginians will demand a legislative cure to this loophole .
I have consulted with the Attorney General Elect , Ken Cuccinelli ; Campbell County Commonwealth Attorney , Neil Vener ; Campbell County Sheriff Terry Gaddy and the investigator in the case , Tracy Emerson .
All have indicated their full support for this legislation .
We should keep an eye on this to make sure it gets signed into law .
Update II : A critic says that the report from WSLS is false , and that the law does cover this situation .
But that critic does n’t live in Virginia , and does n’t explain how WSLS , the law enforcement agency , the state legislator , and the attorney general all got it wrong , too .
After all , if the law covered the situation , the legislator would n’t have needed to introduce legislation to fix it and the AG , the county ’s attorney , and the sheriff would n’t have endorsed it .
At any rate , the facts to which I linked were reported by WSLS and confirmed by all of the above , all of whom are better sources than the critic in question .
Update III : Dave from Reno sends the following , emphases added by me :
1 ) The quote from the news story that talks about the problem being the exclusion of the mother : “ Emerson tells us there ’s a double standard with the law .
If someone other than the mother harms a baby still attached to the mother , that person can be charged . ”
2 ) The statute in the Virginia code that Emerson is referring to : 18.2-32.2 .
Killing a fetus ; penalty .
A . Any person who unlawfully , willfully , deliberately , maliciously and with premeditation kills the fetus of another is guilty of a Class 2 felony .
B . Any person who unlawfully , willfully , deliberately and maliciously kills the fetus of another is guilty of a felony punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility for not less than five nor more than 40 years .
( 2004 , cc. 1023 , 1026 . )
Note that it refers to “ the fetus of another ” , the use of the word “ another ” apparently allows the mother to kill her own fetus .
3 ) The article says that they tried to change the law , but the lawmakers would n’t take it up : “ The Campbell County Sheriff ’s Office and Commonwealth ’s Attorney ’s office worked unsuccessfully to get the law changed after another baby died in the county in a similar case .
Emerson says they asked two delegates and one state senator to take the issue up in the General Assembly .
He says the three lawmakers refused because they felt the issue was too close to the abortion issue . ”
4 ) I believe I have found the proposed law .
It was HB 1631 , and was introduced in the 2007 session , but never made it to the House for a vote .
You can find the history of the bill at the link below , as well as a PDF of the bill itself , which is designed to change 18.2 - 32.2 to remove the words , “ of another ” .
Note this sentence in the summary : “ Currently the act of unlawfully killing a fetus as described in this statute is a crime only if the fetus is the fetus “ of another . ”
5 ) Finally , here is the Virginia House of Delegates legislative schedule for 2007 , where you can find HB 1631 listed as being referred to the Committee for Courts of Justice , where , per the status page , it died .
Thanks ,
Dave !
Justin Elliott of TPM Muckraker points to a new story in the New York Times about Ben Wetmore , a 28 - year - old conservative activist who let anti-ACORN provocateur James O'Keefe and his merry band crash at his New Orleans home prior to their arrest for allegedly attempting to tamper with Sen.

According to the New York Times , Wetmore was a mentor to a network of right wing provocateurs who embraced various forms of political theater to dramatize their issues on college campuses .

In the first part of a major investigation of the so - called ' climategate ' emails , one of Britain 's top science writers reveals how researchers tried to hide flaws in a key study
It is difficult to imagine a more bizarre academic dispute .
Where exactly are 42 weather monitoring stations in remote parts of rural China ?
But the argument over the weather stations , and how it affects an important set of data on global warming , has led to accusations of scientific fraud and may yet result in a significant revision of a scientific paper that is still cited by the UN 's top climate science body .
It also further calls into question the integrity of the scientist at the centre of the scandal over hacked climate emails , the director of the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) , Dr Phil Jones .
The emails suggest that he helped to cover up flaws in temperature data from China that underpinned his research on the strength of recent global warming .
The Guardian has learned that crucial data obtained by American scientists from Chinese collaborators cannot be verified because documents containing them no longer exist .
And what data is available suggests that the findings are fundamentally flawed .
Jones and his Chinese - American colleague Wei-Chyung Wang , of the University at Albany in New York , are being accused of scientific fraud by an independent British researcher over the contents of a research paper back in 1990 .
That paper , which was published in the prestigious journal Nature , claimed to answer an important question in climate change science : how much of the warming seen in recent decades is due to the local effects of spreading cities , rather than global warming ?
It is well - known that the concrete , bricks and asphalt of urban areas absorb more heat than the countryside .
They result in cities being warmer than the countryside , especially at night .
So the question is whether rising mercury is simply a result of thermometers once in the countryside gradually finding themselves in expanding urban areas .
The pair , with four fellow researchers , concluded that the urban influence was negligible .
Some of their most compelling evidence came from a study of temperature data from eastern China , a region urbanising fast even then .
The paper became a key reference source for the conclusions of succeeding reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – including a chapter in the 2007 one co-authored by Jones .
It said that globally " the urbanisation influence … is , at most , an order of magnitude less than the warming seen on a century timescale " .
In other words , it is tiny .
But many climate sceptics did not believe the claim .
They were convinced that the urban effect was much bigger , even though it might not change the overall story of global warming too much .
After all , two - thirds of the planet is covered by ocean , and the oceans are warming , too .
But when Jones turned down requests from them to reveal details about the location of the 84 Chinese weather stations used in the study , arguing that it would be " unduly burdensome " , they concluded that he was covering up the error .
And when , in 2007 , Jones finally released what location data he had , British amateur climate analyst and former City banker Doug Keenan accused Jones and Wang of fraud .
He pointed out that the data showed that 49 of the Chinese meteorological stations had no histories of their location or other details .
These mysterious stations included 40 of the 42 rural stations .
Of the rest , 18 had certainly been moved during the study period , perhaps invalidating their data .
Keenan told the Guardian : " The worst case was a station that moved five times over a distance of 41 kilometres " ; hence , for those stations , the claim made in the paper that " there were ' few if any changes ' to locations is a fabrication " .
( The full statement in the original 1990 Nature paper reads : " The stations were selected on the basis of station history : we chose those with few , if any , changes in instrumentation , location or observation times . " )
Keenan demanded that Jones retract his claims about the Chinese data .
The emails , which first emerged online in November last year following a hack of the university 's computer systems that is being investigated by police , reveal that Jones was hurt , angry and uncertain about the allegations .
" It is all malicious … I seem to be a marked man now , " he wrote in April 2007 .
Another email from him said : " My problem is I do n't know the best course of action … I know I 'm on the right side and honest , but I seem to be telling myself this more often recently ! "
An American colleague , and frequent contributor to the leaked emails , Dr Mike Mann at Pennsylvania State University , advised him : " This crowd of charlatans … look for one little thing they can say is wrong , and thus generalise that the science is entirely compromised .
The last thing you want to do is help them by feeding the fire .
Best thing is to ignore them completely . "
Another colleague , Kevin Trenberth at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , urged a fightback .
" The response should try to somehow label these guys and [ sic ] lazy and incompetent and unable to do the huge amount of work it takes to construct such a database . "
In August 2007 , Keenan submitted a formal complaint about Wang to Wang 's employers .
The university launched an inquiry .
Reporting in May 2008 , it found " no evidence of the alleged fabrication of results " and exonerated him .
But it did not publish its detailed findings , and refused to give a copy to Keenan .
By then , Keenan had published his charges in Energy & Environment , a peer - reviewed journal edited by a Hull University geographer , Dr Sonja Boehmer - Christiansen .
The paper was largely ignored at the time , but Guardian investigations of the hacked emails now reveal that there was concern among Jones 's colleagues about Wang 's missing data – and the apparent efforts by Jones and Wang over several years to cover this up .
Those concerns were most cogently expressed to Jones by his ex-boss , and former head of the CRU , Dr Tom Wigley .
In August 2007 , Wigley warned Jones by email : " It seems to me that Keenan has a valid point .
The statements in the papers that he quotes seem to be incorrect statements , and that someone ( W - C W at the very least ) must have known at the time that they were incorrect . "
Wigley was concerned partly because he had been director of the CRU when the original paper was published in 1990 .
As he told Jones later , in 2009 : " The buck should eventually stop with me . "
Wigley put to Jones the allegations made by the sceptics .
" Wang had been claiming the existence of such exonerating documents for nearly a year , but he has not been able to produce them .
Additionally , there was a report published in 1991 ( with a second version in 1997 ) explicitly stating that no such documents exist . "
This is believed to be a report from the US department of energy , which obtained the original Chinese temperature data .
Wang 's defence to the university inquiry says that he had got the Chinese temperature data from a Chinese colleague , although she is not an author on the 1990 Nature paper .
Wang 's defence explains that the colleague had lost her notes on many station locations during a series of office moves .
Nonetheless , " based on her recollections " , she could provide information on 41 of the 49 stations .
In all , that meant that no fewer than 51 of the 84 stations had been moved during the 30 - year study period , 25 had not moved , and eight she could not recollect .
Wang , however , maintained to the university that the 1990 paper 's claim that " few , if any " stations had moved was true .
The inquiry apparently agreed .
Wigley , in his May 2009 email to Jones , said of Wang : " I have always thought W - C W was a rather sloppy scientist .
I would … not be surprised if he screwed up here …
Were you taking W - C W on trust ?
Why , why , why did you and W - C W not simply say this right at the start ?
Perhaps it 's not too late . "
There is no evidence of any doubts being raised over Wang 's previous work .
Jones told the Guardian he was not able to comment on the allegations .
Wang said : " I have been exonerated by my university on all the charges .
When we started on the paper we had all the station location details in order to identify our network , but we cannot find them any more .
Some of the location changes were probably only a few metres , and where they were more we corrected for them . "
The story has a startling postscript .
In 2008 , Jones prepared a paper for the Journal of Geophysical Research re-examining temperatures in eastern China .
It found that , far from being negligible , the urban heat phenomenon was responsible for 40 % of the warming seen in eastern China between 1951 and 2004 .
This does not flatly contradict Jones 's 1990 paper .
The timeframe for the new analysis is different .
But it raises serious new questions about one of the most widely referenced papers on global warming , and about the IPCC 's reliance on its conclusions .
It is important to keep this in perspective , however .
This dramatic revision of the estimated impact of urbanisation on temperatures in China does not change the global picture of temperature trends .
There is plenty of evidence of global warming , not least from oceans far from urban influences .
A review of recent studies published online in December by David Parker of the Met Office concludes that , even allowing for Jones 's new data , " global near - surface temperature trends have not been greatly affected by urban warming trends . "
Keenan accepts that his allegations do not on their own change the global picture .
But he told the Guardian : " My interest in all this arises from concern about research integrity , rather than about global warming per se .
Jones knew there were serious problems with the Chinese research , yet continued to rely upon the research in his work , including allowing it to be cited in the IPCC report . "
The emails
From sceptic Doug Keenan to Dr Wei-Chyung Wang and Prof Phil Jones – 20 April 2007
" I ask you to retract your GRL paper , in full , and to retract the claims made in Nature about the Chinese data .
If you do not do so , I intend to publicly submit an allegation of research misconduct to your university at Albany . "
From Jones to Dr Kevin Trenberth
" I seem to be the marked man now ! "
From Prof Michael Mann to Jones
" This is all too predictable .
This crowd of charlatans is always looking for one thing they can harp on , where people w/ little knowledge of the facts might be able to be convinced that there is a controversy .
They can't take on the whole of the science , so they look for one little thing they can say is wrong , and thus generalise that the science is entirely compromised . "
From Trenberth to Jones and Mann – 21 April 2007
" I am sure you know that this is not about the science .
It is an attack to " undermine the science in some way .
In that regard I do n't think you can ignore it all … the response should try to somehow label these guys lazy and incompetent and unable to do the huge amount of work it takes to construct such a database . "
From Prof Tom Wigley to Jones – 4 May 2009
" I have always thought W - C W [ Wang ] was a rather sloppy scientist .
I therefore would not be surprised if he screwed up here …
Why , why , why did you and W - C W not simply say this right at the start ?
Perhaps it 's not too late ?
I realise that Keenan is just a troublemaker and out to waste time , so I apologize for continuing to waste your time on this , Phil .
However , I *am * concerned because all this happened under my watch as director of CRU and , although this is unlikely , the buck eventually should stop with me . "
• This article was amended on 2 and 9 February 2010 .

Speakers for Topic 2 :
Roughly For – Professor John Quiggin ,
Roughly Against – Dr. Bruce Littleboy –
Key Questions :
Has neoliberal market orthodoxy being proved wrong by the GFC ?
Was the subprime collapse caused by government intervention or lack thereof ?
Is there any truth to trickle - down theory or does it just mean the poor get trickled - on ?
Are markets naturally efficient in the first place ?
( If we get around to it ) Should the state provide welfare ?
An Idiot ’s background guide to the topic :
Prior to the GFC , many well - meaning Economists had come to the conclusion that Ronald Reagan was n’t too far off the mark when he declared in his 1980 inaugural address “ Government is not the solution to our problem , Government IS the problem . ”
Free market economists rallied to the call , and , true to form , developed a range of assumptions , hypotheses and graphs to support their argument .
Most prescient among these was the ‘ Efficient Markets hypothesis ’ .
For the uninitiated , the EMH can be summarised as ‘ hang the sense of it , this whole market thing seems to be sorting itself out ok without us , so why do n’t we all just go and have a drink or several ’ .
During the subsequent years of American economic expansion – and the self - declared triumph of neo-liberalism ( lets call it ‘ happy hour ’ ) , Economists seem to have grativated away from devising strategies for equitable growth and towards the behavouralist and experimentalist route that reached its zenith with ‘ Freakonomics ’ .
This sexy new ‘ pop ’ Economics might sell books , but some feel it is a complete prostitution and debasement of Economics as a profession – to the point that asking a respectable Economist about Freakonomics is akin to asking a field surgeon in Haiti about botox ( not least because it seemed to imply that Economists were genuinely interesting people to talk to at parties ) .
Paul Krugman , Nobel Prize winning Economist , thinks all Economic theory from the last twenty years needs to be scrapped .
But that ’s what Friedman said about Keynes twenty years earlier … so who ’s right ?
And if they ca n’t make up their minds anyway , why should we even listen to them ?
After the GFC , which saw several trillion dollars simply disappear from the global economy , it ’s worth finding out if Economists really know what they ’re talking about – Does government intervention in the economy actually make us worse off ?
Are markets efficient ?
Are Economists interesting people to speak to at parties ?

– IMPACT REPORT –
At the beginning of the Cold - War era , America focused it ’s nuclear programs on Breeder reactors that produced materials for weapons , as did the Soviets .
When the Oil Crisis hit in ’ 72 , all newly built reactors fell in line with this objective , and Uranium has dominated since .
As a result of this Tipping Point , the best Energy Alternatives were sidelined up until just recently .
During a Nuclear Renaissance , we ’re free to correct past mistakes , and re-examine Thorium as the safer , cleaner fuel of the Future !
Thorium : Fueling a Limitless Future
As we all continue to waste enormous amounts of precious time and energy on re-hashing the nuclear debate , while continuing to poison and destroy our natural ( and even socio - political ) environment with all the toxic byproducts of the pre-dominant methods of fossil - fueled based energy production , perhaps we could also consider some of the cleaner alternatives which ironically have been waiting in the wings since they were first discovered way back at the dawn of the Cold War Era .
To learn about the historical mistakes that caused Thorium Energy to be delayed until now …
CLICK HERE
( opens in a new page )
Just below , is quite possibly the very best , most condensed and comprehensive explanation of not only how nuclear energy is derived , but also how Thorium - based reactions are a superb alternative to Uranium based energy .
This video also covers the tragic reasons why Thorium energy was buried by Uranium - based fission , and includes a complete explanation of how liquid fluoride Thorium reactors ( LFTR ) could in fact be the magical silver bullet that will enable a sustainable version of our highly industrialized Society !
If you ’re curious , then just continue reading about how and why ( a long suppressed )
Thorium - nuclear based energy grid could be our best and possibly last chance for surviving the Fossil - Fuel age .
WARNING :
This material is dense , fast , and superbly comprehensive !
Are you ready to explore the Future ?
Then click below for MORE …
We should pause to briefly clarify the paths available for proceeding into a future where we leave the fossil - fuel age far behind us .
Solar and Wind can definitely help us do this on smaller scales , however without radically limiting our current Consumption ( not necessarily a bad thing ) , nobody with a realistic sense of economics and social behavior expects these marginal sources scale up sufficiently to meet our baseload requirements at any point in the near future .
That ’s not to say that new forms of PV or mechanical generation ca n’t be realized in the future ( using solar and wind as sources ) , but rather that we need to be ever - mindful of the inescapable fact that we just do n’t have the luxury of time to develop these marginal sources , while constantly burning through hydrocarbons to sustain us in the meantime .
Therefore the rhetorical debates around Pro/Anti-Nuclear energy can and should be put into their proper Future perspectives for at least two very good reasons :
1 >
Leading experts in the Green Movement have already started a Cultural shift away from the traditional fears of historical nuclear programs , by putting the ” dangerous waste and weapons ” issues into a more realistic and long term view of their impacts , in relation to the immediate and ongoing damages from our current Energy sources and usage patterns .
ie .
– Former Greenpeace director Stephen Tindale says “ atomic power is an important way forward in climate change battle ”
– Greenpeace Co-Founder Patrick Moore says “ Nuclear energy may just be the energy source that can save our planet from another possible disaster : catastrophic climate change ! ”
– Global warming scientists like James Hansen was among the first to sound the Global Warming alarm , and has since become a proponent of Thorium fueled energy .
2 >
Thorium is a form of fuel that could revolutionize the entire nuclear energy industry by completely changing the supply / enrichment , production methods , reactor fuel cycle and by - products , as well as the resulting waste and weaponization risks of nuclear energy .
Although the use of Thorium was abandoned at the beginning of the nuclear age , due to the weaponization potential of Uranium ( a pivotal tipping point in history ) , it is now poised to make a major re-surgence in it ’s Future potential …and could in fact divert Humanity away from a course to ecological oblivion .
Here ’s a quick overview of the ( posibly supressed ) long - held and promised benefits of Thorium :
These are benefits not only to the future of Energy production , but also in the resulting elimination of the factors that contribute to the weaponization potential within Uranium - based nuclear energy processes , and all their dangerous by - products .
Thorium is named for the Norse god of thunder , and it ’s an Actinide that can produce a form of fission that is almost self sustaining produce more neutrons per collision than conventional fuel .
The more neutrons per collision , the more energy generated , the less total fuel consumed , and the less radioactive nastiness left behind .
It is plentiful in nature , and virtually inexhaustible .
It is very abundant in the US ( at least 175,000 tons ) of the stuff , and does n’t require costly processing or enrichment .
It is safe .
You could carry a lump of it in your pocket without harm !
It dissolves in hot liquid fluoride salts , which enables a self - regulating form of fission that can never cascade out of control , or result in core “ melt - down ” scenarios .
This is the principal behind the “ Liquid Flouride Thorium Reactor ( LFTR ) or “ lifter ” design .
US reactor base could be converted to LFTRs and existing domestic thorium reserves would power the US for a thousand years .
After it has been used as fuel for power plants , the element leaves behind minuscule amounts of waste .
And that waste needs to be stored for only a few hundred years ( short half - life ) , not a few hundred thousand like other nuclear byproducts .
It ’s also one of only a few fissionable substances that acts as a thermal breeder , in theory creating enough new fuel as it breaks down to sustain a high - temperature chain reaction indefinitely .
It ’s reaction process is very self - regulating , and can be stopped and started very quickly / efficiently , which makes it an ideal source of both highly adaptable ‘ baseload ’ as well as ‘ balancing power ’ in future electrical grids –
Which are expected to fluctuate greatly with the increasing use of highly variable / fluctuating wind and solar energy availability .
Based on the much higher reactor costs ( compared to graphite moderated uranium piles ) , the inherent U232 contamination of Thorium reaction , the enormous costs and challenges of modifying the reaction cycles of Thorium to eliminate the U232 contamination , and finally the much greater challenges of handling such “ hot ” by - product , it would be virtually impossible for the byproducts of a thorium reactor to be used by terrorists or anyone else to make nuclear weapons .
Essentially , LFTR is a complex reactor to design ( and even more costly to modify ) and would not be even remotely close to the reactor of choice for aspiring nuclear - weapons states .
Thorium reactors can be used to consume spent Uranium fuel , and other by - products including the materials from de-commisioned weapons which are currently in storage .
The use of Thorium as the primary fuel source in the future , would also eliminate the need to mine , process and enrich Uranium on such a large scale , and thus make it increasingly unavailable for any weapons projects .
Thorium based nuclear energy would also relieve the strain and demand on current energy supplies , and thus greatly negate the possibility of Future wars being waged over conventional energy resources .
In short , eliminating the need to wage wars for access to Oil and Gas !

When Roger Ailes started FOX News in 1996 , people said he'd have no chance against CNN .
This year , FOX News will likely make $ 700 million of profit -- more money than CNN , MSNBC and the evening newscasts of NBC , ABC and CBS combined .
Ailes rules not only the news business but politics :
If Ailes were a Democrat , James Carville says , the Democrats would control 67 seats in the Senate .
David Carr and Tim Arango of the NYT provide a snapshot of News Corp 's most valuable asset .
Here 's the money shot :
Mr. Ailes , the son of a foreman at the Packard Electric plant in Warren , Ohio , described his upbringing with three words : “ God , country , family ” and said that credo was responsible for the success of Fox News .
“ I built this channel from my life experience , ” Mr. Ailes , 69 , said .
“ My first qualification is I did n’t go to Columbia Journalism School .
There are no parties in this town that I want to go to . ”
Members of Rupert Murdoch 's extended family , meanwhile , are appalled by what Ailes and FOX are doing :
“ I am by no means alone within the family or the company in being ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes ’s horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalistic standards that News Corporation , its founder and every other global media business aspires to , ” said Matthew Freud , who is married to Ms. Murdoch and whom PR Week magazine says is the most influential public relations executive in London .

Undercover videos produced by animal rights groups are fueling a debate over the need for new laws to regulate the treatment of American dairy cows .
The graphic videos include one made inside a huge New York dairy operation where cows never go outside , have the ends of their tails cut off in painful procedures without anesthesia , and are seen being abused by one employee who hits a cow over the head with a wrench when it refuses to move .
An investigator for the group Mercy for Animals worked at the New York dairy farm , Willet Dairy , one of the largest in the state , for two months as a mechanic .
" These animals are really treated as little more than milk - producing machines , " said Nathan Runkle , executive director of Mercy for Animals .
" The overall environment at this facility was really a culture of cruelty and neglect . "
Portions of the video will be played in reports to be aired this evening on ABC World News with Diane Sawyer and later on Nightline .
The practice of cutting off the ends of the tails of dairy cows -- known as tail docking -- is found in about half of American dairy farms , according to a 2002 U.S. Department of Agriculture report , although a dairy industry trade group says it is in decline .
The practice was banned in California last year and a bill to prohibit tail docking was introduced last week in the New York legislature .
" Science has shown repeatedly this practice is barbaric and totally unnecessary , " said Jennifer Fearing , California director of the Humane Society of the United States , which helped push the passage of legislation in Sacramento .
The dairy trade group says tail docking helps prevent cows from spreading manure and filth with their tails in barn conditions .
" I do n't think it would help to create an army of tail police to go around and check whether some cows have portions of their tails cut off , " said Chris Galen of the National Milk Producers Federation .

According to a report by Amnesty International :
Nicaragua ’s revised Penal Code , which came into effect in July 2008 ,
stipulates prison sentences for girls and women who seek an abortion
and for health professionals who provide health services associated
with abortion .
The prohibition includes cases where the life of the
woman is at risk or when pregnancy is the result of rape or incest .
[ Emphasis added ]
The revised penal code is inconsistent with the country ’s Obstetric
Rules and Protocols issued by the Ministry of Health , to mandate
therapeutic abortions as clinical responses to specific cases .
" Nicaragua ’s ban on abortion is the result of a shocking and draconian
law that is compelling rape and incest victims to carry pregnancies to
term and causing a rise in maternal deaths , " said Widney Brown , Senior
Director of International Law and Policy at Amnesty International .
Amalia–a person , a woman , a daughter , a sister , a mother–may soon become one of those statistics we all bat around from the safety of our computers to talk about abortion and maternal death .
First diagnosed with cancer many years ago , Amalia was treated and went into remission .
She moved on and lived her life .
She had a daughter , now 10 years old , for whom she wants to stay alive .
In the first week of January , she was hospitalized and after testing was diagnosed with metastatic cancer for which her doctor stated aggressive chemotherapy and radiation would be needed to save her life .
However , because the chemotherapy might affect or lead to the death of the fetus , no doctor will treat her because they fear the consequences of a law that leads to imprisonment for doctors who even deign to think that women like Amalia–merely an incubator under Nicaraguan law–have the right to be treated as aggressively as they would a man .
Providing a therapeutic abortion–one intended to save the life or health of the mother –would give Amalia a fighting chance to live to raise her daughter .
Amalia , wanting to live , is fighting for the right to have this abortion .
Without it , she is denied the treatment she needs to live .
Ironically–or perhaps not –without treatment she is not likely to live long enough to carry this pregnancy to term .
Make sense yet ?
Amalia ’s sister , desperate not to lose Amalia , has pleaded for help from human rights groups , and a coalition of 20 organizations working on women ’s rights , child rights , sexual violence and reproductive health , The Grupo Estratégico por la Despenalización del Aborto Terapéutico de Nicaragua ( Strategic Working Group for the Decriminalization of Therapeutic Abortion of Nicaragua ) is advocating on her behalf .
According to a statement by the Grupo Estratégico :
As the days pass , the cancer advances , and will continue to do so
without therapy .
The life and health of Amalia are at stake .
Her only
hope is to have a therapeutic abortion performed , in order to initiate
the adequate treatment to detain the cancer .
Doctors are denying Amalia
of this procedure adducing that the law does not allow them to practice
therapeutic abortion .
Having exhausted appeals to Nicaraguan authorities , the group is now taking its case to the InterAmerican Human Rights Commission in Costa Rica .
The process–or should I just simply say " hoops " – through which Amalia and her representatives are being forced to jump are costing her precious days of treatment as her cancer progresses every day .
At some point , it will be too late for the treatment to matter .
Amalia is a human being , deserving of human rights .
Her case is also but one example of the end result of efforts of the so - called " pro-life " movement to make it increasingly difficult to see and treat women as actual human beings , as opposed to the container for the potential beings they may be carrying in their wombs .
Amalia may also soon be one of those statistics about which that movement creates every excuse in the book to dismiss as " not real , " " irrelevant , " " not that bad … . " .
Remember how often the stories of women helped by Dr. George Tiller were discounted and contested by the so - called pro-life movement , and both the mainstream and online media after he was murdered ?
( Did they really need those abortions ….? ) .
Amalia is one of those women .
Before our eyes right now .
The only difference perhaps is that being in Nicaragua , it is even easier to ignore her case and make it a statistic .
She is " over there . "
Her case is illustrative of the reasons why international organizations such as Amnesty International have taken on the battle to hold Nicaragua and other countries with similar laws accountable for human rights violations .
" UN
member states should take this opportunity to hold Nicaragua to account
for a law that violates women ’s right to life , health and dignity , " says Widney Brown .
" Nicaragua ’s law criminalizing abortion goes against the advice of
four U.N. treaty bodies and fails to meet its obligations under
international human rights laws , " Brown states .
" Nicaragua needs to repeal this law immediately
and enact laws and policies that promote the rights of women and girls
by ensuring their rights to health , life and to be free from violence ,
coercion and discrimination . "
I hope that day comes , for every woman everywhere , though its arrival is constantly pushed into the future by the actions of the Catholic Church , organizations like Human Life International , Focus on the Family , and the Family Research Council and other so - called " pro-life " advocates .
It may be too late for Amalia and all those she loves and by whom she is loved .
For as many as 1 in 20 people , everyday experiences can elicit extra-ordinary associated sensations .
The condition is known as synaesthesia and the most common form involves " seeing " colours when reading words and numbers .
Many previous studies have shown that the brains of people who experience this phenomenon are different from those who do not and , in a new study reported in the February 2010 issue of Cortex , researchers from the University of Padova , Italy , have discovered that learning may also play an important role in synaesthesia and can lead to synaesthetic behaviour even when the person is not consciously aware of the experience .
Dr Ilaria Berteletti and colleagues tested an Italian synaesthete using a classic test , in which the participant was shown a series of numbers presented in different ink colours and asked to name those colours .
A synaesthete for whom the number 2 is red will find it more difficult to name the ink colour of a green 2 than if the number is presented in red ink and will take longer to respond .
This slowing of response is generally taken as evidence that synaesthetic experiences are real and automatic .
As predicted , the participant in this study was slower to name the colours of the presented Arabic digits when they did not match the colours that he had reported " seeing . "
Strikingly , the same slowing was observed when the numbers were presented as dots , such as dice patterns , even though the participant denied seeing any colours for these types of stimuli .
The results suggest that the mere concept of a number , regardless of how it was presented visually ( as an Arabic digit or pattern of dots ) , was enough to produce the marker of synaesthetic behaviour , even when the participant was not conscious of experiencing synaesthesia .
According to co-author Dr Edward Hubbard , " a lifetime of synaesthetic experiences may lead to the creation of learned associations between different classes of stimuli " and that " conscious awareness of these associations is not necessary for them to affect behaviour . "
Damn .
The New York Times wrote up a kerfluffle involving the Dean of Admissions at the University of Chicago , who sent out a sample essay that 's a little too hott for some applicants and their parents .
... The essay , comparing the college to an elusive lover , has had a very different effect .
" Dear University of Chicago ,
It fills me up with that gooey sap you feel late at night when I think about things that are really special to me about you , " the essay began .
" Tell me , was I just one in a line of many ?
Was I just another supple ‘ applicant ' to you , looking for a place to live , looking for someone to teach me the ways of the world ? "
Is that an admissions binder in your pocket , or are you just happy to be applying to the University of Amateur T & A State Chicago ?
The Times piece did n't print the rest of the essay , but linked to it on College Confidential .
It really only gets better :
The closeness between us was beautiful , it could n't have been just me that felt it , I know you felt it too .
The intimacy was akin to that of scholar and original text , your depth as a person is astounding !
To be honest , I must confess I had already dreamt of a rosy future together , one filled with late nights and long discussions over the Gothic era and the ethical stage of Kierkegaard , we would watch the sunset together and spend every Christmas snuggled in blankets .
Eventually we would get older , I would become a well - educated corporate lawyer and you would enrich yourself within the domain of human knowledge .
Your cup overfloweth with academic genius , pour a little on me .
I have no idea what the fuck this kid 's talking about , but like the Dean of Admissions did , I would 've admitted him to the school , if anything , for even giving me the impression that he were capable of being subversive ( even if the kid is just another freshman horndog ) .
But naturally , like all great ( intellectual and / or creative and maybe sometimes literal ) orgies , people are freaking out .
The Times reported on the students who were upset and / or offended by the essay , which made them question their confidence , which , in turn , makes this entire thing a great PASS / FAIL enterprise .
Did you project your sexual and / or academic insecurity onto this essay ?
FAIL !
That said , the best are the parents who get their fangs out over it , far more so than the kids .
One — " MumMum " — notes :
I agree with the person who said cloying and almost painful to read .
Unless one really likes that mop commercial .
Jesus , parents are all over this College Confidential nonsense .
That woman 's logged 175 posts !
Another user 's name is VicariousParent .
She claws :
I ' got ' the essay ( in the OP ) but personally I thought it was ' meh ' .
It got a bit tiresome after the first few sentences .
Me-yow !
Also , ' vicarious ' would be a pretty ' meh ' word for some of these people .

Scary !
This all goes without saying that the kid who wrote the essay is obviously a genius , and these other kids / parents are insecure and / or jealous about this issue , because he clearly understands what 's important .
1 . What the University of Chicago wants , which are
2 . People who are n't the people flipping their shit over this essay , and also
3 . His nubile young sexuality to deconstruct , which , for all parties involved , is now
4 . The only reason one has to go to college now unless they 're going to useful graduate schools and becoming doctors or lawyers or are trying to stave off the real world for another two years by getting an MFA in something that will ostensibly qualify them to be craftspeople at something like " creative literature " but really ain't worth shit these days , unless you go to Iowa and want nobody but people you secretly hate to read your writing , because otherwise , you get a piece of paper that keeps you out of the job market while you get your fuck on and learn how to take a proper bong rip .
But mostly fucking .
And then : you 're broke for some time after that , the cost of the " education " withstanding .
Tragically , U Chicago 's Dead of Admissions , Jim Nondorf ( pictured ) , apologized for the controversy , noting that while he had the essay writer 's permission , and that he was admitted , he did n't mean to scare up any trouble .
To calm the waters , a Chicago admissions representative on Tuesday posted a response telling students not to worry if their essays were similar .
" We sent out the essay to lighten the mood , but it seems that it might have backfired a bit , " the posting said , adding that the dean , James G. Nondorf , had asked to " pass on a sincere apology if it did not hit the mark . "
" Our general message in sharing it with prospective students , " [ Nondorf ] wrote , " was that they should n't stress out about essay writing . "
Bullshit !
A really important edumacation institution would 've sent this out to be subversive , admitted it , and then told these people to shove their indignity up their bleeding heart asses .
But it appears that the University of Chicago will always have a certain je ne sais quois lacking in other schools like it .

The late - eighteenth - century popular philosopher and cultural critic George Lichtenberg wrote , " Just as we outgrow a pair of trousers , we outgrow acquaintances , libraries , principles , etc. at times before they 're worn out and at times - and this is worst of all - before we have new ones . "
Write an essay about something you have outgrown , perhaps before you had a replacement - a friend , a political philosophy , a favorite author , or anything that has had an influence on you .
What , if anything , has taken its place ?
Trousers ?
And things outgrowing trousers ?
And things we 've had to replace ?
The third one is n't that great , but the next two ?
Essay Option 4
From game theory to Ultimate Frisbee to the great Chicago Scavenger Hunt , we at the University of Chicago take games seriously .
We bet you do , too .
Even if " just a game , " sport , play , and other kinds of games seem to share at the very least an insistence that we take seriously a set of rules entirely peculiar to the circumstance of the game .
You might say , in order to play a game we must take it seriously .
Think playfully - or play thoughtfully - about games : how they distract us or draw us into the world , create community and competition , tease us and test us with stakes both set apart from and meaningful to everyday life .
Do n't tell us about The Big Game ; rather , tell us about players and games .
Essay Option 5
In the spirit of adventurous inquiry , pose a question of your own .
If your prompt is original and thoughtful then you should have little trouble writing a great essay .
Draw on your best qualities as a writer , thinker , visionary , social critic , sage , citizen of the world , or future citizen of the University of Chicago ; take a little risk and have fun .
Here 's my question :
Are these not the best essay questions ever , or what ?
I want to apply to the University of Chicago just to see what they 'll accept .
Since , apparently , the rest of their smooth , soft , supple submissions just to happen to suck balls .
Not like that .
I mean they 're mediocre and kind of pussies .
Not , you know , I mean , right .
Another week , another colorful feathered dinosaur .
Hot on the heels of a recent report identifying pigments in fossilized dino feathers and filaments ( SN Online : 1/27/10 ) , a different team of scientists says that it has mapped the full pattern of plumage sported by the oldest known feathered dinosaur .
Paleontologists first described Anchiornis huxleyi , which lived in what is now northeastern China between 151 million and 161 million years ago , in September ( SN : 10/24/09 , p. 8 ) .
Reports of the lithe , peacock - sized dinosaur caused quite a stir , not least because the feathered creature was older than Archaeopteryx , which is considered by many scientists to be the oldest known bird .
Now , analyses of fossil feathers from all parts of A. huxleyi’s body — reported online Feb.
4 and in an upcoming Science — provide a detailed look at the dino ’s color scheme .
The new findings also bolster the notion that feathers first evolved for a purpose other than flying , scientists say .
A. huxleyi had black and gray body plumage , the team ’s investigations suggest .
And while the long feathers on the front and side of the creature ’s crest were gray , those sprouting from the top and back of its head were reddish - brown .
Along with reddish - brown spots on its head and neck , A. huxleyi sported white racing stripes on its legs and its winglike forelimbs .
Paleobiologist Jakob Vinther of Yale University and his colleagues took a microscopic look at fossilized feathers at 29 sites on a specimen of A. huxleyi unearthed early last year .
Some analyses focused on the small , simple feathers that covered the creature ’s body and skull , and others targeted the longer , more complex feathers that adorned its forelimbs , legs and feet .
“ There was hardly any part of the creature that was n’t feathered , ” Vinther notes .
Almost all of the feathers the team scrutinized contained well - preserved remnants of pigment - bearing structures called melanosomes .
Feathers lacking melanosomes were probably white , the researchers note .
By comparing the size , shape , density and arrangement of melanosomes in each fossil feather with those in variously colored feathers of modern birds , the team then sketched out what A. huxleyi looked like .
“ Using those comparisons , we can reliably predict [ the creature ’s ] color and map the whole animal , ” Vinther says .
The team ’s analyses “ reveal an enormous array of information , ” says Michael Benton , a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England .
The black - and - white bars on A. huxleyi’s forelimbs , as well as its colorful crest , are reminiscent of similar features in modern birds , he adds .
Knowing when color appeared in feathers or filaments may help solve the conundrum of why those structures evolved in the first place , Benton says .
After all , he notes , A. huxleyi’s feathered forelimbs were n’t sufficiently large enough to carry the creature ’s weight in flight .
“ What ’s the function of half a wing ? ” he asks .
The fact that feathers appear in the fossil record long before flight - capable birds suggests that feathers initially served a behavioral function , possibly one related to sending visual signals , and only later began to serve an aerodynamic function .
Philip J. Currie , a paleontologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada , agrees : “ Ancient creatures did n’t just sprout feathers and start flying .
The feathers were there for another reason first . ”
Fossils reveal that dinosaurs often had very large eyes and sizable optic lobes in their brains .
“ Dinosaurs were very visual animals , just like birds are , ” he adds .
Bold patterns of plumage , such as those seen in A. huxleyi , could have served any of a number of functions , Vinther and his colleagues speculate .
Besides communicating to members of its own species — a “ come here , cutie ” to members of the opposite sex , say , or a “ back off ” message to rival suitors — a quick flash of boldly colored plumage could startle an attacking predator or flush prey out of hiding , the researchers say .

1 Generalities
1.1 Modules Sys and Unix
Functions that give access to the system from OCaml are grouped into two modules .
The first module , Sys , contains those functions common to Unix and other operating systems under which OCaml runs .
The second module , Unix , contains everything specific to Unix .
In what follows , we will refer to identifiers from the Sys and Unix modules without specifying which modules they come from .
That is , we will suppose that we are within the scope of the directives open Sys and open Unix .
In complete examples , we explicitly write open , in order to be truly complete .
The Sys and Unix modules can redefine certain identifiers of the Pervasives module , hiding previous definitions .
For example , Pervasives.stdin is different from Unix.stdin .
The previous definitions can always be obtained through a prefix .
To compile an OCaml program that uses the Unix library , do this :
ocamlc -o prog unix.cma mod1.ml mod2.ml mod3.ml
where the program prog is assumed to comprise of the three modules mod1 , mod2 and mod3 .
The modules can also be compiled separately :
ocamlc -c mod1.ml ocamlc -c mod2.ml ocamlc -c mod3.ml
and linked with :
ocamlc -o prog unix.cma mod1.cmo mod2.cmo mod3.cmo
In both cases , the argument unix.cma is the Unix library written in OCaml .
To use the native - code compiler rather than the bytecode compiler , replace ocamlc with ocamlopt and unix.cma with unix.cmxa .
If the compilation tool ocamlbuild is used , simply add the following line to the _tags file :
< prog.{native , byte} > : use_unix
The Unix system can also be accessed from the interactive system , also known as the “ toplevel ” .
If your platform supports dynamic linking of C libraries , start an ocaml toplevel and type in the directive :
# load " unix.cma " ; ;
Otherwise , you will need to create an interactive system containing the pre-loaded system functions :
ocamlmktop -o ocamlunix unix.cma
This toplevel can be started by :
./ocamlunix
1.2 Interface with the calling program
When running a program from a shell ( command interpreter ) , the shell passes arguments and an environment to the program .
The arguments are words on the command line that follow the name of the command .
The environment is a set of strings of the form variable=value , representing the global bindings of environment variables : bindings set with setenv var=val for the csh shell , or with var=val ; export var for the sh shell .
The arguments passed to the program are in the string array Sys.argv :
The environment of the program is obtained by the function Unix. environment :
A more convenient way of looking up the environment is to use the function Sys.getenv :
Sys.getenv v returns the value associated with the variable name v in the environment , raising the exception Not_found if this variable is not bound .
Example
As a first example , here is the echo program , which prints a list of its arguments , as does the Unix command of the same name .
let echo ( ) = let len = Array.
length Sys.argv in if len > 1 then begin print_string Sys.argv . ( 1 ) ; for i = 2 to len - 1 do print_char ' '; print_string Sys.argv .( i ) ; done ; print_newline ( ) ; end ; ; echo ( ) ; ; * * *
A program can be terminated at any point with a call to exit :
The argument is the return code to send back to the calling program .
The convention is to return 0 if all has gone well , and to return a non -zero code to signal an error .
In conditional constructions , the sh shell interprets the return code 0 as the boolean “ true ” , and all non -zero codes as the boolean “ false ” .
When a program terminates normally after executing all of the expressions of which it is composed , it makes an implicit call to exit 0 .
When a program terminates prematurely because an exception was raised but not caught , it makes an implicit call to exit 2 .
The function exit always flushes the buffers of all channels open for writing .
The function at_exit lets one register other actions to be carried out when the program terminates .
The last function to be registered is called first .
A function registered with at_exit cannot be unregistered .
However , this is not a real restriction : we can easily get the same effect with a function whose execution depends on a global variable .
1.3 Error handling
Unless otherwise indicated , all functions in the Unix module raise the exception Unix_error in case of error .
exception Unix_error of error * string * string error * string * string
The second argument of the Unix_error exception is the name of the system call that raised the error .
The third argument identifies , if possible , the object on which the error occurred ; for example , in the case of a system call taking a file name as an argument , this file name will be in the third position in Unix_error .
Finally , the first argument of the exception is an error code indicating the nature of the error .
It belongs to the variant type error :
type of int error = E2BIG | EACCES | EAGAIN | ... | EUNKNOWNERRint
Constructors of this type have the same names and meanings as those used in the posix convention and certain errors from unix98 and bsd .
All other errors use the constructor EUNKOWNERR .
Given the semantics of exceptions , an error that is not specifically foreseen and intercepted by a try propagates up to the top of a program and causes it to terminate prematurely .
In small applications , treating unforeseen errors as fatal is a good practice .
However , it is appropriate to display the error clearly .
To do this , the Unix module supplies the handle_unix_error function :
The call handle_unix_error f x applies function f to the argument x .
If this raises the exception Unix_error , a message is displayed describing the error , and the program is terminated with exit 2 .
A typical use is
handle_unix_error prog ( ) ; ;
where the function prog : unit -> unit executes the body of the program .
For reference , here is how handle_unix_error is implemented .
1 open Unix ; ; 2 let handle_unix_error f arg = 3 try 4 f arg 5 with Unix_error ( err , fun_name , arg ) -> 6 prerr_string Sys.argv .(0 ) ; 7 prerr_string " : \ " " ; 8 prerr_string fun_name ; 9 prerr_string " \ " failed " ; 10 if String.length arg >
0 then begin 11 prerr_string " on \ " " ; 12 prerr_string arg ; 13 prerr_string " \ " " 14 end ; 15 prerr_string " : " ; 16 prerr_endline ( error_message err ) ; 17 exit 2 ; ; Unix ; ; handle_unix_error f arg =f argUnix_error ( err , fun_name , arg ) -> prerr_string Sys.argv . ( 0 ) ; prerr_string " : \ " " ; prerr_string fun_name ; prerr_string " \ " failed " ; String.length arg > 0 prerr_string " on \ " " ; prerr_string arg ; prerr_string " \" " prerr_string " : " ; prerr_endline ( error_message err ) ; exit 2 ; ;
Functions of the form prerr_xxx are like the functions print_xxx , except that they write on the error channel stderr rather than on the standard output channel stdout .
The primitive error_message , of type error -> string , returns a message describing the error given as an argument ( line 16 ) .
The argument number zero of the program , namely Sys.argv .
( 0 ) , contains the name of the command that was used to invoke the program ( line 6 ) .
The function handle_unix_error handles fatal errors , i.e. errors that stop the program .
An advantage of OCaml is that it requires all errors to be handled , if only at the highest level by halting the program .
Indeed , any error in a system call raises an exception , and the execution thread in progress is interrupted up to the level where the exception is explicitly caught and handled .
This avoids continuing the program in an inconsistent state .
Errors of type Unix_error can , of course , be selectively matched .
We will often see the following function later on :
let rec restart_on_EINTR
f x = try f x with Unix_error ( EINTR , _ , _ ) -> restart_on_EINTR f x
which is used to execute a function and to restart it automatically when it executes a system call that is interrupted ( see section 4.5 ) .
1.4 Library functions
As we will see throughout the examples , system programming often repeats the same patterns .
To reduce the code of each application to its essentials , we will want to define library functions that factor out the common parts .
Whereas in a complete program one knows precisely which errors can be raised ( and these are often fatal , resulting in the program being stopped ) , we generally do not know the execution context in the case of library functions .
We can not suppose that all errors are fatal .
It is therefore necessary to let the error return to the caller , which will decide on a suitable course of action ( e.g. stop the program , or handle or ignore the error ) .
However , the library function in general will not allow the error to simply pass through , since it must maintain the system in a consistent state .
For example , a library function that opens a file and then applies an operation to its file descriptor must take care to close the descriptor in all cases , including those where the processing of the file causes an error .
This is in order to avoid a file descriptor leak , leading to the exhaustion of file descriptors .
Furthermore , the operation applied to a file may be defined by a function that was received as an argument , and we do n’t know precisely when or how it can fail ( but the caller in general will know ) .
We are thus often led to protect the body of the processing with “ finalization ” code , which must be executed just before the function returns , whether normally or exceptionally .
There is no built - in finalize construct try … finalize in the OCaml language , but it can be easily defined1 :
let try_finalize f x finally y = let res = try f x with exn -> finally y ; raise exn in finally y ; res
This function takes the main body f and the finalizer finally , each in the form of a function , and two parameters x and y , which are passed to their respective functions .
The body of the program f x is executed first , and its result is kept aside to be returned after the execution of the finalizer finally .
In case the program fails , i.e. raises an exception exn , the finalizer is run and the exception exn is raised again .
If both the main function and the finalizer fail , the finalizer ’s exception is raised ( one could choose to have the main function ’s exception raised instead ) .
Note
In the rest of this course , we use an auxiliary library Misc which contains several useful functions like try_finalize that are often used in the examples .
We will introduce them as they are needed .
To compile the examples of the course , the definitions of the Misc module need to be collected and compiled .
The Misc module also contains certain functions , added for illustration purposes , that will not be used in the course .
These simply enrich the Unix library , sometimes by redefining the behavior of certain functions .
The Misc module must thus take precedence over the Unix module .
Examples
The course provides numerous examples .
They can be compiled with OCaml , version 4.01.0 .
Some programs will have to be slightly modified in order to work with older versions .
There are two kinds of examples : “ library functions ” ( very general functions that can be reused ) and small applications .
It is important to distinguish between the two .
In the case of library functions , we want their context of use to be as general as possible .
We will thus carefully specify their interface and attentively treat all particular cases .
In the case of small applications , an error is often fatal and causes the program to stop executing .
It is sufficient to report the cause of an error , without needing to return to a consistent state , since the program is stopped immediately thereafter .

What really happened to Pat Tillman ?
A new film premiering at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday traces the search for answers about the death of the NFL safety - turned - Army ranger .
The film , “ The Tillman Story , ” charts the truth about the serviceman ’s journey and his mother ’s attempts to discover what really happened to her son .
After the army initially said Tillman died as a result of enemy combat in Afghanistan , an investigation revealed that Tillman ’s death was by friendly fire .
“ It ’s the truth about his death and the truth about his life , ” the film 's director Amir Bar - Lev tells POLITICO .
" From a political point of view , there are some very strong indications that all the way up the chain of command , the truth about how Pat Tillman died was discussed and suppressed . "
But unlike other Bush - bashing films , Bar - Lev says , the film goes farther and features interviews with Tillman ’s mother , Mary , his widow , his youngest brother and several soldiers in his platoon .
To drive home the point , the film features footage of when Mary Tillman , the soldier 's mother , testified before a congressional panel in 2007 .
" We have been asked over and over again , ' Well , what can we do for your family ?
How can we appease you ? ’
And it makes me sick , " Mary Tillman told the panel .
" It 's not about our family .
Our family will never be satisfied .
We 'll never have Pat back .
But what is so outrageous is this is n't about Pat .
This is about what they did to a nation . "
Still , Bar - Lev adds , “ We do n’t just point the finger at the Bush administration .
That ’s an easy scapegoat … and it ’s kind of like shooting fish in a barrel .
It ’s been done already . ”
Bar - Lev says the mainstream media helped push the image that Tillman did n’t have a sense of purpose until he joined the army in the days following the Sept. 11 attacks .
“ I would just say that the biggest myth is about Pat 's character and who Pat actually was , ” Bar - Lev says .
“ That message is at the heart of the film . ”
He credits the Tillman family for being “ more interested in the truth than a heroic glorious story . ”
After its premiere at Sundance , and following plans for a theatrical release , the film will eventually air on the A&E network .

A book published in January by Ronald Asmus titled " A Little War That Shook The World " suggests that former Vice President Dick Cheney pushed for the United States to engage in war with Russia in August of 2008 .
At the time , the White House was contemplating of possibly taking military action against Russia to prevent Georgian forces of being overtaken by Russian troops .
Georgia was and is a strong ally of the US and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili had been pushing for NATO membership .
“ The sheer scale of the Russian attack did lead several senior White House staffers to push for at least some consideration of limited military options to stem the Russian advance .
The menu of options under discussion foresaw the possibility of bombardment and sealing of the Roki Tunnel as well as other surgical strikes to reduce Russian military pressure on the Georgian government , ” wrote Asmus in his book .

Thirty - four movie studios today appealed a crucial Australian ruling which found that ISPs have no obligation to act on letters that allege copyright infringement by subscribers .
iiNet , the third - largest ISP in Australia , received tens of thousands of such notices , but its policy was to treat them all as mere allegations until a judge had ruled that " infringement " actually took place .
Disconnecting or otherwise sanctioning its own customers without this judicial oversight would essentially make the ISP a copyright cop — a notoriously tough job , and one that was outside the company 's realm of expertise .
A federal judge agreed , writing a 200 - page opinion on the case , but the studios have now appealed the ruling on 15 separate grounds .
At issue is Australian law , which ( like American law ) does require ISPs to take action against infringers in certain circumstances .
According to the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) , which represents the studios , the judge 's ruling means that ISPs get the benefits of " safe harbor " rules without having any corresponding duties .
" This decision allows iiNet to pay lip service to provisions that were designed to encourage ISPs to prevent copyright infringements in return for the safety the law provided , " said AFACT head Neil Gane in a statement today .
" If this decision stands , the ISPs have all the protection without any of the responsibility . "
The issue of what ISPs need to do in the " war on piracy " has been a contentious one around the world , with few ISPs willing to take action against customers without some form of legislative mandate or judicial decision .
The iiNet case will help to establish the limits to ISP responsibility under existing copyright law ; if the AFACT appeal fails , expect the copyright industries to seek a change in that law over the next few years .

KILLING GAMES
Japanese 's killings were so cruel , savage , their ways of killing are beyond human imagination .
They took killing people as a game .
For instance , once , Japanese invaders tied up more than one thousand refugees from several places in a square , and made them stand in rows .
Some of them wore long robes , some wore suits , some were women , some were children , all bare - feeted .
Japanese first sprayed gasoline on their body , and then shot them with machine guns , a big fire set off whenever a person was shot .
Dying refugees being shot and burnt , their body shivered in pain , it was a field of flickering flames .
Japanese invaders laughed wildly , took great pleasure in it .
( see : NanJing historical documents archive , Interview with Liu RouYuan who escaped to HuNan from NanJing , " Massacres in the Occupied areas " , Vol. 5 )
Some Japanese soldiers took scores of refugees to a pond , forced them to take off their clothes and broke the ice to " catch fish " , they froze to death immediately .
Some resisted and were shot right at the spot , and then thrown into the pond .
Japanese soldiers hang a young man for no reason at all with wire , and put dry wood below them , bake him slowly .
After half of his body burned black , the Japanese soldiers left , shouting wild .
One day , Japanese soldiers set a store on TaiPing avenue on fire and then forced the clerks to fight the fire .
When people were fighting th fire , Japanese tied some the clerks and threw them into the fire and burnt them alive .
On another day , some Japanese soldiers tied the hands and feet of some refugees and threw them into a shallow pond , then the Japanese threw grenades , blood and flesh flew all over , the Japanese laughed wild .
In an other occasion , Japanese forced several hundred POWs to climb to the roof of the Department of Justice building , some knew they would definitely die , jumped off and died .
Others climbed to the roof , Japanese then set fire from below , the POWs could not get down and cried painfully in the fire .
In another occasion , several Japanese soldiers broke into a store and captured a young man , they forced him to take off his clothes .
Then they poured nitric acid down from the top of his head , his body eroded right away .
The young man shouted curses in anger in order to die fast .
Japanese soldiers then followed him , shouting and making fun of him , until he died .
Some Japanese gathered several hundred POWs together , scooped out their eye balls , cut off their ears and noses and then burned them alive .
Even more savage , a group of Japanese soldiers gang raped a middle - aged lady , later they learned that the lady was pregnant , so they cut open the lady and took out the fetus .
They took the fetus as a toy and played in the streets , met with a Japanese officer , they wavered the fetus on their bayonets to the officer , the officer returned a smile .
The brutal killing game like this , who knows how many happened .
Hundreds ?
Thousands ?

wait , can planets reproduce by budding ?
A new eye - catching proposal suggests that the Moon was spun off from Earth instead of being formed in the aftermath of a collision .
Well , according to a paper by a physicist and a geologist who propose that a bubble of molten heavy metals was ejected from a young Earth after a nuclear meltdown within its innards and formed the Moon , they could .
Forget the notion of a wandering world plowing into our planet and ejecting the material which would become our natural satellite , even though we have evidence that collisions happen in young solar systems .
Imagine a spheroid of molten rock wildly spinning around its axis .
As molten uranium and thorium churn close to what would be its equatorial plane , they trigger a runaway nuclear reaction until a planetary meltdown belches out a plume which cools into the Moon .
Okay , I ’m sure they have a reason to reject the mainstream consensus …
Let ’s think back to the impact theory .
When an object delivers a glancing blow to the young Earth , it sends our planet whirling around its axis , and as it does , a spray of superheated rock is shot where the Moon will form .
But apparently , there ’s a problem with this scenario and for the authors , the proposed solution to this problem just is n’t good enough , which is why they resurrected the fission spin - off hypothesis from its slumber .
Models suggest that around 80 % of the Moon ’s make up should ’ve come from the impacting planet .
However , it has a lot more in common with the Earth in terms of composition .
The current explanation is the mixing of the rocks right after the impact , while the proto -Moon was still molten and coalescing .
But to Rob de Meijer and Wim van Westrenen , this seems a little too convenient .
Instead , they argue that the chances of a close match between our planet and an alien world at the dawn of the solar system is highly unlikely , especially in the levels of such heavy elements as uranium , chromium , neodymium and tungsten .
Now , having the Moon spun out of a proto - Earth would account for the similarity in their composition , but you ’d need a rather bizarre arrangement for this to happen .
Our young planet would need to be very distorted , twice as wide around its equator as it would be around its poles .
A day on this planet would be only 2 hours and 18 minutes long .
There does n’t seem to be any proof this would happen and the only supporting evidence used by de Meijer and van Westrenen is math showing the energy and momentum of their hypothetical early Earth and the newly formed two body system , and the similarities between rocks on the Moon and Earth rock with a few traces of the key elements they say will clinch the case .
Well , assuming of course that planets in a similar range of orbits can’t form from very similar elements and have a similar composition that could mix in the kind of blast thought to have created the Moon , a concept that ’s oddly missing from their paper .
And that ’s the big problem with de Meijer and van Westrenen ’s proposal .
It seems very over - thought and uses a 150 year old idea formed when we had no proof of planetary collisions instead of trying to work out if planets coalescing from similar materials could have a similar composition and to what degree before slamming on the brakes and starting from scratch on a proposal that would be incredibly difficult to prove .
And considering that we already have an example of planetary collisions , it seems like an awfully big step back to reconsider a concept from the Victorian era just to start the whole scientific process from scratch …

Exclusive : Navy to Lift Ban on Women Serving Aboard Submarines Women to serve on subs if 30 - day Congressional comment occurs without incident .
Feb. 23 , 2010  --
Women are a big step closer to serving on U.S. Navy submarines .
ABC News has learned that the Navy has decided to lift the ban on female submarine crew members .
Subs are one of the last places in the military from which women are excluded .
The only potential roadblock remaining is for both house of Congress to pass legislation specifically barring the policy change during the 30 working day window for congressional comment that began Monday .
A Defense Department official tells ABC News that the civilian Secretary of the Navy , Ray Mabus , and the Chief of Naval Operations , Adm. Gary Roughead , support lifting the ban .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates signed a letter last Friday notifying Congress of the Navy 's policy change .
The 30 - day window for congressional comment began when Gates ' letter was delivered to Capitol Hill .
Through a spokesperson , Mabus said he " believes it 's a great idea and the right thing to do .
He fully supports the assignment of women to submarines . "
" The Secretary supports the Navy decision , " said Geoff Morrell , Gates ' spokesman .
" The Chairman fully supports it , " said Capt .
John Kirby , spokesman for Adm. Mike Mullen , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
But even if Congress goes along , it will be at least a year and a half before a woman is able to serve on a U.S. submarine .
The Navy plans to phase women onto submarine crews gradually , and the first to serve will be officers .
Submarine officers must complete more than a year of " nuclear school " before being assigned to a " boat . "
A Defense Department official tells ABC
News the hope is that 12 to 18 ROTC or Naval Academy graduates will enter submarine training .
Women started serving aboard Naval surface warships back in 1993 .
The Navy said hey have been barred from submarines partly because of the close quarters and limited sleeping areas .
But Naval officials and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs have said the time has come to " broaden opportunities for women . "
The Navy put together the details of how it will move forward .
Since officers are already separated from enlisted personnel on a submarine , Naval officials say they can accommodate female officers first .
But no money has been set aside to retrofit sleeping areas or bathrooms for enlisted sailors in any submarines in service .
Normal sub deployments can last up to 7 months .
Women on Submarines : Restrictions to Apply
The Defense Department official also says women will not be allowed to serve alone .
There would always be at least two women on board .
There are discussions about having female junior officers bunk with an experienced female officer , who could act as a mentor .
Restrictions on pregnant women will be the same as those who serve on surface vessels .
The Navy hopes to start the inclusion of women on its larger submarines , which already have separate quarters .
Smaller Virginia class attack subs may be reconfigured later during scheduled maintenance .
The timing of the order comes as graduating seniors at the academy and in ROTC programs have to decide which path they want to take in the Navy .
Officials say it is possible that one of the first women to take up the Navy 's offer , if approved by Congress , could be in command of a submarine in 17 - 18 years .
Blame it on Scott Brown .
Blame it on poll numbers which all seem to be shifting in one direction .
Hell , maybe we should blame it on Rio .
Whatever the reason , President Obama took the hopefully productive step of visiting with Republican legislators this week .
While there were a few tense , testy and factually challenged moments , the conversation seemed engaging and ideas were floated where some common ground might be found between the President ’s agenda and the goals of Republicans in a variety of areas .
While it ’s far too early to get our hopes up , we might just see some progress out of this .
The event elicited some awfully strange responses , though .
What should have been seen as a potential moment of true bipartisan efforts and possible progress got some of the Democratic Party ’s most ardent supporters up in arms .
Leading the charge was Washington Monthly ’s Steve Benen , who seems to think the entire affair was more posturing and that the Republicans are locked into a self - destructive cycle .
It ’s one thing for party officials just outside the decision - making center to raise concerns ; it ’s something else when someone with actual power and direct influence shares those concerns .
And at this point , Republicans realize that they ’re taking obstructionism to levels unprecedented in American history , and they realize that the public may disapprove , but they ’re willing to take the risk .
I ’ll be the first to agree that the GOP has done a pretty effective job of holding ranks against proposals which run absolutely counter to essential conservative principles , but did Steve really just try to describe this as obstructionism which is “ unprecedented in American history ? ”
While our history goes back a couple of centuries or more , we need not look all that far .
I mean , we ’re talking about the same Democratic Party which held up elements of the Bush 2 administration ’s goals to the point where Republicans were foolishly talking about a nuclear option .
It ’s the same party that broke with centuries of standard – if flawed – practice and began calling five minute legislative sessions into order on a weekly basis to prevent the President from making recess appointments .
( I would like to parenthetically point out here that I oppose the practice of recess appointments entirely in the modern age , and would frankly like to see a constitutional amendment to eliminate the practice .
But the larger point here is that , flawed though the practice may be , it is the constitutionally mandated practice which has been in place since the nation began and the Democrats were most certainly acting in an “ unprecedented ” way to thwart it . )
Quibbling over recent history aside , Benen ’s commentary brings us back full circle to the bogus but oft repeated charges made by Democrats and their obedient MSM surrogates that the Republicans “ have no ideas ” on the issues of the day and are n’t trying to participate .
Health care is only the latest example .
As we have pointed out in this space on multiple occasions ( apparently to deaf ears ) the GOP ’s Paul Ryan introduced his own health care reform bill last year and has recently brought it forward once again .
There are elements in there which both parties could agree on if they wanted to start over with a leaner , more efficient reform package .
It seems to me that Obama is a good enough politician that he can read the writing on the wall .
He ’s going to have to start dealing with a significantly more powerful Republican force in Congress next year and seems to be laying the groundwork to get something done .
Smart for the Republicans .
Smart for Obama .
The problem is , a lot of the President ’s most liberal supporters are clearly having a hard time coping with the idea of both parties having some input to the governmental process .
They ’ll come along kicking and screaming sooner or later , but for now it ’s going to remain The Audacity of Cope .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama announced $ 8.3 billion in loan guarantees Tuesday to build the first U.S. nuclear power plant in nearly three decades , a move designed to help advance climate legislation in Congress .
Obama , a Democrat trying to win Republican support for a bill to overhaul U.S. energy practices , said the United States needed to increase its supply of nuclear power to meet its energy needs and fight climate change .
The government backing will go to help Southern Co build two reactors at a plant in the state of Georgia .
The reactors , which some experts estimate will cost $ 8.8 billion , could be in service in 2016 and 2017 .
“ Even though we ’ve not broken ground on a ... new nuclear power plant in 30 years , nuclear energy remains our largest source of fuel that produces no carbon emissions , ” Obama said after touring a union education center in Lanham , Maryland .
“ To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change , we ’ll need to increase our supply of nuclear power .
It ’s that simple . ”
Obama is pushing for a law that would cap greenhouse gas emissions from industry and expand the use of renewable fuel sources such as wind and solar .
By reaching out to Republicans on the nuclear issue -- a top priority for key opposition lawmakers such as former presidential candidate John McCain -- the Obama administration hopes support for the stalled climate bill will grow .
That hope may not come to fruition .
Republicans are eager to expand nuclear power and offshore drilling but are resistant to Obama ’s proposal for a greenhouse gas emissions trading system similar to the European Union’s .
Still , aid to the nuclear industry could draw support for the climate bill from states in the South and Midwest with huge utility companies that run plants on both nuclear and coal .
Obama said the climate bill , which contains a cap - and - trade system , would help create incentives for cleaner fuels such as nuclear .
He said his administration would work to develop what he saw as common ground on the bill with Republicans .
“ We ’re not going to achieve a big boost in nuclear capacity unless we also create a system of incentives to make clean energy profitable , ” Obama said .
“ As long as producing carbon pollution carries no cost , traditional plants that use fossil fuels will be more cost - effective than plants that use nuclear fuel . ”
Shares in Southern Co surged 2.28 percent on the news of the loan guarantees .
The Atlanta - based company has one of the largest number of coal - fired power plants in the United States and would suffer if Washington were to institute restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions .
Nuclear power generating companies also rose on the news , with Exelon Corp up 2.08 percent and Entergy up 1.85 percent .
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven
Chu said the department plans to offer loan guarantees to at least half a dozen projects but declined to lay out a timeframe for further announcements .

EPA FIGHT GETS UGLY
Democrats and opposition Republicans are at odds over several aspects of how to fight climate change .
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is spearheading legislation that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency having the power to regulate greenhouse gases -- an option Obama is preserving if Congress does not act .
Other entities -- including Texas , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Iron and Steel Institute -- are initiating legal challenges to stop the EPA from acting unilaterally on greenhouse emissions .
Carol Browner , Obama ’s top energy and climate advisor , said the White House would oppose any move to limit the EPA ’s regulatory authority .
“ We will work against that .
We do not want to see that passed , ” she told Reuters Insider in an interview .
Expanding nuclear energy is one area Obama and Republicans have embraced as a way to generate power and create jobs .
The administration said the project would generate 3,500 construction jobs and 800 permanent positions once the reactors go into operation .
Supporters of nuclear power argue more reactors will be needed for the United States to tackle global warming effectively because nuclear is a much cleaner energy source than coal - fired power plants , which spew greenhouse gases .
But nuclear power is controversial because of its radioactive waste , which is now stored on site at reactor locations around the country .
Remembering the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania , many Americans still harbor concerns about nuclear power ’s safety .
Obama said a commission with Republican and Democratic leaders and nuclear experts was examining the waste issue .
Some environmental groups also fret that too much effort is being spent on costly , old technology instead of renewable energy sources .
“ Unfortunately , the president is setting up the American taxpayer for the next corporate bailout , ” said Jim Riccio , nuclear policy analyst for Greenpeace , saying the Congressional Budget Office has already determined the loans stand a greater than 50 percent chance of default .
India to create new southern state of Telengana
There have been protests in Andhra Pradesh for many days
The Indian government is to allow a new state to be carved out of part of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh .
Home Minister P Chidambaram said the process of forming Telangana state would begin soon .
Campaigners say the region has long been neglected .
Supporters of the state are celebrating after days of violent protests .
One of their leaders ended a hunger strike .
But many in India fear acceding to the protesters ' wishes could fuel demands for other new states across India .
India 's ' Tiger of Telangana ' feted Biswas : New states needed ?
Dozens of Andhra Pradesh assembly members and at least one Indian MP with a seat in the state have announced they are resigning in protest at the move .
Analysts say the flurry of resignations , mostly from the governing Congress party , could lead to a political crisis in Andhra Pradesh .
Correspondents say Telangana state is likely to include one of India 's major software hubs , Hyderabad .
The city , currently the Andhra Pradesh capital , is home to leading world companies in India like Microsoft and Google .
The government announcement came at midnight on Wednesday .
" The process of forming the state of Telangana will be initiated .
An appropriate resolution will be moved in the state assembly , " Mr Chidambaram said after talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi .
ANALYSIS Sanjoy Majumder
BBC News , Delhi Many are concerned that the move may open a Pandora 's box .
They fear that this will only fuel similar movements in other states and end up significantly redrawing the map of the country .
Already one member of parliament from Andhra Pradesh has resigned in protest over the decision to create Telangana .
The government appears to have given into the demands of protesters , particularly after the leader of the campaign became dangerously ill following a hunger strike to press home his point .
It 's clear this is not the last that has been heard on this volatile issue .
On hearing the news , crowds in Hyderabad and nine other districts of Telangana erupted in celebration , reports the BBC's Omer Farooq in the state capital .
Mr Chidambaram said the government had asked for court cases against leaders , students and others " associated with the present agitation " to be dropped .
He also appealed to protesters to call off their demonstrations .
His announcement was greeted with jubilation among protesters , who let off fire crackers , beat drums , danced and sang songs .
Some of the celebrations took place outside the Hyderabad hospital where one of the campaign leaders , K Chandrasekara Rao of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti ( TRS ) party , had been admitted during his fast .
Mr Rao said : " I am happy that this is the victory of 35 million people who live in the Telangana region . "
Protest rallies seeking a separate state planned for Thursday were called off .
Thousands of police had been deployed for the rallies , but after Mr Chidambaram 's announcement security was relaxed , our correspondent says .
Long campaign Telangana region is spread over 10 northern districts of Andhra Pradesh .
INDIA'S NEWEST STATE Population of 35 million Formed from 10 districts of Andhra Pradesh , including city of Hyderabad Landlocked , predominantly agricultural area
One of the most under - developed regions in India Culmination of 50 - year campaign
More than 400 people died in 1969 crackdown
The demand for separate state status for the underdeveloped and drought - prone area dates back 50 years .
More than 400 people died in violence over the demand for a Telangana state in 1969 .
Campaigners say Telangana 's economic development has been neglected in favour of the richer and more powerful Andhra region - and that a new state is the only solution .
The last three new states in India were formed in 2000 : Chhattisgarh was created out of eastern Madhya Pradesh ; Uttarakhand was created out of the hilly areas of northern Uttar Pradesh , and Jharkhand was carved from Bihar 's southern districts .
India currently has 28 states .

Meet Sinosauropteryx , a very spiky little dinosaur .
A team of scientists from China and the UK has now revealed that the bristles of this 125 - million - year - old dinosaur were in fact ginger - coloured feathers .
The researchers say that the diminutive carnivore had a " Mohican " of feathers running along its head and back .
It also had a striped tail .
The team revealed details of the dinosaur 's coloured feathers in an article published on Nature 's website .
The team began by studying the fossilised remains of a bird , Confuciusornis , which also lived during the early cretaceous period .
Confuciusornis ' feathers were preserved in extraordinarily complete fossils that were recently discovered in northern China .
Using a powerful electron microscope to look inside the feathers , researchers were able to see microscopic structures called melanosomes , which , in life , contain the pigment melanin .
Differently shaped melanosomes contain differently coloured pigments
" Melanin is what gives colour to human hair and animal fur , " said Professor Mike Benton from the University of Bristol , UK , who led this study .
" They are also the most common way that colours are [ produced ] in feathers . "
Professor Benton explained that differently shaped melanosomes produced different colours , with blacks or greys produced by " sausage - shaped " melanosomes , and reddish or " russet " shades found in spherical ones .
" A ginger - haired person would have more spherical melanosomes , and a black - haired or grey - haired person would have more of the sausage - shaped structures , " said Professor Benton .
The scientists found both types of melanosome in Confuciusornis and decided to turn their attention to Sinosauropteryx , which is the most primitive feathered dinosaur yet found .
The bristles that are visible in the fossils were coloured feathers
It was about the size of a turkey and would have fed on lizards and other small prey .
" There 's a very clear rim of feathers running down the top of its head like a Mohican , all the way along its back , " Professor Benton described .
Bands of dark and light along the tail can be seen in the fossils .
This close examination has shown that the dinosaur 's " Mohican " was russet or ginger - coloured , and that these bands were in fact ginger and white stripes .
" This is the first time anyone has ever had evidence of original colour of feathers in dinosaurs , " said Professor Benton .
He said the study has also confirmed that the bristles on this " rather primitive flesh - eating dinosaur ... really were feathers " .
This gives more weight to a very well - supported theory that modern birds evolved from theropods , the group of small carnivorous dinosaurs to which Sinosauropteryx belonged .
" Critics have said that these visible spiny structures could be shredded connective tissue , " Professor Benton explained .
" But the discovery of melanosomes within the bristles finally proves that some early dinosaurs were indeed feathered . "
The findings also help to resolve a long - standing debate about the evolution and original function of feathers .
" We now know that feathers did not originate as flight structures , " said Professor Benton .
This suggests that they evolved , initially , for insulation and perhaps for display .
Feathers could have evolved for insulation or display Dr Richard Butler , a palaeontologist at the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontology , in Munich , Germany , said this was a " fascinating and exciting discovery with important implications for understanding dinosaur evolution and biology " .
Dr Butler , who was not involved in this research , told BBC News : " When people ask how we know what colour dinosaurs were , the answer has always been that we make an educated guess .
" This discovery suggests that with more work we may be able to accurately reconstruct colour patterns in some dinosaur species , and begin to understand how those colour patterns may have functioned for camouflage or display . "

The sounds of crickets courting and flies flying familiar to many of us , but have you heard a rice weevil larva eating inside a wheat kernel , a termite cutting a piece of wood , or a grub chewing on a root ?
Modern insect detection and control technology makes use of these subtle signals , sampled below .
Most of the sound files in the several pages of this library were selected from noise - free sections of recorded signal , but you can hear some typical background noises mixed with insect sounds at I below .
The insect sounds have higher frequencies and shorter durations that make them relatively easy to separate from background ( see discussion in ) .
Several different methods have been developed to identify sounds of particular insect species , and at least one author ( ) has tested a method against multiple signals below .

Geologists say the seabed around the Falklands has substantial oil reserves Argentina has announced new controls on ships passing through its waters to the Falkland Islands in a growing dispute over British oil drilling plans .
A permit will now be needed by ships using Argentine waters en route to the Falklands , South Georgia or the South Sandwich Islands - all UK controlled .
Argentina has protested to the UK about oil exploration due to begin next week .
The UK Foreign Office said the Falkland Islands ' waters were controlled by its authorities and would not be affected .
' Pathetic and useless ' Buenos Aires claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands , which it calls Islas Malvinas .
It has previously threatened that any company exploring for oil and gas in the waters around the territory will not be allowed to operate in Argentina .
On Tuesday , Argentine President Cristina Fernandez signed a decree requiring all vessels travelling between Argentina and the islands , or those that want to cross Argentine territorial waters en route to the Falklands , to seek prior permission .
Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said the decree sought to achieve " not only a defence of Argentine sovereignty but also of all the resources " in the area .
Last week , a ship carrying drilling equipment was detained by Argentine officials .
While , of course , Argentina is free to do what it wants in its territorial waters , I do n't think they have any right to interfere in ours

Falklands ' Legislative Assembly
Q&A : The Falklands oil row Have Your Say : How serious is row ?
But a drilling rig from the Scottish highlands , the Ocean Guardian , is nearing the islands and due to start drilling next week , the UK - based company Desire Petroleum has said .
However , a spokesman for the company declined to comment on the growing dispute between the UK and Argentina over oil and gas exploration .
Chairman of the Parliamentary all - party Falklands group , Sir Nicholas Winterton , said the Argentine decree was " pathetic and useless " and designed simply to try to impede the economic progress of the islands .
He said he would seek a meeting with senior Foreign Office officials to discuss the issue next week .
BBC world affairs correspondent Peter Biles said Argentine anger over the issue had been " brewing for a while " .
He said : " The sabre - rattling over oil in the South Atlantic is just the latest episode in a dispute that 's remained unresolved since the Falklands War nearly 28 years ago . "
Ocean expanse
He told BBC Radio 5 live he did not think events would escalate " at this stage " but uncertainty remained over what the Argentines regarded as their territorial waters .
After Argentina 's invasion of the Falklands in 1982 , a UK taskforce seized back control in a short war that claimed the lives of 649 Argentine and 255 British troops .
The waters surrounding the disputed islands are considered by the UK as part of the British Overseas Territories .

UK Foreign Office statement But Buenos Aires believes the UK is illegally occupying the Falklands , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands .
Last year it submitted a claim to the United Nations for a vast expanse of ocean , based on research into the extent of the continental shelf , stretching to the Antarctic and including the island chains governed by Britain .
Jan Cheek , a member of the Falklands ' Legislative Assembly , told BBC Radio 5 live the new controls were part of a " continuing irritation for us " .
" While , of course , Argentina is free to do what it wants in its territorial waters , I do n't think they have any right to interfere in ours , " she said .
She added Argentina had in the past " interfered " by refusing charter flights heading to the Falklands through its air space , and stopping fishing and cargo vessels .
" It 's more of the same and we come to expect it when Argentina 's government are experiencing difficulties at home .
We 're a very convenient distraction . "
A UK Foreign Office statement said : " Regulations governing Argentine territorial waters are a matter for the Argentine authorities .
" This does not affect Falkland Islands territorial waters which are controlled by the island authorities . "
It added that the UK and Argentina were " important partners " with a " close and productive relationship " .
" We want , and have offered , to co-operate on South Atlantic issues .
We will work to develop this relationship further , " the statement said .
Geologists think the South Atlantic ocean bed surrounding the Falklands could contain rich energy reserves .

Hello World !
It ’s been a long time since I last wrote anything here , and for that I ’m sorry .
The autumn was consumed by university work , and the last few weeks I ’ve been discreetly coding and writing to get everything ready for this announcement .
Anyway , without further irrelevance , let me present the KDE Real - time Communication and Collaboration Project .
You ’ve probably heard me blathering about Telepathy before , but now for the first time we have a coherent plan for world domination , concocted by Abner Silva , Matt Rogers and myself ( with help from many other people ) .
Let me briefly introduce the project and our aims :
Fully integrate real - time communication ( think VoIP , IM , Video etc ) into the KDE Plasma Workspace ( do I have the branding correct ? )
Provide a fully - featured Telepathy - based real - time communication experience in the KDE SC .
( loving the double - barreled words )
Provide infrastructure for collaborative features in KDE SC applications .
So , if any of this interests you , we ’d love your help .
Hop in to #kde - telepathy on freenode IRC , or join our mailing list .
And , while you ’re at it , why not take a look at our code so far .
The Code So Far …
Warning : this is highly experimental code which may cause all kinds of side effects , especially the Nepomuk related stuff , which is likely to make a complete mess of your Nepomuk database , so use with care .
If you ’ve read the above warning and want to take a look at what we ’ve done so far , here are some instructions .
For the first phase of this project , our attentions are focused on building Telepathy based components for basic IM usage on top of the existing Kopete codebase .
So far , you can create an account ( Jabber is the only kind tested , so expect minor bugs with other protocols ) , set its presence and see a list of your contacts .
Not the most exciting stuff ever , but with this core stuff in place , more features should arrive very soon .
Prerequisites
You need recent telepathy - mission - control - 5 , telepathy - gabble and telepathy - qt4 .
Best to install these from your distribution .
If telepathy - qt4 is not provided , or older than 0.2.0 , then download the source here .
The Account Management GUI
Checkout and build the account management gui from svn here :
svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/network/telepathy-accounts-kcm
Also install its plugins from
svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/network/telepathy-accounts-kcm-plugins
You can launch it by running :
kcmshell4 kcm_telepathy_accounts
And then follow the wizard to set up your Jabber account .
Setting the Account Presence
To set the account presence through a GUI ( ie. bring the account on / offline ) , you will need the presence plasma dataengine and applet , available again from svn :
svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/base/plasma/applets/presence
svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/base/plasma/dataengines/presence
You can then add the applet to your Plasma workspace and use it to bring the account (s ) created with the GUI in the previous section on / offline .
Nepomuk Integration
Your contact list is integrated into Nepomuk by means of the telepathy - integration - daemon .
Best to install it and launch it before bringing any accounts online .
Code , again is in svn .
svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/network/telepathy-integration-daemon
You can run it by calling telepathy - integration - daemon on the command line .
Contact List App
Finally , in order to see our contact list , we need a contact list app installed .
Currently , this is in the very early stages of development , but you can at least see a list of contacts in it ( although you ca n’t interact with that list yet ) .
Source code is at :
svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/network/telepathy-contactlist ( corrected )
and you can run it by calling telepathy_contactlist_prototype on a command line .
If you like what you see or have any problems with getting it working , come talk to us in # kde - telepathy .
We ’re very happy to help out 🙂
Gmail users will soon have more ways to keep up with their friends via a widget that shows quick status updates like Facebook and Twitter do , The Wall Street Journal reports .
The move would further turn Gmail , which revolutionized online e-mail , into a comprehensive communications hub .
The intent is to keep people 's attention centered on Google , by making Gmail , not Facebook , people 's first stop online – and their default place to send and receive messages .
Gmail users can already chat via Jabber or AIM , make video calls , and send SMS messages from Gmail 's web interface .
As the Post reports :
Google has been trying to fashion Gmail into more than an e-mail service for years .
The service currently lets users set an " away message , " which can be a link to a Web page , that their friends see when they instant - message them .
Now , it plans to launch a new interface that will aggregate updates from more friends in a stream .
The new stream will also eventually include content that a user 's connections share through its YouTube video site and Picasa photo service , according to one person familiar with the matter .
But whether those features will also be announced in the coming days remains unclear .
The full extent of the new features remain unclear , but Google is inviting reporters to a launch event Tuesday on its Mountain View , California , campus promising " some innovations in two of our most popular products , " according to an e-mail sent to reporters .
Yahoo has included similar features in its e-mail service , letting users see what photos their contacts have uploaded to Flickr , for example .
Google could integrate updates from a user 's Twitter account , since most of that is public .
And it could likely make it easy for Gmail users to post to Twitter as well , due to Twitter 's liberal API policy .
Facebook , however , will not likely let its rival re-publish status updates , or allow users to publish to their Facebook pages through Gmail .
Facebook , much like AOL and Compuserve back in the early ' 90s , is a controlled and sanitized version of the larger internet , but it relies on closed protocols .

Southwest is now claiming it will review its " Customer of Size " policy in response to Kevin Smith 's criticism .
But will anything really change ?
Advertisement
Southwest 's first blog post about its decision that Smith was " too fat to fly " was n't especially apologetic , closing with " If a Customer cannot comfortably lower the armrest and infringes on a portion of another seat , a Customer seated adjacent would be very uncomfortable and a timely exit from the aircraft in the event of an emergency might be compromised if we allow a cramped , restricted seating arrangement . "
But on Monday , a post by Linda Rutherford sang a slightly different tune .
Rutherford wrote , in part ,
Although I 'm not here to debate the decision our Employees made , I can tell you that I for one have learned a lot today .
The communication among our Employees was not as sharp as it should have been and , it 's apparent that Southwest could have handled this situation differently . [...]
Southwest , like most carriers , has a policy to assist passengers who need two seats onboard an aircraft .
The policy is an important one for the comfort and safety of all passengers aboard a plane , and we stand by that 25 - year - old policy .
This has our attention , and we will be reviewing how and when this delicate policy is implemented .
Advertisement
So , uh , mistakes were made ?
And also Southwest " stands by " ( perhaps a poor choice of words ) its policy , but is planning to " review " it ?
Is this all just empty rhetoric , or might Southwest actually implement a just and non-humiliating way for fat people to fly ?
According to Justin Bachman of BusinessWeek 's Traveler 's Check blog , probably the former .
Bachman writes that as Americans get bigger , airlines could " change the seating configuration of the typical domestic airplane from a 3x3 seating to one that has two seats on each side , or maybe a 3x2 . "
But they probably wo n't .
He explains :
Such scenarios are not realistic , since the whole point of an airplane is revenue generation and the dictum that more seats equals more money .
Passenger size is not a factor .
Will it ever be ?
In all likelihood , not for quite some time , if ever , says Greg Powell , a vice president at BE Aerospace , the Florida company that makes the seats for Southwest 's 737 fleet .
Airlines are not clamoring for wider seats – just lighter ones , to reduce fuel burn .
That 's why modern airplane seats have become notably thinner in recent years but seat width has not kept pace with that of Americans ' .

Kate Harding responded to Southwest 's initial " cramped , restricted seating arrangement comment thusly : " ' If we allowed a cramped , restricted seating arrangement ?
Because ' The Greyhound of the Skies ' is positively roomy when there are no fat people on board ? ' "
The truth is , airlines have effectively shifted the blame to fat people for their policy of cramming as many people as possible onto planes with no regard for their comfort .
And as one commenter on Traveler 's Check pointed out , this is n't just a problem for " Customers of Size , " unless " size " means " over 5 ' 5 " . "
Bob writes ,
I work for an airline and have since the 1980's .
I 'm also a big guy .
Not obese but tall and wide .
I 'd probably get fired for saying this , but my own airlines is very uncomfortable for anyone over 5 5 and 160 pounds .
And if you try to use a laptop and someone has reclined in front of you , forget it .
And if someone has a kid in their lap , it is insane .
Do n't frame this like it 's just a fat issue .
I 'm not fat and I 'd love to see more space mandated .
I want to work on a plane , and can't .
I practically have to fold myself in .
I 've worked for the airlines business and traveled a lot and let me tell you , seats and space has gotten smaller in the last twenty years .
It 's not all about people getting fat .
Almost no one who is a journalist has mentioned this , yet considering if they 've traveled and over 35 , they have to know .
Advertisement
" Customers of Size " policies are actually an enormous PR victory for airlines , making customers believe that their lack of personal space is due to the fatness of their seatmates and not to the actions of companies that consistently provide one of the worst services in existence ( would we tolerate anywhere else the indignity and discomfort we pay through the nose for in the air ? ) .
This works because America 's fat - phobia is so entrenched that even when airlines shrink seats , overbook flights , and generally dicks us around in every way , plenty of people will still say " perhaps one should be penalized for being overweight " and not " perhaps companies should be penalized for a shitty product . "
Maybe Kevin Smith 's ordeal will bring some attention to the problem .
But sadly , things probably wo n't change until customers recognize that they 're all being screwed — and until an airline steps up to offer a reasonable alternative .

' Stewart 's best lines , most effective arguments , and most convincing evidence ' never shown to Fox audience
Gawker compiles video collection of best unaired clips ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/5/2010 , 3:42 pm PT
If you watched the two separate nights over which Bill O'Reilly cut up his O'Reilly Factor interview with Jon Stewart on Fox " News " this week , as we did , you probably found that both nights fell surprisingly flat , given that Stewart , at least , usually offers a reason to make these things " must watch " moments .
Well , there 's a reason it fell flat , as noted by Gawker today , O'Reilly cut out most of the best stuff ...
Fox News has generously placed the full , unedited conversation between Bill O'Reilly and Jon Stewart online , so we can see precisely how unfairly and deviously Fox edited the interview in order to weaken Stewart 's case : A lot !
Last night on his show - Part Two of a ludicrously overhyped " faceoff " between O'Reilly and Stewart in which Stewart attempted , among other things , to present a critique of Fox as a fear - mongering GOP messaging operation - O'Reilly boasted that his edit of their 42 - minute interview for broadcast was " a fair cut " and invited viewers to have a look at the unedited version online to judge for themselves : " Some of these idiots in the press who hate us , ' O ' Reilly cut the interview to make Stewart look ' - OK , all of that is bull .
It 's a fair cut .
And then when you watch the cut and watch the whole interview you 'll see it . "
So we took him up on the offer , and guess what ?
If by " fair cut " O'Reilly means " cut in a manner that left some of Stewart 's best lines , most effective arguments , and most convincing evidence out of the interview and hidden from the broadcast audience , " then he 's absolutely right .
Gawker 's selection of some of the best video that never made air --- along with descriptions of how some of them were cleverly gutted before making it onto air --- is posted right here .
Now they 've got the " must watch " stuff .
Really .
And all of it , far more entertaining and interesting and challenging than what actually made it onto O'Reilly 's air .
Go figure .
Two federal lawsuits each seek more than $ 10 million on behalf of two 12 - year - old boys who allege a Kankakee police officer shocked them with a stun gun during an in - school demonstration .
The lawsuits were filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Urbana .
Police officials in Kankakee placed the officer on administrative leave after he allegedly used a stun gun on students Tuesday as part of an unauthorized demonstration of the device at Kankakee Junior High School .
The lawsuits name the police officer , the city of Kankakee , Kankakee School District 111 and two teachers .
The boys ' attorney , James Rowe , says they also want the officer -- identified in the suit as Lonnie Netzel -- fired and criminal charges filed in the case .
Teachers Teresa LaReau and Jessica Labon are also named .
Rowe alleges that the shockings were racially motivated .
" Shocking two 12 - year - olds with a taser gun for no reason is reprehensible and criminal , " said James Rowe , the lawyer representing Alta Young and Stella Bender , the boys ' mothers , in a statement .
" This was abuse , and it was perpetrated upon students of color and only students of color . "
Another mother , who asked to remain anonymous because she did n't want her son to suffer a backlash from the school district , said her 12 - year - old son witnessed the incident and that it occured in a special needs classroom for learning and behaviorally challenged children .
" All the children in the class have some sort of learning or behavior disorder , " the concerned parent said .
" My son has Tramatic Brain Injury , if that gives you an example of what the makeup of the kids are in that class . "
The Kankakee school district has not confirmed this information .
She said her son told her that the first boy screamed and said , " why did you do that ? "
The officer responded : " You volunteered . "
The second boy fell down over a chair and the third boy laughed .
" Now my son is scared of police officers . "
The Netzel allegedly Tased a few students in the finger a week earlier , and allegedly has a history of intimidation .
He is a 19 - year - veteran of the Kankaee police force who has worked as a school - resources officer for years .
In one of the more gruesome incidents detailed in the lawsuit , Netzel allegedly laid out sheets of newspaper and asked a boy to sit on it before being Tased , in case he defecated or urinated .
Kankakee School District 11 Superintendent Colleen Lange said in a statement that the school board is conducting a full investigation into the alleged incident .
The design and implementation of programming languages fascinates me .
A programming language enables a text file to both accurately communicate to another person a problem ’s solution and control a computer ’s execution .
The influence a language ’s feature set has on the way a programmer thinks about problems and their solutions is an endlessly captivating idea .
The world of programming languages is amazing .
I ’m particularly interested in implementing higher - level languages in lower - level languages .
I think I was attracted to Math in school because the construction of new ideas based on a small set of axioms seems like good , clear thinking .
Building up to a high - level programming language from below has the same appeal for me .
This article may be the first of many recording the scratching of an itch that apparently needs scratching .
I cannot seem to ignore it even if I try .
A book on Scheme or implementing interpreters or compilers always seems to find its way into my hands .
I want to implement Scheme from Scratch : an interpreter , a compiler , a JIT , etc .
I want to see how it all happens .
If you do too then you may enjoy following along .
Prerequisites
This exploration is not for novice programmers .
It is a tutorial introduction for novice language implementor and enthusiasts from the perspective of a novice language implementor and enthusiast .
You have experience programming on a UNIX or UNIX - like system .
Any of Linux , BSD , or Mac OS X is fine .
You have used common developer tools like gcc and make .
Your copy of K&R 2e is a little dog eared but cherished .
You might even have a copy of APUE 2e .
You have some prior exposure to Intel 386 Assembly language .
You do n’t need to be an Assembly master .
Just some general knowledge about registers , the stack and heap , and some basic instructions .
Jeff Duntemann ’s Assembly Language Step By Step , now in its third edition , is a light and enjoyable introduction providing a sufficient level of Assembly knowledge .
If someone even mentions SICP , your head fills with thoughts of master magicians casting alluring spells .
SICP 2e has spent a lot of time on your bedside table and you ’ve done many of the exercises when you really should have been doing other things ( like I should be doing now . )
SICP showed you the implementation of Scheme in Scheme .
This chicken and egg paradox bothers you and you wonder “ How do I implement Scheme from Scratch ? ”
“ Scheme ”
There are many versions of “ Scheme ” .
The Original Lambda Papers show various ancestors .
I ’ve seen threads mentioned in those papers .
SICP implements several versions of Scheme .
The main language used in SICP does n’t have macros .
SICP shows the implementation of a lazy Scheme .
There is the official IEEE Scheme standard and the de facto RnRS standards : R4RS , R5RS , R6RS .
It is n’t totally clear what makes a Scheme “ Scheme ” .
I ’m not going to worry too much about exactly what a language must have to be enough of a Scheme to earn the name .
I know it needs at least s-expressions ; garbage collection ; symbols ; first - class , lexically scoped procedures ; and proper tail calls .
“ from Scratch ”
What does it mean to implement “ from Scratch ” ?
Upon what foundation will we build Scheme ?
Do we have a working physical computer , an operating system , an assembler , a linker , a C compiler , a Scheme interpreter or compiler , another high - level language ?
At least to me , “ from Scratch ” implies building up towards Scheme from some lower - level .
If a system already has another high - level language then , philosophically , why not just write programs in that language ?
We could , after all .
So implementing Scheme with the assistance of another high - level language is out .
Does the system already have Scheme ?
No .
If it did , we ’d use it and you would n’t need to implement Scheme .
( Or if the system does have Scheme , at least we ’d pretend it did n’t so we could enjoy implementing it ourselves . )
I will assume we have working computer with a 32 bit Intel 386 - style processor , UNIX - like operating system with an assembler and linker .
These are all very interesting low - level details but building up towards a Scheme system from a level where one of these is missing is out of scope for this discussion .
Perhaps the grey area is whether or not the system has a C compiler or not and if we want to use that to build up to Scheme .
All UNIX - like systems have a C compiler .
The operating system and tools are probably written mostly in C .
Many high - level languages , like Scheme , are implemented in C. Working in C is definitely working at a lower - level then working in Scheme .
A testament to the low - level of C is that C is often referred to as “ portable Assembly ” .
Given these things we can take a C compiler , gcc , as one of our available tools .
Scheme from Scratch Implementations
There are many possible ways to implement Scheme from Scratch :
Bootstrap Scheme A quick and dirty Scheme interpreter implemented in C .
This should be less than 1000 lines to implement .
Not many features and slow execution but enough of an interpreter to bootstrap us into the world of Scheme .
Compiling Scheme A Scheme to i386 Assembly compiler written in Scheme .
First executed with Bootstrap Scheme but later self compiling .
See An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction .
Compile - to - C Scheme A Scheme to C compiler written in Scheme .
Provides great portability because C is the intermediate language on the way to machine code .
Byte Code VM Scheme
An embeddable Scheme virtual machine based on a byte - code compiler and interpreter .
Written in ANSI C and very portable .
See Chibi Scheme , for example .
JIT Engine Scheme
An embeddable Scheme engine based on a just - in - time compiler for i386 and with sophisticated garbage collection .
I ’m not sure if this will be written in C or Compiling Scheme .
Platform Scheme Compile Scheme to target a platform like JVM , .NET ’s CLR , Parrot , or LLVM .
By targeting an existing platform , a lot of education and fun would be missed .
It certainly would n’t count as “ from Scratch ” .
It is necessary to write the target platform also .
You can see that it is a big itch .
I do n’t know how long it will take to scratch or what will come of it all but will surely be fun implementing Scheme from Scratch .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

High - Dose Vitamin C Therapy Proven Effective
" My doctor does n't believe in vitamins . "
Since when is medicine based on belief ?
( OMNS , January 5 , 2010 ) The medical literature has virtually ignored 75 years of physician reports and laboratory and clinical studies on successful high - dose vitamin C therapy .
Effective doses are high doses , often 1,000 times more than the US Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) or Daily Reference Intake ( DRI ) .
It is a cornerstone of medical science that dose affects treatment outcome .
This premise is accepted with pharmaceutical drug therapy , but not with vitamin therapy .
Most unsuccessful vitamin C research has used inadequate , low doses .
Low doses do not get clinical results .
Investigators using vitamin C in high doses have consistently reported excellent results .
High doses were advocated almost immediately after ascorbic acid was isolated by Albert Szent - Gyorgyi , M.D. ( 1893-1986 ) .
Notable early medical pioneers of high - dose vitamin C ( ascorbate ) therapy are Claus Washington Jungeblut , M.D. ( 1898 - 1976 ) ; William J. McCormick , M.D. ( 1880 - 1968 ) ; and Frederick R. Klenner , M.D. ( 1907 - 1984 ) .
More recently , important work has been published by Hugh D. Riordan , M.D. ( 1932-2005 ) and Robert F. Cathcart III , M.D. ( 1932-2007 ) .
It Was 75 Years Ago Today Dr. Jungeblut , Professor of Bacteriology at Columbia University , first published on vitamin C as prevention and treatment for polio , in 1935 .
( 1 ) Also in 1935 , Jungeblut showed that vitamin C inactivated diphtheria toxin .
( 2 ) By 1937 , Jungeblut demonstrated that ascorbate inactivated tetanus toxin .
( 3 ) Between 1943 and 1947 , Dr. Klenner , a specialist in diseases of the chest , cured 41 cases of viral pneumonia with vitamin C. By 1946 , Dr. McCormick showed how vitamin C prevents and also cures kidney stones ; by 1957 , how it fights cardiovascular disease .
Beginning in the 1960s , Dr. Cathcart used large doses of vitamin C to treat pneumonia , hepatitis , and eventually AIDS .
For more than three decades , beginning in 1975 , Dr. Riordan and his team have successfully used large doses of intravenous vitamin C against cancer .
The use of doses of tens of thousands of milligrams of vitamin C per day may be the most unacknowledged successful research in medicine .
Heard this one before ?
" If vitamin C was that good , doctors would tell their patients to take a lot of it . "
It is surprising how many physicians have done precisely that .
What 's that ?
Your doctor still does n't ?
Why ?
Decades of physicians ' reports and controlled studies support the use of very large doses of vitamin C. References : ( 1 ) Jungeblut CW .

THE notion that a hacker could eavesdrop on you by commandeering your smartphone or your computer ’s microphone is not new .
But such bugging attempts could soon become far more powerful , even giving attackers the ability to monitor a target ’s utterances almost anywhere they go – even if that target is nowhere near any of their own gadgets .
As people embrace smartphones and notebook computers , which can remain more - or - less permanently connected to the internet , they have unwittingly ensured that they are never far from a potential …
The Ultimate Idiot ’s Guide to Being an African Junta
By |
David M. Crane , the former U.N. war crimes prosecutor for the Special Court in Sierra Leone , and his chief investigator , Alan W. White , indicted former Liberian warlord and president Charles Taylor in 2003 .
Three months ago , their new firm CW Group International offered to sell legal services to the murderous military junta in Guinea .
( Read the full story by Turtle Bay ‘s Colum Lynch here . )
The company ’s proposal included a PowerPoint presentation on how to convert a repressive military force into a defender of the people that obeys the laws of armed conflict .
The proposal was ditched after Guinea ’s accused war criminal and junta leader , Moussa Dadis Camara , was shot in an assassination attempt carried out by one of his own officers .
Now if only Charles Taylor had seen this .
As President Obama seeks to revive his moribund healthcare initiative -- and arrest the precipitous drop in his political fortunes -- he is struggling with the consequences of one of his most important early decisions : letting Congress take the lead in designing his signature policy proposal .
Leaving it to Congress put an unusually glaring spotlight on how Capitol Hill does business .
The spectacle of Congress ’ horse - trading , secrecy and gridlock has fueled today ’s virulent anti-Washington mood .
The public ’s reaction was all the greater because Obama had campaigned on a promise to change the way Washington did business , and because healthcare reform engendered such personal high hopes and anxiety .
The way voters saw it , the smoke - filled room was back -- and they did not like it .
“ It ’s an ugly process , and it looks like there are a bunch of backroom deals , ” Obama conceded in a January television interview .
“ The process did n’t run the way I ideally would like it to . ”
But Obama himself helped bring on the backlash .
“ In 2006 and 2008 , voters threw out Republicans and thought things would change , ” said Frank Luntz , a Republican pollster .
“ Now they see it ’s even worse .
Because of YouTube and Facebook , and you can watch TV on your cellphone , we know these deals are happening .
We assumed they happened 20 years ago , but we know it today . ”
That ’s one reason Obama has called a healthcare summit this week -- to try to renew the debate on more pristine terms .
Even if nothing comes of the talks , they are designed to spotlight on national television precisely the bipartisan , high - minded debate that Congress ’ year - long process was not .
From the outset of his presidency , Obama invited Congress to devise the details of healthcare legislation and other major initiatives -- an apparent bid to avoid what happened when President Clinton tried to overhaul healthcare 17 years ago .
Clinton delivered a detailed proposal drafted in private administration talks , and it fell flat with a Democratic Congress ; Obama set only broad outlines of his initiatives and declined to state preferences on central provisions .
Critics fault Obama and Congress for taking so long with the task , pointing to the standard set by President Lyndon B. Johnson , when such landmark measures as Medicare and the Voting Rights
Act were passed seven months into 1965 .
But Johnson had the advantage of a landslide election behind him and enormous congressional majorities :
He had 68 Democrats in the Senate and 295 in the House .
Now , Congress has 57 Democratic senators and 255 Democrats in the House .
And it ’s one of the least respected institutions in government .
The latest Gallup poll found that Congress ’ approval rating is 18 % , as low as it was in 1992 and down from 39 % since the beginning of the Obama administration .
Tapping into that disaffection , Republicans have denounced Democrats for making major decisions about the healthcare bill in closed - door sessions -- such as when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) crafted a 383 - page amendment rewriting the Senate bill as he brought it to the floor .
Democrats also suffered black eyes from special legislative provisions written into the bills to win support from particular lawmakers -- especially Medicaid funding breaks sought by Sens. Mary L. Landrieu ( D - La. ) and Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) , moves that were dubbed the “ Louisiana Purchase ” and “ Cornhusker Kickback . ”
Even if such practices are common on Capitol Hill , they were easily exploited by GOP critics at a time of economic hardship and mistrust of large institutions .
“ The forces unleashed by the financial collapse created in the minds of people the sense that there are demonic forces at work in banking , real estate and , not surprisingly , in Congress as well , ” said Ross K. Baker , a political scientist at Rutgers University who is an expert on Congress .
The firestorm helped elect Republican Scott Brown of Massachusetts to the Senate .
Healthcare action on Capitol Hill was an easy target for his populist message as he denounced “ those backroom deals for Nebraska and others . ”
His campaign momentum surged .
The effects on Democratic strategy have been lasting .
Party leaders have been very cautious about moving the healthcare bill through a fast - track procedure , fearing that will be tarred as a strong - arm maneuver .
House Democrats are also insisting that the Nebraska deal and other parochial provisions be stripped from the House - Senate compromise .
On another key priority -- a jobs bill -- Reid has whittled down a bipartisan proposal in part because it included some special - interest provisions .
At the healthcare summit Thursday , Democrats hope to neutralize complaints that the process so far has been too partisan and secretive .
But hardly anyone in Washington expects major decisions or compromises to be made on camera .
“ Obama probably made a mistake by over - hyping the notion of transparency , ” said Norman J. Ornstein , an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute .
Compromising means giving up something -- and that ’s harder to do in a public setting .
“ The idea that in public you ’re going to say , ‘ I ’m going to have to abandon this position , ’ -- it does n’t happen , ” Ornstein said .

Gold , Silver , Precious Metal Stocks Final Bottom ?
It was exactly a week ago when precious metals and main stock indices formed a bottom and provided a favorable entry point for all willing to participate in the next move up in the metals .
Consequently we 've sent out a Market Alert , and our Subscribers were able to get back on the market during Monday 's decline ( with prices lower than there were at the end of the session on Friday ) .
While it may seem that the worst is behind us , we still believe one needs to keep an eye on the situation in case it turns around in a flash - especially , if the general stock market is to move much lower from here .
Therefore , let 's begin this week 's journey through charts with the general stock market ( charts courtesy by http://stockcharts.com.)
After all , it was this market that provided key signals last week , and which needs to be currently monitored with great caution .
The reason for the particular caution needed while analyzing the main stock indices is that we have strong reasons ( sentiment , technical , etc. ) to believe that the current downleg is a beginning of a more significant move down .
This means that the emotion that we need to deal with here is fear , not greed , which would be the case if prices were rising .
From a psychological point of view , fear is much stronger emotion than greed , and taking a look at virtually any chart reflects that .
Declines are usually steeper than upswings , mostly because of the abovementioned psychological reason .
Consequently , the general stock market needs to be monitored very carefully , because another move lower is likely to be sharp .
The first thing that comes into mind after looking at the above chart is that if this move is indeed a beginning of a serious decline , then we are still in its early stages .
Please note that the Friday intra-day low was still much above the 200 - day moving average , not to mention the first Fibonacci retracement level of 38.2 % .
Actually , the SPY ETF would need to move lower by a similar amount of dollars to what it already declined in order to reach the first retracement level .
Naturally , the question here is how low can the general stock market go during this plunge .
Last week , we mentioned that it is too early to say , and that it seems that the decline is not even 50 % over yet - and we do n't have much to add this week , besides stating that the first Fibonacci retracement ( around the $ 96 level ) is likely to stop the decline at least temporarily .
The action in volume is clearly negative , as the volume increased visibly along with lower prices and this is the most important technical reason why we believe that there is a 90 % probability that this was not the final bottom for this decline .
Still , the point made in the latest Market Alert , is still up - to - date :
The general stock market is likely to move temporarily higher and the corrective upswing may take several weeks .
It 's much too early to say if the main stock indices will move above the January high - for now it does n't seem likely .
There is one more thing that we would like to comment on before providing you with the gold chart - namely , the fact that during the early part of the 2007 - 2009 downswing , precious metals stocks were negatively correlated with the general stock market .
Please take a look at the area marked with the blue rectangle on the above chart .
For over 10 months PM stocks were trading in the opposite direction to the general stock market - if one takes short time - frames into account .
Please note that tops in PM stocks were reached along with bottoms in the main stock indices and vice - versa .
Still , taking the long - term perspective - both markets plunged dramatically .
The reason why we mention this phenomenon in this update is that it shows just how tricky relying on the stability of a given correlation can be .
Today , we see that the main stock indices are closely positively correlated with PM stocks and PMs in general , but that does n't mean that over several months these markets must go in the same direction .
We will keep our eyes open for additional clues , and report to our Subscribers accordingly .
Moving on to the gold market we see that the similarity that was visible during the latest decline is still present after gold bottomed .
This time , however , it suggests that gold may soon need to consolidate for a week or so - just like it took place in the past .
Please take a look at the areas marked with red rectangles - gold paused when it moved to the declining short - term resistance line ( April 2009 ) , or it broke above it and then verified it as support ( October 2008 , July 2009 ) .
Should the history repeat once again , we can see a similar pattern also this time .
Let 's turn to the short - term chart featuring the GDX ETF ( proxy for PM stocks ) for more details .
The volume in the GDX ETF provides us with additional bullish signals , as it - contrary to the situation in the SPY ETF - is higher during days when the price rises .
Moreover , the RSI indicator moved higher after having bottomed around the 30 level , which often served as a confirmation of a bottom in the past .
One of such examples comes from late October , when GDX started almost $ 15 rally .
It is too early to say when will the next top materialize , as currently much depends on the main stock indices .
For now , it seems that the general stock market will consolidates for some time , which will allow PM stocks to rally along with higher PM prices .
The situation on the general stock market can change very quickly ( just like it was the case a week ago ) , so one has to monitor it for important clues .
Naturally , we will send out a Market Alert to our Subscribers , should anything important ( from the Precious Metals Investor 's point of view ) emerge .

I stepped off the bus into three fucking feet of snow .
I was the only one on the bus , and the driver had laughed viciously when he slammed the door to the bus and roared off in a cloud of deisel fumes .
The building I was looking at was old , white , and covered with snow .
It looked vaugely familiar , and there was a path carved through the snow , which went from 3 feet where I was standing , to over my head .
Holy Christ , what did I get myself into ?
BOOM BOOM BOOM !
Three rapidfire explosions that shake the trees and cause flakes of snow to drift down from their nearly bare branches .
I look around , but no sign where it came from .
Sighing , I grabbed my duffle out of the snow and headed through the carved snow channel to the building .
WHile I was walking there was another set of explosions .
That would explain why all the snow was on the ground but the branches of the trees were bare .
Inside the building was n't much warmer , but at least Class - A's were warm .
I had on my nice shiney E - 2 rank , awarded for excellence during training at AIT , and was all giddy and proud of myself .
It took awhile of wandering around , but I found a woman , who offered to call my unit and have them send someone down to get me .
She tells them I 'll be in the cantina in the building , and then shows me where it is .
She comments on my wedding ring , tells me that post housing is at a premium , and the nearest town is a little over 4 miles from post .
Great , I 'm in Sleepy Fucking Hollow .
No biggee , I joined up to avoid a nightly ass pounding in jail .
Not to say I was n't going to join anyway , it 's just I ended up in the custody of the US Army a bit earlier than planned .
So I 'm sitting there eating nacho's and drinking soda when the guy shows up .
He looks shit - ass miserable , wearing Mickey - Mouse boots , a fucking parka , and cold weather trousers .
" You MOnkey ? " he asks , moving over to the radiator and standing over it .
" Yes .
You from the unit ? " " Yup . Finish your nacho's . " he tells me , then goes over and orders a beer .
He sits down across from me , cracks open the beer , takes a long pull off of it and then belches .
" Who 'd you piss off to end up here ? " he asks me .
" Nobody .
I was actually assigned here after AIT .
Everyone else going to Germany had orders for 21st Replacement , I had orders for here . "
I told him .
" Why ?
What 's so bad except the snow ? "
" Counting you , and me , the unit total now sits at 18 people . " he grunts .
" You had to piss off someone . "
" Eighteen ?
As in ten plus 8 ? "
The thought boggles my mind .
" YEah .
The other two hundred are supposed to be along in the next few months .
You think that 's fucked up , wait till you see our barracks . "
He finishes off the beer , snags a couple of my last nachos , then stands up and buttons his parka .
" Let 's go , kid . "
I catch his rank when he grabs his cold weather cap off the table .
E - 4 , but he looks about nine thousand years old .
I silently follow him outside and into a Chevy Blazer , which he fires up , and we pull out in the streets .
" It gets cold her about August , there 's usually snow on the ground by late September , and it stays till about March or April , from what I 've heard from guys who have been here . " he tells me .
" Most of the buildings were built by the Nazi's in World War II , for example , our barracks were built in the 1930's and refurbished last month .
Here , let 's grab your TA - 50 so you have your cold weather gear , I do n't want you to freeze to death in the middle of the night . "
I nod , follow him in , and we roust a German guy reading a porn mag to give me my equipment .
He does n't make me sign anything , does n't even have a list , he just hands me all this shit , and waves us out the door .
" Do n't they keep accountability ? " I ask , throwing the second dufflebag full of gear into the back of the CUC - V .
" Why ?
Nobody gives a shit about us or this place .
DoD could n't give a shit less what we do out here .
You can literally murder someone out here , and maybe , jsut maybe , Stuttgart will give a shit enough to send someone to investigate if its an officer .
If it 's winter , it 's chalked up to cabin fever .
Hell , last week the engineer company lost two guys , nobody knows where they went , but since no vehicles are missing and they left their cold weather gear behind , we fiugure they are dead .
We 'll probably find them in the summer . "
Oh Lord Jesus , where did I end up ?
We 've been driving for a good 25 minutes , left post , and are on the range roads .
We pass a corner that warns that in the last year 22 troops have been killed by taking the corner too fast .
Given the way the CUC - V leans when we take the corner , it does n't surprise me .
Finally , we pull up to a three story white building .
It 's starting to get dark .
Only a handful of lights are on .
We go inside , and I notice that it 's warm in there .
The first time since I left Frankfurt .
" Hey , Carter , this is Private Monkey , he needs a room and some linen . " the guy says , and the Specialist behind the desk opens a box on the wall , pulls out a key , while the PFC opens a closet and grabs a sheet set , two wool blankets , and a pillow .
They hand it all to me , then go back to watching some fucking show on the little TV .
My guide walks me upstairs , and down to the second half of the building , through the double doors .
He stops to look around and shivers .
" There is only you in the whole section .
Some of us sleep in the day room for comfort . " he tells me , pointing at my door .
" Why ? " I ask , unlocking it and pushing it open .
It smells of paint and sawdust , and something else .
Something that gives me goose bumps .
" You 'll see . "
He digs in his parka and pulls out a bottle of tequila and hands it to me .
" Stay warm , kid .
WHen you wake up , go ahead and come down to the day room .
I think we got an officer today , but right now , we do n't have formation or anything like that . "
I nodd dumbly , completely confused .
This is the Army ?
This is Regular Army ?
THIS is Active Duty ?
What .
The .
Fuck ?
The door slams , and suddenly it feels like the room has gone shadowed despite the fact that light was on .
OK , shower / bathroom to my left , lockers to my right .
Short " hallway " exactly as long as the embedded wall lockers were long .
Fairly large room , with a radiator , refrigerator , two desks , two dressers , and 2 sets of bunk beds .
I walked over , turned on the radiator , and listened to the clanking and thumping and other noises that radiators made .
Looking out the window , I can see fencing with rolls of razor wire on top and guard towers .
Empty .
NOthing in the huge lot , no movement in the towers .
Turning away from the window , I draw the curtains to help the room warm , and begin putting my stuff away .
Everyone else in my AIT was sent to places like Umatilla , Black Briar Creek , Red Stone Arsenal , Johnston Atoll .
I was sent to a fucking place that does n't even have a goddamn name that was n't even up to full strength .
I began to suspect that the ( ReA ) after the unit name meant " ReActivated " since we may or may not have an officer .
I jerked off in the shower thinking of my wife , and went to bed .
It was cold , but I was used to that from Juvie .
I woke up shivering , cold as shit under my blankets .
There was someone in my room , I could feel their presence .
I did n't move , did n't open my eyes , trying to focus on the person .
I 'd learned the trick in Juvie .
I kept my breathing the same , but the air was ice cold and made me cough and sit up .
My room was pitch black , and freezing cold .
I swung off the top bunk , and when my feets hit the floor , the floor actually had fucking ICE on it .
What the fuck ?
I stumbled over , still positive someone was in the room with me , and fumbled for the light switch .
I was n't anyone 's punk , if there was someone in her with a hard dick in their hand , I was going to bust open their skull .
My room was empty , but there was frost above where my head had been , and there was frost on the floor .
I could still feel someone watching me , and whoever it was fucking hated me .
Cold , and completely un-nerved , I gathered up my blankets and grabbed my key , and left my room .
The hallway was dark and cold , and I was in my socks and wollen long johns .
My breath plumed out in front of me in the light of the few lights that were on , and I walked the length of the hallway , pushing through the double doors , and eventually went down the stairs .
Not all the way down , there was another landing below , but a hand painted sign said : " DAY ROOM / CQ AREA " on the second floor landing .
I pushed through the door , and found myself in the same room I 'd originally entered the building through .
The Specialist was leaned back in a chair , dozing , and the PFC was reading a book .
I could hear snoring from another room , and dragging my blanket , I went in there .
There was 15 people in the room , all of them huddled up in chairs , their blankets wrapped around them .
I dropped my shit in an empty chair , and went back into the CQ area .
" Hey , why 's it so cold ? " I asked the PFC .
He looked up and then looked around .
" The furnace went out . "
" Why the fuck did the furnace go out ? "
" Nobody 's loaded coal in it since earlier today . "
" WHy the fuck not ? " I asked .
He smiled , like he knew a secret .
He reached up and grabbed a key , and came up to the desk .
Taking a piece of paper , he sketched what I figured was a map to building .
" OK , we 're right here .
Go down that hall , through the double doors , go through the first door on your left , go down the stairs and exit the stairwell .
There will be two doors on your left , mailboxes and a single door on your right .
Go through the first door on your left , use that key , go all the way to the back of that room , and you 'll find the furnace and a mound of coal with a shovel in it .
Open the furnace , load up the coal , and use the can of gasoline to wet down the coal and light it up .
Then come back . "
He pointed everything out on my map , and I suddenly realized he was talking a coal furnace .
What the fuck ?
I 'm familiar with them , the house my father owned on the West Coast had a coal furnace .
I nodded , he handed me a key and a flashlight , then went back to his book .
Grumbling , I went back upstairs to my room , dressed , grabbed gloves , and went back down to the CQ area .
I did n't say anything , but I was positive that there was still someone in my room .
The hair on the back of my neck would n't stay down .
So , I followed his directions to the bottom floor .
I noticed one thing he 'd forgotten to tell me .
There was a door that would lead outside , but it was locked and chained shut , and the chain was fairly new .
Curious , I unlocked the door , and swung it open .
HOLY SHIT !
A bare dirt floor and an unfinished cieling stretched out into the darkness .
I could smell interesting smells , and could hear a heavy , labored breathing noise in the darkness .
The goosebumps and heebie jeebies that had faded while I 'd walked through the building came back in force .
I was glad I was fully dressed .
I stepped into the room , onto the dirt floor , and walked into the darkness .
I passed the source of the heavy breathing , and turned to look for it .
An old electric water heater sat there , massive and ominous in the puddle of illumination from the flashlight .
I could see where pipe fittings were leaking steam , making the wheezing , heavy sound of breathing .
The air was n't warm or moist , it was still cold , and I could see the glitter of frost on the walls around the loose pipe joints .
I was n't in the Army .
There was no way this could be the 80's Army .
Somehow , I 'd ended up in the 1950's .
I heard a skittering behind me , and whirled around , flashlight held close , and a pair of beady eyes glared at me from the darkness .
I felt the cold shiver run down my back , and realized that I did n't belong down here .
That something down here did n't like us .
Did n't want us in the building .
It or They wanted us gone , wanted us to leave .
Or wanted us to die .
The eyes suddenly moved forward , revealing itself to be a huge rat , easily as long as my forearm with it 's long tail .
It rushed me , mouth open and eyes bright .
" FUCK YOU ! " I yelled , took a step forward , and kicked that big ugly motherfucker back into the darkness .
I made a crunching sound and aborted shriek .
I backed up , slowly , not fully in possession of my faculties , not even aware I was backing away from the door I so wanted to escape out of .
When my back hit the far wall , and the shovel against the wall fell on the dirt , I screamed .
I 'd discovered in Basic Training and AIT that my voice carried .
This time , however , a yell that could have been heard across an FTX firefight just fell flat , without even an echo .
I was nearly bald , but my hair was standing straight up .
I could hear crunching sounds out in the darkness , and my fertile imagination conjured up ghouls pushing up from the dirt , gnawing on bones of past interlopers .
Spinning around , I saw an honest to god kerosene lamp .
My hands shaking , I clipped the flashlight to my chest pocket and fumbled through lighting the lantern .
I had my back to that cavernous room , and I was nearly sobbing with the knowledge that things we closing in on me .
Things that wanted sweet , warm , flesh to gnaw .
The lantern provided a dim bubble of warm light , and I could see the glint of metal off to my right .
Sure as shit , it was furnace .
That did nothing to ease my feelings though .
The furnace was BIG , it was BLACK , and an old Nazi insignia was visible above the furnace door .
The sight of it made my blood run cold .
My imagination supplied screams coming from the furnace as I stared at it .
It was n't a furnace , it was huge , black beast , lying dormant , that demanded living sacrifices to be fed into its maw .
" Fuck that .
It 's a goddamn furnace , this is a fucking basement , and this place is a shit hole . "
I growled up , feeling anger well up to replace my fear .
I was goddamn soldier , a killer Uncle Sam had ordered forged in order to kill motherfuckers .
I was n't going to be afraid of a fucking furnace , an ugly dead rat , and some goddamn darkness .
I pulled open the door to the furnace , located the coal pile , and began shovelling coal into the furnance , just like that fuckhead PFC who'd sent me down her for a laugh at my expense , had told me to do .
I poured gasoline on the coal , and lit it up , then located the feed chute and loaded it .
It came as no suprise that the feed - chute was full of cobwebs .
These guys had been just shoveling coal onto the grate and lighting it up .
As a final " fuck you " I took the shovel and knocked the Nazi emblem off the fucking furnance .
Fuck those dead motherfuckers .
Holding the lantern , I walked the length of the basement , ignoring the little noises .
That breathing ?
The hot water heater .
That gnawing noise ?
Mr. Ugly Rats relatives feasting on his corpse .
Those footsteps behind me ?
Echoes .
Wait .
What ?
I stopped suddenly , and heard the footsteps continue on for another step or two .
I will not look behind me .
I will not run .
Monsters are not real .
I will not run .
I will not look behind me .
Monsters are no FUCK IT !
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE !
I hit the door , kicked it open like it was a movie , and slammed out into the hallway .
I pushed the door shut and held it , shaking and sweating .
As I was locking it , I heard a tapping noise , but refused to open it .
" Cocksuckers .
Hope they like it in there . "
I growled .
I blew out the lantern and set it by the door , then retraced my steps back to the CQ area .
I glanced in , but counted fifteen people , still sleeping .
The Specialist was there , still dozing , but the PFC was missing .
Good , fucker wo n't freeze to death , but let him stay down there till morning , the fucking prick .
" Dude , you 're back ! " I heard from behind me .
I jumped , and spun around .
The bathroom door was closing , and the PFC stood in front of me .
" Damn , you were gone almost an hour .
I was starting to think we'd have to mount a rescue mission for you .
DId you go in ? "
" Yeah .
I reloaded the coal , the radiators should start heating up any time . "
It was starting to dawn on me .
Nobody had been playing jokes , nobody had been fucking with me .
" Nice work , Private .
In the last two months , nobody has managed to do it , and most of us wo n't even go in there . " the PFC told me .
I nodded dumbly .
" So it was n't my imagination ? " I asked .
" No . " he told me , then leaned in close .
" These barracks , fuck , this whole post , is haunted . "
I felt a chill run up my back .
Welcome to Germany , PV2 Monkey .
You ai n't seen nothing yet .
" GET THE FUCK UP !
ALL OF YOU !
ON YOUR FUCKING FEET !
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING STILL SLEEPING ?
WHY AREN'T YOU IN YOUR ROOMS ! "
The screaming woke me up .
My neck hurt from sleeping in the chair , and I was still jet - lagged .
I 'd been dreaming of being trapped in a large dark space with something breathing heavily behind me no matter which way I turned .
I was glad I was woken , but the big mouthed fucker yelling was going to get a beat - down .
While all of that was shambling through my exhausted mind , I 'd already lept to my feet and to attention .
My bleary vision settled on a man in BDU 's , with the gold bar of an LT on his lapel .
He was pissed , kicking chairs and rousing everyone .
I 'd fallen asleep in my uniform , still coated in coal dust , and my boots dusty from the dirt floor and gritty from the coal dust .
My eyes were gritty and I was bone deep tired .
" THIS IS THE GODDAMN US ARMY , NOT A FUCKING DAY CARE ! NOW GET UP ! "
He managed to yell and bully us into a formation four wide and four deep .
Glaring , he stood in front of us at parade rest .
" You guys are the sorriest looking fuckers I 've ever seen .
Whose the ranking NCO ? " we all looked around .
" I am , sir . "
A guy with grey hair said , stepping forward .
Oh God , all he had on his collar was Corporal .
Everyone around me was specialists , PFC's , and me .
" Whose the officer in charge of this cluster fuck of morons ? " he asked .
" You are , sir . " the corporal said .
I repressed a grin at his expression .
" You , Private Monkey , go wake everyone else up .
I want a formation outside in twenty minutes . "
I noticed his uniform was pressed and starched , and his boots reflected his uniform .
" Sir , this is everyone else . "
The corporal said , grabbing my arm before I could take a step .
" This is the entire unit .
We sleep in here for warmth . "
The LT looked like he was about to explode .
He turned and stomped off , and we all looked at each other .
Everyone introduced themselves to me .
Out of everyone there , I was the only person who had n't been sent here from another unit , who had n't been busted at least once , and had n't served at least 2 years in the military .
The only explanation we could figure out for me being sent there was the fact I had been transported to Basic Training in handcuffs .
We all seperated and returned to our rooms to get changed and dressed .
I took a shower , the water was hot and warm , and the soap washed away the lingering feelings from the night before .
I took about my iron and ironed my uniform on the desk , putting a damp towel between the desk top and my uniform , so that it came out looking good .
A quick bit of work , and my extra pair of boots were shined and ready .
I shaved quickly , and headed back down to the dayroom .
Everyone was standing there in uniform , and the LT looked pissed .
He was turning away from the bank of about a dozen phones on the CQ barrier .
" Why do those clocks have different times ? "
He sneered .
" The first is local time , the second is Zulu , the third is synched with the Pentagon , and the last is synched with NORAD , sir . "
A woman answered .
She was E - 3 , and had a leg brace on .
I noticed her titties filled her BDU blouse .
" Who ordered that bullshit ? "
The LT snarled .
" Sir , that was in the orders packet that we opened upon arriving here . "
The female , Stokes , answered .
" WHAT OPERATIONS PACKET ?!? " he screamed .
Great , this ass - monkey thought screaming meant good leadership .
" Carter , grab the Op - Orders ! " A guy , Mann , yelled .
The CQ came into the room , holding a thick manila envelope .
" Why was n't I handed this already ? "
The LT asked .
I could tell this guy was going to be a problem .
" You did n't check in last night , LT , and had not asked for it this morning . "
Carter answered .
The LT tore the envelope out of Carter 's hand and walked out , pulling a ring of keys from his pocket .
" Shit , this guy 's going to be a problem . "
Mann grumbled .
He pulled a pack of Camels out of his pocket and lit one .
I went and bought a soda .
I was down to less than $ 5 in my wallet , and I doubted that the vending machines would honor traveller 's checks .
I came back to everyone trying to figure out what kind of asshole this LT was going to be .
The door blew open , cold air rolling over all of us .
Standing in the doorway was a guy wearing Mickey - Mouse boots , arctic firing mittens , a cold weather mask , a cold weather cap , a pair of cold weather trousers , and a parka with the full lined hood pulled over his head .
He had a box , sealed with apair of metal bands , in his hands .
He set the box on the table , and pulled off his mask .
" Fifth Corps sent these here .
This is 2/19th Special Weapons , right ? " he asked .
" Whose fucking asking ? "
The PFC behind the desk snarled .
The guy laughed .
" Good answer .
Good OPSEC .
Wanna sign for these ? "
" Mason , go find the LT ! "
The PFC yelled .
A guy with no rank on his collar , but the darker squares of sew - on rank on his bare collar showing he had once been higher ranking , nodded and went into the stairwell .
" Damn , you guys are out in the middle of fucking nowhere . " the guy bitched .
He bummed a smoke off of Mann .
" The goddamn main post does n't even know where the fuck you guys are , and all the maps say is ' restricted area ' for this area .
Goddamn Cold War bullshit . "
( I 'd become very familiar with that phrase over the years . )
" Why was n't I notified you were on your way , soldier ? "
The LT yelled as he came out of the stairwell .
The guy 's face went from easy going bitching to hard as the goddamn ice that coated the windows .
" Well , why was n't I notified , and you better answer , I 'm an officer . "
( I 've never forgotten that phrase )
The guy turned around and pulled back the hood of the parka .
On his cap sat a single gold oakleaf .
" So am I .
And I do n't answer to you , Leiutenant . "
He looked positively pissed , and the LT went white .
" Sign for this shit so I can get off this goddamn rock and back to some semblance of civilization . "
The LT stammered through apologies and fawningly signed the clipboard .
The Major kicked the box across the floor , and left through the two sets of double doors .
It was then that the arrangement made sense .
2 sets of double doors acted as an airlock , keeping out the worst of the cold .
It was also snowing outside .
" Do n't just stand there !
Someone carry this down to my office ! " the LT screamed at us .
I shrugged , grabbed the box , and hefted it .
It was pretty heavy , but I 've always been stronger than my size made someone believe .
I followed the LT downstairs , and for some unknown reason I was suddenly afraid that the room beyond the stairwell door would be bare dirt .
I breathed a sigh of relief when lightbulb lit tile and cinderblock came into view .
There was one door on my left , mailboxes on my right , a counter with a gap in it , and a chained shut door that the window was stark white .
So were the full flown windows to the right .
That meant that the snow was over the doorway .
Holy fuck .
We went past a door behind the mailboxes , and to three doors .
One recently painted " 1SG " the other painted " XO " and the one the LT led me through was " CO " .
Inside the lights were on , and the desk was piled with what I assumed was the contents of the manila envelope .
" Set it there , private , then go stand at parade rest over there in case I need you . " he said , going over and sitting behind the desk .
I let my mind drift as I stood there while he first popped the banding off and then began going through the stacks of papers .
I saw him pull out maps , typewritten orders , and more packets .
He was grunting at various things , but I tuned him out .
My legs started to hurt , and my knees were aching .
THe LT left and came back with a sandwich .
Fucker did n't offer me shit , I just stood there , until finally he looked up .
" Go get everyone else , tell them to form up out front of the building . "
Out front ?
In the snow ?
Was he fucking high ?
I snapped to attention , pulled a left face , and got the fuck out of there .
Everyone was sitting in the day room smoking cigarettes and drinking soda .
Stokes had opened up her leg brace and was rubbing her knee and sighing .
" LT Greer wants us to form up outside . "
I said .
" Oh you have to be fucking kidding ! "
Another private , Cobb , snarled .
I turned around and looked outside .
It was bare white and you could n't even see the steps off of the porch .
" That 's what he said . " I answered .
" He said to form up in the lot across the street . "
Grumbling , we went to our rooms and put on our cold weather gear .
When I returned to the CQ area , everyone else but Stokes was already there .
Private Cobb had a coil of 550 cord in his hands .
" All right , we 'll all take a cut of that one , " he said , pointing at the other coil of 550 cord , " Tie it to your parka belt , then loop it over this one .
I checked , you can't see farther than a foot or two out there .
Stokes will hold the barracks end , I 'll be on the far end .
As soon as the LT comes out there , we should be able to go in . "
I just nodded dumbly .
These guys and girls all knew better than me .
I followed instructions , and was the fifth out the door .
Cobb had n't been kidding .
I damn near fell down the steps , and could n't see my hand if I stretched it out in front of my face .
It was only 1600 , and it was nearly dark , with the wind howling around us .
I must have died on the bus and now I 'm in Hell .
I felt the person behind me grab onto my back , and I reached back and grabbed his hand .
We 'd hold four people to a line , and hopefully get four lines .
I bumped into the guy in front of me , and I stepped up next to him , my shoulder against his .
Closer than any other formation I 'd ever been in .
" TEN MINUTES ! " the guy next me yelled .
" OK ! " I yelled back , then turned to my right .
" TEN MINUTES ! " " Roger ! " the other guy yelled back .
He was still holding my hand tightly .
I reached out and grabbed the guy on my left 's hand , and he squeezed .
It was freezing fucking cold , the wind was prying through the holes in the cold weather mask , and my ears and the tip of my nose were starting to hurt .
" FIVE MINUTES ! " was yelled to me , and I yelled it down the line .
Where the fuck was LT ?
What kind of mad-man was he to send us out in this shit ?
If were n't tied together , we'd be spread all over and lost in the white - out .
Fuck , if we were n't holding hands , we'd be all alone in the whiteness .
" FUCK THIS ! EVERYONE BACK IN ! " the guy on my left yelled .
I passed it up , and soon I felt the guy on my right pulling me forward .
I stumbled on the steps , and we went inside .
We were covered with snow , and we all had ice on cold weather masks .
" Where 's the LT ? " Cobb asked .
" RIGHT HERE !
WHY AREN " T YOU FUCKERS IN FORMATION ? ARE YOU AFRAID OF SOME SNOW ? " came the screaming from the stairwell .
" Sir , look outside .
For the love of God , that 's a blizzard ! "
Said another guy .
I could n't see his name .
" Did your recruiter promise you that you only had to work in the summer ?
GET YOUR ASSES OUTSIDE , GODDAMMIT ! " he yelled .
" AND WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS ROPE SHIT ? "
" Blizzard security measures , to make sure nobody gets lost . "
Cobb said .
" That 's an old wives tale .
You losers better be outside in five minutes , if I have to come out and get you , there will be hell to pay ! " the LT screamed , throwing open the doors and pushing his way outside .
Cobb lit up a cigarette , and offered me one .
I took it , even though I did n't smoke , and looked around .
" Tell me he did n't just go outside without a teather . "
Stokes said , shaking her head .
" Are n't we going to formation ? " I asked , looking around .
Everyone was taking off their cold weather gear and rolling it up so they could sit on the floor on it .
" Do n't worry , Private Monkey . "
After about a half hour , people began wandering off , talking and chatting .
Stokes was holding hands with Cobb , and they walked down the hallway together .
I walked over to Mann .
" What happens now , Mann ? " I asked , pointing at the door .
" Do n't we try to rescue him ? "
" In a November blizzard ?
At night ?
Look , Private Monkey , he went out there in a field jacket and winter BDU's , no protective gear . "
Mann told me .
" He 's already dead , is n't he ? " I asked .
" Yup . "
Mann said , moving around behind the desk .
" You 've got CQ tonight , tomorrow morning , we 'll call Fifth Corps and let them know they lost an officer . "
I stared at the doorway .
I later found out that none of that snow stayed on the ground , the winds whipped it around and later dumped it further down the mountain .
We were too high up for too much to stay .
We found the officer that summer .
Everyone was asleep in the day room .
Mann had given up trying to get TV reception through the snow and was reading a porn mag .
We were passing a bottle of whiskey back and forth and sipping off it now and then .
There would be an eerie moaning down the hallways and behind the stairwell doors .
The front outer doors would shake now and then , and my imagination always painted the LT , his skin white and waxy , pawing at the door with frozen hands .
It had been over six hours since he had left .
The fact he had n't returned did n't seem to bother anyone , and I 'd be goddamned if I was going to show that it bothered me .
I jumped at a loud howling noise echoing down the hallway .
" Relax , Monkey , it 's just the wind . "
Mann said , closing the porn mag and setting it on the counter .
" Why did n't we call in a search and rescue ? "
I asked , pointing at the large bank of phones .
There were over 12 of them , all them plugged in with big old - style sockets .
" Only one of those works , and that 's to an office at Corps .
Right now , nobody is there because we are n't operational . "
Mann told me .
Another moan drifted down the hallway and I shivered .
Down the hallway , the lights flickered , and some stayed off .
Mann looked down the hallway : " I hate this fucking place . " he grumbled .
" We 'll call Fifth Corps tomorrow and let them know we 're down an LT . " he saw me shiver again as a full blown shriek roared down the stairwell .
" Look , just follow Cobb 's advice , Private Monkey , he used to be an actic environment trainer before he got busted for selling crack . "
I nodded .
Mann went back to reading his porn mag , and I began going through the drawers looking for something to read .
I found the CQ logbook , and began reading it .
There was only 2 months worth the enteries there .
Apparerntly Cobb had been here , by himself , with just the construction workers coming in during the day , for nearly a month .
The log held records of screaming , and a few times of hearing sobbing coming from the third floor bathroom .
About a week into it , Cobb had stopped walking a patrol of the upper floors .
The Eighteen of us had only arrived in the last month .
I was the first new person besides the LT to arrive in a week .
They 'd logged when I 'd arrived , that I 'd recieved my initial TA - 50 issue , and had recieved linen and been placed in my room .
Mann had logged that the LT had gone outside , without protective gear , into a blizzard despite being warned , and had not returned after one hour and was presumed dead .
He was n't the only one .
Apparently an E - 5 had gotten drunk and had gone outside , and had not returned .
He too was presumed dead .
* BANG BANG BANG *
The noise came from upstairs , right above us .
I jumped , and Mann jumped too .
I did n't feel so bad .
" What the fuck was that ? " I asked .
" We do n't know . "
Mann admitted .
" It happens now and then .
Fuck , I hope your not a chickenshit , Monkey . "
Mann unlocked a desk drawer and pulled out two M1911A1 Colt .45 's in holsters .
" Put this on , son . "
Mann told me .
Man looked to be in his mid-30's , and I responded by nodding and copying the way he belted it on .
" Why are we ... "
Mann shushed me .
I opened my mouth to ask why , and a loud shriek came boiling down the stairwell and out of the vents .
Following it was a sound like a woman sobbing loudly .
The hair on my neck stood up .
Mann handed me a flashlight , and I saw the day to the day room shut , and heard the click of the lock .
My whole body was covered by goosebumps , hell , I had goosebumps on my balls , and my asshole felt like it was puckered shut .
The sobbing sound was overlaid with shrieks .
* BANG BANG BANG *
Mann was grinning , but it was sickly looking .
His face was pale .
" It 's one of those nights . "
He said .
I pretended not to notice the tremor in his voice .
I heard what sounded like doors opening and slamming from upstairs , and another shriek came ripping down the hallway .
Then , like it was a fucking movie or something , the lights shut out one after another , marching down the hallway toward us , and then the lights in the CQ area cut out .
I could hear footsteps above us , and suddenly the emergency lighting kicked in .
Red light spilled out from above me , painting me and Mann like brutalized corpses .
" Thank God . "
Mann breathed .
I looked at him .
" Last time they did n't cut on .
Want to see something trippy ? "
Our breath was visible in the red light .
I nodded , and he turned on a flashlight and stood up .
" Check it out , fully charged , right ? " I nodded .
I 'd seen him open the package of OD green batteries and put them in less than twenty minutes ago .
He got up , walked around the counter , and opened the doors to the hallway .
COld wind slapped me in the face , somewhere the wind was getting into the building unhindered .
Mann slid the flashlight down the hallway , the spinning beam looking surreal .
He let go of the doors and ran back to me .
" Watch the light . " he told me .
I nodded silently , my mouth dry .
Above us , it sounded like someone was stomping around in boots .
There was another shriek , this one through the floor vents .
The light stayed nice , bright , and white , and I was just about to ask why we were watching a flashlight beam when it happened .
THe beam dimmed , then came back , then it flickered , then it came back .
Suddenly it dropped to extremely dim , stayed that way for moment , then went out .
It flickered back on , then slowly dimmed away .
" Trippy , ai n't it ? "
Mann asked me .
" That 's why Cobb quit doing the rounds , and why we do n't do them either .
You never know when it 's going to happen . "
His face was painted surreal by the red emergency lights .
We sat there in silence , looking at each other once in awhile when a shriek was particularly loud .
When banging sounded from the door behind us , from the tiny office behind the CQ area , we both jumped .
" FUCK THIS ! " I yelled , standing up .
My nerves were strethced too tight .
I was n't going to just sit here .
There was NO FUCKING SUCH THINGS AS GHOSTS !
This was someone fucking with us or an effect of the blizzard top outside .
I walked over to the door and snatched it open , telling myself that a window must have blown open .
The musty air was pushed back by another shrieking breeze , and in the red light I saw that the only things in there was cot , a sleeping bag , a desk , and a chair .
No windows .
No vents .
" Cobb spent the last week he was here alone in there with these pistols at night .
You watch , he 's a little twitchy nowdays . "
Mann said , standing up behind me .
I slammed the door and turned back to Mann .
" Look , this is bullshit .
There 's someone in here fucking with us . "
" Who ?
Who the fuck is out here to fuck with us ?
There 's not another fucking unit out here within five fucking miles !
They 're on the other side of the fucking mountain !
We 're above the goddamn ski resort for Christ 's Sake ! "
Mann looked pissed , but I did n't care .
THis was bullshit .
This was a US Army barracks , for fucks sake , nobody believed in ghosts .
" Give me the fucking keys , I 'm going upstairs . "
I told him .
I grabbed another flashlight and put new batteries in it , then shoved the rest of the batteries from the package in my pocket .
" You realize , we wo n't be able to hear you scream above the " wind " . " he told me , placing a strange emphasis on wind .
I nodded and took two steps before Mann grabbed my arm .
" Look , kid , I realize you 're all bad ass hell from AIT and Basic , but listen to me . " he sounded urgent , and I stopped .
" Look , there are some posts in the US that are haunted .
I 'm not making this up , kid .
Madigan Army Hospital at Fort Lewis is haunted , the parade ground at Fort Riley Kansas is haunted , Darmstadt is haunted , the whole fucking post .
Do n't go fucking around in here . "
I could see the earnestness in his voice , and reminded myself that he had been in the Army for 8 years before getting busted to his current rank .
He 'd been a Drill Instructor at Red Stone , training ChemCorps troops , and got caught fucking one of the students .
I sat down , then nearly jumped out of my seat at what sounded like cackling laughter coming from down the hallway .
" Just the wind , kid . "
Mann told me .
He did n't sound convinced , but I decided it was better to just stay here with him .
The night passed , but only an hour or so was filled with strange noises .
The lights came back on at 3AM , and the wind died down .
I was glad I 'd refilled the coal chute on the furnace before dinner .
We ate MRE's for breakfast , and Stokes and Cobb took the only vehicle we had to the chow hall on main post and got us some food .
According to Mann , out in the snow , was a building that would be our mess hall .
The cooks were all due sometimes .
We called in what happened to the LT , and the guy on the other side of the line did n't sound surprised , or even worried .
Just asked if we had any other casualties to report .
I went to bed .
The chair was uncomfortable , but the sounds of the rest of the company were comforting .
-------------------
I slept till around noon , and woke up to someone stamping their feet .
Bleary eyed I got up and walked out the day room doors and into the CQ area .
Carter was taking off his parka , and there were two other people there .
A Captain and a Sergeant First Class .
" Jesus Christ , we got fucking dicked . "
The SFC bitched .
When he took off the parka , I read the name " Vickers " on his chest .
He had jump wings , air assault wings , and a pathfinder badge .
" Who are you ? " the Captain asked me .
" Private Monkey , sir . " I told him .
" Jesus , Vickers , he 's just out of boot . " the Captian grinned .
When he pulled off his parka I saw his name Bishop .
" Well , Private Monkey , go get everyone .
We had the mess hall load us up with a couple of mermites so you guys can have hot chow tonight and for breakfast . "
" Yes , sir . " I said .
I went to the desk , and wrote down what rooms had people in them .
Eighteen , out of over eighty rooms .
Jesus .
I gathered everyone up , and there were questions about the new CO or XO , and the new NCO .
We gathered for dinner , and ate chatting about what a shit hole we were stuck in .
The far end of the hallway suddenly went dark and the Captian looked at us .
" It 's eighteen hundred hours . "
Cobb said .
THe Captian raised one eyebrow , but let it lie .
About ten minutes later the lights flickered back on .
" Every night , sir . "
Cobb said .
A shriek flowed down the stairwell , and Captain Bishop and SFC Vickers exchanged a glance .
" Let me guess , just the wind ? " Captain Bishop asked .
Cobb nodded , and the CPT and the SFC exchanged glances .
" The Army actually expects you to stay here ? " Captain Bishop said .
" This is outfuckingrageous !
In twelve years in the military I 've never seen any shit like that . "
The boots crashed upstairs .
Wind my ass , there were dead Nazi 's up there , I knew it .
SFC VIckers looked up .
" How bad does it get , soldiers ? " SFC Vickers asked as another scream ripped down the hallway .
I noticed Cobb was scootched up into the corner , he was eating without looking at his plate .
I 'd seen that in Juvie a lot .
" Pretty bad , Sergeant .
We 've pretty much abandoned our rooms , and at night , we all stay down here . "
Stokes told him .
" You have n't heard the worst of it .
Last week was really bad . "
" How bad , soldier ? " Captain Bishop asked .
He sounded genuine , not faking .
" Voices , sir .
We could hear voices . "
Stokes was staring at her plate .
" What kind of voices ? " Captain Bishop asked softly .
Upstairs , the stomping sounded again .
" German voices , sir .
And laughing . "
Stokes said .
I looked around , and saw everyone else nodding .
" We all stay in here , tommorrow , we 'll search this fucking building . "
Vickers said .
A sobbing scream echoed out of the vents .
" Try to get some sleep , troops .
God , this is just fucked up . "
Captian Bishop said .
He saw that Carter and Mann had the .45 's again , and raised an eyebrow .
" Here , sir . "
Mann said , handing Captain Bishop the pistol .
" Should n't these be in the arms room ? " Bishop asked .
" We do n't have the keys .
Cobb found these in one of the offices upstairs . "
Mann answered , and Cobb nodded .
A slow , mournful wail floated down the vents and the hallway , heralding a cold breeze that turned the room freezing .
Our breaths plumed out .
The lights shut out , about eleven , and I woke to Sergeant Vickers and Captain Bishop swearing .
I tossed in my chair and went back to sleep .
We had command , finally .
Things would be OK .
( OK , I 'm heading out .
I 'll probably add to this .
The most fucked up week of my life )
---------EDIT--------------
You know the best part of all of this ?
Not one of you is gonna believe me .
NOt about what 's already written , not about the rest .
Hell , when I was stationed at other posts , NOBODY fucking believed the shit we saw during the months leading up to getting the unit operational .
The fucked up shit , all the shit we saw , and what the Army did about it , nobody 's going to believe .
Tomorrow , I 'll post what happened the next day , what we found out about the building , and what happened to Cobb .
WHere was I ?
Oh yeah , the third night I 'd spent there .
I woke up early , it was around 0430 and cold as shit in the room .
I got up , stretched , and pulled on my boots and BDU top .
Curious , I took my lighter and light it , then ran it around the edges of the windows .
Nothing , the flame did n't even flicker .
It did n't flicker near the vents either .
There was n't any air coming in the room through the vents or the windows .
Dammit .
Wait .
What ?
Aw fuck , the furnace was out again .
No .
Hell no .
I 'm not going back in that room , ever .
Not even with a gun .
Not even with a rocket launcher .
NOt even with tank .
Coward bubbled up from my mind .
Against a man ?
No . Against a beast ?
No .
Against a water heater that breathed and a furnace that was probably used to burn people alive ?
Fuck .
Yes .
It 's not like I 'm the only one scared , these guys and girls were all people who been in for years , and they abandoned their rooms because of this shit .
No . I refuse to be afraid .
There 's no such thing as the fucking boogey man and no such thing as ghosts .
It 's the 19 fucking 80's , nobody is afraid of ghosts anymore .
I slipped out of the dayroom and into the CQ area .
Carter was leaned back in the chair , fucking with the rabbit ears on top of the little television trying to get Sesame Street to come in clearer .
Another guy that I 'd seen around but not really interacted with was reading a book .
I waved to both and headed for my room .
The hallway lights were on , but it still felt ... dim .
I unlocked my room , retrieved another uniform and some underwear , grabbed a towel , and took a shower and shaved .
I felt better in a clean uniform .
I gathered up my laundry bag and headed for the laundry room .
I 'd memorized the barracks map that was in log book when I had assistant CQ .
I tossed in my dirty laundry into the washer and added some Tide , then headed out to the CQ area .
" Sleep good , Private Monkey ? "
Carter asked , stretching and yawning .
" Yup , sure did , Specialist . "
A moan drifted down the stairwell .
" Good morning , soldiers . "
It was Captian Bishop , and he sounded waaay to cheery for a man who had just spent the night in this hell hole .
I could hear Sergeant Vickers waking people up in the day room .
Bishop walked up to the CQ area , and rested his elbow on the counter .
" We 're going to search the barracks today .
There is 20 of us , we 'll break into teams of four .
I want every locker , every room , ever closet , every bathroom checked .
If the door does n't open with the keys we have , kick the goddamn thing in . "
Captain Bishop said .
I could hear Stokes lurching into the CQ area .
Her knee did n't work worth a shit .
" What about the arms room and the NBC area ?
We do n't have keys for the locks , and they 're pretty serious locks . "
Carter asked , bringing a ring of keys out of the desk door .
" We have 6 master keys , and four keys for each room , unless someone is staying in the room , then we only have 2 or 3 keys . "
" We 'll figure that out after lunch .
We 'll have breakfast , I 'll assign teams , and we 'll knock this out by lunch . "
Captian Bishop looked totally in control .
" We 'll go onto main post for lunch . "
I nodded , and waited while everyone came out into the CQ Area .
The whole unit , all 20 of us , was smaller than my AIT class .
I was getting familiar with everyone .
Cobb looked like he had n't slept in a month , and I hoped someone had let Sergeant Vickers and Captian Cobb that he had been stuck here , by himself , for a month .
I was assigned with Mann , a woman named Stevens , and a black guy named Smith .
We drew lots , and ended up with the far side basement .
The water heater / furnace room , the war - stock storage , the tool room , a mailroom , a set of offices .
I did n't say a word , but I could tell my companions were n't too thrilled about the area we drew .
I swore I heard a chuckling noise float up through the vents .
We walked silently down the hallway , past the double doors , and then into the stairwell .
When we opened it , freezing air poured over us , and I took my gloves out of my thigh pocket and pulled them on .
" Shit , I should have thought of that . "
Stevens said .
" Damn , Monkey here is the only one of us with a field jacket too . "
" Shut up , let 's knock this shit out and get out of here . "
Mann said , and we headed down the stairs .
When we pushed the door open , the small hallway at the bottom of the stairs was pitch black .
CHrist , this was turning out run already .
" This room first . "
Mann said , unlocking and pushing open the doorway to that huge dirt floored room .
I felt fingers tickle up my spine as I looked at the dark maw of the doorway .
Was it just my imagination , or did our little hallway get darker somehow ?
Fuck this .
I 'm a US Army soldier .
There 's no such thing as ghosts , there are n't any dead Nazi 's stalking around these barracks .
I pushed past Mann , snapped on my flahslight and dropped it into the pocket of my field jacket .
THe others followed me .
" OK , spread out to double arm intervals . "
Mann said .
I scootched my way between Mann and Stevens , that way I would n't be at the end , and would n't have to touch the walls .
I was a clever monkey .
" I 'm not near a wall . "
Smith said .
Mann went by me , and I heard some movement .
" Shit , where is the wall ? "
Mann asked .
I surpressed an urge to run for it .
I heard Stevens breathing heavily , and squeezed her hand .
She squeezed back .
" OK , damn , this fucker is about 8 people wide . "
Mann said .
I ran the numbers in my head .
The room was damn near the size of the barracks , but the doorway opened up against the far side , and it was right down the stairs .
The dimensions did n't fit .
Mann came back and grabbed my hand , and I realized that it was because it probably went underneath the lawn .
Duh .
We walked forward , shining our flashlights on the ground , Smith had his pointed at the other wall .
We saw several rats slither into the holes in the concrete , and the water - heater looked more sad than menacing .
It must have been around 20 years old , and was n't holding up well .
We finally reached the far end .
" I 'm gonna reload the furnace . " I told them .
Mann told me to go ahead , and the three of them talked while I sweated through reloading the feeder - chute and starting a new fire .
" Ready ?
Let 's get out of this fucking room , it 's creepy . "
Mann said .
We all nodded in the light from the furnace , and then we got the fuck out of that room .
In the hallway , Mann kicked the lantern I 'd left there god knows how long ago , and it bounched off the wall and shattered .
" Nice going , Mann . " I said .
" What the fuck was that ? "
Smith asked .
" An oil lantern .
I used it the other day when I refilled the fucking furnace . "
I replied .
" No fucking way , there 's nobody that would go through that fucking room by themselves . "
Stevens said .
" At ease that shit .
Let 's hit the war - stocks room . "
The calling me out on reloading the furnace the other day stopped , and Mann unlocked the war - stocks room .
" What the fuck is war - stocks ? " I asked .
" Well , our unit has to have up to date stocks to roll out in case the Soviets or the East Germans jump .
SO it 's stored in this room ...
What the fuck ? " I looked over Mann 's shoulder .
Nothing .
THe room just stretched out into the darkness .
" This is bullshit !
Cobb and I loaded this shit off of five - tons !
I goddamn KNOW this fucking room was full ! "
Mann swore , stepping into the room .
THe wind grabbed the door out of Steven 's had and slammed it shut .
We could hear Mann yelling and trying to open the door , and we tugged on it hard .
THe handle was ice cold , and the wind was swirling around us , making an unearthly banshee wail the whole time .
The wind quit , and the door flew open .
Mann fell on the floor and scrabbled away from the empty gaping door .
His eyes were huge , and it was probably the most frightened I 'd ever seen someone .
He kicked the door shut , and scrabbled to his feet .
" What ? " I asked .
" There 's someone in there . "
Mann said .
" Bullshit . " I said .
I pulled the door open and stepped in .
I expected it , I knew it was going to happen , but the wind shrieked and the door slammed shut behind me .
The floor was concrete , and I began walking the length .
FUck this , there 's no such thing as ghosts , there 's no such thing as monsters .
I found the two huge double doors that opened onto the loading dock according to the map I 'd memorized .
The doors were chained shut from the inside .
There were a few wooden chunks , but that was it .
I ignored the breathing noise on the inside wall .
That was the water heater .
I ignored the low chuckling laughter , that was the furnace .
I ignored the footsteps , that was echoes of my boots on the concrete .
As I started walking back toward the door , I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up .
A warm puff of cold air hit the back of my neck and bald head .
I must have passed under a vent or air leak .
one step . two step .
phhhhhhhhhh
It 's just the air .
one step .
two step .
three ... phhhhhhh RUN DUMBSHIT !
I hit the door with my shoulder , like I 'd just plowed the Tumwater quarterback .
My shoulder slammed the bar nearly flush with the door , and the door crashed open .
Stevens and Smith went reeling away , and I turned around and kicked the door shit , putting my back against it and holding it .
" Someone in there ? "
Mann asked .
I straightened up and adjusted my BDU top .
" No , just my imagination . " I stepped over by him .
Smith locked the door .
" Did you find any of those pallets ? " I shook my head .
" The pallet jacks ? "
No again .
" Where the fuck did it all go ? " he asked .
" Maybe another unit stole it ?
Or black marketers . "
I said , rubbing my hands together .
Damn , they were freezing .
Everyone nodded .
THat 's what happened .
We 'd tell the MP's , and CID would investigate .
The MRE's , uniforms , TA - 50 , concentina wire , body bags , tents , and camou nets would never be found .
The tool room was empty , and I stood in the hallway " warming up " while Stevens and Smith checked it .
No tools , but Mann assured me that the trucks with the tools had not arrived yet .
He told me that Cobb and he had spent the first 3 days moving the beds , dressers , desks , and refrigerators up into the rooms and the offices on the other side of the basement .
While he talked , he opened the mailroom door , and we swept our flashlights around inside .
Nothing .
According to him , they 'd just finished loadin the furniture into the rooms the day I arrived .
" Hey , I have a question . " I said .
" Shoot . " he answered , holding open the door while Stevens and Smith left the tool room .
" Well , if the only phone that works is the one that is a locked line to Fifth Corps , how the fuck did you know to come get me ? " I asked .
It had been bothering me since the night before .
Mann laughed , and explained .
Apparently , the number they had for my unit at the reception center / rec center was the number to the Fifth Corps office , and they 'd call the unit on the locked line .
Duh .
I should have figured that out myself .
We pushed at the door to outside , but only managed to get it about two inches open .
We could see packed snow around the edges , and gave up .
" Where do you suppose the LT ended up ? " Smith asked , as we entered the stairwell .
" Fuck him , he got what was coming to him . "
Stevens swore .
" He 's probably in the back parking lot .
If he went around the building , he would have got lost behind us .
There is n't shit behind this building but snow , trees , and eventually the ski resort . "
Mann answered .
We pushed into the hallway and ran into the group searching the first floor .
THey had n't seen jack , so we helped them sweep the rooms on the first floor .
" Captian Bishop and Sergeant Vickers are checking the third floor . "
Stokes told us from the hallway while Mann and I searched another barracks room .
" What the fuck are they doing up there ? "
Mann asked .
" There is n't shit up there but empty rooms and the attic access . "
" They think whoever it is that 's fucking with us is hiding on the third floor . "
Stokes answered .
Mann laughed .
" What 's so funny ? " I asked .
" The box - heads who were doing the construction refused to refurbish those rooms .
THey would n't even repaint the offices .
The two of them are in for a shock . "
Mann told me .
" Box heads ? " " Germans . "
" What 's the surprise ? " I asked .
Hell , asking this kept my mind from putting monsters under the beds to jump me .
" The walls still have all the old Nazi paintwork .
We 're talking swastika 's and lightning bolts and eagles . "
Mann replied .
" It 's like something out of a world war two movie . "
" Why is that fucking Nazi 's are creepy ? "
Stevens asked .
" I lived in the South , and we had the Civil War , but you never hear tales of dead Rebels killing people . "
" They were n't evil . "
Smith said , stepping into the hallway .
" They may have been slave holders and the like , but they were n't evil like these assholes were . "
We stayed silent while we checked the laundry room , the broom closet , and finally ended up back in the day room .
The other groups dribbled in , and finally Sergeant Vickers and Captian Bishop showed back up .
Both of them looked disturbed .
" Get everyone together .
We 're going back to main post .
You guys have a hot lunch . "
Captian Bishop told us .
Did you know , that if you really need to , you can fit 10 people in a Chevy Blazer ?
We pulled up to a messhall , and we all bailed out .
Lunch was n't great , but it was hot , it was fresh , and that made it good .
" Hey , MOnkey , you still got that bottle I gave you ? " the person I 'd first met , Specialist Thompson , asked me .
" Yeah .
I left it in my room .
I kind of forgot about it . "
I answered .
" The CO told me to take the CUC - V to the Class VI .
He pitched in , we 're all going to sit in the day room and get drunk tonight .
You want anything ? "
I dug in my wallet and pulled out a $ 20 traveller 's check .
I signed it , and handed it to him .
" Grab me a bottle of Wild Turkey , use the rest to make sure everyone else has a bottle . "
I told him .
He looked surprised .
Cobb lit two cigarettes and handed me one absently .
I took it , even though I did n't smoke , and leaned back in my chair to belch .
Everyone laughed , and Smith cut loose with a belch louder and more abrasive than mine , which I laughed at .
" Say , Monkey , have you figured out why the barracks are haunted ? "
Smith asked .
I shook my head and coughed from a drag of the cigarette .
" Well , this post was n't even discovered till after World War TWo was over .
It was found by some guys who got lost .
" This is one of the SS training grounds .
The welcome center is featured on a few old documentaries as having Hitler inspecting SS units in front of it .
Our building , however , was n't discovered until the early 1960's , and even then , it was n't really examined until close to the 1970's .
" Rumor control says the first guys in it vanished , and the area was listed as restricted . "
I nodded .
I 'd heard the Major bitching about the fact the area was listed as a restricted area on the map .
" Here 's the fucked up part , Monkey .
" The place was where the SS cadre , the trainers , were barracksed .
It was also there they practiced new techniques and kept their skills sharp . "
" Torture . " I said .
The heads around the table nodded .
" You mean to tell me that the Army , the U Fucking S Army is making us live in a place where motherfuckers who are the standard for evil tortured people to death ? "
Everyone nodded , and I spent the rest of the time till Captain Bishop and SFC Vickers picked us up trying to figure out who I 'd pissed off to end up there .
Everyone else was talking in low tones in the CUC-V .
There was 10 of us packed into it , and we were passing around a bottle of Ausbach .
Three in the front , four in the middle , 3 us packed into the back on top of the toolboxes .
In AIT and Basic , when we went somewhere by truck , we always talked and BS'd .
This ride , all we did was pass the bottle and pass around the cigarette Cobb had lit up .
SFC Vickers seemed particularly disturbed , staring out the window and taking long pulls off the bottle .
The 10 of us went through 3 bottles of liquor by the time we pulled up to the barracks .
I climbed out of the truck , the wind whipping at my parka , and I stared at the building .
The building I had to go back into .
The building that the Army expected me to live in and like it .
The building where motherfuckers who came to mind when you said evil had tortured people to death , beaten people to death , practiced strangulation techniques , and planned foul deeds .
It was three stories tall .
A basement , and supposedly a sub - basement we had n't checked .
There was an attic , but nobody had gone in there .
The roof was steeply inclined , and I understood it was because of the snow .
I could see iron rings on the roof , and I asked Thompson about them .
They used to tie the treetops to the rings , pulling them over the building to hide it .
THe trees clustered close to the building , the snow was up to the windows , about five feet deep .
While I stood there and watched , lights came on in one of the room , then shut off .
The other CUC - V pulled up .
Figures , I was probably the only one who saw it .
We trudged into the building , not like men and women who had come home , but rather like we were walking to the firing squad .
We were all overstressed .
I may not have been an NCO , but I sure as shit knew when people were past their breaking point .
Even I was seeing things , and probably hearing things .
The CQ area was cold , and dim .
It took Carter three times of flicking the switch to get the lights to come on .
Captian Bishop did n't say anything , just walked into the day room cracking open a bottle of Picardi 151 .
We all followed , and Thompson began handing out bottles out of a rucksack .
I got two bottles of Wild Turkey .
It was more than I needed , shit I had n't drunk that much since I got tossed on my head in Juvie by the cops .
We all began bullshitting , and eventually ate from MRE's .
We had a mermite full of food , but MRE 's just felt right .
Everyone talked about their fall from grace .
The fact I 'd arrived in handcuffs , that Thompson had been an E - 6 who'd beaten up another soldier bad enough to hospitalize the guy over a woman , Cobb had been a prime suspect in a murder , and even though they 'd busted him for failure to report , they 'd never pinned the murder on him .
Captian Bishop had beaten the fuck out of his Brigade COmmander for calling him a nigger , SFC Vickers had gotten caught fucking his superior 's wife , Stokes had gotten drunk and wrecked her car and killed another soldier in a head on collision .
I was the youngest there .
The next one closest to me was 22 .
These guys and girls had joined the Army while I was still catching feels in JR High .
We were all criminals .
If penal units still existed , it was us .
Murderers .
Theives .
Thugs .
That was us .
I passed out around 1900 , and slept through the night .
We did n't have fire guard , we did n't bother with CQ or ACQ or even duty driver .
We all got drunk , some of us drunk enough to puke in the trash cans before going back to drinking .
I woke without a hangover .
I was angry when I woke .
Anger I was used to , I was always angry .
Todd fucking with me , the engineer of the Crazy Train fucking with me .
Anger was part of my life .
It was cold , and I was pissed off .
I stomped over to the CQ desk and dug through the drawers till I found the map for the building .
Looking at it , I located the main breaker boxes .
In the furnace room .
Fine , if that 's how it was going to be , then that 's how it would be .
I refused to be intimidated by dead Nazi scumbags .
I was too old to believe in ghosts or hauntings .
That shit was for little kids .
I was a goddamn man .
I replaced the batteries in my flashlight , and headed down the hallway and to the stairwell .
I paused on the mid-way landing down .
The creepy feeling had washed over me , but I pushed it away and decided there was no way I was going to be scared by some fuckheads .
Above me , the door to the stairwell opened .
When it closed , the lights in the stairwell went out .
I rolled my shoulders , a habit I 'd picked up , and pushed my way through the darkness till I found the stairwell exit .
Growling to myself , I pushed out and into the hallway , and found the handle of the door that led into the furnace room .
It took me a minute to unlock it .
There was muted impact noises from the stairwell , but I ignored them .
There were 3 windows in that stairwell , and it was n't outside the realm of possibility that one of them had air leaking and making it thump .
I opened the door to the furnace room , and the lights turned on in the hallway , flooding the area with hard white light .
Fuck you .
I ai n't afriad of you .
I moved into the room , following the sketch I 'd made of the map in my little green notebook .
How the fuck did we miss it , it was between the water heater and the furnace ?
The gritty black dirt made crunching noises under my boots , and I could hear the whisper of rats in the darkness .
A thread of dark thought bubbled up to the surface of my mind .
If I was to trip , and get knocked out , would they come to eat me ?
Followed by : " How the fuck did they survive all these years out here ? "
I did n't want to know .
I found the breaker boxes .
Three huge metal boxes , with words in German written on them .
I did n't read German , and I did n't care .
I opened the box , and stood there staring .
Fuses .
Fucking fuses and each box had a large switch .
The kind that you grab the wooden handle and move it up or down .
I used the flashlight to look around , and found a box of fuses on top of the middle box .
Looking carefully , I checked each fuse through the glass .
Often having to rub the glass clean .
I heard murmmuring behind me and ignored it .
I heard footsteps and ignored them .
I heard breathing and blew it off .
I was a US Army soldier , I 'll be goddamned if I was going to run away just because it was dark and creepy .
Of course it was , it was a goddamn basement of a 50 year old building , of course it was creepy .
I had to replace 6 fuses , and two of the bus - bars needed thrown back .
It needed about a dozen more fuses , but I 'd gone through the box I 'd found .
THe fuses had the double lightning bolts of the SS on them .
Talk about a fucking ego .
I closed the fuse boxes , reloaded the feeder chute on the furnace .
and walked , slowly , back to the exit .
Once again , I heard that weird creak .
But since I was holding my balls in my hands , I did n't break out running .
I bounced up and down on my toes , and noticed that there was a slight give to the ground beneath me .
What .
The .
Fuck ?
It suddenly dawned on me , and I jumped away , backing toward the door .
The sub basement .
We could n't find the access , because I was the only one who'd come down to the furnace room .
The building plans still had the old German markings , they were the original Nazi blueprints , that 's the only reason we knew that there was a sub - basement , but the access was n't listed .
Nobody would have found it .
Who the fuck would have dug in that grainy black dirt , that dirty that felt sticky and unclean , for a fucking access ?
I headed back out , sighing in relief when I locked the door to that fucking basement .
I walked back up the stairs , relishing the cold white light of the lightbulbs , and then headed down thehallway to the CQ area .
When I pushed through the double doors , I saw Stokes come out of the office behind the CQ area .
Captain Bishop was behind the desk in the little room , with the cardboard box that the LT had made me drag down to the CO office .
SFC Vickers looked up from something he was writing on and waved at me .
" Private Monkey , they fixed the land lines between us and post , we have phone usage .
Grab a bite to eat . "
He told me .
I nodded , went over and got my mess kit from my little nest in the day room .
I went into the bathroom , and washed out my mess kit , then scooped up some greenish looking eggs with leathery looking ham embedded in the clumps .
Eating while I walked , I went into the day room and sat down in my nest .
I ate in silence , happy to fill my gut with lukewarm eggs and Korean War ham .
Fucked up thing , the food I 'd eaten in Juvie was worse than this shit I had shovelled out of one of the two tins from a green container .
Finishing up , I went and washed out my mess kit and put it back .
" Private Monkey , Captain Bishop wants you . "
Thompson told me , coming out of the CQ area .
I nodded and went up to the office door and knocked three times , just like military ettiquette demanded .
" Enter . "
I walked in , and stood at attention in front of the desk .
" Have a seat , Private . "
I sat down , curious as to what was going on .
" I'm Captian Bishop , temorary CO until the unit is fully up to speed . " he began , holding a folder .
I recognised it as my command PRP records .
The PRP records came with carrying as TS - SSBI security clearance .
" I see that you had a choice of joining the military or being tried as an adult . "
He started .
" Yes , sir . "
" And you have to complete a three year tour of the military , or if you are chaptered out , you will go to jail . "
" Yes , sir . "
" It says here you were transported to Basic Training in hand cuffs , and transported from Basic Traiing to AIT in handcuffs . "
" Yes , sir . "
" I expected , when I looked at the rest of your record , that I would find low level performance at best . "
I waited .
" I was pleasantly surprised .
Graduated top of Basic Training , you were the Distinquished Honor Graduate of your AIT , and were promoted .
You 've also been decorated twice , both of them Army Achievement Medals , for your performance , and there are letters of commendation from your instructors . "
THe last part was new to me .
" I do n't know why you are here .
I suspect you got screwed by someone who only read the details of your military entry .
Well , we 're all in this together , so I expect you to keep up your current standard . "
" Yes , sir . "
" Any questions ? " he asked me .
" Yes , sir . "
He raised an eyebrow , and I continued .
" What is this unit , sir ?
Where is everyone else ?
Why the hell are we so far away from the rest of post ?
Why does n't anyone know we are out here ? "
He held up his hands .
" Department of the Army just reactivated this unit two months ago , Private .
We 're a special weapons unit , which means that ... "
He lectured me on the new unit , and what it boiled down to , is with a recent round of SALT talks , things were going to change in Western Germany .
The places we worked were classified , the contents of the bunkers would be classified , if asked , we 'd say were part of the Military Intelligence group .
Our phone calls to the States would be limited .
Our incoming and outgoing mail would be read and screened by the guys from MI .
We were restricted to post unless we recieved permission to leave post .
He summed it with a saying I would use to define my life .
" Cold War bullshit , Private Monkey .
Dismissed . "
I left , and Captain Bishop called in Private Meyer .
SFC Vickers waved me over .
" You have CQ tonight .
The phones are working , so if anyone comes in after hours , they have our number to call us so we can go get any newbies . "
A moan drifted down the hall .
" Where the hell were you ? "
" I did a recon for the fuse box . "
" Did you find it ? " " Yeah , and I found something else . "
" What ? "
" The access to the sub - basement .
I found it when I was walking back from replacing a bunch of the fuses . "
SFC Vickers looked startled .
" I 'll need about 20 more fuses to bring everything up to speed . "
I told him .
He wrote that down in his notebook .
" Sub - basement ?
It 's on the blueprints , but nobody has found it . "
He told me .
" Stokes , Tandy , Cobb !
Grab your flashlights and come on ! "
He turned back to me .
" Show me .
Let 's find out what kind of secrets this building holds . "
We gathered up , and SFC Vickers made sure we got all our cold weather gear .
Just in case .
Belted up , covered in cold weather gear , with flashlights and extra batteries , we headed back to the furnace room .
" Hey , Stokes . " I whispered .
" Yeah ? "
We were trailing everyone else .
" Ever read the Shining ? " I asked .
" Want a broken jaw ? "
She asked .
I shut up .
We went into the room , and it took me about 10 minutes to find the place where the floor cracked beneath my feet .
PFC Tandy and Cobb grabbed the coal shovels , and we shoveled the dirt from over that spot .
There was about 2 inches of dirt over a concrete floor .
Over the wooden planks that made up the access hatch to the sub - basement .
The concrete was old , blackened by age ( I told myself ) , and smelled funny .
Cobb used the shovel to bust the rusty old lock on the trapdoor , which was about a half - dozen planks .
THey used the shovels to pry the door up .
And our flashlights dimmed , flickered , and went out .
Stokes screamed .
* BANG BANG BANG * came from upstairs .
I screamed .
I unscrewed my flashlight while everyone was cursing , dropped out the batteries , dug batteries out of my pocket , and reloaded my flashlight .
The beam came on stark and white , illuminating Cobb 's tightly drawn and pale face .
" Replace your batteries . "
I said , forcing my voice to stay steady .
I heard everyone murmur , and handed Tandy an extra pair of batteries .
It took a moment , and everyone got their batteries replaced .
" Open that hatch . " SFC Vickers ordered .
I stepped on the shovel , and worked my gloved fingernails under the lip of the hatch , and putting my legs and back into it , I heaved the hatch open .
Out flashlight beams illuminated a set of wooden stairs going into the darkness , and the weak beams could not pierce the black gloom that surrounded the ladder .
" What the fuck is that smell ? "
Tandy asked .
It smelled .
Bad .
It reminded me of an old deer carcass I 'd found .
" I do n't know .
Private Monkey , lead the way . "
I stepped onto the steps , and heard them creak and splinter .
Nervous , I moved down the stairs , expecting them to give out and sending me crashing to the unseen floor , breaking my legs , and leaving me as food fu guys stay here , I 'll fucking check .
This place is n't fucking haunted , it is n't fucking full of dead goddamn Nazi's , it 's just a creepy old fucking building .
FUck you guys . "
I swore , stomping off into the darkness .
Behind me , someone cocked at .45 .
My whole body was covered in goosebumps tight enough to make my skin ache .
My boots clomped on the old concrete , and I stepped into a puddle of water that had seeped in .
I was trying to control my breathing , and even though I was dressed in a parka , cold weather pants , field jacket , and winter BDU's , I was freezing .
I was also sweating at the base of my spine and between my shoulders .
My flashlight caught something , and curious , I moved over to it .
Crates .
Dozens of them , they stretched out into the darkness .
" FOUND SOMETHING ! " I yelled .
silence back .
" HEY !
I found something ! " silence .
" YOU FUCKERS BETTER NOT HAVE LEFT ME ! I SWEAR I'LL KILL YOU ! " I yelled .
" We 're right here , Private Monkey , calm down . "
I heard SFC Vickers tell me .
His pale face loomed out of the darkness , and he bore a striking resemblence to the hero of The Thing and it gave me the chills .
" What is it ? " " Did n't you ... you know what , I do n't want to know . "
I stated .
" It 's crates , lots of them . "
I flashed my flashlight on the side , showing the old emblem that was still visible despite it 's age .
An eagle .
A swastika .
" Holy Jesus . "
Stokes breathed , thumping up next to us .
" Jesus does n't know about this place . "
Tandy replied .
I shrugged , and looked at the lid of the crate .
SFC Vickers slapped a bayonet into my hand , I started prying on the lid .
The lid gave with a screech , and Cobb giggled , a sharp , brittle sound .
The crate contained boxes , all marked with the same emblem that was on the map of the building .
" Open one . " SFC Vickers ordered .
I shrugged , grabbed a box , and tore it open .
Sheathed knives fell out .
Four of them .
" Holy mother of God . "
Stokes whispered as I bent over , picked one up , and lifted it .
It was an old Nazi SS dagger .
The crate must have contained hundreds of them .
SFC VIckers shined his flashlight around , and draped on one wall was the Nazi flag .
Our flashlights chose that time to die .
I bent down , tucked the dagger in my boot , and dug out my last set of batteries .
When my flashlight came back on , I swept it over everyone 's faces .
" Let 's get the fuck out of here . "
SFC Vickers said , and I grunted in agreement .
I had to lead the way , and we slung the trapdoor back over .
We headed back to the door at a quicktime , and all laughed nervously when SFC Vickers locked the door .
" Monkey , did you keep that dagger ? "
Stokes said , pointing at my boot .
" Yeah .
I wanted proof .
If we get upstairs , and there 's nothing wrong with it , then this place is n't haunted . "
I replied , almost challengingly .
We walked back to the CQ area , and found out that Mann and Carter had gone to get us lunch and dinner .
While SFC Vickers made his report to Captian Bishop , I pulled the sheathed dagger out of my boot and tossed it on the CQ counter .
" Where the fuck did you get that ? "
Smith asked .
" Sub - basement .
There 's a shitload of crates down there . "
I answered .
" One of them had these in them . "
" Aw man , this is fucked . " he said .
" We 're in a goddamn haunted building . "
" You wanna know what 's worse ? " I asked , grinning .
" What ?
What could be fucking worse ? "
Smith asked .
" You 're black . " I told him .
He stood there , staring at me for a moment .
Then he started laughing .
I was laughing with him , and vaugely aware that Tandy had gone into the bathroom .
Smith handed me a bottle of Jack Daniels , and I took a deep hit off of it .
" This is just fucked . "
Smith said .
" I do n't know whether I feel better or worse that the CO does n't seem to care we 're drinking during duty hours . "
I took another hit off the bottle and passed it back .
" Who fucking cares .
This is bullshit . "
I replied .
Mann and Carter came in the doors , carrying two mermites each .
Everyone bustled around , and we passed around the bottle and ate a hot lunch .
" Private Monkey ? " Captian Bishop asked , looking at me over his mess kit .
" Yes , sir ? "
" You have CQ tonight .
Sergeant Vickers tells me you are n't afriad of that furnace room , so it will be your job to keep the furnace running . "
WHAT !
GIMME A BREAK !
" Yes , sir . "
The rest of the day went with us gathered up in groups , talking about the banging from upstairs .
We were sitting eating dinner when I noticed something .
" Hey , where 's Tandy ? " I asked .
There were only 19 of us sitting there .
" Who ? " Captain Bishop asked .
" Private Tandy .
He 's missing . "
I said .
" Has anyone seen Private Tandy ? " SFC Vickers asked .
Nobody had .
I brought up that I 'd seen him go into the bathroom .
" COme with me , Monkey . "
SFC Vickers ordered .
I set down my dinner , stood up , and together we went into the bathroom .
" Private Tandy , are you in here ? "
Vickers called .
" All you all right ?
Do you need assistance ? "
" YOU BETTER BE BEATING OFF ! " I yelled .
Vickers looked at me with a grin , and we stepped around the small corner .
Two stalls , two urinals , two sinks .
No window .
A shaving kit was scattered on the counter between the sinks , and I stared at it as SFC Vickers checked each stall .
" He 's gone . " I said .
SFC VIckers turned and looked at me .
" They got him . "
" Bullshit .
We 've all been drinking today .
He must have gotten drunk and wandered off . "
Vickers answered .
" And left his shaving gear ? " I asked .
" Hell , I got drunk and left my wallet in a Korean whorehouse . "
Vickers answered .
I nodded .
" Anyway , he 's not in here .
Let 's go check his room . "
We left and Captain Bishop looked up .
" He 's not in there , we 're going to check his room . "
Vickers told the CO .
" All right , everyone , split up .
Stokes , you 're here with me .
Everone else , go looking for Tandy . "
Captian Bishop ordered .
" Monkey , Sergeant Vickers , the two of you check the furnace room . "
" Yes , sir . " SFC Vickers said .
I stayed silent , but made a point to reach over the counter and grab the SS dagger .
Fuck the dumb shit , I 'm not going down there unarmed .
We walked by the groups opening rooms and checking inside , through the double doors , then into the stairwell .
" Jesus , Monkey , do you think he came down here ? "
Vickers asked , wiping his mouth .
" No . I think they got him . "
I admitted honestly .
I did n't know who , or what , they were , but I was seriously beginning to believe we were n't alone in the building .
I was seriously beginning to believe something was wrong in this building .
When SFC Vickers opened the door of the furnace room , I could see the cherry glow from the furnace at the far end .
I 'd never seen that before , and it made a chill run down my back .
The wind howled , and the door slammed shut behind me , cutting off the light from the stairwell .
I clicked on my faithful OD Green flashlight , drew the SS Dagger , and ventured deeper in .
" Tandy ?
TANDY !
You better not be fucking with ME ! " I called out .
The breathing of the water heater answered me .
I 'd taken a step , and my boot came down on empty air , and I fell forward , dropping the knife and my flashlight as I plunged forward .
I went through wood , and slammed onto concrete , knocking the wind out of me and filling my vision with stars .
The thick parka saved me from any real injury , but my breathing was painful .
My flashlight was laying about 10 feet from me .
And I 'd fallen through empty air and into the sub - basement , smashing the steps as I fell .
" Tandy ? "
I called out softly , rolling over and crawling to my flashlight .
" Tandy ? " I grabbed my flashlight and shined the beam around , the light catching the dagger .
I scooted over to it , scooped it up , and hefted the weight in my hand .
They did n't teach knife fighting in the Army , but the first rule of knife fighting is that you will get cut .
Expect it , accept it , and cut the other guy while he thinks victory is his .
Do n't spin the knife .
Do n't toss it from one hand to the other .
Do n't do any lunges showing off .
Keep it low , to the side , angled upward , for a slash across their body or arms , or a straight thrust under the ribs .
The Army did n't teach recruits knife fighting .
My father taught knife fighting .
I shined the flashlight around in the darkness , looking for whatever was in there .
There were broken planks around where I 'd landed , and the light shined off of puddles of ice and slush .
Water was leaking into the sub - basement from somewhere , and shining my light above me , at the cieling , showed icecicle nubs and full blown icecicles hanging from the steel beams that supported the concrete floor that was covered with dirt in the basement above me .
" MONKEY ! WHERE ARE YOU ! " sounded from above me .
" IN THE SUBBASEMENT !
WATCH IT , THE HATCH IS OPEN ! "
A light flashed down , and I moved over to stand in the puddle of the beam .
" You all right ? " SFC Vickers asked .
" I could n't get the door open , the wind was whipping down the stairwell .
" Yeah , that seems to fucking happen . "
I swore , flashing my light around .
" My fucking ribs and back hurt . "
Hey , what was that ?
" Just a second . " I told him , and walked over .
It was a pack of Malboro's , Tandy 's brand .
I picked it up , opened it up , and lit one with shaking hands .
I did n't smoke .
I walked back into the puddle of light from SFC Vicker 's flashlight and looked up into the beam , squinting .
" I think he was down here .
I found a pack of cigarettes .
Malboros . " I called up .
There was a pause .
" I think I dropped them .
I smoke Malboros . "
SFC Vickers called down .
" Toss 'em up , I need a smoke . "
I slipped three out and put them in my pocket , then tossed the pack up .
" Thanks .
Are you all right ? "
" Yeah , I said I 'm fucking fine .
It 's cold and creepy down here . "
" Can you hang on , we 're going to have to get a rope , the stairs are all fucked up . "
SFC Vickers called down .
Fucker was going to leave me .
" I 'll be fine . " " Here. Catch . "
Something dropped from above , and I grabbed it , dropping the knife .
It was one of our two .45's .
I stuck it in the belt of my parka and picked up the knife , sheathing it in my boot , and drew the .45 .
" Look , you may have to shoot Tandy , can you do that ? "
Vickers asked .
" Yes , sergeant .
I can utilize lethal force against Private Tandy if I deem it necessary . "
I said , in formal , clipped tones .
" Good .
I 'll be right back . "
He told me , and the light vanished .
Fucker .
I checked my watched , and sighed in acceptance .
My watch was shattered , broken all to shit by the fall .
Something moved out in the darkness , and I realized I was in the middle of the room , without a wall to my back .
I started backing up , figuring the left wall was closer .
I could hear something moving , and I could hear the sound of breathing from somewhere in the darkness .
It 's just the fucking water heater .
Be a goddamn man .
When I bumped into the wall , I jumped , and something dropped on me from above , enveloping me , grabbing my arms and legs , and smothering me .
I fired the pistol three times in rapid succession , yelling and struggling .
I managed to tear my way free of the grip of my assailant , and fired into it 's shape on the ground , hearing the bullet richocet and whine off into the darkness to smash into something .
That Nazi flag would n't fuck with me again .
I 'd kicked its fucking ass .
I picked up my flashlight from where the beam was illuminating part of the white circle and the red of the background , and shined it to my left and right .
There were posters on the wall on my left , and a map on my right .
Aw fuck .
This was n't just where the crates were stored , they used to do stuff in here .
My brain summoned up the image of jewish men and women screaming as " approved torture " techniques were used , the faces of men smiling as they strangled victims to display their technique and skill , or to teach an audience .
Fuck this , I 'll go back to jail .
Well , I was n't going to get any un-lonlier down here .
I went over and looked at the map .
I was n't sure what the map was of , but I figured it was of part of Germany .
There were markings and stuff I was unfamiliar with , but I did recognise the international symbol of a box with an X through it .
Someone had been tracking military units in here .
The further I went down the wall , the stronger that musty smell began to be .
I could hear bootsteps echoing around me , I could hear breathing , but I blew them off .
If Tandy was down here , if he loomed out of the darkness , I was n't even going to warn him , I was going to blow his ass away .
Fuck him .
I reached the corner , and discovered desks lined up against the wall .
Shining my flashlight into the room itself , there were more desks , and I could dimly see something different .
If I 'm gonna get eaten by cannible undead Nazi reverse snow vampires , I might as well check some shit out before it happens .
I walked over there , being careful at one point when I was walking across ice .
It was a podium , with the Nazi SS logo on the front .
I was kind of disappointement that there was n't a book , or a speech , laid out .
There was a riding crop ( how fucking cliche ) on the podium .
Bummer .
I finished a circuit , weaving my way through boxed I really did n't want to open .
I was n't sure where the smell was coming from , or even what it was , and was kind of relieved .
My curiosity had overwhelmed fear .
* BANG * I brought up the .45 and spun slowly in place .
I could hear breathing , always behind me .
I was breathing hard , my breath visible in the light of my flashlight .
Nothing , but I could still here the breathing .
" PRIVATE MONKEY !
Are you down there ? "
I heard .
Flashlight beams lanced down through the opening , a good fifty feet away , and I ran into the puddle of light , looking up .
" Throw me a rope ! " " Did you find Tandy ? "
" FUCK TANDY ! THROW ME A GODDAMN ROPE ! " the breathing was heavier , and I could feel the darkness closing around me .
Those fucking Nazi's had been holding a class on tracking us one by one through the building and killing us , to bring us down here and eat us while we screamed .
The rope fell from the opening , and I tucked the pistol into the belt of my parka , dropped the flashlight into the pocket , and climbed up the rope .
Fear and desperation lent me a lot of strength , and I was up it in a flash .
" Did you find him ? " SFC Vickers asked .
" No .
There 's no - one down there . "
I told him .
He held out his hand , and I stared at it .
" The pistol , Private . "
He said .
I grunted and handed it to him .
" Let 's go , we 'll regroup at the CQ area , and see what anyone else found . "
SFC Vickers was saying .
Everyone kept asking me what I 'd seen , but I just mumbled as we walked up the stairs .
As we headed down the hallway , the lights snapped off , and while everyone else cursed , I just stayed silent .
As long as it was just the lights , I could n't give a shit less anymore .
Everyone was gathered in the CQ area , and I took a quick headcount .
18 . Wait , what ?
I counted again , came up with the same number , and sheepishly remembered to count myself .
Nineteen .
We were all here .
The search had turned up nothing .
Captain Bishop and Stokes checked my ribs .
Stokes was a goddamn 91A , a fucking medic , she should n't even be in the unit , but she was here just like the rest of us .
I was wrong , this was n't Active Duty .
The bus I had been on had slid out in the snow , and my body had n't been recovered yet .
I was dead .
Those dark thoughts followed me when Cobb and I took CQ .
" You OK , Monkey ? " Cobb asked .
We both ignored the lights flicking on and off at the end of the hallway .
" Yeah , just hurt . " I replied .
The crashing came from upstairs , and a scream echoed down the stairwell .
" Have a slug . "
He told me , holding out the bottle of Ausbach .
Our breath steamed in the air , but I knew I 'd reloaded the furnace .
It was just ... well ... it just was n't getting to us tonight .
When the phone ring , we both jumped .
Cobb dropped the bottle , and I just stared at the ringing phone while he scrambled after the bottle .
" Answer the fucking phone ! " he yelled .
I grabbed at , and then had to chase it .
" 2/19th Special Weapons , Private Monkey , how can I help you , sir or ma'am ? " I rattled off .
Silence .
" Hello ? " I asked .
Cobb was staring at me .
HHHHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssss
It was low , gravelly , and liquid .
" It 's for you . "
I said , holding the phone out to Cobb .
-----------
That 's it for the night .
Sorry , gang .
There 's more , detailing the first week I had in Germany .
Complete with what happened to Cobb , what was in the sub - basement , and more .
" 2/19th Special Weapons , Private Monkey , how can I help you , sir or ma'am ? " I rattled off .
Silence .
" Hello ? " I asked .
Cobb was staring at me .
HHHHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssss
It was low , gravelly , and liquid .
" It 's for you . "
I said , holding the phone out to Cobb .
Cobb looked at the phone , took it , and put it to his ear .
I could hear the sibilant hiss , the liquid exhale of air , even though Cobb was the one who held the phone .
Cobb dropped the phone , and lept up , grabbing me by my throat and slamming me against the wall .
He was squeezing hard , and his face was red .
" WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING ! " he screamed .
I slammed my arms up between his , breaking his grip , and slammed my forehead into his face .
His nose crunched , and I kneed him in the balls , he stepped back , and I stepped forward and slammed my right forearm into his face , knocking him down .
Before he got up , I slammed a boot into his stomach .
He was curled up in a ball on the floor , and I could hear a busy signal coming from the swinging phone reciever .
" Do n't ever fucking touch me again , asswipe . "
I snarled , rubbing my throat .
The day room door burst open , and SFC Vickers stood there , the .45 in his hand .
I 'd seen that pistol in his hands more lately than I saw it the first few days I was here .
" What 's going on ? "
He asked , walking toward us .
Cobb was still sitting up , holding his nose .
" Nothing . " he said .
" We were just having a discussion . " I lied .
I 'd learned the way the military worked .
If nobody talked , nothing happened , and fights between men were rarely reported .
If you laid your hands on another man , and he kicked your ass , well , you were just shit out of luck .
I reached over and hung up the phone .
" Cobb 's nose is bleeding . "
SFC Vickers stated , the master of the obvious .
I was starting to realize that maybe there was more to him getting sent here than just fucking someone 's wife .
He 'd left me alone in that goddamn hole , and he always made sure all of us were first into a room .
" I hit myself in the face with the phone . "
Cobb replied , putting two fingers on each side of his nose .
WIth a crunch , he set it .
I picked up the phone and hung it up .
SFC Vickers looked at both of us curiously , then went back to the day room .
" Jesus Christ , Monkey , where did you learn to fight like that ? "
Cobb asked , wiping his nose off with the hem of his shirt .
" We moved a lot . " I told him .
" Bullshit . "
" It 's the truth . " I was being serious .
I had n't learned much in Juvie , just got better at what I was doing .
" Goddamn , son , remind me not to tangle with you again . "
Cobb told me .
" Sorry about that . "
I was honestly embarassed .
The phone rang again , and both of us stared at it .
" Don't . "
Cobb said , when I started to reach for it .
" Just . Don't . "
The phone kept ringing .
My mouth was dry , and my imagination was running wild .
I knew it was Tandy on the other line .
That hiss was him trying to speak , to call to us for help , while some dead Nazi wrapped boney fingers around his throat and squeezed like Cobb had done to me .
" Answer that goddamn phone ! " SFC Vickers yelled , stomping into the room .
He had that fucking pistol in his hand again , and was looking a little too wild - eyed for my taste .
" No . " Cobb replied .
I just shrugged .
" Answer the phone , Private . "
SFC VIckers was a bit ominous .
I 'd begun to notice things about him .
" Fuck it . "
I snarled , and grabbed the phone .
" 2/19th Special Weapons , Private Monkey , how can I help you , sir or ma'am ? "
Nothing , just whispering silence .
" Hello ? " I knew it was coming .
Hssssssssss
Low , sibilant , bubbly .
The hair that did n't exist on my head stood straight up .
" It 's for you , Sergeant . "
I said , in my best dead - pan voice .
He snatched the phone out of my hand .
" Sergeant First Class Vickers speaking . "
He said .
I noticed it was nearly a fawning tone .
He stood there , and his eyes widened .
He threw the phone at me , bouncing it off my chest .
My bruised ribs twinged .
" You think this is goddamn funny , Private ? " he yelled .
" Not particularly , no . " I told him .
" No , what ? " he asked .
There was a pretty large vien writhing on his forehead .
" No , Sergeant . " I answered .
" THEN WHO WAS THAT ? " he screamed at me .
Behind him , I could see the door to the dayroom open , with Captain Bishop coming out .
" Maybe it was Tandy . " I said .
I wanted to feed him that goddamn pistol .
It was n't pointed at me , but it was n't pointed away from me either .
I hung up the phone , and did n't care that my hand was shaking .
" Think this shit is funny , Private ?
All these bullshit spooky sounds , just happening to find a bunch of old Nazi bullshit , all the lights switching off .
Think this is a good game of ' Scare the Sergeant ' or some shit ? "
He was pointing the pistol at me , jabbing with each word .
" What 's the problem , Sergeant ? " Captain Bishop asked .
Vickers whirled around , pistol still in his hand , and Captain Bishop grabbed the barrel .
" Relinquish the weapon , soldier . "
He ordered .
Sergeant Vickers let it go .
" Privates Cobb and Monkey think they 're comedians . "
Vickers said , whirling around .
I was starting to wonder what he heard .
* ring ring * Cobb and I turned to stare at the phone .
So did Vickers and Bishop .
Stokes and Mann were coming out of the dayroom .
Even sleepily disheveled , Stokes looked good .
The cold perked her nipples through her T - shirt , hard buttons of top of those huge titties .
** ring ring ** " Gentlemen ? " Captian Bishop asked .
The phone rang again .
We all were looking at him .
" Are n't you going to answer it ? " ** ring ring ** " 2/19th Special Weapons , Private Monkey , how can I help you , sir or ma'am ? " I repeated into the reciever .
Nothing .
" 2/19th Special Weapons , Private Monkey , how can I help you , sir or ma'am ? "
I said again , slowly and distinctly .
Still nothing .
This is new .
" 2/19th Special Weapons , Private Monkey , how can I help you , sir or ma'am ? "
I asked a little more forcefully .
SSSSssssssssssss .
" It 's for you . "
I said , handing the phone to Captian Bishop .
" Captain Bishop speaking , how may I hel .... " his face turned a greyish color .
" WHO IS THIS ? " he shouted .
He held the phone out at arms length , and we could all hear it .
Breathe in .
HHHHHhhhhhhhhhhssssssssssssss Breathe out .
SSSSSssssssssssssss
I grabbed it out of his hand , and slammed it down .
" What the fuck was that ? "
He asked .
" Tandy . " I told him .
" Where 's Tandy ? "
Stokes asked , holding onto her arms and shivering .
The lights in the hallway clicked off , and a low moan echoed down the hallway and stairwell in tandem .
I could see one flickering bulb at the far end of the hall .
Nobody answered her .
" What happened to your face , Cobb ? " Bishop asked .
" I fell . "
Cobb said .
Bishop looked at me , looked at my hands , then shrugged .
" What 's going on ? "
Mann was looking fairly confused .
Cobb lit two cigarettes and passed me one .
I did n't smoke , but I took it anyway .
" We do n't know , something is ... " * ring ring * " Fuck you ! "
I yelled , the anger , the rage , at all this bullshit boiled to the surface .
I grabbed the phone and slung it against the wall , shattering the black plastic casing .
" RING NOW , BITCH ! "
Behind me , the whole phone bank , with the exception of our dedicated Fifth Corps line , started ringing .
I stood there , facing the wall , and the broken plastic , while the other black phones , identical twins of their freshly murdered brother , began sounding out .
" Don't . " Captain Bishop breathed .
" Don't .
Answer .
The.
Phones . "
The lights went off in the CQ area , and up above , the boots thundered on the floor while the phones screamed .
I squeezed shut my eyes , nad wished I 'd wake up in my cell .
Behind me , in the darkness , the phones were ringing .
Behind me , four men and a woman were standing .
Above me , boots slammed onto the floor , and a scream roared down the hallway .
" Fuck this . "
I snarled , spinning around .
I began grabbing phones and yanking them from the wall plugs .
Fuck whoever was calling , I did n't feel like talking on the phone .
The lights buzzed on , slowly , and the crashing stopped , before I had even yanked the third one free .
I kept going though , I wanted this shit over .
Cobb 's nose was bleeding again , and if those dead Nazi 's smelled it , they'd be on us like a hooker on a cock wrapped with $ 50's .
" Everyone into the dayroom .
Private Monkey , secure all the doors . "
Captain Bishop ordered .
Everyone rushed past as I picked up the keyring .
I picked the cigarette off the ground from where I 'd dropped it .
I did n't smoke , I just felt more comfortable with it in my hand .
By the time I was done locking the hallway doors , it was only Captian Bishop and myself in the room .
As I passed him , he handed me the .45 .
" Just in case , son . "
He told me .
I nodded , and pushed through the first set of doors to outside .
Outside , I could see the bare streets , with snow pulled off the banks being blown by the wind sparkling in the lights at the end of the short brick walk that led from the road to the front doors .
I locked the doors , and stared for a moment at the slope of the hill across from us .
The LT 's car was still parked out there .
I wondered if he was inside of it , coated in ice , or maybe sharing a smoke with Tandy .
At the top of the hill was a fence , with concertina wire on top .
I could n't make out the guard towers , but knew they were up there .
I could see the two CUC - V's , and the five ton .
Still , I locked the doors .
To the left , one time .
THey 'd open with a push against the bar , but not from the outside .
I backed up , and pulled open the door , never taking my eyes from the glass doors .
Now was when the body came flying through the glass , and we were already down a man , already there was somebody missing that could be slung through the glass at me .
I backed into the CQ area , and locked the inner doors .
I could still see outside , and still see the missing LT 's car .
He was in there , listening to Duran Duran , smoking a cigarette , and planning on coming in here and ripping my throat out .
THen he 'd drink my blood .
Then he'd gnaw the flesh from my ...
I shook my head to clear away those thoughts .
Fuck him .
I bet I could whip some undead butterbars ass .
I was Private Monkey , bad motherfucker .
Killing machine .
Twisted steel and sex appeal .
All the women love a killer .
" You alright , Private ? " Captain Bishop asked .
He sounded genuinely concerned , so I answered him while I locked the door to the stairwell .
" Dark monkey thoughts . " I told him .
" Monkey ? " " YEs , sir .
My father called my brothers and I his ' monkey - boys ' out of affection .
I 'm a good climber . "
I told him .
" Oh . I thought you were saying something else . " he admitted .
" We all bleed and die the same , sir . "
I answered , letting him know I knew what he meant by those words .
The hallway door locked firmly , the two bathroom doors did not , niether did the empty room that read " REC ROOM " above the doorjam .
The boots had stopped stomping , but we were still working by flashlight .
I knew there was n't breakers tripping , it was fuses , so that meant that the wiring was bad .
That was it , just bad wiring .
The wind was coming in through the walls , and shifting the wiring .
Tandy had gotten drunk , or maybe he was despondent about his spank - sock rejecting , or something , and had gone outside .
" Private Monkey , why is there an SS dagger stuck in your boot ? "
Captain Bishop asked me .
" We found a bunch of crates , and Sergeant Vickers left me alone in that sub-basement .
I'm a soldier , I 'm more comfortable with a weapon in my hands . "
I shrugged .
" You can have it . "
" They are illegal here in Germany .
We have to turn Nazi paraphanelia over to our German hosts so they can destroy it . "
Captain Bishop looked thoughtful .
" How many do you think were down there ? "
" Well , sir , the sub - basement extends roughly the length of the building and * CRASH CRASH CRASH * " KEEP IT DOWN UP THERE , ASSHOLES ! " ( that got me a funny look ) " and I 'd estimate about a quarter of it is full of crates .
Some of them are different sizes , so I doubt they are all knives .
There 's also a torn Nazi flag with bulletholes in it . "
I finished .
" Let 's go get some shut - eye , son . " Captain Bishop told me .
I noticed he did n't ask for the .45 back , nor did he ask me to give up my knife .
I went in the day room , found my little nest , and closed my eyes .
I heard Captain Bishop lock the dayroom door before I fell asleep , but not much else .
-------------------------------
Breakfast was lukewarm mermite eggs and kangaroo meat .
I kept catching myself doing headcount , and Cobb visibly flinched every time a screamed howled out from the hallway , the stairwell , or from above us .
" Listen up , men . " Captain Bishop ordered .
We all paid attention to him while we kept eating .
" Sergeant Vickers and SPC Carter will be going into post .
We 're going to have MI put a tap on our phones .
They will also bringing back dinner and tomorrows meals .
Private Cobb will be taking the 5 - ton and getting us two light sets , a one point five
Rehabilitating force ( Image : Jenn Shock / chronic - shock / Flickr )
WHEN Ross Clark read in New Scientist ( 29 March 2008 , p 26 ) that the US military considered the Nintendo Wiimote controller accurate enough to control bomb disposal robots , it set him thinking .
Could the Wii ’s skiing and snowboarding attachment , the balance board , help rehabilitate people who have had a stroke ?
“ I wanted to know if it would be any good for assessing the standing balance of patients , ” says Clark .
He reasoned that being able to measure the centre of pressure of a person ’s foot will be useful to a physio who is helping someone relearn how to stand .
Yet the lab - grade …

Also , wikipedia has just become so solid a source that it ’s hard to contribute anything that feels valuable without really putting a lot of effort into it .
I made a lot more edits back when proper nouns were misspelled .
Now , fixing a comma splice does n’t have the same satisfaction .

As I hinted at in my CNN.com column of yesterday , those self - identified free - speech champions who are crying in their Cheerios today over Citizens United v. the FEC are able to get to what many of us think is a contradictory position by pretending that the free - speech objection to campaign finance reform is a smokescreen for enabling the Corporatey Corporates ( and their puppets , the Republican Party ) .
For instance , The New York Times editorial board :
Disingenuously waving the flag of the First Amendment , the court 's conservative majority has paved the way for corporations to use their vast treasuries to overwhelm elections and intimidate elected officials into doing their bidding . [… ]
[ A ] conservative majority has distorted the political system to ensure that Republican candidates will be at an enormous advantage in future elections .
Or The American Prospect 's Scott Lemieux :
The central line of argument in Justice Kennedy 's majority opinion — that the First Amendment does not permit distinctions based on the identity of the speaker — is superficially attractive .
The problem is , there 's no reason to believe that any of the justices believe it .
Lemieux at least points to other Supreme Court cases to build a case for hypocrisy , but what 's striking here is the inability to even pretend to take debate opponents at face value .
When arguments are disingenuous , that apparently obviates the need to engage them .
Thus , petulant hand - waving like : " Libertarians agree that letting corporations have more influence over the political process than ordinary citizens is excellent for the cause of freedom . "
Ordinary citizens like … Russ Howard and Steve Cicero , who launched an unsuccessful grassroots recall campaign against a politician they considered corrupt , then were given a fine for campaign finance violations eight times the amount of money they had raised for it ?
Or how about ( of all things ! ) the Supreme Court case in question , where documentary filmmakers faced jail if they broadcast a movie that made a politician look bad during election season ?
Or how about this description in yesterday 's decision of what regulated political speech looks like in practice ?
Campaign finance regulations now impose " unique and complex rules " on " 71 distinct entities . "
These entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different types of political speech .
The FEC has adopted 568 pages of regulations , 1,278 pages of explanations and justifications for those regulations , and 1,771 advisory opinions since 1975 .
In fact , after this Court in WRTL [ the 2007 Wisconsin Right to Life case ] adopted an objective " appeal to vote " test for determining whether a communication was the functional equivalent of express advocacy , the FEC adopted a two - part , 11 - factor balancing test to implement WRTL 's ruling .
This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on speech in the strict sense of that term , for prospective speakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place .
As a practical matter , however , given the complexity of the regulations and the deference courts show to administrative determinations , a speaker who wants to avoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak .
The plight of " ordinary citizens " is precisely the reason why non-Republicans like me ( let alone many conservatives who refused to support John McCain ) opposed the campaign finance laws struck down yesterday .
When a law requires any group of two or more people who raise $ 5,000 for the purposes of making a political statement to adhere to a blizzard of federal regulations subject to fines , that law by definition chokes off the " voices of everyday Americans " that President Barack Obama , in his ridiculous reaction to the decision yesterday , expressed outrage on behalf of .
Free - speech campaign - finance enthusiasts are willing to censor or chill those small voices for the greater purpose of attempting ( and largely failing ) to blunt the political activity of hated Corporations ( or " Wall Street banks , health insurance companies and the other powerful interests , " in the words of a president who has been bailing out Wall Street banks and crafting legislative deals with health insurance companies and other powerful interests for a year now ) .
What campaign - finance supporters are not willing to do , at least most of the time , is admit that they 're making any tradeoff on political expression at all .

Editor ’s note :
This article was originally published on The Huffington Post .
Last summer , when mass protests broke out in Iran following what was seen as a rigged election , Americans cried out in support of the uprising through all possible channels .
Some commentators here went so far as to claim credit for the “ revolution , ” as if it never could have happened without American political movements having already set the example .
But despite the arrogance of that claim , the Iranian Green Movement is indeed an exertion of democratic will that resonates closely with many Americans — and for good reason .
America ’s rich history of successful social and political movements , from its genesis onward , lends profound familiarity to the Iranian uprising , most of which has remained nonviolent .
The enduring American symbolic identity — as a bastion of freedom and opportunity — is mostly justified when one considers the relative success of the Civil Rights or Feminist movements of the 20th Century , or of the ongoing LGBT rights movement , which continues to make incremental gains today .
American democracy , fueled by an active populace — despite its numerous imperfections — remains the gold standard around the world .
It is against this venerable historical backdrop that one must concede that the most well known , highly publicized American social / political movement today — the tea party movement — is a national embarrassment .
At its core , the tea party movement is rife with contradiction , incoherence and a willful contempt for facts or reason .
It is but a parody of the legitimate movements for which American democracy has historically been held in such high regard .
It is , in fact , the latest installment in quite another American tradition : the exploitation of frustrated , desperate , and susceptible people by monied interests and profiteers .
The impetus for the Civil Rights movement was centuries of racially based oppression at all levels of American government and society .
The logic behind its call for equality was overwhelming .
Now consider the tea party movement , whose foremost demand of a president who in his first month passed one of the biggest tax cuts ever … is for tax cuts .
The movement ’s incoherence is only illuminated further when this demand is uttered in the same sentence as its call for deficit reduction .
Though the movement claims to have no defined leadership , there are public figures and entities who nevertheless carry that mantle , which has led to perhaps its greatest irony :
A portion of the American populace who carries a populist banner against the coddling of greedy bankers is led by some of the country ’s most cynical and base profiteers .
When the movement was christened last April for a large tax day protest , it was derived wholesale from the efforts of a registered corporate lobbyist and a right - leaning cable news network , whose president recently pointed out that it ’s all about ratings .
At the tea party ’s national convention last weekend , its keynote speaker was a former governor who quit midterm in order to peddle a book that she did n’t write , but for which she collects most of the royalties .
If this were Iran ’s Green Movement , these would be the people slinging marked - up green headbands on the street corner .
Of course , the tea party is not without its whistleblowers .
The $ 500 per plate entry fee to last week ’s convention almost led to it being canceled altogether .
But the exodus of reasonable elements will only homogenize the movement further towards a particularly polarizing worldview that opens itself to continued profit - driven exploitation .
In Authoritarianism & Polarization in American Politics , a revealing work of political science published last year that unfortunately went somewhat unnoticed , Marc J. Hetherington and Jonathan D. Weiler describe a specific worldview — authoritarianism — which they argue lies at the heart of political polarization in modern American politics .
( It should be noted : their use of the term is not related to the more quotidian and overly negative connotation associated with despotic regimes ; rather , it describes a particular lens through which certain people view the world , based on a wide range of scholarly work spanning the fields of psychology , sociology , political science , and other cognitive sciences . )
According to Hetherington and Weiler , authoritarians tend to rely more on emotion and instinct in decision - making , view politics in black and white , resent confusion or ambiguity in the social order , and are suspicious of specific groups who they believe could alter that order ( typically gays and immigrants ) .
The difference between authoritarians and nonauthoritarians , according to the authors , becomes far more pronounced during tumultuous economic or social periods when there are more perceived “ threats . ”
During such times , authoritarians in particular lose accuracy motivation and , “ become much less interested than nonauthoritarians in seeking information that [ is ] balanced in its approach , and much more interested in pursuing one - sided information that reinforc [ es ] existing beliefs . ”
Or in other words , they are highly susceptible to misinformation campaigns , the likes of which pervaded the health care reform debate last summer .
Most every characteristic of an authoritarian worldview lends itself well to the impassioned rhetoric of the tea party movement and the shrewd players operating behind the scenes and atop the soap box .
The movement ’s overly simplified , often - confused solutions to complex problems align with authoritarians ’ Manichean worldview .
That Tom Tancredo ’s anti-immigrant - laced speech at last weekend ’s [ Feb. 4 - 6 ] convention was well received comes as no surprise .
And that this is the group who so often embraces proven falsehoods and spin-narratives to defend its anti-administration agenda should speak for itself with regards to accuracy motivation .
Despite the criticism it receives , the tea party continues to be praised as a political force .
It is loud , passionate , and generally unconcerned with pesky things like facts or reasoned , practical solutions to the country ’s problems .
This bodes ill for 2010 ’s political environment , and it is a shameful representation of what constitutes an American political or social movement .
While the tea party may alienate some who see it for the profit - machine that it is , others who share the fearful , intolerant authoritarian worldview that it is increasingly coalescing around will be lured in and pitted against the very people in power who could actually help them .
That this movement has grown political legs is too bad , and by Hetherington and Weiler ’s account , it means even more polarization is yet to come .

From the article :
This afternoon , the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) held a debate titled “ Does Security Trump Freedom ? ” that featured former GOP congressman and Libertarian Presidential candidate Bob Barr , Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - CA ) , and former Bush Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh .
During one point in the debate , Barr condemned the right ’s call to try terror suspects exclusively in military tribunals and defended plans to try suspects in civilian courts .
He then insisted that waterboarding is torture , which prompted the crowd to start booing .
As they continued to boo , he pointed to the audience and asked , “ How would you like to be waterboarded ?
Try that ! ” :
BARR : But I do n’t think we should go down the path of allowing our leaders to have their cake and eat it too .
There is nothing magical about a military tribunal .
They do n’t have necessarily better lawyers than the civilian sector .
I think I have a lot more faith in our US attorneys who are nonpolitical than my colleagues on the other side of this debate .
We can try them .
We should try them .
That is precisely , Jay , what our law provides for .
And the first time we ’re faced with a situation we say , “ Oh we ’re going to have them go to the military let them torture them for a while , it ’s not enhanced interrogation technique .
Waterboarding is torture !
How would you like to be waterboarded ?
Try that !

Today , the New York Times published an article detailing how “ Schwarzenegger Seeks Shift [ In State Budget Funding ] From Prisons to Schools “ .
The catchy slogan , “ Universities over prisons . ”
Schwarzenegger ’s proposal seeks to shift the allocated percentage of the state budget in education from the current 7.5 % to “ no less than 10 % ” .
Their economic strategy is dependent upon the budget cuts to state prisons , thus adjusting its annual portion from 11 % to “ no more than 7 % ” .
Sarcastic applause .
Among our friends the question regarding this article has been , “ What does it all mean ? ”
That is perhaps the best question , since as it stands the proposal means nothing .
The increase of the percentage of the state budget alloted to education does not mean , for example , that fees will be reduced , nor that teachers and workers whose jobs have been cut will ever come back to see a campus in California .
The proposal does not even mention where in the university the money is going to go .
Will it go to construction ?
Will it serve to speed up the current bond buying practice the UC system has praised as a money making venture ?
We all know what happened to the bank bailout money that was supposed to aid consumers bring the national economy “ back into swing ! ”
As it stands , we cannot expect a cent out of this increase , ( especially since it is something that Mark Yudof has hailed as “ a bold and visionary plan that represents a fundamental restoration of the values and priorities that have made California great ” .
Believe us , he ’s licking his fat cat chops ; he has no values , his only priority is stuffing his pockets and those of his loyal puppets , and he could care less about the “ great ” state of California .
Furthermore , the article states that the effect of the proposal will hinge upon the passing of legislation that will “ reduce the parole burdens from ‘ downward pressure on prison staff salaries ’ and from the reduction of inmate medical costs ” …
Fucking great !
Not only will the new proposal piss off current repressive prison staff , it will make it even harder for the prisoners to recuperate after they get the shit beaten out of them because the master ca n’t afford the NFL Sunday package anymore .
Lance Corcoran , spokesman for the [ Evil ] California Correctional Peace Officers Association , stated , “ If this is the direction the [ State ] administration chooses to go in , there will certainly be consequences . ”
We know what ’s coming , since just last month the same [ E] CCPOA managed to avert state sanctioned furloughs when a judge threw out the case , implying that it was unwise to endanger the security and safety of the State .
Unfortunately , this violent and repressive backlash will also reach university campuses and it will continue to foster animosity simply through rhetoric even though in the end it may only accomplish making the administration a more powerful entity .
Campus police will stop thinking of students as the brats they beat up when they get rowdy and , instead , regard them as an economic competitor , a rival for survival .
For this reason alone , we demand that police be immediately withdrawn from the public space of the university , since it will place protesters at increased risk of injury .
To close , we would like to state that this plan is neither “ bold ” nor “ visionary ” , but grossly misleading and a threat to the public safety of students and prison inmates everywhere .
If California would like to save some of the money used to support the state prison system , they could start by repealing the three strikes law .
We did n’t think we ’d see an iPad surface so soon …
If you were keeping up with the Grammys , you were probably just as shocked as we were when Stephen Colbert pulled one out to present Song of the Year .
And of course , the iPad ’s cameo would n’t be complete without a little gloating from Colbert himself .
“ Jay Z , did you not get one of these in your gift bag ?
Am I cooler than you ? ! ” Bravo , Stephen Colbert .

No native apps allowed in Windows Phone 7 Series
Windows
Phone 7 is only three days old , but leaked docs from Microsoft supposed to show that the requirements for the developer have turned up ( via XDA - Developers )
# WP7 will use both Silverlight and XNA , this decision makes sense it will it the Xbox 360 integration .
Microsoft has been rebuilt their Mobile devices Windows - Mobile from the ground - up , the result could be described as the Zune Phone , the Zune HD has impressed many people
The only allowed apps will be :
XNA - written apps – mainly for games and full screen immersed apps , that do n’t use standard controls ; XNA uses .NET technology ( managed , not native )
. NET apps ( probably Silverlight ? ) without possibility to invoke native API , i.e. only “ managed ” APIs allowed
MSMobile via wmpoweruser
Applications that were made for Windows Mobile 6 are compatible with Windows Phone 7 Series .
via xda-developers
Developers though , can look forward to Microsoft ’s legendary documentation and support .

Much has been written in the last two days about the surprising purchase by the RBI ( Reserve Bank of India ) of some 200 tonnes of gold bullion , valued at about $ 6.7 billion , from the IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) .
Is this really a significant event ?
Judging by the price of gold since the announcement was made - up about $ 50 an ounce and showing no signs of stopping anytime soon - it certainly must have been significant .
But why ?
The folks at the IMF , who , having long sought to rid themselves of some of their huge stash of gold bars in order to ( purportedly ) help balance their books and provide aid to underdeveloped countries , made a rather glib announcement about having put their financial house back in order , apparently unaware of how markets might react .
Being a fly - on - the - wall at IMF headquarters over the last few days would surely have provided some insight into this particular matter , however , it could well be that none of the economists and resident experts at the IMF even look at the price of gold , this metal having long ago lost its relevance in the minds of most bankers in a world full of paper money , fast computers , and sophisticated economic models that all failed so spectacularly over the last year .
Of course , the way the yellow metal is viewed by bankers and economists varies greatly depending upon what part of the world you are in .
Surely , the Reserve Bank of India employs at least a few economists and they must have weighed in on the purchase .
Like the Chinese , they found the idea of more gold holdings to be irresistible .
We 'll probably never know the many details that went into this decision , however , it certainly appears to be much more significant than the IMF conveyed in their press release .
A few thoughts as to why this is so are offered here .
The Delicious Timing of the Transaction
Had this deal been done , say , in March of next year or even during the last month or two of this year , markets would probably not have reacted as they did .
As it was , within a few weeks of the IMF gold sale agreement being finalized in September , the gold sales began , wiping out an impressive half of the total authorized sale in very short order .
Since the IMF gold sales come under the umbrella of the recently renewed five - year European central bank gold sales agreement with a reduced cap of 400 tonnes per year ( down from 500 tonnes per year in the prior agreement due to a dearth of sellers ) , the sale to India accounts for half of the entire 2009 - 2010 sales .
This is shown below in chart form , the IMF sales appended to the right of the graphic that appeared in the latest Gold Investment Digest from the World Gold Council .
After steady declines in recent years as European banks have reduced their gold sales , in comes the IMF to fill the void and - surprise !
- the gold price skyrockets .
Prior to the sale , there was much speculation that China would be the first buyer but , obviously , the RBI beat them to the punch and , while the IMF may not have realized it , this was one of the key reasons why markets are now in a tizzy .
This is a clear demonstration of how anxious at least one central bank is to exchange their paper money for something more tangible and the RBI neatly side - stepped the problem that any large buyer always has - driving up the market price while making their purchases .
To their credit , the RBI ended up driving prices higher after they were done buying .
India Purchased the Gold at Market Prices
A back - of - the - envelope calculation shows that the Indian central bank is now already up more than $ 300 million since buying their 200 tonnes of gold .
This is probably not what the IMF folks thought would happen and you can imagine the raised eyebrows of the staff when working out the deal where they probably figured they had hit the exact top of the gold price surge and what suckers the Indians were .
Press reports indicate that the RBI made their purchases between October 19th and 30th at an average price of $ 1,045 an ounce and , though it looks like they paid too much based on the chart below , they 're still way ahead .
The relatively simple math is as follows : A gain of $ 50 an ounce is about a five percent rise in the gold price and a five percent rise in the RBI 's $ 6.7 billion is a gain of about $ 335 million .
Of course , the gold price could go up or down from here , but any smirks that appeared on the faces of IMF staff as they were signing the paperwork were , obviously , premature .
But , more importantly , what does this transaction say about the " value " of paper money and gold if a major central bank is so anxious to spend billions of dollars of the former to buy the latter at over $ 1,000 an ounce ?
If the RBI felt strongly about boosting their gold reserves , why did n't they do it when gold traded at $ 400 or $ 500 an ounce a few years back , or even last year when it could be bought for between $ 800 and $ 900 an ounce ?
European central banks have been selling the stuff for years at much lower prices and surely the Indian central bank could have boosted their reserves then .
Why , they could even have bought some of the U.K.'s gold back in 1999 that was dumped on the market at $ 275 an ounce .
Recall that Gordon Brown sold about half of England 's 600 tonnes of gold at what is now known as the " Brown Bottom " .
Removing the Sword of Damocles
Probably more important than any other factor in the IMF - RBI gold sale is the fact that the proverbial " Sword of Damocles " has been removed from the gold market after hanging there for years , suspended in mid-air , waiting to drop on any buyer of gold who was dumb enough to buy dumb 'ol gold coins when the IMF was about to flood the market with the stuff .
For years , Jim Rogers has been pointing to the looming IMF gold sales as the reason he thought the metal would underperform other commodities .
Well , it 's still early , but initial indications are that , not only did the IMF gold sales not cause the gold price to plunge , these gold sales actually caused the price to soar .
Who would have known that , when the IMF gold was finally offered up for sale that half of it would be gone within weeks and , more importantly , the buyer turned out to be someone other than the party that most market analysts were expecting .
For years , the prospect of European central banks and the IMF selling off their huge stockpiles of gold in the open market has been a big reason why buyers were understandably cautious .
Analysts have been saying , " Even if the central banks stop selling , the IMF gold will be there to sate the appetite of buyers and that should keep a lid on prices . "
So , the central banks have essentially stopped selling and now half the IMF gold is gone within weeks and China is probably already signing paperwork to buy the other half .
The Sword of Damocles is now gone , if it ever really was there .
A Sea Change in Central Bank Thinking
Perhaps the most provocative question that this gold sale has raised in the minds of other central bankers around the world is , " If India 's buying , maybe we should be buying too " .
As shown below , there are many countries that have woefully small gold reserves and , for better or worse , these same countries are also loaded to the gills with U.S. dollar denominated assets , some of which they'd now be more willing to exchange for gold bars after India has .
China , Japan , Russia , Taiwan and many other countries - mostly in Asia - are now sitting up in their chairs looking around at the other central banks in the world wondering who 's going to be next to buy gold after India scored a cool $ 6.7 billion that quickly turned into a stash that is now worth $ 7.0 billion .
Surely , even the most dimwitted economists in Asian central banks are now tuned in to the rapidly changing landscape of global gold supply and demand .
While economists in the West may cling to their " money is just a unit of account and gold is nothing special " way of thinking , central bank staff half way around the world are now starting to look at things very differently after the events of this week .
If inflation begins to heat up in the months ahead , then we might just see central banks scramble to buy gold along with the rest of the world .
In a pure fiat money system , there is nothing to back a national currency other than faith in the government that issues it and confidence in the central bank that prints it .
Oh yes , and the central bank 's gold .
Even the IMF noted in a recent statement that its ( still ) massive gold reserves give its balance sheet a " fundamental strength " .
Clearly , other central banks around the world , along with millions of investors , feel the need for this " fundamental strength " too .
In a dispute that commingles foreign policy and a quest for political advantage , U.S. - Israel relations have taken an unexpectedly central role in the California race for Senate .
Rivals in the race for the Republican nomination are questioning whether former Rep. Tom Campbell is sufficiently supportive of Israel .
They base their criticisms on his voting record , statements about a Palestinian homeland and capital , and some of his past associates .
Their allegations have raised enough concerns for Campbell that he plans to meet Monday with the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
He also is reaching out to other Jewish leaders .
His campaign ’s honorary chairman , former U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz , weighed in to call Campbell ’s support for the nation “ unwavering . ”
“ He clearly understands the very real threats facing the Israeli people , all the more urgent now as Iran rushes toward nuclear arms , ” Shultz said in a statement released to The Times .
“ Tom Campbell ’s record of action tells you where he stands , and I stand with him . ”

The two other major Republican primary contestants , former businesswoman Carly Fiorina and Orange County Assemblyman Chuck DeVore , have launched criticisms of Campbell .
The rhetoric has grown so heated that a prominent supporter of Campbell ’s has accused Fiorina ’s campaign manager of calling Campbell an “ anti-Semite . ”
The campaign manager denies the accusation .
The debate over Campbell ’s Israel credentials , which has been roiling on Jewish and conservative websites , is a rare one in American politics , and even less frequent in Republican primaries compared with Democratic competitions , said Dan Schnur , director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC and a former GOP political operative .
“ Support for Israel is a pretty universal concept among Republicans , ” he said .
“ Support for Israel is a pretty broad - based concept in American politics . ”
But more than foreign policy appeared to be at play .
Evangelical Christians have a strong affinity for the state of Israel , for political reasons and because they say support for it is emphasized in the Bible .
For years surveys have shown evangelical support for Israel far outweighs that of the general population -- and evangelicals are a key bloc among Republican primary voters .

“ The bigger concern for Campbell is less with Jewish voters than with religious conservatives , ” Schnur said .
The issue has sparked at least one dispute among prominent Republicans .
Former California Secretary of State Bruce McPherson said in an interview that when he called Fiorina manager Marty Wilson to tell Wilson he planned to endorse Campbell , Wilson replied , “ Bruce , how can you do that ?
He ’s an anti-Semite . ”
McPherson , who said he would have endorsed Fiorina if Campbell was n’t in the race , said he was stunned .
He and Campbell have known each other for more than two decades , he said , and Campbell has never given any such indication .
“ As a matter of fact , I know he ’s a strong supporter of the state of Israel , ” McPherson said .

Wilson denied making the comment .
“ That ’s not true , absolutely not , ” he said , adding that he does not believe Campbell is anti-Semitic .
“ That ’s crazy . ”
Wilson said he discussed the endorsement with McPherson but did not recall discussing Israel .
“ It ’s uncharacteristic of Bruce to sit there and make that kind of a claim , ” Wilson said , adding that he had known McPherson for years .
Criticism of Campbell ’s voting record centers on efforts to reduce foreign aid for Israel .
While in Congress , Campbell said , he supported military aid for Israel but twice sought to reduce economic aid .
In the late 1990s , when foreign aid to other nations was being cut to help balance the budget , Israel ’s allocation was not affected .
Campbell said he favored allowing the military aid to remain unchanged but supported slightly reducing economic aid .

A second instance occurred when he voted against giving Israel an additional $ 30 million in economic aid , which was to have been taken from funds set aside for the neediest nations , such as those in Africa .
That money , he said , was on top of a $ 700 - million aid request that he supported and an earlier $ 3 - billion appropriation .
Campbell noted that he has traveled to various African nations to teach and has seen first - hand how much difference even a small amount of money could accomplish .
“ I remember the mayor of a village in northern Malawi came out to thank us for a little water pump .
It was probably under $ 50 , and it allowed the water from the river to be brought to this area , ” Campbell said .
“ You do n’t forget things like that . ”
Campbell also drew criticism in the past for saying that Jerusalem should be the shared capital of both Israel and a Palestinian state .
He said in the interview that he stands by that view .
Advertisement
His opponents also questioned Campbell ’s past associates , notably Sami Al - Arian , a former University of South Florida professor who pleaded guilty in 2006 to conspiring to help a terrorist organization .
Al - Arian had donated $ 1,300 to Campbell ’s 2000 campaign for Senate .
Campbell , who was the business school dean at UC Berkeley and now teaches at Chapman University , wrote a letter to the University of South Florida protesting its decision to fire Al - Arian over comments he made .
He also visited Al - Arian ’s brother in jail .
Campbell said he did not know about Al - Arian ’s illegal activities at the time and said that if he had he would not have written the letter .
“ None of that had come out , ” he said .
Al - Arian was also photographed with George W. Bush during his first presidential campaign , Campbell noted .
Jewish leaders expressed confidence that Campbell is not anti-Semitic , but said he was not regarded as a “ friend of Israel . ”

“ He ’s a brilliant gentlemen and an engaging personality , and I do n’t think he ’s particularly pro-Israel , ” said Rabbi Abraham Cooper , the associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles , who has known Campbell since the 1980s .
“ I think there ’s enough there on the record that would send real alarms that this is someone who maybe does n’t fully understand , does n’t fully value or fully support a strong ongoing relationship with the state of Israel , an alliance with the state of Israel . ”
Campbell called his opponents ’ efforts to undermine his Israel record “ unacceptable , ” and singled out Wilson ’s alleged comment to McPherson as “ reckless and irresponsible . ”
“ It ’s also personally hurtful , ” he added .

There are at least eight artists that have used the name Isis : 1 . Isis was a Los Angeles , CA based band that started in Boston , MA in 1997 .
They borrowed from and helped to evolve a sound pioneered by the likes of Neurosis and Godflesh , creating heavy music consisting primarily of lengthy songs that focus on repetition and evolution of structure and texture .
As such , their music encompasses a considerable range of genres .
Some of these include sludge metal and post- metal ; the band is considered a pioneer of the latter sub - genre .

It ’s going to be the media issue of the new decade : whether or not Rupert Murdoch can succeed in his plans to persuade newspaper readers to pay for content online .
New research does n't look promising .
It ’s going to be the media issue of the new decade : whether or not Rupert Murdoch can succeed in his plans to persuade newspaper readers to pay for content online .
It ’s a grand experiment , with success or failure likely to determine a great deal of the future of journalism .
Today , News Limited blew the bugle by using the front page of The Australian to announce a corporate restructure .
The national broadsheet will be spun off into a new division in anticipation that it will lead the push to putting quality content behind paywalls .
The Australian , Rupert ’s newspaper flagship in the Pacific region , is being trimmed for the risky new voyage .
But while Rupert has been making his plans , Australian researchers working with the international World Internet Project have conducted their first survey on whether and how much Australians will pay for content online .
The results have been released to Crikey , and they are depressing for Rupert .
Seven out of 10 Australians would not consider paying anything at all .
Young people were particularly against the idea , with three quarters saying they would not pay .
It gets worse .

News junkies — those who turn to the web for local or national news several times a day — are actually the people least prepared to pay for online news , according to what they told the researchers .
Yet those who turn to the web for news once a day are the most likely to pay .
Go figure .
It should be said that the numbers or respondents involved are small , so the results for this question should be treated with caution .
The survey also looked at willingness of readers to consume large amounts of text online , and found that those who were prepared to read long articles and essays were slightly more likely to consider paying for them — but still under half were prepared to pay .
This suggests that ease of reading could be important , and is relevant to the reports that Rupert ’s plans include a “ cool new toy ” or exclusive deal with one of the e-readers shortly to hit the market .
There are some other interesting variations when the survey results are cross- tabulated by region .
The numbers involved are small , so the results should be treated with caution , but they suggest that readers in states with limited access to quality local newspapers are more likely to consider paying for online news .
West Australians and Tasmanians — particularly those in urban areas — are the people most likely to be willing to pay for news , although even in those regions the numbers prepared to pay do not top 50 % .
This survey was undertaken by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries & Innovation at Swinburne University ’s Institute for Social Research , and is part of the World Internet Project , which is the leading international source of research on how people use the internet .
In late 2009 , 800 Australian internet users were asked how much they would be prepared to pay to read an online newspaper , given that a daily print newspaper cost about $ 1.50 .
The detailed results , with cross tabulations for age , locality and degree of news - junkiness , will be on my blog later today .
Now , surveys only tell part of the story .
It is one thing to ask readers in the abstract whether they would pay for news , when at the moment they are used to getting it for free .
How they would actually behave if much of their favoured material became otherwise unobtainable is another issue .
The “ cool new toy ” is also likely to have an impact .
We know that people are willing to pay small amounts for data that is available elsewhere for free , if it is delivered to them on a mobile .
Nevertheless this new Australian data tends to back up other surveys done overseas .
This recent article in The Economist , which quotes a British survey suggesting that newspaper readers are “ shamelessly promiscuous ” in their online reading habits , and would quickly shift to free online sources if newspapers tried to charge them .
“ The theory underlying most papers ’ online strategies is that people will buy a favourite newspaper and then go to its website for breaking news and extras such as blogs .
But fans of the Daily Telegraph , for example , the most popular quality daily paper , got just 8 % of their online news from its website .
They spent twice as much time visiting the BBC ’s news website and more than twice as much reading other quality papers . ”
In the Australian context , the fact that a “ cover - all ” news service from the ABC will remain free is likely to be a key factor , just as the BBC has become News Corporation ’s enemy No.1 in Europe .
On the other hand , another survey by the Boston Consulting Group , gleefully reported by The Australian last year , focused on the kind of stuff people might consider paying for .
It came up with slightly more encouraging results , suggesting that almost half of Australian internet users would be willing to pay a small monthly amount for news that was either unique , or timely — such as a news alert service .
However , even this survey concluded that the amounts people were prepared to pay would have only a “ negligible ” impact on overall industry revenue .
The surveys could all be wrong , of course , and Rupert could be right .
We also know that he is not planning to merely replicate newspaper content online , but to offer targeted packages of niche content .
This is bound to change the picture .
Nevertheless , at this early stage of the story , you would have to say that the signs are all against Rupert .
If he overcomes and succeeds , then the history books might well represent the paywall push as the most significant and audacious part of his already incredible career .

Yoko Ono is turning 77 tomorrow .
Keep that in mind as you imagine the performance artist shimmying , writhing , caterwauling , and charming the pants off the audience at Brooklyn Academy of Music on Tuesday night .
The show began with a montage of Ono recordings , films , interview clips , and photos from her days with husband John Lennon , and ended with a cavalcade of special guests that frankly kind of blew us away .
Rundown of the entire performance by We Are Plastic Ono Band , plus an image gallery featuring Eric Clapton and the Scissor Sisters , after the jump .
CLICK THROUGH for our slideshow of Yoko Ono performing with Plastic Ono Band at BAM .
The first set was a fast and furious tour through the Yoko Ono discography , including the title track from her latest record release ,
, and a rendition of “ Rising ” with son Sean — the emcee - of - sorts — as accompaniment .
And in case you wondering , the lady can still scream .
The second act , less rehearsed but equipped with a magical spontaneity , included guest appearances by Scissor Sisters — who performed “ The Sun is Down ” as a dance -y duet in front of an animated short from the ’60s — and a heartstring - tugging acoustic version of “ Oh Yoko ” by Gene Ween .
Justin Bond , in sequined leggings , took on “ What a Bastard the World Is ” before things got experimental with Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore , who thrashed conceptually ( think lots of reverb and dissonant bass notes ) as Ono wailed “ Mulberry . ”
Bette Midler owned the audience with a whimsical take on “ Yes , I ’m Your Angel , ” which Ono explained that she wrote to cheer up Lennon on the eve of his 40th birthday .
After an appearance by Paul Simon and son Harper , a childhood friend of Sean ’s from The Dakota and Central Park West , Eric Clapton took the stage for a searing “ Yer Blues ” ( originally on the Beatles ’ White Album , on which Clapton played as session guitarist ) followed by Ono songs “ Death of Samantha ” and “ Do n’t Worry Kyoko . ”
Two original members of Lennon ’s Plastic Ono Band — Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner — played backup , marking the first time in four decades that the group of musicians had jammed together .
The finale was — as you might have guessed — a group performance of “ Give Peace a Chance , ” set to a dark auditorium punctuated by flashlight , a reference to the Onochord , a device meant to spell out “ I love you ” with a series of Morse code flashes .
Sidenote : if you do n’t follow Ono ’s Twitter feed , we would heartily recommend it .

Our Hapless Man in Havana
For the last month , the Cuban government has detained an American contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , accusing him of secretly distributing laptops and other communications devices in Cuba and calling it espioniage .
Unfortunately , the incident has occasioned the usual , tired debate about what the United States is doing in Cuba and why .
What this incident really should spark is a close look at Cuba ’s retrograde political repression and the United States ’ policy paralysis when it comes to its island neighbor .
The very fact that Cuba arrested the USAID contractor for doing nothing more than handing out laptops says more about Cuban paranoia than U.S. policy .
In what other country in the hemisphere would it be considered a crime for a foreigner to give out a cell phone , laptop , or any other modern tool of communication ?
Brazil ?
Argentina ? Mexico ?
Venezuela ?
Of course not .
In fact , Americans passing out free cell phones and computers in those countries are called , appropriately , humanitarians .
Let ’s be clear :
The Castro regime is isolating its citizens from not just news and information , but from modernity .
It is one of a handful of governments on Earth still attempting such a comprehensive level of repression .
Sadly , though journalists do report this simple fact , the surreal level of Cuban repression often takes a back seat to criticism of U.S. policy .
In these cases , U.S. articles often insinuate that Washington must be up to something sinister in Cuba when describing such events .
Just last week , the hoary commentator on all things Cuba , Wayne Smith , lobbed a predictable partisan criticism .
He argued that President Barack Obama ’s administration is continuing the policies of his predecessor , fomenting rebellion in the communist country while severely restricting trade with the island .
( Never mind that the policy of providing assistance to independent civil society groups in Cuba started under Bill Clinton . )
But what ’s so sinister about a citizen receiving or having a laptop or a cell phone ?
Nothing — unless the government is maintaining a chokehold on power by holding its citizens frozen in the past .
Now , full disclosure here : I used to be the director for Latin America at the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , where I proudly helped distribute basic communications tools to independent - minded citizens and groups inside Cuba .
We provided simple things like pencils , paper , and reading materials — and we ’re not talking about anti-Castro screeds .
We supported the distribution of documents about internationally recognized human and labor rights .
Sadly , rather than lauding the effort to bring change to Cuba , the media harangued NED with constant questions about why we were meddling in another country .
It is a question , I hasten to add , that no journalist would have asked when NED provided the same goods to similar groups in Chile under the strong arm of Gen. Augusto Pinochet .
But today ’s Cuba is repressive in a way all Americans should consider shocking .
Take , for instance , the " Black Spring " of 2003 , when the Havana government arrested 75 dissident leaders and sentenced them to prison terms averaging 18 years for doing nothing more than holding a meeting of like - minded citizens in their homes .
The truth is that the U.S. media too often forgets to ask whether possessing a laptop or a pamphlet merits a decades - long spell in a squalid prison cell .
Nor does the media recognize that U.S. programs in Cuba are n’t cloak - and - dagger .
There is no dagger — and to consider basic communications tools the legal equivalent of an anticommunist weapon is to take the deranged , power - obsessed , atavistic view of the Cuban government .
As for the cloak : The Cuban regime ’s absurd abrogation of its citizens ’ rights to information makes it necessary .
Ultimately , though , last month ’s arrest of the USAID contractor demonstrates the ineffectiveness of Obama ’s much - heralded April announcement of opening up telecommunications with Cuba .
In his speech , Obama called for a change in U.S. policy , allowing private companies to develop direct contacts with the Cuban people .
It sounded nice , but unfortunately something got lost in the translation from presidential directive to governmental regulation to reality .
The final regulations that resulted and were released in September did little to advance any of Obama ’s lofty rhetoric .
The sale or construction of telecommunications infrastructure to Cuba by U.S companies — necessary to allow the famously antiquated island to have digital contact with the rest of the world — is forbidden .
Instead , what is allowed are donations , something Cuba already permits .
Simply put , Obama ’s plan is not enough to unleash the initiative and potential of private businesses to open up the island .
Imagine a board meeting at a telecom company considering Cuba ’s potential .
" Ladies and gentlemen , while we ca n’t sell our equipment to the island , I propose donating cell - phone towers , handsets , routers , and other equipment , " the executive might say , " because someday in the unforeseeable future we may be able to invest there — and in the meantime , we ’ll give it away . "
Even the much - vaunted promise of allowing the laying of a fiber optic cable to Cuba — which would provide Cubans with access to high - speed Internet — did n’t foresee the infrastructure requirements necessary to make it work on the island .
You ca n’t plug a fiber optic cable in like a toaster .
The Obama team ’s sole effective change has been to allow executives to travel to Cuba on telecommunications - related business .
None of this matters for the poor American contractor who spent Christmas in a Cuban jail , a political pawn in a sorry game .
That what he did is a " crime " is the fault of the Cuban regime .
But the fact that he was tasked with such a low - level activity , handing out communications devices , is the fault of the broader framework of U.S. regulations .
I do not advocate a wholesale lifting of the U.S. embargo on Cuba .
But , I do believe Washington should create the regulatory scenario in which the U.S. private sector can do its transformative best .
Sadly , given the September regulations , we ’re not there yet .

She draws a different things on feather and she calls herself a “ Featherlady ” .
Here you can see some of her great artworks that will amaze you .
Feathers are one of the epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering , or plumage , on birds .
They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates .
They are among the outstanding characteristics that distinguish the extant Aves from other living groups .
Feathers have also been noticed in Theropoda which have been termed feathered dinosaurs .
However , there are also some scientists who disagree with the interpretation of feathered dinosaurs , pointing out instead that birds and some theropods are only convergently similar .
Although feathers cover most parts of the body of birds , they arise only from certain well - defined tracts on the skin .
They aid in flight , thermal insulation , waterproofing and coloration that helps in communication and protection .

Mr Robertson made the comments on his programme
The White House has dismissed as " stupid " comments by evangelist broadcaster Pat Robertson suggesting that quake - struck Haiti was cursed .
Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was amazed by the remarks .
During a broadcast on his Christian Broadcasting Network , Mr Robertson suggested the Haiti 's earthquake was divine retribution .
He said Haiti had sworn a pact with the devil when it freed itself from French colonial rule .
The White House said the comments were completely inappropriate .
" It never ceases to amaze , that in times of amazing human suffering , somebody says something that could be so utterly stupid , " Mr Gibbs said .
" But it , like clockwork , happens with some regularity . "
Mr Robertson , an 80 - year - old former presidential candidate , made the comments on Wednesday on his programme , " The 700 Club " .
" They said , we will serve you if you will get us free from the French .
True story .
And so , the devil said , okay it 's a deal , " the televangelist said during the broadcast .
" Ever since , they have been cursed by one thing after the other , " he added , comparing Haiti to its more prosperous neighbour , the Dominican Republic .
In a statement on his network 's website , spokesman Chris Roslan said Mr Robertson never said the earthquake - which is feared to have left tens of thousands dead - was God 's wrath .
He added : " History , combined with the horrible state of the country , has led countless scholars and religious figures over the centuries to believe the country is cursed " .

This morning I heard on a local DC radio station an interview with a tourist who complained that Washington ’s “ scripted ” inhabitants “ have no real understanding ” of the economic situation of ordinary Americans .
I agree with the tourist ’s assessment , but unlike her I ’m not disappointed .
You see , to visit DC expecting to find people engaged in serious discussions of economics is like visiting a Star Trek convention expecting to find people engaged in serious discussions of astrophysics .
Perhaps a handful of the celebrities and costumed performers are familiar with real science , but their overwhelming object is not to help their public deal with reality but , rather , to escape it .

He was n't a plumber and his name was n't Joe – but he became famous for 15 minutes during the 2008 presidential elections after John McCain decided to latch on to him during the Republican campaign 's death - spiral .
Still not comfortable with his inevitable fate as a future Trivial Pursuit question , Joe – real name Sam Wurzelbacher – still pops up at fringe political events .
And this weekend it finally dawned upon him what presidential campaigns are all about – and what his precise role in 2008 was .
Scott Detrow , a reporter for Pennsylvania Public Radio , heard Wurzelbacher speaking at a Republican gubernatorial candidate 's gig in Pennsylvania , in which he laid into Palin and McCain , calling McCain a " career politician " and lambasting Palin for supporting McCain 's Arizona senate primary race ( where McCain is struggling to see off a red- meat Republican challenger ) .
Detrow asked Wurzelbacher why he was biting McCain 's hand , after it was McCain who shone the national spotlight on him by repeated references in a presidential candidates ' debate .
" I do n't owe him shit .
He really screwed my life up , is how I look at it , " Wurzelbacher told Detrow .
" McCain was trying to use me .
I happened to be the face of middle Americans .
It was a ploy . "
President Obama , on the otherhand , got more respect from the artist formerly known as Joe the Plumber : " I think his ideology is un-American , but he 's one of the more honest politicians .
At least he told us what he wanted to do . "
And Wurzelbacher also had common - sense views on the crazies who dispute Obama 's nationality and compare him to Hitler .
" The birthers , the truthers — if people are trying to bunch them [ with tea partiers ] , that would kill us .
That just pushes away Democrats and independents who might come out for our cause otherwise . "
No matter how many times we go through it , winter always seems to catch us by surprise — a chilly , costly , inconvenient surprise .
Prepare yourself for the rest of this season with helpful and healthy projects , clever tricks , and energy savers .

Sony hopes today marks the beginning of the end of the rampant piracy seen on its PSP platform .
SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 3 , released today , is Sony 's first test at discouraging pirates from downloading PSP software .
Those who purchase SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3 are now required to register the title through PlayStation Network before given access to online gameplay .
UMD copies of the game will come with a voucher code that must be redeemed online , while digital copies will automatically register in the background .
Those who buy a used copy of the UMD can purchase a PSN entitlement voucher for $ 20 to play online .
We spoke recently with John Koller , director of hardware marketing at SCEA , about this new initiative to combat piracy on PSP and when we may see it appear on other titles and platforms .
SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 3 is the first title to introduce the new online entitlement feature .
As with many programs , we 're investigating future opportunities , but we have no announcements to make on it at this time .
Today 's consumers are more tech savvy and better connected to the internet than ever before .
Piracy continues to be an issue of concern for the PSP platform .
SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 3 is a trial run for a new initiative we are exploring for the platform .
We will continue to explore this as an opportunity for the platform going forward , but we have no announcements to make on future iterations at this time .
Piracy remains a concern on the PSP platform , but the launch of the PSPgo and the ability to access the PlayStation Store directly from PSP - 3000 were significant steps towards fighting piracy and getting consumers to download digital games legally .
Since then we 've seen a steady rise in digital game sales and PSPgo has undoubtedly played a critical role in helping to minimize the impact of piracy on the PSP platform .
No one will dispute that piracy has a negative impact on software sales .
We 're continuing to take proactive steps in the fight against piracy and believe this new initiative will be of benefit to the gaming industry .
From the largest publishers to the smallest developers , piracy is an issue that impacts everyone in the industry .
We 've been working closely with our development teams and publishing partners on this new initiative to help educate consumers on the importance of piracy - protection .
From our research , this will be received quite positively .
Remember , piracy affects more than just the creators of the game .
It also affects the consumers who purchase titles expecting a high - quality gaming experience .
Game development is a long and costly process that can take years to create and many more dollars to develop , manufacture , market and distribute .
Our goal is to keep this development pipeline flowing with creative new IPs , well known franchises and pick up and play experiences that all can legally enjoy .
That 's something that all fans can be happy about .
Activision released a statement earlier today , indicating that since it ’s release on the 10th of November 2009 , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 has already brought in more than $ 1 billion in terms of retail sales worldwide .
Over $ 550 million was raised during the first five days of availability , breaking records and out - performing five - day box office performance of movies like The Dark Knight , Harry Potter and Avatar .
Averaging the sales so far , this means that Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 has been bringing in an impressive $ 15.625.000 per day , which places it well above the the relative Gross Domestic Product of the Republic of Niger .
This further boils down to an equally impressive revenue of slightly more than $ 180 per second .
Recently , Sony and Quantic Dream rolled out the PAL , North America and Japan regional box art for their upcoming PS3 - exclusive interactive drama Heavy Rain and boy is there some hootin’ and hollerin ’ over it .
Though everything seems to make sense to me : America gets a wet t- shirt contest , Japan gets a dead guy ’s nose extruding from a puddle , and Europe gets good box art .
PAL Art : Alright let ’s see… .
Rain ?
Check .
Specifically of the heavy variety ?
Check .
The conspicuous , but not intrusive , blood stain is appreciated , and the cover also references the importance of the Origami Killer in the game without giving anything away , which deserves high points .
As I look at the origami itself it makes me think of a someone dying of a mortal wound , crawling aimlessly through the rain in a fruitless effort to reach a more respectable end .
See !
An emotional response , that ’s what good box art does .
US Art : Woah , this baby ’s got everything !
Sex appeal , gun appeal , and just to make sure we were n’t outdone by those boys across the Atlantic we slapped their boring ol ’ box art on too .
Only smaller …and less detailed , and pretty much playing second fiddle to Madison Paige ’s boobs journalistic integrity .
Seriously though it ’s pretty cookie cutter stuff ; I ’ve always been against putting characters on the box art for the reason of gaining preconceived notions about characters before the game is played .
Basically , it ruins part of the discovery that should be wholly reserved for when you ’re playing through the game .
Unfortunately for these types of games , ( the ones that spend millions and millions on development and production ) hype seems to be as critical to the process as any other phase for the game including development itself .
The backlash on the cover has been overwhelming enough for Sony to go ahead with the decision to offer the previously mentioned Europe box art to download and print .
Japan Art :
It was a relief to many of us stateside to see that we were not the only ones put through a ‘ what the hell is this ? ’ situation .
No origami , no over - exposure of characters , just a nose , probably of a dead guy .
Ominous and mysterious ?
Sure , but closer to eccentric and weird , and certainly not as subtle as the PAL version .
Though for the record , if that guy is actually supposed to be on land then that is indeed some heavy - ass rain .
So there you have it , you going with Dying Origami , Nose Puddle Haiku or G.I. Joe ?

In a study to be presented at the Society for Maternal - Fetal Medicine 's ( SMFM ) annual meeting , The Pregnancy Meeting ™ , in Chicago , researchers will unveil findings that demonstrate a link between the birth defect gastroschisis and the agricultural chemical atrazine .
Gastroschisis is a type of inherited congenital abdominal wall defect in which the intestines , and sometimes other organs , develop outside the fetal abdomen through an opening in the abdominal wall .
The incidence of gastroschisis is on the rise , increasing two to four times in the last 30 years .
Researchers at the University of Washington ( Seattle ) , were alerted to a higher than normal number of cases in Eastern Washington which caused them to hypothesize that the increased incidence could be due to environmental exposures in that area .
" Our state has about two times the national average number of cases of gastroschisis , " said Dr. Sarah Waller , one of the study 's authors .
" The life expectancy for fetuses with this diagnosis is better than 90 percent ; however it requires delivery at a tertiary care center with immediate neonatal intervention which often separates families and can cause serious financial and emotional stress . "
The team conducted a study of all cases of live born infants with gastroschisis during the period of 1987 - 2006 .
They matched birth certificates with U.S. Geological Survey databases of agricultural spraying .
They looked at the chemicals atrazine , nitrates , and 2,4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid .
Of the 805 cases and 3616 controls in the study , gastroschisis occurred more frequently among infants whose mothers resided less than 25 km from the site of high surface water contamination with atrazine .
No risk was associated with the other chemicals reviewed in the study .
The risk of gastroschisis also increased for women who conceived in the spring ( March through May ) , when chemical use is more prevalent .
The study was authored by Sarah Waller , M.D. , Kathleen Paul , M.D. , Suzanne Peterson , M.D. , and Jane Hitti , M.D. , of the University of Washington , Seattle .

HED : Beyond [ Yiddish word ] and [ Kosher Deli Food ] DEK :
The new Jew [ insert “ phenomenon , ” “ movement , ” or “ revolution ” ]
Outside a [ adjective ] club in [ insert “ the East Village , ” “ the Lower East Side , ” or “ Williamsburg ” ] , a dozen [ adjective ] twentysomethings with [ insert “ tattoos ” or “ piercings ” ] on their [ body part , plural ] are smoking [ an herb ] and talking about the latest Jewish [ musical genre ] sensation , [ insert “ Matisyahu ” ] .
“ For the first time in my life , Jews are [ adjective ] , ” said [ precious gem , capitalized ] [ Jewish surname ] , wearing a t - shirt that read “ [ Biblical figure ] [ active verb ] . ”
“ I used to feel [ adjective ] about being Jewish .
Today I [ verb ] my Jewishness in ways I never did before . "
[ Color ] [ Jewish surname ] , founder of a company that makes [ Jewish ritual object ] - shaped pasta , agreed , adding , “ This is not our [ family relative ] ’s Judaism . ”
Faced with a multiplicity of [ plural noun ] , they ’re forging their own Jewish [ plural noun ] .
They ’re the new Hipster Jews , and they ’re here to [ verb ] .
Hipster Judaism has its roots in [ insert “ Adam Sandler ’s Hanukkah Song , ” “ The Beastie Boys , ” or “ Dee Snyder of Twisted Sister ” ] .
Raised on [ 1980s TV series ] and too young to have an intense memory of [ insert “ the Holocaust , ” “ the creation of Israel , ” or “ Yahweh ” ] , this generation has chosen a [ adjective ] approach to Jewish identity .
And young Jews are n’t the only ones who [ verb ] Judaism .
It seems that everywhere , from [ cable TV station ] to [ clothing store ] , popular culture has become saturated by a [ adjective ] form of Jewish [ noun ] .
When [ female celebrity ] was photographed wearing a Kabbalah [ noun ] , the trend was officially [ adjective ] .
This is n’t the Judaism of [ character from Fiddler On the Roof , The Chosen or Yentl ] .

If that ’s how I [ verb ] my Judaism , that ’s my [ adjective ] decision .
Who are my parents to tell me what ’s [ adjective ] and what ’s not ?

A just - released Jewish community report , “ Judaism in the Age of [ cultural phenomenon from the early 1990s ] , ” backs up this claim .
According to the report , “ In contemporary [ country ] , with its [ exotic Starbucks blend ] and [ popular video game ] culture , Judaism is only one facet of a [ adverb ] [ adjective ] identity .

Jews are models of a [ adjective ] , do - it - yourself Jewish [ noun ] .
Much like [ recent technological product , plural ] , they plug in to [ plural noun ] and then they [ verb ] . ”
All this has led to a decidedly more [ adjective ] approach to Jewish identity .
“ Jews do n’t want to give up on Judaism , but they also do n’t want to give up on the American ideal of [ noun ] , ” said Dr. [ Hebrew name ] [ Jewish surname ] , Professor of Jewish [ plural noun ] at [ insert “ Brandeis ” ]

“ For all groups , contemporary ethnic identification is as fluid as [ liquid ] . ”
Inevitably , there are those who disagree .
“ [ A Jewish food ] and [ a Jewish entertainer ] are insufficient [ plural noun ] for identity , ” argued Rabbi [ Old Testament Prophet ] [ Jewish surname ] of [ sparsely populated state ] .
“ You can only go so far on [ insert “ t - shirts , ” “ concerts , ” “ blogs , ” “ Jewfros ” or “ drugs ” ] before you realize there ’s no nourishment there . ”
“ It ca n’t be all [ mood ] , ” agreed Professor [ four - syllable name ] [ three - syllable name ] [ Jewish surname ] , recipient of the American Jewish [ noun ] Foundation Award for Excellence in [ adjective ] Jewish Thought in 1956 , 1957 , and 1959 .
“ Besides , we have zero evidence that the so - called ‘ hipster ’ culture leads Jews to [ active verb , sexual ] and marry other Jews .
So what ’s the point ? "
“ They just do n’t get it , ” responded [ Season , capitalized ] [ Jewish surname ] , founder of the blog Jew[ exclamation ] .com .
“ The critics just are n’t as [ insert “ cool , ” “ edgy , ” “ trendsetting , ” “ downtown , ” or “ hip ” ] as we are , so of course they ’re coming at us from a [ adjective ] perspective .
Did I mention that we ’re extremely [ insert “ cool , ” “ edgy , ” “ trendsetting , ” “ downtown ” or “ hip ” ] ? ”
In the end , no amount of pigeonholing will succeed in [ verb ] ing the new [ noun ] of American Jews .
“ We must n’t make generalizations , ” said [ first name of 19th - century U.S. president ] [ Jewish surname ] , [ senior job title ] of The [ 1940s Hollywood producer ] Family Foundation Crisis Campaign for American Jewish [ noun ] .
“ But I think it ’s safe to say that all young American Jews are [ adjective ] , [ adjective ] , [ adjective ] , [ adjective ] , [ adjective ] and [ adjective ] .
And they wo n’t be defined by anybody else . ”
Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have peered deep into the eye of the chicken and found a masterpiece of biological design .
Scientists mapped five types of light receptors in the chicken 's eye .
They discovered the receptors were laid out in interwoven mosaics that maximized the chicken 's ability to see many colors in any given part of the retina , the light - sensing structure at the back of the eye .
" Based on this analysis , birds have clearly one - upped us in several ways in terms of color vision , " says Joseph C. Corbo , M.D. , Ph.D. , senior author and assistant professor of pathology and immunology and of genetics .
" Color receptor organization in the chicken retina greatly exceeds that seen in most other retinas and certainly that in most mammalian retinas . "
Corbo plans follow - up studies of how this organization is established .
He says such insights could eventually help scientists seeking to use stem cells and other new techniques to treat the nearly 200 genetic disorders that can cause various forms of blindness .
Scientists published their results in the journal PLoS One .
Birds likely owe their superior color vision to not having spent a period of evolutionary history in the dark , according to Corbo .
Birds , reptiles and mammals are all descended from a common ancestor , but during the age of the dinosaurs , most mammals became nocturnal for millions of years .

Vision comes from light - sensitive photoreceptor cells in the retina .
Night - vision relies on receptors called rods , which flourished in the mammalian eye during the time of the dinosaurs .
Daytime vision relies on different receptors , known as cones , that are less advantageous when an organism is most active at night .
Birds , now widely believed to be descendants of dinosaurs , never spent a similar period living mostly in darkness .
As a result , birds have more types of cones than mammals .
" The human retina has cones sensitive to red , blue and green wavelengths , " Corbo explains .
" Avian retinas also have a cone that can detect violet wavelengths , including some ultraviolet , and a specialized receptor called a double cone that we believe helps them detect motion . "
In addition , most avian cones have a specialized structure that Corbo compares to " cellular sunglasses " : a lens - like drop of oil within the cone that is pigmented to filter out all but a particular range of light .
Researchers used these drops to map the location of the different types of cones on the chicken retina .
They found that the different types of cones were evenly distributed throughout the retina , but two cones of the same type were never located next to each other .
" This is the ideal way to uniformly sample the color space of your field of vision , " Corbo says .
" It appears to be a global pattern created from a simple localized rule : you can be next to other cones , but not next to the same kind of cone . "
Corbo speculates that extra sensitivity to color may help birds in finding mates , which often involves colorful plumage , or when feeding on berries or other colorful fruit .
" Many of the inherited conditions that cause blindness in humans affect cones and rods , and it will be interesting to see if what we learn of the organization of the chicken 's retina will help us better understand and repair such problems in the human eye , " Corbo says .
Funding from the National Eye Institute supported this research .
It remains one of the greatest human fossil discoveries of all time .
The bones of a race of tiny primitive people , who used stone tools to hunt pony - sized elephants and battle huge Komodo dragons , were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2004 .
The team of Australian researchers had been working in a vast limestone cavern , called Liang Bua , in one of the island 's remotest areas , when one scientist ran his trowel against a piece of bone .
Carefully the group began scraping away the brown clay in which pieces of a tiny skull , and a little lower jaw , were embedded .
This was not any old skull , they quickly realised .
Although small , it had special characteristics .
In particular , it had adult teeth .
" This was no child , but a tiny adult ; in fact , one of the smallest adult hominids ever found in the fossil record , " says Mike Morwood , of Australia 's University of Wollongong and a leader of the original Flores expedition team .
The pieces of bone were carefully wrapped in newspaper , packed in cardboard boxes and then cradled on the laps of scientists on their journey , by ferry and plane , back to Jakarta .
Then the pieces of skull , as well as bones from other skeletons found in Liang Bua , were put together .
The end result caused consternation .
These remains came from a species that turned out to be only three feet tall and had the brain the size of an orange .
Yet it used quite sophisticated stone tools .
And that was a real puzzle .
How on earth could such individuals have made complex implements and survived for aeons on this remote part of the Malay archipelago ?
Some simply dismissed the bones as the remains of deformed modern humans with diseases that had caused them to shrink : to them , they were just pathological oddities , it was alleged .
Most researchers disagreed , however .
The hobbits were the descendants of a race of far larger , ancient humans who had thrived around a million years ago .
These people , known as Homo erectus , had become stranded on the island and then had shrunk in an evolutionary response to the island 's limited resources .
That is odd enough .
However , new evidence suggests the little folk of Flores may be even stranger in origin .
According to a growing number of scientists , Homo floresiensis is probably a direct descendant of some of the first apemen to evolve on the African savannah three million years ago .
These primitive hominids somehow travelled half a world from their probable birthplace in the Rift Valley to make their homes among the orangutans , giant turtles and rare birds of Indonesia before eventually reaching Flores .
It sounds improbable but the basic physical similarity between the two species is striking .
Consider Lucy , the 3.2 million - year - old member of Australopithecus afarensis .
She had a very small brain , primitive wrists , feet and teeth and was only one metre tall , but was still declared " the grandmother of humanity " after her discovery in Ethiopia in 1974 .
Crucially , analysis of Lucy 's skeleton shows it has great similarities with the bones of H. floresiensis , although her species died out millions of years ago while the hobbits hung on in Flores until about 17,000 years ago .
This latter figure is staggeringly close in terms of recent human evolution and indicates that long after the Neanderthals , our closest evolutionary relatives , had disappeared from the face of the Earth around 35,000 years ago , these tiny , distant relatives of Homo sapiens were still living on remote Flores .
The crucial point about this interpretation is that it explains why the Flores people had such minuscule proportions .
They did n't shrink but were small from the start – because they came from a very ancient lineage of little apemen .
They acquired no diseased deformities , nor did they evolve a smaller stature over time .
They were , in essence , an anthropological relic and Flores was an evolutionary time capsule .
In research that provides further support for this idea , scientists have recently dated some stone tools on Flores as being around 1.1 million years old , far older than had been previously supposed .
The possibility that a very primitive member of the genus Homo left Africa , roughly two million years ago , and that a descendant population persisted until only several thousand years ago , is one of the more provocative hypotheses to have emerged in anthropology during the past few years , " David Strait of the University of Albany told Scientific American recently .
This view is backed by Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum , London .
" We are still grappling with what this discovery has done for our thinking and our conventional scenarios . "
In addition , Mike Morwood says he has now uncovered stone tools on nearby Sulawesi .
These could be almost two million years old , he believes , which suggests the whole region was populated by very ancient humans for a startlingly long part of human prehistory .
" This is going to put the cat among the pigeons , " Morwood says .
However , it is the hobbits ' similarity to ancient African apemen that provides the most compelling evidence for their ancient origins .
In the Journal of Human Evolution , a team led by Debbie Argue of the Australian National University , recently reported that analysis of H. floresiensis shows they most closely resemble apelike human ancestors that first appeared around 2.3 million years ago in Africa .
In other words , their stock may be not quite as old as Lucy 's but probably comes from a hominid , known as Homo habilis , that appeared on the evolutionary scene not long after Lucy 's species disappeared .
Homo habilis 's features now seem to match , most closely , those of H. floresiensis .
Consider those hobbit feet , for example .
The skeleton unearthed on Flores had a foot that was 20 cm in length .
This produces a ratio of 70 per cent when compared with the length of the hobbit 's thigh bone .
By contrast , men and women today have foot - to - thigh bone ratios of 55 per cent .
The little folk of Flores had singularly short legs and long , flapper feet , very similar to those of African apemen , even though limbs like these would have made their long march from Africa to Flores a painful business .
Similarly , the hands of H. floresiensis were more like apes than those of evolved humans , their wrists possessing trapezoid bones that would have made the delicate art of stone tool - making very difficult .
Their teeth show primitive traits while their brains were little bigger than those of chimpanzees , though CT scans of skull interiors suggest they may have had cognitive skills not possessed by apes .
Nevertheless , this little apeman , with poor physique , a chimp - sized brain and only a limited ability to make tools , now appears to have left Africa , travelled thousands of miles and somehow colonised part , if not all , of south - east Asia two million years ago .
Scientists had previously assumed only a far more advanced human ancestor , such as Homo erectus , was capable of undertaking that task and only managed to do so about a million years ago when our predecessors had evolved powerful physiques , a good gait and the beginnings of intellect .
Without these , we would have got nowhere , it was implied .
Then along came little H. floresiensis which , quite simply , has " no business being there , " says Morwood .
And you can see what he means .
Apart from the sheer improbability of a jumped - up ape travelling from Africa to Indonesia , there is the particular puzzle of how it got to Flores .
Primitive hominids were almost certainly incapable of sailing .
So how did it arrive on the island in the first place ?
It is a puzzle , although Stringer believes the region 's intense tectonic activity is significant .
" After the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 , people were found far out at sea clinging to rafts of vegetation .
Things like that could have happened regularly in the past and people could have been swept out to sea and washed ashore on Flores .
Alternatively , there could have been short - lived connections between now separate islands . "
Thus , ancient African apemen travelled half the world , made homes across Indonesia and , in one case , were washed out to sea to end up colonising a remote island that was already populated with pygmy elephants , called stegadons , and giant Komodo dragons , which are still found on the island .
It is a truly fantastic tale , worthy of Rider Haggard , and it has turned the study of human evolution on its head .
And then there is the report that dates the stone tools found on Flores as being 1.1 million years old .
" That is utterly remarkable on its own , " adds Morwood .
" Until we found these dates , the longest period of island isolation that we knew about occurred on Tasmania where the aboriginal people were cut off from mainland Australia 11,000 years ago .
We thought that was an amazing length of time .
But now we have found an island where early humans were cut off from the rest of evolution for more than a million years . "
In addition , there are those completed digs carried out by Morwood which suggest that some type of human being was making stone implements up to two million years ago .
A crucial aspect to this remarkable story is the region 's geography , Morwood believes .
The ocean currents and the remoteness of Flores make the island difficult to get to , so once a species does get there , it will remain well protected on it , he argues .
" Flores seems to protect species that are long past their use - by dates .
There were those pygmy elephants , and the Komodo dragon , for example .
And now we have Homo floresiensis .
It may be that only a few animals get there but when they do arrive they tend to survive for a long time , which has been science 's good fortune . "
That is putting it mildly .
Had not the original Australian team , led by Morwood , uncovered those hobbit remains in 2004 , the story of humanity 's African exodus would have been considered a fairly simple affair .
According to this version of events , Homo erectus evolved from apemen predecessors , such as Australopithecus africanus , in Africa and then headed off around the Old World more than a million years ago , armed with a great physique and a modest intellect .
These allowed it to settle across Africa , Asia and Europe .
This diaspora was then followed by a second wave of humans – our own species , Homo sapiens – which emerged from Africa 100,000 years ago and took over the planet , replacing all pockets of its predecessors it encountered .
Now a far more complex picture is emerging .
Ancient apemen , who might have been thought to lack the nous for global conquest , appear to have done the trick almost a million years earlier .
One of the major tenets of human evolution , the story of our world conquest , is now urgently in need of revision .
As to the fate of H. floresiensis , that is unclear .
The species disappears abruptly from the archaeological record 17,000 years ago .
But why ?
They had apparently survived quite happily on the island for more than a million years .
So what did for them in the end ?
There are two competing answers .
The first suggests that the species , after all the good fortune that had helped it endure the vicissitudes of life in the Malay Archipelago , ran out of luck .
" There is a thick layer of ash in the Liang Bua cave above the most recent hobbit remains , " says Stringer .
" We now know this was caused by a major volcanic eruption which occurred about 17,000 years ago .
So it may be that they were just unlucky with the local geology . "
According to this vision , the little folk of Flores were wiped out by choking plumes of volcanic ash or died of starvation on an island denuded of vegetation .
It would have been a pretty terrible way to go .
Yet neither Stringer nor Morwood is convinced that was what happened , despite the tight link between dates of eruptions on the island and the disappearance of the species from the fossil record .
Instead , they suspect a very different agent : the bloody hand of modern humans .
" Look at our track record , " says Morwood .
When Homo sapiens entered Europe 40,000 years ago , on its route out of Africa , they would have encountered the continent 's original inhabitants , the Neanderthals .
Within a few millenniums , the Neanderthals had been rendered extinct .
Stringer agrees .
Homo sapiens left Africa about 100,000 years ago and by the time hobbits became extinct on Flores , modern humans were all over south - east Asia .
" I can not see Homo floresiensis keeping modern humans off the island .
There must have been encounters between them and us .
It is wonderful to speculate what might have happened when they met up , but I suspect that those moderns used up the resources that the hobbit needed to survive . "

Over 100 thousand government supporters have massed in central Tehran to mark the anniversary of the 1979 revolution that created Iran 's Islamic Republic , while a heavy security force fanned across the city to snuff out the opposition 's counter protests .
Police clashed with protesters at several sites around Tehran , opposition Web sites reported .
Dozens of hard - liners with batons and pepper spray attacked the convoy of a senior opposition leader , Mahdi Karroubi , smashing his car windows and forcing him to turn back as he tried to join the protests , his son Hossein Karroubi told The Associated Press .
Thursday 's celebrations were an opportunity for Iran 's clerical regime to tout its power in the face of the opposition movement .
Production of highly enriched uranium
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in a speech in Tehran marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution , announced that Iran had already produced highly enriched nuclear material in defiance of the West .
Ahmadinejad claims Iran has produced highly enriched uranium
" The head of Iran 's atomic energy organization said the first stock of 20 percent fuel was produced and delivered to scientists , " he said in a speech at Tehran 's Azadi ( Freedom ) Square before a crowd of several hundred thousand supporters .
Ahmadinejad stressed Iran was now a " nuclear " state which had nothing to hide and would not be bullied .
" They ( the Americans ) want to dominate our region , but the Iranian people will never let them do that , " he added .
IAEA report on Iran 's enrichment process
Meanwhile , the International Atomic Energy Agency published a document on Thursday that revealed Iran would produce its first batch of higher enriched uranium " within a few days . "
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano wrote in the one - page report that Iran had informed agency inspectors that it had " begun to feed the ( LEU ) low - enriched uranium into one cascade ( of uranium - enriching ) centrifuges " at its plant in Natanz .
" We were also told that the facility was expected to begin production of up to 20 percent enriched [ uranium ] within a few days , " Amano said .
Technology available to produce nuclear weapons
The IAEA head added that " it should be noted that there is currently only one cascade installed in ( Natanz ) that is capable of enriching the LEU up to 20 percent . "
Uranium enrichment is taking place at facilities in Natanz , Iran told the IAEA
Experts say that once Iran has enriched uranium to the 20 percent level , there is nothing to stop it carrying on to the 93 percent level needed to produce nuclear weapons as the technology is the same .
The West suspects the Islamic Republic of using its nuclear energy program as a cover for efforts to build atomic weapons , a charge repeatedly denied by Iran , which insists its program aims solely to meet growing energy needs .

A diamond - based nanowire device .
Researchers used a top - down nanofabrication technique to embed color centers into a variety of machined structures .
By creating large device arrays rather than just " one - of - a- kind " designs , the realization of quantum networks and systems , which require the integration and manipulation of many devices in parallel , is more likely .
Illustrated by Jay Penni .
By creating diamond - based nanowire devices , a team at Harvard has taken another step towards making applications based on quantum science and technology possible .
The new device offers a bright , stable source of single photons at room temperature , an essential element in making fast and secure computing with light practical .
The finding could lead to a new class of nanostructured diamond devices suitable for quantum communication and computing , as well as advance areas ranging from biological and chemical sensing to scientific imaging .
Published in the February 14th issue of Nature Nanotechnology , researchers led by Marko Loncar , Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) , found that the performance of a single photon source based on a light emitting defect ( color center ) in diamond could be improved by nanostructuring the diamond and embedding the defect within a diamond nanowire .
Scientists , in fact , first began exploiting the properties of natural diamonds after learning how to manipulate the electron spin , or intrinsic angular momentum , associated with the nitrogen vacancy ( NV ) color center of the gem .
The quantum ( qubit ) state can be initialized and measured using light .
The color center " communicates " by emitting and absorbing photons .
The flow of photons emitted from the color center provides a means to carry the resulting information , making the control , capture , and storage of photons essential for any kind of practical communication or computation .
Gathering photons efficiently , however , is difficult since color - centers are embedded deep inside the diamond .
" This presents a major problem if you want to interface a color center and integrate it into real - world applications , " explains Loncar .
" What was missing was an interface that connects the nano - world of a color center with macro - world of optical fibers and lenses . "
The diamond nanowire device offers a solution , providing a natural and efficient interface to probe an individual color center , making it brighter and increasing its sensitivity .
The resulting enhanced optical properties increases photon collection by nearly a factor of ten relative to natural diamond devices .
" Our nanowire device can channel the photons that are emitted and direct them in a convenient way , " says lead - author Tom Babinec , a graduate student at SEAS .
Further , the diamond nanowire is designed to overcome hurdles that have challenged other state - of - the - art systems — such as those based on fluorescent dye molecules , quantum dots , and carbon nanotubes — as the device can be readily replicated and integrated with a variety of nano - machined structures .
The researchers used a top - down nanofabrication technique to embed color centers into a variety of machined structures .
By creating large device arrays rather than just " one - of - a- kind " designs , the realization of quantum networks and systems , which require the integration and manipulation of many devices in parallel , is more likely .
" We consider this an important step and enabling technology towards more practical optical systems based on this exciting material platform , " says Loncar .
" Starting with these synthetic , nanostructured diamond samples , we can start dreaming about the diamond - based devices and systems that could one day lead to applications in quantum science and technology as well as in sensing and imaging . "

Queensland billionaire Clive Palmer has signed a deal to sell millions of tonnes of coal to China in what 's believed to be Australia 's largest export contract .
Mr Palmer says the $ 69 billion , 20 - year offtake deal was signed last Friday with China Power International .
Another $ 8.6 billion agreement was signed with the Metallurgical Corporation of China to build the project in central Queensland .
Mr Palmer 's Resourcehouse wants to develop a 40 million - tonne - a - year thermal coal mine in the Galilee Basin , near Alpha , west of Emerald .
" That 's the biggest coal mine in the world in one go I think you 'll find , " Mr Palmer said .
" This is really a great time for the state .
" You know , things have been a bit quiet lately and it's good to see that we can revitalise the economy . "
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh says the project will boost the state 's economy .
" What the signing of this contract with the Chinese company means is that Australia 's largest single export deal ever signed will be happening right here in Queensland , " Ms Bligh said .
Four underground mines and two open cut mines will be developed , as well as a new coal port at Abbot Point , near Bowen .
A new 500 kilometre rail line will be built to link the mine and the terminal .
Jobs target
Mr Palmer says the project will create jobs .
" It 'll create 7,000 jobs , I believe during construction and operations , and they 'll be direct jobs , " he said .
Ms Bligh says it helps reach her election promise to create 100,000 new jobs .
" We 've already seen 30,000 jobs created in the last couple of months . " she said .
" We still have some 98,000 jobs to go to reach that target , because for some time last year we went backwards . "
Differences aside
Mr Palmer is suing the Queensland Premier over comments she made about his links to the Liberal National Party .
He is a large financial backer of the party but he says they have put their differences aside for the project .
" You 've got to understand the Premier is a very compassionate , caring person who cares about the future of Queenslanders and about jobs , " he said .
But he is still suing Ms Bligh .
" Life 's got to be interesting has n't it , " he said .
Ms Bligh says the defamation suit will be solved by lawyers .
" But neither Mr Palmer or I are going to let any of those issues get in the way of jobs for Queenslanders , " she said .
The State Government could reap up to $ 500 million a year in royalties , dependent on the price of coal .
" That is a huge boost and a massive shot in the arm for the Queensland economy and it's great news for central Queensland and regional Queensland , " Ms Bligh said .
The mine is expected to be fully operational by 2014 .

Dogs have an intellectual capacity similar to that of a two - year - old human child , researcher and author Stanley Coren said at a presentation to the 117th annual convention of the American Psychological Association .
"
One of the most recent breakthroughs is that people began to use tests which were originally designed for young humans -- for pre-linguistic or limited - linguistic humans -- to see whether dogs had certain capacities , " Coren said .
" And that allows you then to do a whole bunch of things , not only to determine whether a dog has a certain thinking skill but to place him in terms of where would you be in terms of human beings , as well as in terms of other animals .
" According to Coren , who has written more than a dozen books on understanding dogs , recent studies have confirmed that the animals have a higher cognitive capacity than scientists had thought .
They are able to learn the meaning an average of 165 words , including hand signals ; the record for most words learned tops 200 .
Coren said that dogs are also capable of performing basic arithmetic that involves counting up to four or five , and that they have been shown to intentionally deceive humans or other dogs .
Coren also reported on studies comparing the intelligence of different breeds of dogs .
He noted that there are three different kinds of dog intelligence : instinctive intelligence , which is highly breed - dependent ; adaptive intelligence , which involves problem - solving and learning from the environment ; and working and obedience , which involves trainability .
According to measures of working and obedience intelligence only , the top seven " smartest " dogs are border collies , poodles , German shepherds , golden retrievers , dobermans , Shetland sheep dogs and Labrador retrievers .
The hounds have the lowest degree of obedience intelligence .
" We all want insight into how our furry companions think , and we want to understand the silly , quirky and apparently irrational behaviors [ that ] Lassie or Rover demonstrate , " Coren said .
" Their stunning flashes of brilliance and creativity are reminders that they may not be Einsteins but are sure closer to humans than we thought .

My submission to the UK Parliamentary Committee is here – this version excludes figures .
Here is a pdf version with illustrations .
In my situation – which is a little , shall we say , unique - it ’s hard to figure out exactly where to start .
So I tried to cover topics that I did n’t think anyone else would cover , other than the “ trick ” where I tried to counter Gavin - esque disinformation .
Update :
I sent the following corrigendum to the Committee responding to an alert comment by reader Tom P :
There was an inconsistency between the caption to Figure 5 and the covering text .
The original caption to Figure 5 ( which stated “ right – varying the Tornetrask and Urals versions to newer versions ” ) was correct as submitted .
The running text should be changed as follows :
For example , Figure 5 compares the published Briffa ( 2000 ) reconstruction ( left ) with a version derived merely by varying versions of Tornetrask and west Siberia tree ring chronologies ( right ) substituting the Polar Urals update for Yamal ( right ) .
The medieval - modern differential changes with these seemingly inconsequential changes one seemingly inconsequential change of version .
Abbi Marper is too shy to speak above a whisper , but she wants to be a policewoman or a nurse .
Her friend Becky Billing is studying to be a plumber .
Charlotte Wilson , the most chatty of the group , is having a problem narrowing her options .
" I want to be a firefighter , but I also want to be a paramedic and a midwife , " she says .
" The trouble is , there 's just too much choice . "
Slumped in the plastic chairs of a Sheffield community centre , shovelling fistfuls of free sweets from the coffee bar into their mouths , the group of girls are all members of Aim High , a dance troupe set up by Becky Billing and Charlotte Wilson 's sister , 17 - year - old Lauren , two years ago after they got in trouble with the police .
" Lauren and I got into a car with some blokes one night and ended up getting home really late , so we told our parents we'd been snatched off the street by strangers , " Becky Billing half giggles , but flicks her hair over her face and refuses to look up .
Before the girls knew it , their parents had called the police and a kidnap investigation had been set up .
When the shamefaced teenagers owned up , they were cautioned with wasting police time and asked why they had done it .
" It was because we were bored , " says Becky Billing , who is 17 .
" There 's nothing for us to do outside of school .
My mum had youth clubs , sports stuff and drama when she was young , but we 've got nothing . "
With the support of the police , the Commission for Youth Enterprise and a few local groups , Aim High grew quickly from six dancers to 55 .
It now holds two classes a week , for young people aged eight to 18 , and recently performed to Sheffield 's mayor in the town hall .
" It 's completely changed me , " says Lauren Wilson .
" I 'm not an idiot any more , for a start .
I 've got plans and stuff I want to do with my life . "
The assumption nowadays is that girls ' lives have dramatically improved in recent decades .
After all , compared with previous generations they have undreamt - of opportunities in terms of freedom and educational achievement .
How , then , to explain recent studies that have caused a ­groundswell of concern among experts ?
For , far from seeing the world as their oyster , it is becoming increasingly clear that teenage girls are a stand - alone demographic in crisis – a group about which much is assumed but little is known .
The first study that caused experts to question the quality of girls ' lives was published late last year : a highly credible look at the mental health of teenage girls in Scotland .
Helen Sweeting 's 19 - year - long study , published in the journal of Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology , concluded – to the surprise of academics , experts and politicians alike – that young girls were deeply depressed .
Sweeting 's research , although geographically limited , was substantial .
Three times – in 1987 , 1999 and 2006 – she had returned to the same part of Scotland to question up to 3,000 teen­agers about their mental state .
Over the two decades , Sweeting found that , while the 15 - year - old boys she spoke to had experienced a small increase in psychological distress , the number of girls of the same age reporting mental issues from mild anxiety to more serious symptoms had jumped sharply .
The 1999 results were alarming enough : the incidence of common mental disorders including anxiety , depression and panic attacks among girls had increased from 19 % to 32 % ( the increase for boys was just 2 % to 15 % ) .
But the 2006 study revealed an even greater leap .
Girls across all social strata were now reporting mental disorders at a rate of 44 % .
Over a third admitted " they felt constantly under strain " .
Those who " felt they could not overcome their difficulties " had more than doubled to 26 % .
The number who said they " thought of themselves as worthless " had trebled between 1987 and 2006 from 5 % to 16 % .
When Sweeting published her findings , some questioned whether her teenagers were an anomalous group , their mental states a sad but unrepresentative snapshot of a specific community .
But a number of other studies , both in the UK and elsewhere , have come to similar conclusions .
Last week government research into 42,073 children between the ages of 10 and 15 concluded that teenage girls were a vulnerable demographic , urgently in need of help .
Dr Alison Tedstone , who led the research , said the choices being made by teenage girls regarding diet , lifestyle and other health - related issues were so consistently damaging that they had become " a standalone group of the population " requiring immediate intervention .
Brought up on the tough , Lowedges housing estate on the south side of Sheffield , Becky Billing and Charlotte Wilson can talk endlessly about the alcohol - fuelled adventures they have had over the years , the fights they have started , the brushes with the police and the friends who have become pregnant .
" All the girls I knew at primary school were really nice and normal , then we go to secondary school and they all went a bit mad , " says Charlotte Wilson , 15 .
" From 12 or 13 years old , most of the girls I know just talk about sex , alcohol , sex , drugs and sex again .
It 's like it 's this big competition and it gets everyone pretty stressed . "
Her experiences echo a vast study of the well - being of youngsters across 30 industrialised nations .
The recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report ranked Britain 's teenage girls as among the worst off for health , lifestyles and school standards relative to public spending levels .
The report found that " risky behaviour " among girls – described as a combination of drinking , smoking and teenage pregnancy – was more acute in Britain than in any of the other nations apart from Turkey and Mexico .
Teenage pregnancy is far higher in the UK than the average across the OECD 's survey .
The UK has the fourth highest teenage pregnancy rate after Mexico , Turkey and the United States .
In Britain , more than 23 teenage girls per 1,000 gave birth in 2005 .
So what 's going on ?
Experts have said it is highly significant that this slew of research has coincided with two fundamental social upheavals : the period in which girls began to outperform boys academically , and the obsession with celebrity culture and the pressure on younger and younger girls to become sexualised .
It is hard for those brought up in the 1980s to understand the world in which young girls are now having to develop their sexual and social identities .
The worst that young women of the previous generation had to contend with was a stolid , lingering patriarchy , a sniggering , Benny Hill - style of humour that was obviously already on its last legs , and Page 3 girls ; a lewdness that today seems more quaint than offensive .
The sexual politics girls find themselves confronting today could n't be more different .
The sex industry has moved from the margin to the mainstream .
Girls are besieged by images that glorify a pornographic view of women .
There is a lap - dancing club in every town centre , six - year - old girls are bought fashion accessories adorned with the Playboy logo , Shakira writhes on all fours in a cage on MTV .
Last Thursday David Cameron said children – and young girls , in particular – were having their ­childhood stolen by a " growing , unnecessary and inappropriate ­commercialisation and sexualisation that is beginning far too young " .
The Tory leader has threatened to ban advertisers who improperly target young children from bidding for government contracts for three years under a Conservative administration .
But according to Natasha Walter , author of the new book Living Dolls , The Return of Sexism , the sexualisation of the young has already wrought ­irreparable damage on a generation of young girls .
In her previous book , The New Feminism , Walter claimed that feminism was fast becoming " part of the very air we breathe " .
Now , however , Walter admits that she was wrong .
She failed , she says , to predict how powerful , how pervasive and how sly the backlash would be .
The air she imagined carrying the perfume of liberal ideals into homes , schools and workplaces has instead , she says , turned toxic .
" Feminism 's own language of empowerment has been turned against it , " she writes .
" The language of empowerment has been harnessed to confuse sexual liberation with sexual objectification .
The impact has been insidious and profound . "
Girls today are growing up in an atmosphere of unapologetic crudity .
Stripping is widely cited as a method of empowerment .
A student claiming to be from either Oxford or Cambridge University published her online sex diaries last week , claiming to be , " unapologetically and unquestionably , a closet nympho " .
Walter calls it the " era of New Promiscuity " , where emotion - free sex is both expected and celebrated .
We are , she writes , living in a culture defined by pornographic sensibilities , where young women are willing participants in online " games " like Assess My Breasts .
Last month a survey of teenage girls found that more than half would consider being " glamour " models – posing almost naked for men's magazines – and a third saw Jordan as a role model .
It is no coincidence , Walter suggests , that anorexia nervosa , the disorder of pathological self - starvation , is on the rise , with an 80 % increase in hospital admissions among teenage girls over the last decade .
Susie Orbach , author of the seminal Fat is a Feminist Issue and , more recently , Bodies , about the western obsession with physical perfection , says things started to get worse for teenage girls about 15 years ago but that the problems had accelerated recently , particularly with regard to body issues .
" What we think of as ' normal ' now in the way girls relate to their bodies would have been considered serious cause for concern 20 years ago , " she said .
" It 's to do with the aspects of celebrity culture that are proffered to them – the post - Thatcherite notions of success and money as a fast track to happiness ; the rapid growth of the beauty and style industries , which prey on teenage girls ; the hypersexualisation of the culture ; and the ambitions of the parents , who want their daughters to feel the world is their oyster . "
The impact on girls struggling to comprehend both themselves and the world around them is not hard to predict .
Who , after all , would n't feel confused and unhappy being raised in this brave new world that demands super - skinny , super - sexy and super - brainy all at the same time ?
Eleanor Martin , a 17 - year - old from Hampstead in north London talks of how her string of A and A* GCSE results did n't seem enough for her parents .
" They just seemed to take my exam success for granted , " she said .
" It was like , ' Well , you 're a girl , of course you 're going to do well . '
I feel like I have to do more than do well at school and be a nice person to please them , but I 'm not sure what else I can do .
I sometimes think it might be a good idea to go off the rails for a bit , just so they do appreciate me . "
This hothouse of expectation has created what the American psychologist Jean Twenge describes as a " narcissism epidemic " which is , she believes , disproportionately affecting women .
Twenge analysed data on 37,000 American teenagers gathered over almost 60 years .
She found that , while in the 1950s only 12 % of the youngsters agreed that " I am an important person " , by the late 1980s it was 80 % .
In 1967 only 45 % of students agreed that " being well - off is an important life goal " .
By 2004 the figure was 74 % .
In recent years the growth has accelerated .
In 1982 , Twenge found , just 15 % got high scores on a narcissism personality index .
By 2006 it was 25 % , an increase largely down to the results of the teenage girls who took part .
" The narcissist has huge expectations of themselves and their lives , " said Twenge .
" Typically , they make predictions about what they can achieve that are unrealistic , for example in terms of academic grades and employment .
They seek fame and status , and the achievement of the latter leads to materialism – money enables the brand labels and lavish lifestyle that are status symbols . "
It is , in short , the Paris Hilton syndrome spread across millions of lives .
Most of all , of course , it affects teenage girls , such as Isabella Grant , a 14 - year - old from Edinburgh .
" I want to be a famous catwalk model , and I do n't see why that 's unrealistic , " said the slim , blonde teenager .
" Everyone tells me I 'm really pretty and that , if I work hard enough , I can achieve whatever I want .
I 've got an agent already and have already had a few jobs .
I am completely determined .
Naomi Campbell has already given up the catwalk .
They need new girls , and I 'm going to be the best . "
The narcissism of young women could just be a phase they will grow out of , admitted Twenge , but she is concerned that the evidence of narcissism is present throughout highly consumerist , individualistic societies – and women suffer disproportionately from the depression and anxiety linked to it .
Back in the Sheffield community centre , Becky Billing admits finding the competitive pressure of her female peers so noxious that she has chosen to opt out entirely .
" I trust my mum and my sister , but apart from them all my best friends are boys , " she admits .
" I mean , I 'm glad I 'm a girl and everything , but I would n't want one as my best friend .
They 're all messed up and I just prefer not to be around that . "
Might such overwhelming pressure to do better , look better and have more explain the recent reports of sharp rises in aggression among girls ?
While young women aged 16 to 24 still have the highest risk of becoming victims of aggressive crime in this country , recent studies have shown a significant rise in the numbers of girls turning to violence themselves .
Youth Justice Board figures for last year show that , while overall crime rates are falling , there is a 50 % rise in violent crime committed by young women , with girls now responsible for around 21 % of offences that reach the courts .
But the changing attitude of girls to violence appears to be having even more worrying knock - on effects .
According to a UK - wide survey of 14 - to 21 - year - olds by Engender , the women 's rights group , one in three girls ( and one in two boys ) think there are circumstances in which it could be acceptable to hit a woman or force her to have sex .
Even Abbi Marper , at age 11 , happily admits to being as physically aggressive as the boys in her group .
" You have to stand up for each other , " she says , her voice rising above a whisper for the first time .
" And you have to stand up for yourself .
You have to show you 're strong . "
Charlotte Wilson , too , is keen to dispel any notion that , as a girl , she might hold back from physical violence .
" Of course I 've been in fights , " she laughs .
She pauses and looks over at her mother , Tracey , sitting alert but calm on the opposite side of the table .
" Remember when I got arrested that time , mum ? " she asked .
" It was when I had the fight with that old woman .
She must have been about 45 .
She told the police I had tied her to a fence with handcuffs and hit her with knuckledusters .
They let me go with a caution after a few hours because that woman had made it all up .
All I 'd done was shove her about a bit and she 'd done the same to me . "
April Foulds left school a year ago at 16 with a single exam success , a basic level NVQ in childcare .
Two years too young to earn money through real work or bene­fits , April is a NEET : a growing population group defined by not being in education , employment or training .
" What am I going to do with my life ? " she repeats , sulkily .
" Dunno .
Maybe I 'll get pregnant and get loads of money off the government . "
Her friends squawk in protest .
" Only joking , " she adds , vaguely .
For all their brash , surface confidence , Charlotte Wilson , April Foulds , Abbi Marper and Becky Billing do n't seem to feel liberated or empowered .
Instead , as they gain confidence and open up , they inadvertently reveal low expectations and poor self - esteem .
The message is that for modern teenage girls the encouragement to do better , look better and have more has become almost unbearable .
They need help and they need it urgently – not only for themselves but for the next generation , whose mothers they will be .
On February 16 , President Barack Obama announced loan guarantees totaling more than $ 8 billion for two new light - water reactors in Georgia , part of an initiative to restart the nuclear power industry in the U.S.
Just three weeks earlier , Secretary of Energy Steven Chu had announced the formation of a Blue - Ribbon Commission on America 's Nuclear Future to resolve what to do with the waste produced by those future reactors — as well as the 2,000 metric tons a year produced by the 104 reactors currently in operation in the U.S.
After all , the Obama administration has halted plans to store spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada — a geologic repository that never opened .
Such struggles to find a permanent resting place for nuclear waste has prompted some to resurrect an idea that stretches back to the Manhattan Project : so - called fast - neutron reactors that can consume nuclear waste through fission .
Whether it is billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates touting a new design for a traveling - wave reactor or the South Korean government promoting spent fuel reprocessing and fast breeder reactors , observers and governments seem to think it is time to reconsider fast reactors — despite the fact that the designs have a mixed track record .
Since the 1950s , roughly $ 100 billion has been spent on the research and development of such reactors around the world , yet there is currently only one producing electricity — the BN - 600 reactor in Russia , operational since 1980 .
The U.S. " is at an impasse over disposing of nuclear waste , " noted physicist Frank von Hippel of Princeton University and co-chair of the International Panel on Fissile Materials ( IPFM ) , during a February 17 conference call with reporters that included several physicists , his co-authors on a new report on such fast - neutron reactors .
" The interest in these reactors is that fast - neutron reactors are more efficient at fissioning long - lived isotopes … [ and ] ... fissioning long - lived isotopes will minimize the waste problem . "
Going fast with sodium
The most prevalent type of fast - neutron reactor , so - called because the neutrons used to initiate the fission chain reaction are traveling faster than neutrons moderated by water in conventional nuclear reactors , operate at temperatures as high as 550 degrees Celsius and use liquid sodium instead of water as a coolant .
Sodium burns explosively when exposed to either air or water , necessitating elaborate safety controls .
Nevertheless , as far back as 1951 at Idaho National Laboratory , such a sodium - cooled fast - neutron reactor produced electricity .
But attempts to make that technology commercial have largely failed , mostly because of difficulties with controlling sodium fires and the steam generators that transfer heat from the sodium to water .
Japan 's Monju sodium - cooled fast neutron reactor caught fire in 1995 — and has just received permission to resume operation this month after years of technical difficulties in repairing it , along with legal challenges to its restart .
The French Superphenix sodium - cooled fast - neutron reactor operated successfully for more than a decade — but only produced electricity 7 percent of the time , " one of the lowest load factors in nuclear history , " said nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider , an IPFM member during the call .
An accident at the plant cost one engineer his life and injured four other people when a leftover tank with roughly 100 kilograms of sodium residue exploded , according to Schneider .
Further , such reactors require that the spent nuclear fuel be reprocessed , a technical program that involves extracting plutonium and other fissile materials from the depleted uranium fuel rods .
Such elements can then be used in the fast - neutron reactor or mixed with uranium to form so - called mixed oxide ( MOX ) fuel and deployed in a more traditional nuclear reactor .
The U.S. had such a program until the 1970s that was briefly resuscitated by the second Bush administration ; it was again shelved by the Obama administration in 2009 .
Of course , such plutonium and highly enriched uranium are also exactly the isotopes used to fashion nuclear weapons , making the materials security threats .
Already , the world has roughly 250 metric tons of such spare plutonium stockpiled , largely concentrated in the U.K. and France , that has been reprocessed but never used as nuclear reactor fuel .
That 's enough to make 30,000 " Nagasaki - size " nuclear bombs , according to von Hippel .
Bomb - proof reprocessing
The U.S. Department of Energy is spending $ 145 million to research a " proliferation - resistant " alternative to current reprocessing methods , and a House of Representatives hearing last June explored future needs for nuclear fuel recycling .
Such reactors might also help address a potential deficit in uranium supplies caused by the generally low price of nuclear fuel over the past several decades .
U.S. reactors consume some 25 million kilograms of uranium annually but only roughly 1.8 million kilograms of the nuclear fuel are produced in the country , says Amir Adnani , CEO of Uranium Energy Corp. , a Texas - based uranium mining company ; the remainder comes from mines abroad and other sources .
In fact , one in 10 U.S. homes is powered by uranium derived from old Soviet nuclear warheads via the Megatons to Megawatts program , according to Paul Genoa , director of policy development at the Nuclear Energy Institute , but that agreement with Russia expires in 2013 .
Fears of such a uranium shortage led India , which has limited natural supplies of the nuclear fuel , to explore another fissile element , thorium , as an alternative .
Wrapping highly fissile plutonium in a thorium blanket could produce enough nuclear fuel indefinitely , according to the vision laid out by the architect of India 's nuclear program , physicist Homi J. Bhabha , in 1954 .
The Indian government is currently building such a prototype fast breeder reactor , despite limited success with a precursor , said Princeton physicist M. V. Ramana during the IPFM call .
" The cost of electricity is 80 percent higher than from heavy - water reactors , " he added .
Uranium prices would need to increase 15 - fold from current levels of roughly $ 80 per kilogram to make it economically attractive .
Pricey power
Indeed , the cost problem plagues not just efforts to find a way to use nuclear waste , but also the nuclear industry in general — new conventional reactors such as the ones in Georgia that received the White House 's initial loan guarantees could cost at least $ 7 billion per reactor .
But the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission may have just raised the price after it rejected the initial AP - 1000 design for security and safety reasons , insisting that the power plant buildings need more structural strength .
Yet the promise of a generator that continuously supplies electricity with low greenhouse gas emissions is driving a government - backed renaissance .
Nuclear reactors " produce about 20 percent of our electricity but fully 70 percent of our carbon - free electricity , " Chu noted during a conference call with reporters after the loan guarantee announcements .
Fast - neutron reactors would not improve the economics of nuclear power based on past experience , the IPFM members argued .
Nevertheless , China has signed an agreement with Russia to design two 880 - megawatt fast - neutron reactors based on the BN - 600 .
As far back as 1956 , Adm . Hyman Rickover , who oversaw both the Navy 's nuclear - propulsion efforts as well as the dawn of the civilian nuclear power industry , cited such sodium - cooled fast - neutron reactors as " expensive to build , complex to operate , susceptible to prolonged shutdown as a result of even minor malfunctions , and difficult and time - consuming to repair . "
That judgment remains despite six decades and $ 100 billion of global effort , according to physicist Michael Dittmar of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who wrote , " ideas about near - future commercial fission breeder reactors are nothing but wishful thinking " in a November 2009 analysis .
" For that $ 100 billion we did learn some things , " remarked physicist Thomas Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group , during the IPFM call .
" We learned that fast reactors were going to cost substantially more than light - water reactors … [ and ] … that , relative to thermal reactors , they 're not very reliable . "
Traveling - wave reactor
New designs might help with that , such as the traveling - wave reactor from TerraPower touted by Bill Gates recently as part of an effort to get to zero carbon emissions from the energy sector .
The proposed technology would employ cores that , starting with enriched uranium , fission over at least 30 years .
The cores could theoretically also employ the depleted uranium from existing reactors , as well , thus consuming some of the nuclear waste problem , explains nuclear engineer John Gilleland , president of TerraPower , in a video demonstration
" The idea does have the advantage of being waste - eating .
It would n't require reprocessing , " von Hippel said .
But significant materials advances would be required to create a cladding , or cover , for the core that could contain a fission reaction for decades .
" It will confront horrendous materials issues in achieving the long lifetime cores that are envisioned , " Cochran argued .
And , ultimately , some nuclear waste will remain .
" The only thing breeders can do is change the volume of waste , " Ramana insisted .
" The issue of nuclear waste disposal is more of a social and political problem than a technical problem . "
The disposal solution of the moment for nuclear waste will likely continue to be fuel rods cooling in water pools before being moved to dry casks sitting on the site of existing reactors — roughly 64,000 metric tons of spent fuel is stored precisely that way today .
" There is no problem with that in the short - term .
Dry cask storage is very safe , " von Hippel said .
" Over the longer term , you do n't want spent fuel at 66 reactor sites indefinitely . "
And even if a fleet of fast - neutron reactors were built , Cochran noted , " you 're not going to eliminate the need for a geologic repository . "
Details were blanked out for a number of reasons Defence officials ' insulting remarks about the public had to be blanked out of government UFO files before they were made public , a memo has revealed .
The Ministry of Defence had agreed to publish its full archive of reported sightings in response to a deluge of Freedom of Information Act requests .
But the once - secret memo , published on its website , reveals " uncomplimentary comments " were edited out .
Comments on international relations and defence technology were also deleted .
Thousands of pages from the department 's UFO files have been released through the National Archives since 2008 , revealing details of reported flying objects and encounters with aliens .
The newly released memo to ministers and defence chiefs , dated September 2007 , discusses how to make the largely " low security classification " information public .
The files are considerably less exciting than the ' industry ' surrounding the UFO phenomena would like to believe
MoD memo
It notes they " include references to air defence matters , defence technology , relations with foreign powers and occasional uncomplimentary comments by staff or police officers about members of the public , which will need to be withheld in accordance with FoI principles . "
The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) recorded UFO sightings from the end of the Second World War until it shut its special investigation unit on 1 December last year .
Officials feared publishing only part of the information would " fuel accusations of a ' cover - up ' , " the document reveals .
" Contrary to what many members of the public may believe , MoD has no interest in the subject of extraterrestrial life forms visiting the UK , only in ensuring the integrity and security of UK airspace , " it says .
" The MoD is aware of no clear evidence to prove or disprove the existence of aliens , and consequently the files are considerably less exciting than the ' industry ' surrounding the UFO phenomena would like to believe . "
The fifth instalment of MoD UFO files was released last week , revealing reports of a large triangular UFO hovering in the skies above former home secretary Michael Howard 's home near Folkestone , Kent , in March 1997 .

Mr Mabhouh died in his hotel room in Dubai last month
Israeli opposition leader Tzipi Livni has applauded the controversial killing of a Hamas commander in a Dubai hotel by suspected Israeli agents .
" The fact that a terrorist was killed , and it does n't matter if it was in Dubai or Gaza , is good news to those fighting terrorism , " she said .
It is thought to be the first time a top Israeli has made such a comment .
Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was found dead in his room on 20 January , having been electrocuted and suffocated .
His alleged killers used fake British , Irish , German and French passports , according to the authorities in Dubai , which released pictures of the suspects , none of whom were caught .
Mr Mabhouh was one of the founders of Hamas 's military wing .
The Israeli secret service Mossad has been widely accused of carrying out the killing but Israel has repeatedly asserted there is no proof its agents were involved .
' Fighting terrorism '
Mrs Livni , the former foreign minister who leads the parliamentary opposition for the Kadima party , did not indicate who was behind the killing .
" The entire world must support those fighting terrorism , " she told a Jewish conference in Jerusalem .
" Any comparison between terrorism and those fighting it is immoral . "
The current Israeli Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , responded to allegations of a Mossad plot last week by saying : " Israel never responds , never confirms and never denies . "
Dubai security cameras picked up 18 members of what local police believe was a hit team .
Diplomatic tension between Western states and Israel has grown over the killing .
VANCOUVER , British Columbia --
The president of the KHL confirmed Saturday that the Russian - based league will aggressively pursue star winger Ilya Kovalchuk once his NHL contract expires on June 30 .
" Yes , yes , because it will be absolutely legal , " Alexander Medvedev said during a sitdown interview with ESPN.com and The Hockey News .
" It 's understood with the leagues that if it 's a free agent or even a restricted free agent , they could decide where to play .
So Kovalchuk has the full right to decide where to play .
We are going to negotiate with him and his agents what kind of agreement could be reached . "
Unless he signs an extension with the New Jersey Devils , Kovalchuk will become an unrestricted free agent July 1 .
Medvedev 's company Gazprom owns the KHL club in St. Petersburg and he 's hopeful the former Atlanta Thrasher will be open to a lucrative offer to jump ship from the NHL .
" The difference between 45 percent taxes and 13 percent taxes is substantial , " Medvedev said .
" We could top that [ NHL ] money he would receive by a substantial sum up .
He will decide . "
In other words , a $ 7 - million salary in Russia for Kovalchuk is akin to making almost double in the NHL and that 's what Medvedev hopes will be the biggest allure .
While the KHL hopes to add a marquis star of Kovalchuk 's stature , Medvedev understands there 's a chance it will lose Jaromir Jagr , who has played the last two seasons with Omsk .
Jagr 's contract expires at the end of the season , and he told reporters last week that he would consider a return to the NHL .
" His contract will expire , " said Medvedev .
" Obviously Jaromir is a one of the stars of the KHL and we would be happy for him to stay .
But legally he has the right to go any place . "
In other developments , Medvedev said he met four times this week with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and reported progress in the strained relations between the two leagues .
" I will characterize it as a constructive meeting , " he said of the last encounter here in Vancouver .
" It was a broad agenda .
Some things could be done relatively quickly , some of it will require time .
But at least now we have an agreement on what should we do , who will be responsible and which results we anticipate . "
Just what exactly the two league leaders were discussing remains vague .
" We agreed not to disclose anything before we reach an agreement , " said Medvedev .
Bettman confirmed meeting with Medvedev .
" It is fair to say we had a constructive discussion , " Bettman told ESPN.com via email Saturday .
" Second , we did n't agree to any specifics .
And , third , we agreed to not say anything other than we had a constructive discussion . "
An obvious point of disagreement is Medvedev 's concern that the NHL has not yet committed its players for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi , Russia .
" You can't change your philosophy overnight but at least we had a constructive discussion , " Medvedev said when asked about what Bettman told him regarding 2014 .
But again , Medvedev warned that Russia 's top NHL stars will be in Sochi regardless of whether the NHL has signed off on it , saying that Alex Ovechkin , Ilya Kovalchuk and Evgeni Malkin have pledged to be there either way .
" They have said that nobody can forbid them to play for their own country in the Olympics , " he said .
" I 'm rather sure that these guys will play on the [ 2014 ] Russian Olympic team .
And it does n't only refer to Russian players but I have heard statements from other European players which are committed to play for their countries in the Olympic Games . "
Pierre LeBrun covers the NHL for ESPN.com .
With Curbed LA 's new look , what better time to take a look at the ... past ?
Here , a round - up of the 10 best new — and rehabbed — buildings of the decade .
To compile the list , we asked local architects , media types , Curbed readers , and various other experts for their opinions .
We tallied the votes and then cast this list , which weighs such factors as architecture , neighborhood influence , and cultural impact .
Not all these are beauties -- this list contains at least one structure that 'll burn your eyes out .
And overall , half are rehabs / renovations of existing buildings , ironic given that California was at the center of the nation 's recent building boom .
But whether they 're architectural rehabs or shiny new structures , all these buildings impacted the city -- and for the better .
The buildings , it should be noted , are in no particular order .
Disagree with the selections ?
Did we leave something out ?
Make your voice heard in the comments .
And now , without further ado ...
Building : Standard Hotel
Architect : Koning Eizenberg Architecture
Year completed : 2002
The background :
An early pioneer in the neighborhood , Andre Balazs ’ renovation of the architect Claud Beelman ’s Standard Oil building not only was a great example of adaptive re-use in downtown , but it introduced a new crowd of locals and tourists to downtown .
The experts : “ With a pirate flag flying atop the building and those vibrating rooftop waterbeds , many did n't know what to make of Andre Balazs ' Standard when it opened in 2002 .
Nor did I when he gave me a tour for an article a few days before the debut -- the giant black foot in a bathroom was especially perplexing .
In a way , the building kicked open the door for those wondering if the young , hip and monied would hang out Downtown .
Much of what has followed shows that Balazs was ahead of his time . " --- Jon Regardie , executive editor , Downtown News
Building : Disney Hall
Architect : Frank Gehry
Year completed : 2003
The background :
An engineering feat , an acoustic wonder , Gehry ’s Disney Hall arrived after years of delays ( cue the parallels to the Grand Avenue project ) .
Internationally recognizable , the music hall now rivals the palm tree in terms of ID'ing Los Angeles .
The experts : " It 's become an icon for the city .
But its image is almost separate from its purpose as a music hall because in an abstract sense , it represents something that is free , risky and loose -- it ’s an attitude for the city .
It 's shows an opening and a willingness to do a major product like this .
It also reinvents the building type .--- Sci-Arc Director and architect Eric Owen Moss [ Photos via The Age ]
Building : Arclight / Cinerama Dome
Architect : Gensler on Arclight
Year completed : 2002
The background : Movie - going got swanky again .
And it was about time .
The restoration of the concrete geodesic Cinerama Dome , and opening of the ArcLight Cinemas theater also marked a new chapter in Hollywood development .
The experts : “ This was the culmination of another multi- year preservation battle for ModCom .
This was very nearly a gory accident as the plans swerved all over the road from using the dome as a lobby , arcade and any number of indignities .
A huge round of applause to Pacific for seeing the light and embracing Welton Becket ( and Pierre Cabrol's ! ) 1963 geodesic dome as the centerpiece of a groundbreaking complex that changed the way we see movies in Los Angeles .
Overnight , every other multiplex became second rate and now we all think a chicken apple sausage with bbq watermelon sauce is a completely normal thing to expect at a snack bar .

Building : Inner City Arts
Architect : Michael Maltzan
Year completed : 2008
The background : Housed on the site of a former auto body shop , the third phase of this campus ( this round added a library , learning center , theater and more ) , earned Maltzan numerous awards .
It 's also one of a handful of new architecturally - minded projects to open in the Skid Row neighborhood .
The experts : “ Inner City Arts fuses its admirable purpose -- arts for the underserved -- with exemplary architecture , landscaping ( by Nancy Goslee Power ) and environmental graphics ( by Michael Hodgson ) .--- Dwell editor/KCRW host Frances Anderton
Building : Caltrans District 7 Headquarters
Architect : Morphosis
Year completed : 2004
The background : Oppressive , innovative or brilliant ?
All or none may describe your feelings about Pritzker Prize - winning Thom Mayne ’s 2006 ’s office building .
We prefer " battleship . "
But it 's an instant landmark for downtown , an inspiration to young architects .
The experts : " It makes a strong case for engaging progressive architects to shape the city .
Morphosis designed a massive government building that is sustainable , beautifully executed , on time and on budget .
Its commonplace to think that designers who challenge convention will cause delays and increase costs , but here the architect turned this cliché around by bringing technology and innovation to the building process itself . " --- Jeffrey Allsbrook , Standard - LA Via Kansas Sebastian and RPA 210
Building : Kodak Theater / Hollywood & Highland
Architect : Ehrenkrantz Eckstut + Kuhn Architects , Rockwell Associates - Design Architect , Kodak Theater
Year completed : 2001
The background : Ugly brings the money , honey .
Yes , the winner of our Ugliest Building Contest is also one of the Best Buildings .
Opening in November 2001 , the Kodak Theater hosted the Oscars in 2002 , bringing the Academy Awards back to Hollywood .
More importantly , the elephant - clad development ( truly god- awful to look at , there 's no way around it ) would eventually bring all those other new Hollywood buildings , too .
The experts : " Hollywood and Highland was the critical first project in the neighborhood , it was a major catalyst for Hollywood development .
The opening of Hollywood and Highland convinced other developers to come to the area . " --- Leron Gubler , President & CEO , Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Photos : Via Phil Dragash and Reto Kurmann and ningtan
Building : Griffith Observatory
Architect : Pfeiffer Partners / Levin & Associates
Year completed : 2006
The background :
It took a 2007 wildfire to make many people realize just how fond they were of the Griffith Observatory ( which almost turned into a giant marshmallow in that blaze ) .
Just a year earlier , the building had finished a $ 93 - million expansion , a renovation of John C. Austin and Frederick M. Ashley 's original design .
The experts : “ One of L.A. 's most visible and beloved landmarks , it received a first - rate restoration , and creative expansion that provided much - needed space and upgrades while preserving its iconic appearance .
The project also represents the most private funding ever raised for a preservation project in Los Angeles .
”--- Linda Dishman , Executive Director , LA Conservancy
[ Construction and interior shots via Pfeiffer Partners Architects ]
Building : Van Nuys Civic Hall
Architect : Kennard Design Group / Tetra Design
Year completed : 2005
Background : City Hall MiniMe , orginally designed by architect Peter K. Schaborum was restored for about $ 22 million , a meant partially meant to mollify backers of the secession movement and give a stronger political voice to the Valley .
The experts : “ Restored to its 1930s - era phallic glory , it 's a great building , albeit a much less impressive one than the downtown version ?. one of the great things about the refurb was that it included a virtual - meeting link up for Valley residents .
That way they could gripe to the city council without driving the 20 miles to downtown ! ”--- Mariel Garza , Editorial Page Editor , Los Angeles Daily News .

Building : Camino Nuevo High School
Architect : Daly Genik
Year completed : 2006
The background :
You ca n’t live in Los Angeles without noticing the number of hulking schools being built around the city .
But rising on an inhospitable intersection , this charter high school is an example of school architecture that bucks the LAUSD tear - down mentality and overspending .
The experts : " It 's a memorable response to a ridiculously tough and tight site .
The facade gives the school a futuristic silhouette that captures the whirring craziness around it , and works to blocks the area 's harsh noise and light .
Inside , a carefully protected courtyard supports an intimate sense of community .
It 's a brave approach that 's sorely lacking in LA 's public architecture . "
--- Sam Lubell , Architects Newspaper [ Photo : World Architecture News ]
Building : Getty Villa
Architect : Machado and Silvetti Associates ( renovation and expansion )
Year completed : 2006
The background : Among lawsuits filed by homeowners and a contentious battle at City Hall , the Villa re-opened following an eight - year renovation and expansion .
And despite the Getty adopting the name Malibu , this one ’s in Los Angeles , people .
The experts : “ There was a lot of community controversy over the Getty ’s remodeling and expansion .
The neighbors feared the expansion would encroach on the neighborhood , they figured they'd heard the rock music from the ampitheater .
But from the beginning , we at the Post thought it was a great project .
We thought it would add to the community ’s cultural place , that it would be a great place to go to that was right in your back yard .
And it is .--- Bill Bruns , Managing Editor , Pacific Palisadian Post [ Photo : Christopher Chan ]
And now : Meet the Runner - Ups .
Brad Friedman Byon 2/11/2010 , 4:12 pm PT
[ NOW UPDATED : Patty strikes back !
Swings and misses again . ]
Oh , noes !
Rightwing blogger " Patterico " , one of the only ones silly enough to throw in with GOP propagandist Andrew Breitbart to defend his employee , accused federal felon James O'Keefe , sez I'm " Liberal " !
And a " stooge " !
Ouch !
Thems good bloggery , Patty !
U shure skooled me !
' Cept for the part where you hit publish before bothering to check your facts ' n ' stuff ...
Patty had his panties in a crunchy wad last night because , as he foolishly seems to be charging , the New York Times never said O'Keefe " dressed " as a pimp inside those ACORN offices in his infamous , highly - edited hit videos --- only that he " posed " as one .
" Did you know that you can ' pose ' as a pimp without dressing like one ? , " Patty uses as the opening line for his pre-discredited article .
Therefore , no correction is necessary for the " paper of record 's " repeated misreporting , or even for their Senior Editor of Standards , Greg Brock , who not only stood behind their reportage that O'Keefe was dressed as a pimp in those offices , but , as detailed in the emails we published in full at the above link , claimed he knew it to be a fact , based not only on the say - so of O'Keefe and Fox " News " , but also on the evidence seen in a mysterious , unreleased video as well as interviews with ACORN employees .
Unfortunately , Brock failed to produce the video he claims exists , or even the interviews with ACORN employees he claims exists , even though ACORN themselves has now told The BRAD BLOG they believe no such interviews actually exist and have requested a meeting with the Times Public Editor Clark Hoyt to discuss the entire shameful turn of events as documented by those sorry emails .
But the " posed " versus " dressed " silliness gets still worse for Patterico who tries , in his ill - considered zeal to stand by the accused federal felon O'Keefe and fellow con-artist Breitbart , to attack not just me , but also Marcy Wheeler at emptywheel and Eric Boehlert at Media Matters , both of whom previously covered my reports on this disturbing matter .
Perhaps Patty thought he was dealing with Fox " News " " Democrats " or something ?
Because both Wheeler and Boehlert --- my " oafish sidekicks " and " pathetic hacks " , as he describes them --- eviscerate po ' po '
Patty in reply today , essentially destroying every silly case Patty was self - righteously and ham - fistedly trying to make .
For example , Wheeler points out how Patterico actually helps make the case that the Times owes readers a correction , and Boehlert points out that not only did the Times clearly " suggest " , inaccurately , that O'Keefe dressed as a pimp in those offices ( as Patty critiques me for reporting ) but they actually reported as much quite directly .
I 'll point you over to both Wheeler 's and Boehlert 's responses to the silly boy , so they can reap the full rewards for shaming him , rather than post the quotes from the Times , etc. here .
You 'll enjoy both responses , featuring stuff like this from Boehlert :
New York Times claiming O'Keefe was dressed as a pimp visiting ACORN offices ?
K. Ready for the embarrassing part where I quote theclaiming O'Keefe was Behold : They visited Acorn offices in Baltimore , Washington , Brooklyn and San Bernardino , Calif .
... Mr. O'Keefe , 25 , a filmmaker and conservative activist , was dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risque high school play .
That , of course , in contrast to what we 've now reported over and over and over , and as former MA Attorney General Scott Harshbarger wrote in his December 7th report [ PDF ] --- which was ignored by the New York Times in misreports on their pages at least eight times since it 's release :
Although Mr. O'Keefe appeared in all videos dressed as a pimp , in fact , when he appeared at each and every office , he was dressed like a college student - in slacks and a button down shirt .
That is just one point , though a major one , in the knowing deceipt behind the entire O'Keefe / Breitbart ACORN video scam which underscores their utter disdain for the truth , for the basic tenets of real journalism , and for their lack of credibility in their dishonest , phonied - up assault on ACORN .
As importantly , it raises serious questions about the credibility of their claims concerning the recent federal felony arrest of Breitbart 's employee , James " TeaBugger " O'Keefe , along with three other Republican activists ( one of them the son of the acting US Attorney ) for allegingly trying to " maliciously interfere " with the phone system of Louisiana 's Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu .
Credibility lost .
Just like Patty's .
But at least he is n't facing the possibility of ten years in jail , so the reasons for his foolishness are far less clear .
Also , since Patty is apparently too much of a propagandist , like his heroes Breitbart and O'Keefe , to actual do the right thing , such as issue a correction , retraction and / or or apology , or even link to Wheeler and Boehlert 's eviscerating rebuttals , you 'll have to let his exceptionally angry readers know about them yourselves , I guess .
Silly Patterico .
Not only is he seemingly incapable of merely challenging someone 's reporting by saying he believes it to be incorrect and publishing his arguments in support , he must also hurl all sorts of names and whiffed attempts at insults to backfire along with it .
Presumably doing so makes his ill - conceived , ill - researched arguments stronger or something ?
It 's all the more embarrassing , of course , because , setting aside his silly ( and inaccurate ) name calling , the arguments used to challenge my reporting are not just obtuse and probably disingenuous , they also happen to be flat out wrong .
Hopefully he 'll clear all that up for his readers shortly , by issuing the appropriate apologies , retractions and / or corrections .
Right after hell freezes over .
UPDATE 2/12/10 : Crash and burn .
Rather than simply do the right thing by retracting and apologizing , Patty has instead decided to double down , twice , in hopes of burying his monumental failure .
If there was any evidence that he had any shame , I 'd call it shameful , but instead , it 's just shameless .
So , in his response to having made a complete jackass of himself , he has now posted two articles trying to extricate himself in hopes of justifying his massive fail .
In his first attempt , rather than admit his errors , he 's essentially chose to suggest that Wheeler , Boehlert and I support child prostitution .
No , really , that 's about all he 's got left .
In his second , even more convoluted attempt at trying to un-embarrass himself , he sorta kinda almost reveals the glimmer of manhood to admit he got his story completely wrong , but it does n't really matter because Wheeler , Boehlert and Friedman love child prostitution --- or whatever ridiculous claim this Deputy D.A. ( no , seriously , that 's actually what he is ! ) is on about .
However , he is seemingly unable to even post that story on his front page .
To find it , you have to notice a link to it over in his " Recents Comments " thing in the sidebar .
So if you 'd like to read it , and enjoy a chuckle , you 'd have to know where it is .
Which is right here .
All of that in lieu of simply posting an update , retraction , correction and apology on the original story .
But that would take a grown up and / or a responsible blogger .
If he was a serious person , with serious critiques of our reporting , I 'd be happy to respond to each and every one of then , of course ( though , really , he would n't come out looking any better if I did , so he should thank me at this point ) .
As I told him via Twitter , I 'm also happy ( unlike him , apparently ) to transparently correct any errors in my reporting .
Unfortunately , he has n't demonstrated any , even though he ( did I mention he 's a Deputy D.A. ?!) likes to use the word " lie " and " proof " a lot .
It seems this Deputy D.A. --- who seemed like a decent person when I had him , in studio , as my guest on a radio show in '08 --- is unfamiliar with the actual definition of either of those words , disturbingly enough .
In the meantime , while Patty enjoys pretending that he 's a crusader against prostitution and / or government waste , and while he 's posted almost a hundred stories on the menace to America that is ACORN ( who has never been accused of running a prostitution ring , much less a child prostitution ring , but has received millions of dollars from the federal government over the last several decades to help poor people buy a house and vote ) , for some reason , Patty has n't seen fit to run a single story on the actual allegations --- two different ones , from two different sets of employees , filed in two different federal courts --- of actual prostitution and child prostitution rings run by and / or operated by Blackwater with tax - payer money , even though the company continues to receive billions of dollars from the federal government since 2001 alone .
Kinda makes Patty 's protestations and savior complex ring a li'l thin , doncha think ?
And it 's made all the more absurd when he tries to suggest my priorities are somehow out of whack , because ( I guess ) I 've actually called out the NYTimes , with hard evidence , for flagrant and repeated misreporting on the O'Keefe / ACORN story ; deferring to Fox " News ' " Steve Doocy and an accused Felon 's claims about himself as evidence for why they stand by it ; and then appearing to lie about it all when called on all of the above .
Can you imagine the stroke that wingnuts like Patterico , Breitbart and O'Keefe would have if a Sr. Editor for Standards at the NYTimes backed up their obvious and repeated misreporting by claiming " MSNBC and Nancy Pelosi said so on live TV .
We believe her " , as the NYTimes ' Greg Brock did in those emails we posted exclusively earlier this week ?!
But this repeated error by the " Liberal " NYTimes works in their favor , so Patterico is foolish enough to defend their coverage ( which even Breitbart is n't dumb enough to do ) , getting his facts completely wrong in the bargain , defending an accused felon who lied to sell his story , and then hiding behind a phony quest to save the world from a non-existent child prostitution ring and government waste when a great deal of evidence exists that both are actually going on under his nose , and neither he nor Breitbart have said a word about it .
All of which makes Patty 's quote from his not - hidden reply to me , Boehlert and Wheeler , all the more amusing :
[ T] hese three are HACKS .
They do n’t care about truth , and they do n’t care about the law .
They care about advancing their liberal agenda , and they are willing to distort any fact and destroy any reputation they think they need to in order to achieve their goals .
Keep swinging , Patty .
You 'll hit the ball one of these days .

Quebec sovereigntists woke up to a political migraine Wednesday induced by their most popular living leader .
Lucien Bouchard , the charismatic former Parti Quebecois premier who brought Quebec to within a whisker of independence , launched a broadside against his old party .
It was a rare comment on current affairs from Bouchard , who has steadfastly refused to talk publicly about politics since his 2001 retirement .
His comments were summed up in a front - page headline Wednesday in Le Devoir newspaper : Sovereignty is no longer achievable , Bouchard says .
Not only is independence on the shelf but it ’s not something Quebecers should be focusing on , Bouchard said during a public forum the previous evening in Quebec City .
“ I learned about it this morning .
But if I ’d learned about it last night I would n’t have slept , ” said Bernard Landry , the man who replaced Bouchard as premier , in an interview with LCN .
“ ( Bouchard ) is a great and complex man . . .
This deeply disappoints me . ”
Landry and other sovereigntists defended their cause , and said they will continue fighting for it even if Bouchard wo n’t .
Bouchard argued that his old party should be focusing on education and economic issues instead — like public debt .
In an additional blast at his old mates , he suggested the party was becoming radical and pandered to prejudices .
For the PQ ’s current leader , Pauline Marois , it was business as usual Wednesday .
She began the day by brushing past reporters seeking to ask her about the Bouchard comments .
Then she started the day ’s question period by asking the government why it had changed the law to allow Orthodox Jewish schools to offer classes on Saturday .
Premier Jean Charest snapped back that she should have taken her former leader ’s advice before the day ’s question period .
The Jewish - schools question is only the latest so - called identity issue being stressed by the PQ in recent months as it seeks to win over nationalist voters once tempted by the now - faltering ADQ party .
It ’s also the issue that caused Bouchard to launch his broadside .
During a public forum on Tuesday night , he was asked about the issue .
Bouchard replied : “ I do n’t like what I ’m hearing from the Parti Quebecois . ”
He invoked the memory of the party ’s most beloved figure , founder Rene Levesque , who went out of his way to demonstrate respect for religious minorities .

“ I think of Rene Levesque , ” Bouchard said .
“ Rene Levesque was a man of generosity .
He did n’t ask questions like that , Rene Levesque .
He did n’t think our identity was threatened . ”
He then went on to say that the sovereignty battle should be shelved for the foreseeable future .
Bouchard was so popular in Quebec that , during the 1995 referendum , supporters would strain to touch him as he delivered a series of speeches to adoring nationalist crowds .
His pro-Independence
Yes side started the referendum campaign at a major disadvantage , before Bouchard — then a federal politician leading the Bloc Quebecois — took leadership of the campaign .
Under his leadership , the Yes rallied to within less than a percentage point of winning breaking up the country .
Bouchard then became premier , and spent most of his time in office saying he would wait for the so - called “ winning conditions ” — like eliminating the budget deficit — before holding another referendum .
That go - slow approach annoyed the PQ ’s most ardent faction .
After one final dust - up with that wing of the party — a fight which , ironically , also started with a dismissive comment about Jews by a prominent Pequiste — Bouchard angrily left the PQ .
In his retirement speech , he cited the so - called Michaud affair and told a shocked Red Room of the national assembly that he had failed to rekindle the flames of Independence .
That was on Jan. 11 , 2001 .
Bouchard has maintained a public silence on that issue ever since .

Pity executives at genetically modified seed giant Monsanto .
Not only are they having to knock heads with Department of Justice lawyers over the company ’s business practices , but some of their most - cherished PR talking points are being obliterated by researchers .
In the past few months , we ’ve learned that its much - vaunted technologies do n’t really increase yields after all ; and are n’t really all that promising for adapting to climate change .
We ’re also getting a trickle of information that calls into serious question the PR talking point on which the entire GMO seed industry hangs : that GMO products are safe to eat .
This is a widely held assumption ; but as Don Lotter showed in a recent paper in the International Journal of the Sociology of Food and Agriculture , there has actually been shockingly little research done on the long - term effects of eating GMO foods–and most of what has been was conducted by the industry itself .
The problem is that government funding for independent research on GMOs is scant–and industry funding is non-existent .
And it ’s extremely difficult for independent researchers to get their hands on GMO seeds without signing restrictive contracts with their patent holders , as the New York Times reported earlier this year .
The independent research that has been done on the health effects of GMOs paints an alarming picture .
Here ’s my discussion of the results of a multigenerational study , funded by the Austrian government , that came out last year on the effects of GMO corn on mice .
Short story : in the third and fourth generations , mice fed GMOs showed “ statistically significant ” reproductive dysfunction .
And now comes this study by three French university researchers .
It ’s a fascinating piece of work .
The researchers analyzed data from tests done on rats by Monsanto and another biotech firm , Covance Laboratories , submitted to European government in 2000 and 2001 .
The firms conducted the tests to prove that their products were safe to eat ; scrutinizing the same data , the researchers arrived at a different conclusion .
The three products in question are still quite relevant : one strain of Roundup Ready corn , engineered to withstand Monsanto ’s flagship herbicide ; and two strands of Bt corn , engineered to contain the insect - killing gene from the BT bacteria .
Roundup Ready and Bt products are ubiquitous in the U.S. seed supply , often “ stacked ” into the same seed .
Here ’s what the researchers found :
in the three GM maize varieties that formed the basis of this investigation , new side effects linked to the consumption of these cereals were revealed , which were sex - and often dose - dependent .
Effects were mostly concentrated in kidney and liver function , the two major diet detoxification organs , but in detail differed with each GM type .
In addition , some effects on heart , adrenal , spleen and blood cells were also frequently noted .
As there normally exists sex differences in liver and kidney metabolism , the highly statistically significant disturbances in the function of these organs , seen between male and female rats , cannot be dismissed as biologically insignificant as has been proposed by others [ 4 ] .
We therefore conclude that our data strongly suggests that these GM maize varieties induce a state of hepatorenal [ i.e. , kidney ] toxicity .
The researchers also found “ clear negative impact ” on their livers of rats fed all three kinds of GMO corn .
They added that it ’s impossible to tell , based on the data , whether the damage was caused by the specific genes introduced to the corn , or–more troubling still –if the very process of genetic modification creates a toxic effect .
And they call for more research :
In conclusion , our data presented here strongly recommend that additional long - term ( up to 2 years ) animal feeding studies be performed in at least three species , preferably also multi-generational , to provide true scientifically valid data on the acute and chronic toxic effects of GM crops , feed and foods .
Here ’s hoping that governments find the will–and the courage –to find such research ; it ’s clear that industry wo n’t .
I want to acknowledge that one risks sounding like a fanatic or a “ denier ” when bringing the issue of GMOs and human health .
Here ’s why .
Nearly our entire corn and soy crops crops are genetically modified–and have been for nearly a decade .
Corn and soy course through the food system like blood in a body .
If GMOs caused harm , would n’t it be obvious by now ?
Moreover , most corn and soy goes into animal feed .
Last I checked , pigs , chickens , and cows on factory animal farms have n’t been dropping dead en masse before their date with the executioner .
Again , if GMOs were dangerous , why are n’t factory animal farmers rejecting them ?
This thinking , I think , represents educated opinion on GMOs .
The logic would be persuasive , if scientists were claiming that GMOs caused spectacular , virulent illnesses , the kind associated with , say , E. coli 0157 or salmonella .
But instead , the evidence I ’m referring to suggests that GMOs cause low - level , chronic damage .
And think of the U.S. diet .
People here tend to survive on refined sugars and processed food , and are routinely exposed to toxic chemicals like BPA .
Moreover , we have high and growing levels of chronic ailments .
To me , it ’s highly plausible that yet more low - level toxins could enter the food stream without causing immediately identifiable trouble .
As for animals on factory farms , their lives are by design short , nasty , and brutish .
The game is to fatten them as quickly as possible for slaughter , not to make sure they ’re feeling well .
So , again , it seems plausible that subtly health - damaging feed could be intorduced without causing much of a stir .

A study that looked at how people behave during pandemics has identified key demographic and psychological factors that may predict protective behaviours .
The study is published online January 30 2010 , in the British Journal of Health Psychology .
Dr Alison Bish and Professor Susan Michie at the Health Psychology Unit , University College London , investigated the results of a number of studies into how people behave during pandemics , such as the recent swine flu outbreak , to better understand protective behaviour and to improve interventions and communication in the future .
The review included the results of 26 published studies on associations between demographic factors , attitudes and behavioural measures during outbreaks including SARS ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) between November 2002 and July 2003 , Bird Flu ( Avian influenza ) in 1997 , and Swine Flu ( in 2009 ) .
Dr Bish said : " These illnesses have far reaching effects because of how easily they are transmitted .
When an outbreak occurs however , people can choose to take steps to protect themselves .
Protective behaviours can be preventative , avoidant or disease management , such as hand washing , avoiding public places , or taking antiviral medication .
We wanted to discover the groups of people that are most likely to take such steps , and the attitudes that are associated with these behaviours . "
Many of the studies found significant gender differences in protective behaviours .
Studies in Hong Kong and Singapore , the UK and the USA found that women were more likely than men to carry out protective behaviours such as washing their hands , wearing a mask or following quarantine restrictions .
Older people were also found to be more likely to carry out such protective behaviours .
Dr Bish explains : " These patterns could be explained in terms of perceived risk , with women and older people feeling that they may be more susceptible to disease than men , or younger people do . "
In fact , greater perceived susceptibility to disease was found to be a strong predictor of protective behaviours in studies carried out in the UK , Hong Kong , Australia and the Netherlands , with those people who felt they were more at risk carrying out more protective behaviours such as good hygiene , vaccination , and disinfecting the home .
In studies investigating SARS and swine flu , greater perceived susceptibility was associated with avoidant behaviour such as avoiding public places .
Having a high level of trust in authorities was found to be associated with compliance with preventative , avoidant and management of illness behaviours .
Dr Bish explains : " As trust is a key emotion relevant to risk behaviour , people who trust in authorities are more likely to follow their advice .
The issue of trust becomes weightier in uncertain situations , making this an important factor in whether people follow government advice during pandemics . "
Dr Bish concluded : " We hope that this insight into the demographic and psychological variables associated with protective behaviour during a pandemic can be used in future pandemic situations to encourage behaviour that will reduce the spread and impact of disease . "
Remember our list of the Top Ten Most Badass Animals Native to the USA ?
Well , Newsweek has taken it a step further and produced a photo gallery of the baddest animal breeds in the world .
Number 8 on the list : bunny rabbits .
Seriously .
The cutie pie you see at right is a European rabbit , whose modus operandi is reportedly to “ reproduce in the manner they ’ve become famous for and overrun whatever habitat they enter .
Native to Spain and Portugal , this hopping plague has trampled much of the world , including Washington state ’s San Juan Island and Hawaii .
In Australia rabbits are partly blamed for killing off more than 10 percent of the mammal species .
They rip up farms , ruin soil , and support lots of other troublesome species , including feral cats and foxes . ”
Other animals on Newsweek ’s list include wild boars and snakeheads in the US , the Indian mongoose , South American killer bees , Russian zebra mussels , Chinese crabs and more .

Nothing can really prepare you for the latest online phenomenon , Chatroulette .
The social Web site , created just three months ago by a 17 - year - old Russian named Andrey Ternovskiy , drops you into an unnerving world where you are connected through webcams to a random , fathomless succession of strangers from across the globe .
You see them , they see you .
You talk to them , they talk to you .
Or not .
The site , which is gaining thousands of users a day and lately some news coverage , has a faddish feel , but those who study online vagaries see a glimpse into a surreal future , a turn in the direction of the Internet .
Before you rush off to your computer to try Chatroulette , it is only fair to let you know what you ’re getting into .
Entering Chatroulette is akin to speed - dating tens of thousands of perfect strangers — some clothed , some not .
The home page is sparse , with two empty boxes — one labeled Stranger , the other , aptly , You .
When you press the Play button , your webcam is activated and you are told that Chatroulette is “ Looking for a random stranger . ”
Up pops a live video and you can chat with the person on the other end .
Hit Next and you are confronted with a new stranger .
In its simplest form , the site does exactly what its name says — it pulls you into a game of roulette .
I used the service for the first time a few weeks ago , and I found it both enthralling and distasteful , yet I kept going back for more .
LA DENUNCIA
La sorella di Cucchi : « A Stefano
negata possibilità di nominare legale »
Al momento dell ' arresto indicò l'avvocato di famiglia
ROMA - « Voglio denunciare un fatto gravissimo : so con certezza che mio fratello aveva nominato al momento dell ' arresto l'avvocato di famiglia Stefano Maranella come suo legale .
Ma ciò gli è stato negato » .
Parla così Ilaria Cucchi , sorella di Stefano , il giovane morto il 22 ottobre scorso dopo essere stato arrestato .
Questo pomeriggio Ilaria Cucchi , il parlamentare dell ' Italia dei Valori Stefano Pedica e l'avvocato Stefano Maranella si sono recati al carcere di Regina Coeli per parlare con il direttore del carcere Mauro Mariani .
L'AVVOCATO - L'avvocato Maranella aggiunge : « Ribadisco che se è vero che sia stata impedita la mia nomina il fatto rappresenterebbe una gravissima violazione del codice penale .
Un fatto del genere accade soltanto quando l'avvocato di fiducia non è reperibile , in quel caso si nomina un avvocato di ufficio .
Penso che se fosse stato difeso da un avvocato di fiducia le cose sarebbero andate diversamente » .
The youth jab :
It 's illegal and untested , maybe even dangerous - but that has n't stopped the Hollywood A - list using Genotropin
Timebomb ?
Genotropin , which people are injecting to look younger , may increase the risk of diabetes
Originally developed to help address development disorders , a drug called somatropin ( also sold as the branded drug , Genotropin ) is being touted as the ultimate weapon against ageing and the elixir of youth .
Devotees claim it can do everything from reducing body fat and increasing muscle mass to reversing the signs of ageing .
But critics say that in their quest for beauty , users are playing with a ticking timebomb , suggesting that the legacy of the drug could be joint and muscle pain , diabetes and even cancer .
Atropine is a synthetic version of a hormone that occurs naturally in the body .
Human growth hormone ( hGH ) is essential for body growth and is produced by the body in increasing amounts throughout childhood .
Production peaks in most people around the age of 30 and then declines .
So , at the age of 20 , you probably produce around 500 micrograms of hGH a day ; by the time you 're 40 , it 's closer to 200 micrograms ; and at the age of 80 , it 's likely to be no more than 25 micrograms .
Convinced that these diminished levels are the cause of the ageing process , affluent 40 and 50 - somethings are illegally procuring the drug over the internet or via unscrupulous doctors .
Think of any A - list woman of a certain age and it's almost a given that she 's been linked to hGH .
Elixir of youth : Genotropin can reduce body fat and increase muscle mass to reverse the signs of ageing
Courtney Love reputedly left a vial of the substance in an LA hotel room and other celebrities are rumoured to be fans of the stuff , which is usually administered by injection .
Courtney Love :
The rock star allegedly left a vial of Genotropin in a hotel room
One British user , who does not wish to be identified , self - administers hGH that she buys over the internet at a cost of £ 600 a month .
' It 's wonderful stuff , ' she says .
' I started using hGH after a skiing accident a few years ago when I damaged all the tendons around my shoulder .
' Two years after the accident , I still could n't move it properly , so a friend who was a body - builder suggested that I tried hGH .
' After just three months , my shoulder had completely recovered , but it was the other benefits that got me hooked .
My eyes were brighter , my skin seemed firmer , my complexion was much more even and my hair was thicker .
But I was also sleeping better and had more energy . '
It truly does sound like a wonder drug , so why is it not readily available ?
' In Britain , somatropin is a prescription - only medicine that is licensed only for use by adults and children who are deficient in the hormone hGH , ' says Professor John Monson , from The London Clinic Centre for Endocrinology .
' Research has been carried out that shows that while there may be side effects , on balance , it 's better for the patient to take it than not .
That 's not the case when you 're giving it to healthy people . '
The professor lists a catalogue of potential side effects , from diabetes and fluid retention to joint pain and more serious diseases .
' Might giving a healthy person growth hormone increase their risk of cancer ?
Yes , possibly .
But nobody knows because the research has n't been done . '
Even if you were prepared to take those risks , Professor Monson is n't convinced you 're going to see the benefits that you might hope for .
So what does the professor say to people who believe the drug has helped them ?
' For a start , you can't rule out the placebo effect or that they may be taking other drugs that are having an effect .
Brain strain hGH was originally extracted from the brains of dead humans but , in 1985 , it was produced synthetically
' But even if the drug is doing what they think it is , you do n't know what risks you might be running in the long term .
It 's like someone saying they drink a bottle of champagne every day and feel brilliant .
Well , they probably do , but that does n't make it a good thing . '
Many others in the medical profession also believe somatropin abusers are running unnecessary risks with their health .
Stanford University carried out a review of all the research into hGH , concluding that using the growth hormone resulted in small changes in body composition and an increased likelihood of conditions such as diabetes .
They said : ' On the basis of this evidence , growth hormone cannot be recommended as an anti-ageing therapy . '
Unfortunately , that 's unlikely to stop anyone who rails against the passage of time and is convinced that a drug can stop the clock .
A music sharing website run by a Teesside man was a case of " large - scale , professional , ripping off " , a court has heard .
Alan Ellis , 26 , who founded the Oink site , denies conspiracy to defraud .
Teesside Crown Court was told he had $ 300,000 in his Paypal account when his home in Grange Road , Middlesbrough , was raided in 2007 .
Prosecutor Peter Makepeace said all the cash benefited Mr Ellis and none went to the artists who created the music .
He had n't sung a note , he had n't played an instrument , he had n't produced anything .
The money was not going to the people it rightly belonged to , it was going to Mr Ellis
Prosecutor Peter Makepeace
The court heard that membership to Oink was free , but by invitation only , and anyone wishing to propose a friend had to make a five dollar payment .
Peter Makepeace , prosecuting , said : " At the time this website was taken down , there were approximately 200,000 active members . "
" Those users had access to about 200,000 audio files .
" This site had facilitated a staggering 21 million downloads of those available files . "
The website never had to upload any music itself , all it did was " provide the facility of linking one person to another who wanted that music . "
He added that it was a case of " large - scale , professional , clever , technical ripping off . "
Oink was set up in May 2004 and hosted in Norway , but later moved to Amsterdam after the music industry asked it to stop .
Following an investigation in October 2007 , which led to the site being closed down , police simultaneously raided premises close to Schiphol Airport and Mr Ellis 's Middlesbrough home .
The prosecution said that when interviewed by police , Mr Ellis refused to answer questions about money , and said it was " out of my hands " what the site 's members did .
Worldwide donations Police found donations from around the world in several of Ellis 's Paypal accounts .
Mr Makepeace said : " It is clear that he received by way of donations personally , almost $ 300,000 . "
None of the cash was going to the music industry , the court heard .
" Every penny was going to Mr Ellis , " Mr Makepeace said .
" He had n't sung a note , he had n't played an instrument , he had n't produced anything .
" The money was not going to the people it rightly belonged to , it was going to Mr Ellis . "
The trial continues .

Three Huge Ways Pakistan Still Is n’t Cooperating
The dramatic news of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar ’s capture has revived a long - dormant spirit of optimism regarding the U.S. - led effort in Afghanistan .
Eager for a clear - cut victory after the country ’s slow - motion collapse during the past five years , many hoped that the arrest of Baradar , Taliban leader Mullah Omar ’s top deputy , would not only be a turning point for the NATO war effort in Afghanistan , but would also usher in a new era of cooperation with Pakistan ’s main spy agency , Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) .
In the New York Times ‘ article on Baradar ’s capture , the paper referred to unnamed Americans who think Pakistani officials , most notably Gen. Ashfaq Kayani , " have gradually come around to the view that they can no longer support the Taliban in Afghanistan … without endangering themselves . "
Baradar ’s arrest was evidence of a " sea change in Pakistani behavior , " Bruce Riedel , a former CIA official , told the Times .
Not so fast .
The circumstances surrounding Baradar ’s capture are still murky , making it difficult to extract any meaning from the Pakistani decision to arrest the Taliban leader .
And even if U.S. and Pakistani interests overlapped in the case of Baradar , there are still a slew of outstanding issues between the two countries that appear no closer to resolution .
" The basic problem is that there are things we do n’t know about this operation , and that we will probably never know , " says Teresita Schaffer , director of the South Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
The most optimistic explanation is that the ISI thinks the Afghan Taliban has become a threat to its interests in Pakistan , and has decided to move against the group .
But Schaffer also floated another , less cheerful , possibility : Baradar , as suggested by this Newsweek profile , is more open to negotiations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai ’s government than some of the Taliban hierarchy ’s hard - line members .
The ISI could have arrested him in a bid to thwart negotiations meant to assimilate the Afghan Taliban back into Afghanistan ’s political fold , which would likely cost Pakistan its influence as the group ’s patron .
In other words , given the information available to the public , the Pakistanis could have arrested Baradar with the hopes of halting Taliban attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan — or they could have arrested him in an attempt to continue those attacks .
Even assuming that Baradar ’s arrest is a step in the right direction , there remains a long list of issues on which the United States and the Pakistani military do not see eye to eye .
The most obvious is the Haqqani network , which operates out of North Waziristan and has become one of the most lethal threats to NATO forces in Afghanistan .
Although General Kayani has shown a willingness to go after Taliban operatives in South Waziristan , the Pakistani military has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. requests to take on Haqqani operatives to the north .
For years , U.S. officials have accused the ISI of maintaining links to tribal patriarch Jalaluddin Haqqani .
In one particularly blunt message delivered in 2008 , CIA Deputy Director Stephen Kappes traveled to Islamabad to tell the Pakistanis , " [ W ]e know there ’s a connection … and we think you could do more and we want you to do more about it , " as summarized by a senior American official to the New York Times .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has also stated publicly that Pakistan ’s ties to the Haqqani network , as well as other extremist groups in the tribal areas , " are a real concern to us . "
The ISI is thought to maintain its ties to Haqqani because it perceives his organization as a valuable asset in countering Indian influence in Afghanistan .
Pakistan ’s fixation with India has also led the country to sponsor Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) , a paramilitary group focused on forcing India out of Kashmir .
The United States designated LeT as a terrorist organization in December 2001 , in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks ; under Western pressure , then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf also banned the group in 2002 .
Nevertheless , LeT reconstituted itself as Jamaat - ud - Dawa and continued to plan and carry out attacks against Indian interests , culminating in the spectacular November 2008 attacks in Mumbai .
The Mumbai massacre raised to a fever pitch Western and Indian calls for Pakistan to crack down on the organization .
" Pakistan has restricted the aboveground organization , Jamaat - ud - Dawa , but not to a significant degree , " notes Stephen Tankel , a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of the forthcoming Storming the World Stage : The Story of Lashkar - e - Taiba .
" They can operate under different names , and they continue to raise funds . "
If anything , Lashkar - e - Taiba has only escalated its activities in the past year .
The day after Feb. 12 ’s announcement that Pakistan and India would hold talks for the first time since the Mumbai attacks , a bomb exploded outside a crowded cafe in the Indian city of Pune , killing nine people .
Indian authorities immediately made it clear where their suspicions lay — with Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram responded by announcing renewed efforts to interview David Headley , a Pakistani - American held in the United States who is allegedly an LeT member .
Whether or not LeT ’s leadership ordered the Pune attack , Tankel says , " the group has clearly been emboldened and is ramping up its transnational activities . "
That is n’t exactly an encouraging sign that Pakistan is doing everything in its power to clamp down on the organization .
Pakistan has charged seven individuals for involvement in the planning of the Mumbai attacks , including LeT ’s operational commander and the plot ’s alleged mastermind , Zaki ur - Rehman Lakhvi .
Although this is an important step , Western and Indian officials have been frustrated by the trial ’s slow pace — and particularly disappointed by a Pakistani court ’s decision to free Hafiz Saeed , the head of Jamaat - ud - Dawa , who they accuse of being behind the attack .
The court claimed that it lacked sufficient evidence to hold him .
In addition to New Delhi ’s anger that Saeed is not facing trial , Tankel stated , " there is concern on the Indian side that there are other people who are n’t being tried , who should be tried . "
He added that some in India have also alleged Pakistan is inflating the importance of several of the LeT functionaries who are on trial .
Pakistan also maintains extensive contacts with underground figures with connections to India , most notoriously the Mumbai - born crime boss Dawood Ibrahim , according to a January Congressional Research Service report .
Ibrahim ’s organization , reportedly with the ISI ’s assistance , carried out a number of bombing attacks on March 12 , 1993 , that killed 257 people .
Ibrahim subsequently relocated to Karachi , where under the ISI ’s protection , his organization has " developed links to Lashkar - e - Tayyiba " and " found common cause with al Qaeda and shares its smuggling routes with that terrorist group , " the report says .
Pakistan has ignored repeated requests from India to extradite Ibrahim — most recently , on the suspicion that he played a role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks .
The lack of progress in resolving these outstanding issues should discourage the United States from expecting a volte - face from Pakistan .
" You have to remember the [ Pakistani ] military is in some ways very cautious , " Schaffer says .
" It has gone through a period of looking very bad in front of their people , and they do n’t want to look bad again . "
Pakistan ’s fraught relationship with India is not going away anytime soon , and for that reason , the military is loath to sever ties with its longstanding clients .
So , however much Baradar ’s arrest may cause U.S. commentators to dream of a revolution in Pakistani foreign policy , they will likely have to satisfy themselves with incremental progress .
A major injustice is about to be redressed .

As it turns out , Senate Democrats may not be able to force healthcare legislation through the chamber on a simple majority vote .
Republicans say they have found a loophole in the budget reconciliation process that could allow them to offer an indefinite number of amendments .
ADVERTISEMENT
Though it has never been done , Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) says he ’s prepared to test the Senate ’s stamina to block the Democrats from using the process to expedite changes to the healthcare bill .
Experts on Senate procedural rules , from both parties , note that such a filibuster is possible .
While reconciliation rules limit debate to 20 hours , senators lack similiarconstraints on amendments and could conceivably continue offering them until 60 members agree to cut the process off .
Another option for Democrats would be to seek a ruling by the parliamentarian that Republicans are simply filing amendments to stall the process .
But such a ruling could taint the final healthcare vote and backfire for Democrats in November .
Or Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidGOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' Supreme Court fight pushes Senate toward brink MORE ( D - Nev. ) could use a tactic similar to the so - called nuclear option to quash the GOP tactics .
If those options failed , and Reid could n’t convince a single Republican to vote with his 59 - member conference , Democrats might be forced to consider withdrawing the healthcare bill .
A Democratic leadership aide confirmed to The Hill that the options outlined in this articlee are correct .
House Democrats have said they would not pass the Senate healthcare bill unless changes are made through reconciliation , which is necessary because Republicans control 41 Senate seats , enough to block legislation through the regular process .
But Republicans may end up having that power even under reconciliation .
“ You could keep offering amendments until you do n’t have any more to offer , ” said a congressional aide , who said he did not know how long senators would be willing to stay in the chamber to move the reconciliation package .
“ What the body ’s tolerance would be is unknown . ”
A former Senate Republican leadership aide said : “ The limit is on debate , not on consideration of amendments . ”
DeMint said he ’s ready to try anything .
“ You ’ll see Republicans do everything they can to delay and stop this process , ” DeMint said .
“ They need to get the message the track they ’re on is the wrong track . ”
Reid spent significant time last year in close study of the Senate rules for fast - tracking healthcare legislation under special budget rules .
Reid stayed away from the special process of passing healthcare reform with only 51 votes because he knew it would be messy .
But since Republicans won a Senate seat in Massachusetts , thereby stripping Democrats of a filibuster - proof majority , it appears Democrats will need to invoke those rules to make crucial changes to healthcare legislation .

DeMint said that using reconciliation rules to pass the House - requested changes to the Senate healthcare bill with only 51 votes is “ tyrannical . ”
“ I think you ’ll see us offering amendments to get us into November , if we can , ” said DeMint .
Sen. Judd Gregg ( N.H. ) , the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee , said : “ You could continue to offer amendments , I suspect .
“ You can offer an unlimited number of amendments on the budget after time is elapsed so it ’s logical that you could also do it on reconciliation , ” Gregg said .
Democrats could try to persuade Republican colleagues to back down and withdraw their amendments after several hours or days of voting .
With a unified Democratic conference , Reid would need just one GOP senator to cut off the process .
The most likely candidate would be Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , who voted with Democrats to advance the Senate Finance Committee bill but has since opposed the healthcare measure on the Senate floor .
Reid or another Democrat could make a point of order that using amendments to stall a reconciliation bill violates the spirit of the Budget Act of 1974 , which sets up for expedited consideration of budget - related bills .
Reid or another Democrat could argue that offering unlimited amendments violates the spirit of limiting debate .
The parliamentarian has ruled that the limit on debate does not allow senators to filibuster the motion to proceed to a reconciliation bill .
The parliamentarian could rule that the same concept applies to amendments .
No one really knows , because a lawmaker has never tried to use amendments to filibuster a reconciliation package .
“ We have n’t ever tried it before , ” said a congressional aide .
Parliamentarian Alan Frumin could rule Republican amendments after a certain number out of order .
But he could also allow the GOP amendments , since they are not expressly barred .
If Frumin ruled with Republicans , Reid would be in a difficult position .
He could either pull the bill off the floor or he could appeal the ruling of the parliamentarian .
With a simple majority of 51 votes , Reid could overturn the ruling of the chair and set a Senate precedent that amendments must be limited to within reason .
This tactic would be similar to the so - called nuclear option Senate Republicans considered using in 2005 to overrule Democratic filibusters of judicial nominees .

China and the US are set for renewed confrontation after Beijing warned of serious repercussions following Washington 's announcement of a $ 6.4bn ( £ 4 bn ) arms deal with Taiwan .
Sanctions were imposed on US companies involved in the deal , and in one of a flurry of unsually strong statements condemning the American decision the Foreign Ministry said : " It will be un­avoidable that co-operation between China and the United States over important international and regional issues will also be affected . "
Earlier it had summoned US ambassador Jon Huntsman .
The Foreign Ministry statement will add to concerns about the knock - on effects of the deal , and whether it will hinder the prospect of new sanctions against Iran at the United Nations Security Council .
Despite China 's reluctance to act against its ally , the US was hopeful that it could win its backing if Russia was on board .
Beijing will postpone high - level consultation on strategic security , arms control and non-proliferation issues , it said .
The Defence Ministry said it was suspending military exchanges because of the " harm and odious effect " of the deal .
The dispute comes amid growing tensions over issues including trade , climate change and internet censorship .
" This is the strongest reaction we have seen in recent years , " said Stephanie Kleine - Ahlbrandt , North East Asia project director of the International Crisis Group .
But she added : " Our real sense is that China is looking to see what reaction it will receive from Barack Obama . "
US officials made no immediate response to the Chinese reaction , which seemed stronger than expected .
The arms deal includes Patriot missiles , Black Hawk helicopters and minehunter ships .
But , in an indication of US concern about Beijing 's reaction , it does not include F16 fighter jets or a design plan for diesel submarines – both long sought by Taiwan .
Taiwan has been self - ruled since 1949 , but Beijing continues to assert sovereignty over it and has said it is prepared to use military action if the island seeks formal independence .
While the US does not technically have diplomatic relations with Taipei , it is legally obliged to ensure that Taiwan can defend itself and has long supplied it with arms .
Taiwan 's Defence Ministry said the deal " gives us greater confidence in pushing for an amicable outcome in our relations with China , and will help promote peace in the Taiwan Strait " .
China is believed to have more than 1,000 missiles aimed at the island .
Taiwan 's relations with the mainland have improved since President Ma Ying - jeou took office in 2008 .
But Beijing 's reaction to the long - expected sale suggests it may have hoped the thaw would reduce US military cooperation .
China 's Taiwan affairs office said the deal " fanned the flames of Taiwan independence " and sent the wrong message , according to the Xinhua state news agency .
Washington and Beijing had boasted of a strengthening of bilateral ties , but in recent weeks the relationship has come under growing strain .
China is thought to be concerned that Obama faces growing domestic pressure to take a tougher line towards Beijing , and was angered by Hillary Clinton 's speech on internet freedom last week .
Although China warned that the speech could damage bilateral relations , both sides subsequently sought to play down the disagreement .
Obama 's national security adviser , Jim Jones , said in a speech on Friday that the US was " bent toward a new relationship with China as a rising power in the world " .
But Jin Canrong , a professor of international studies at Renmin University , said the arms sale would give Beijing a " fair and proper reason " to accelerate weapons testing .
It 's been 18 months since O'Reilly , the world 's largest publisher of tech books , stopped using DRM on its ebooks .
In the intervening time , O'Reilly 's ebook sales have increased by 104 percent .
Now , when you talk about ebooks and DRM , there 's always someone who'll say , " But what about [ textbooks|technical books | RPG manuals ] ?
Their target audience is so wired and online , why would n't they just copy the books without paying ?
They 've all got the technical know - how . "
So much for that theory .
Instead , expect to hear DRM apologists ( either DRM vendors or technologically naive people in publishing who believe what DRM vendors tell them ) now saying , " Oh sure , it works for O'Reilly , but those are tech books .
Regular trade books can't possibly work the same way ! "
During the past 18 months we 've seen a dramatic shift in customer preference from print to digital when looking at sales from oreilly .com , which is a substantial sales channel for us .
And looking across all of our sales channels for individual ebooks — including mobile apps — 2009 ebook revenue was up a staggering 104 % on 2008 ( which was more than 50 % above 2007 ) .

It is time to take stock :
What has the intelligent design movement achieved ?
As science , nothing .
The goal of science is to increase our understanding of the natural world , and there is not a single phenomenon that we understand better today or are likely to understand better in the future through the efforts of ID theorists .
If we are to look for ID achievements , then , it must be in the realm of natural theology .
And there , I think , the movement must be judged not only a failure , but a debacle .
Very few religious skeptics have been made more open to religious belief because of ID arguments .
These arguments not only have failed to persuade , they have done positive harm by convincing many people that the concept of an intelligent designer is bound up with a rejection of mainstream science .
The ID claim is that certain biological phenomena lie outside the ordinary course of nature .
Aside from the fact that such a claim is , in practice , impossible to substantiate , it has the effect of pitting natural theology against science by asserting an incompetence of science .
To be sure , there are questions that natural science is not competent to address , and too many scientists have lost all sense of the limitations of their disciplines , not to mention their own limitations .
But the ID arguments effectively declare natural science incompetent even in what most would regard as its own proper sphere .
Nothing could be better calculated to provoke the antagonism of the scientific community .
This throwing down of the gauntlet to science explains not a little of the fervor of the scientific backlash against ID .
The older ( and wiser ) form of the design argument for the existence of God — one found implicitly in Scripture and in many early Christian writings — did not point to the naturally inexplicable or to effects outside the course of nature , but to nature itself and its ordinary operations — operations whose “ power and working ” were seen as reflecting the power and wisdom of God .
The following passage from the Book of Wisdom is essentially a design argument addressed , circa 100 b.c. to those impressed by ancient Greek science :
For all people who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature ; and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know the one who exists , nor did they recognize the artisan while paying heed to his works ; but they supposed that either fire or wind or swift air , or the circle of the stars , or turbulent water , or the luminaries of heaven were the gods that rule the world .
If through delight in the beauty of these things people assumed them to be gods , let them know how much better than these is their Lord , for the author of beauty created them .
And if people were amazed at their power and working , let them perceive from them how much more powerful is the one who formed them .
For from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator .
Yet these people are little to be blamed , for perhaps they go astray while seeking God and desiring to find him .
For while they live among his works , they keep searching , and they trust in what they see , because the things that are seen are beautiful .
Yet again , not even they are to be excused ; for if they had the power to know so much that they could investigate the world , how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things ?
( Wisd . 13:1–9 )
These words are prophetically relevant to those today who investigate the world but fail to find its author .
Note that the evidence of the creator to which this passage points consists of phenomena that even ID proponents would agree have good scientific explanations : “ fire , ” “ wind , ” “ swift air , ” “ the circle of the stars , ” “ turbulent water , ” and “ luminaries of heaven . ”
The Letter of Clement ( circa a.d. 97 ) , one of the oldest surviving Christian documents outside the New Testament , speaks of God ’s “ ordering of His whole creation ” by pointing , again , to natural phenomena :
The heavens , as they revolve beneath His government , do so in quiet submission to Him .
The day and the night run the course
He has laid down for them , and neither of them interferes with the other .
Sun , moon , and the starry choirs roll on in harmony at His command , none swerving from his appointed orbit .
Season by season the teeming earth , obedient to His will , causes a wealth of nourishment to spring forth for man and beast and every living thing upon its surface , making no demur and no attempt to alter even the least of His decrees .
Laws of the same kind sustain the fathomless deeps of the abyss and the untold regions of the netherworld .
Nor does the illimitable basin of the sea , gathered by the operations of His hand into its various different centers , overflow at any time the barriers encircling it , but does as He has bidden it .
. . .
The impassable Ocean and all the worlds that lie beyond it are themselves ruled by the like ordinances of the Lord .
Spring , summer , autumn , and winter succeed one another peaceably ; the winds fulfill their punctual duties , each from its own quarter , and give no offence ; the ever - flowing streams created for our well - being and enjoyment offer their breasts unfailingly for the life of man ; and even the minutest of living creatures mingle together in peaceful accord .
Upon all of these the great Architect and Lord of the universe has enjoined peace and harmony .
The emphasis in early Christian writings was not on complexity , irreducible or otherwise , but on the beauty , order , lawfulness , and harmony found in the world that God had made .
As science advances , it brings this beautiful order ever more clearly into view .
Every photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope , every picture from the ocean ’s depths , every discovery in subatomic physics , shows it forth .
As Calvin wrote in his Institutes of the Christian Religion , “ God [ has ] manifested himself in the formation of every part of the world , and daily presents himself to public view , in such manner , that they cannot open their eyes without being constrained to behold him . ”
And , “ [ W ] ithersoever you turn your eyes , there is not an atom of the world in which you cannot behold some brilliant sparks at least of his glory .
. . .
You can not at one view take a survey of this most ample and beautiful machine [ the universe ] in all its vast extent , without being completely overwhelmed with its infinite splendor ” [ emphasis mine ] .
Note that “ atoms of the world ” are not irreducibly complex , nor is “ every part of the world . ”
Irreducible complexity has never been the central principle of traditional natural theology .
But whereas the advance of science continually strengthens the broader and more traditional version of the design argument , the ID movement ’s version is hostage to every advance in biological science .
Science must fail for ID to succeed .
In the famous “ explanatory filter ” of William A. Dembski , one finds “ design ” by eliminating “ law ” and “ chance ” as explanations .
This , in effect , makes it a zero- sum game between God and nature .
What nature does and science can explain is crossed off the list , and what remains is the evidence for God .
This conception of design plays right into the hands of atheists , whose caricature of religion has always been that it is a substitute for the scientific understanding of nature .
The ID movement has also rubbed a very raw wound in the relation between science and religion .
For decades scientists have had to fend off the attempts by Young Earth creationists to promote their ideas as a valid alternative science .
The scientific world ’s exasperation with creationists is understandable .
Imagine yourself a serious historian in a country where half the population believed in Afrocentric history , say , or a serious political scientist in a country where half the people believed that the world is run by the Bilderberg Group or the Rockefellers .
It would get to you after a while , especially if there were constant attempts to insert these alternative theories into textbooks .
So , when the ID movement came along and suggested that its ideas be taught in science classrooms , it touched a nerve .
This is one reason that the New Atheists attracted such a huge audience .
None of this is to say that the conclusions the ID movement draws about how life came to be and how it evolves are intrinsically unreasonable or necessarily wrong .
Nor is it to deny that the ID movement has been treated atrociously and that it has been lied about by many scientists .
The question I am raising is whether this quixotic attempt by a small and lightly armed band to overthrow “ Darwinism ” and bring about a new scientific revolution has accomplished anything good .
It has had no effect on scientific thought .
Its main consequence has been to strengthen the general perception that science and religion are at war .
Cui bono ?
Only those people whose religious doctrines entail either Young Earth creationism or a rejection of common descent .
Such people already and necessarily were in a state of war with modern science and have no choice but to fight that war to the bitter end .
Many of them see in the ID movement a useful ally in that war ( as the Dover trial illustrated ) , despite the fact that the ID movement does not deny common descent or the age of the earth .
Other religious people , however , have nothing to gain and a great deal to lose by the ID movement ’s frontal assault on well - defended redoubts of modern science — an assault that has come to resemble the Charge of the Light Brigade .
I suspect that some religious people have embraced the ID movement ’s arguments because they want “ scientific ” answers to the scientific atheists , and they know of no others .
But there are plenty of ways to make a case for the reasonableness of religious belief that can be persuasive to many in the scientific world .
Such a case has been made by a growing number of research scientists who are Christian believers , such as John Polkinghorne , Owen Gingerich , Francis Collins , Peter E. Hodgson , Michal Heller , Kenneth R. Miller , and Marco Bersanelli .
I have addressed many audiences myself using arguments similar to theirs and have had scientists whom I know to be of firm atheist convictions tell me that they came away with more respect for the religious position .
Religion has a significant number of friends ( and potential friends ) in the scientific world .
The ID movement is not creating new ones .

Why a cap - and - trade system can be bad for your health
Daniel Gros
The purpose of a cap - and - trade system is to help in the fight against global climate change .
This column warns that a unilateral approach could increase global emissions by shifting production to more carbon - intensive methods abroad .
Acting alone , the EU ’s Emission Trading Scheme may be doing more harm than good .
The purpose of a cap - and - trade system is to help in the fight against global climate change by putting a cap on domestic emissions .
It is clear that a binding cap on emissions will restrict the supply of all energy - intensive goods .
This implies that the global price of these goods must increase , and therefore production abroad will increase , which will lead to higher emissions abroad .
A carbon tax will have the same effect , which is called “ carbon leakage ” in the parlance of the climate change community .
Most existing analysis of carbon leakage focuses on a small subset of energy - intensive sectors ( steel , cement , etc. ) whose products are often traded intensively .
The EU has actually defined sectors exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage mainly in terms of their openness to trade and found that about 60 % of all Emission Trading Scheme sectors ( accounting for about 75 % of emissions ) are “ at risk ” ( see Appendix ) .
A recent study based on a large general - equilibrium model concludes that about 40 % of any reduction in the production of energy - intensive goods in the EU would be offset by higher production abroad ( Veenendaal and Manders 2008 ) .
1
A cap - and - trade paradox
In recent work , I argue that this focus in much of the literature on energy - intensive industries is misguided because it focuses on the wrong issue ( competitiveness of particular sectors ) and neglects the fact that the output of these industries ( especially energy and steel ) is used throughout the economy ( Gros 2009 ) .
Most products that are traded intensively incorporate thus substantial amounts of emissions via the energy and energy - intensive inputs used in their production .
Given that it is usually assumed that the supply of exports from China and other emerging market economies is rather price elastic , even small changes in relative prices could have a considerable impact on trade flows .
It is well known that carbon leakage undermines the effectiveness of any national cap - and - trade system in reducing global emissions .
But it is not widely realised that , under certain conditions , carbon leakage could paradoxically cause the imposition of a cap - and trade–system like the Emission Trading Scheme to increase global emissions and thus reduce ( global ) welfare .
The mechanism through which this can happen becomes clear once one distinguishes between production and carbon leakage .
“ Production ” describes the displacement , at least partially , of domestic production to the rest of the world .
“ Leakage ” refers to the amount of emissions avoided when domestic production falls relative to the increase of emissions in the rest of the world where production goes up .
For example , if production leakage were only 50 % ( i.e. foreign production increases only by one half of the fall in domestic production ) , global emissions would still increase if the carbon intensity abroad is more than twice as high as at home .
The general point is that the displacement of production , even if partial , can lead to an increase in overall emissions if the carbon intensity of production in the rest of the world is much higher than at home .
Differences in carbon intensity
A key parameter in any judgement of the efficiency of the Emission Trading Scheme ( and the national carbon taxes in France and Sweden ) is thus the difference in carbon intensity between the EU and its major trading partners .
How large is it ?
Estimates of the emissions embodied in international trade have to be based on input - output matrices in order to taken into account the way energy inputs are used throughout the economy .
On this basis Weber et al. ( 2008 ) suggest that ( on average for all sectors ) each $ 1000 of exports from China contains about 2 - 3 tonnes of carbon , about 4 times more than the 0.5 tonnes of carbon embodied in $ 1000 of exports from the EU or other OECD countries .
The same sources also show that exports from other emerging markets have sometimes even higher carbon intensities than those of China .
Another way to provide a crude estimate of differences in carbon intensities is the carbon intensity of GDP , which is ten times higher in Russia than in the EU and six times higher in China ( see Table 1 ) .
Of course , the higher carbon intensities of emerging markets are partially due to their different output mix .
However , this does not change the basic fact that a dollar unit increase in exports from China in general embodies four times as much CO2 emissions than a dollar of exports from the EU or the US .
Moreover , higher exports in general lead to higher income , and higher GDP growth in China is associated with a very higher growth rate of emissions .

Source : Author ’s calculations based on IFM data and Weber et al. ( 2008 ) .
Carbon intensity of exports is based on 2002 data .
Both intensities are measured as tons of carbon per 1000 dollars .
If one accepts as a benchmark that Chinese production is in general about 4 to 5 times as carbon - intensive as that of the EU , it follows that the Emission Trading Scheme might have led to an increase in global emissions if production leakage had been only somewhat above 20 - 25%.2
A proper welfare evaluation of the economic impact of a cap–and - trade system like the Emission Trading Scheme ( or of the more wide - ranging recent French proposal to tax all energy inputs , not only in the energy - intensive ( Emission Trading Scheme ) sectors ) should take into account also the fact that the displacement of consumption and production leads to standard welfare effects ( producer and consumer surpluses ) .
Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conditions for a ( possibly composite ) good whose production creates emissions and thus an externality .
Figure1 . Effect of Emission Trading Scheme with higher carbon intensity abroad
The introduction of a domestic carbon price ( via a ' cap and trade ' system or otherwise ) has two effects :
It reduces global production , from QFTno ETS to QFTETS .
This reduction in global production increases welfare because at the margin the social cost was higher than the ( private=social ) benefits from consumption .
The net welfare gain is given by the area ( covered by little rectangles ) enclosed by the points OADE ( loss of consumer surplus under the line OE but gain of social cost of production below the line DG ) .
The fact that the domestic price of carbon is higher than the price for carbon abroad leads to an increase in the social cost of production beyond the point at which the domestic “ cap ” or ceiling is reached .
From this point onwards , the social cost is not only above the one for the unconstrained case ( i.e. the case without a domestic cap on emissions ) but also steeper because any additional production has to take place abroad .
This increases the social cost for two reasons : first , the private cost of production is higher because the supply from domestic producers cannot increase .
Secondly , the external effects from producing abroad are higher because the carbon intensity abroad is higher .
This implies that the ( global ) social cost of producing the reduced quantity QFTETS is higher by the shaded trapezoid enclosed by the points BCDG .
As drawn , it is clear that an ETS - like cap–and - trade system can actually make the world worse off .
Whether or not this is the case depends of course on the slopes of the demand and supply functions relative to the difference between domestic and foreign carbon intensities .
Gros ( 2009 ) shows in the context of a standard fully specified model that a domestic price on carbon can be counterproductive in terms of global welfare under the following condition :
This condition is more likely to be satisfied the lower the sum of the domestic and foreign elasticities of demand and the higher the foreign elasticity of supply , adjusted for the size of the foreign country .
In other words , the introduction of a cap - and - trade system in a small country that is much less carbon - intensive than the rest of the world has a high probability of being counterproductive .
Moreover , the longer the time horizon , the higher should be the elasticity of supply .
This implies that while carbon leakage might not be important in the short run , it could become much more relevant as time goes on .
This analysis would of course be relevant , mutatis mutandis , also for the general carbon tax recently proposed in France .
Given that France is small relative to the rest of the world and that the carbon intensity of the French economy is rather low , this measure could thus very well have a negative impact on global welfare .
Adopting a domestic carbon tax at the EU level would not change the conclusion much since the EU accounts also for only a limited share of global GDP .
Conclusion
Given that the developing world has now openly declared that it is not willing to accept any binding cap on its own emissions at the Copenhagen summit , it is time to rethink the European approach to combating climate change .
The unilateral approach followed so far might do more harm than good .
In my next column , I will outline a unilateral approach that will benefit the environment with certainty .

Appendix
Article 10a of the revised Directive states that a sector or sub-sector is " deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage if :
the extent to which the sum of direct and indirect additional costs induced by the implementation of this directive would lead to a substantial increase of production cost , calculated as a proportion of the Gross Value Added , of at least 5 % ; and
the Non-EU Trade intensity defined as the ratio between total of value of exports to non EU + value of imports from non-EU and the total market size for the Community ( annual turnover plus total imports ) is above 10 % . "
A sector or sub-sector is also deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage :
if the sum of direct and indirect additional costs induced by the implementation of this directive would lead to a particularly high increase of production cost , calculated as a proportion of the Gross Value Added , of at least 30 % ; or
if the Non-EU Trade intensity defined as the ratio between total of value of exports to non EU + value of imports from non-EU and the total market size for the Community ( annual turnover plus total imports ) is above 30 % .
See : http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission/carbon_en.htm which concludes : 151 of 258 NACE - 4 sectors ( ≈ 60 % of all sectors ) deemed at Significant Risk of CL ( SRCL ) .
Sectors deemed exposed to SRCL account for ≈ 75 % of GHG emissions of industries covered by ETS .
This study arrives , however , at much lower estimates for overall carbon leakage for reasons that are not clear .
See also Renaud ( 2008 ) .
For a different point of view see Gurria ( 2009 ) .
2 It is of course impossible to determine the marginal carbon intensity for exports from emerging economies that are related to the imposition of the Emission Trading Scheme in Europe .
However , the burden of proof should be on those who argue that this marginal carbon intensity is much lower than the average measured by aggregate statistics .
As of January 1 , 2010 , we are changing our name to " Coordination Problem " .
This name change is symbolic as well as substantive .
The term " Austrian economics " has become as much a hindrance to the advancement of thought as a convenient shorthand to signal certain methodological and analytical presumptions .
We started this blog with a clear purpose to emphasize ongoing research in the scientific literature , and developments in higher education as related to economics and political economy .
As a group we are committed to methodological individualism , market process theory , institutional analysis , and spontaneous order theorizing .
And while we do not shy away from policy discussions , we do not identify with any political party or specific political movement .
As an experiment , over the past six months we have been tracking the use of the term Austrian economics in the news and in the blogosphere .
Less systematically , we have also been listening carefully to the use of the term among fellow professional economists and what they think the label means .
The results do not fit our intention .
Google alert , for example , inevitably points to financial advice or libertarian politics , rarely to the research paradigm of F. A. Hayek , never to the scholarship of Israel Kirzner .
Mises is often mentioned , but Mises the ideological symbol , not Mises the analytical economist .
The " Austrian " theory of the business cycle is mentioned , but only in relationship to anti-fed politics and hard money advocacy , and never as an ongoing research program among professional economists .
These trends are not recent , but have been constant throughout our respective careers .
We have always been among those who attempted to offer resistance to this use of the term .
It has become evident to us that our efforts have been futile .
Rather than resist the pure ideological identification , we are choosing to devote our efforts elsewhere .
The name Austrian economics has been lost as a focal point for a tradition of economic scholarship , and is now a focal point for something else .
We have to let it go .
Why " Coordination Problem " ?
The answer to this question has its origins in the seminal work of the 1970s development of market process theory and Gerald O'Driscoll 's brilliant depiction of F. A. Hayek 's research program in Economics as a Coordination Problem .
The contributors to this blog are convinced that O'Driscoll put his finger on the central unifying theme in Hayek 's long and diverse research career .
But our intent goes well beyond Hayek studies , we are convinced that Mises and Hayek identified in the 1930s through the 1950s the central elements of sound economic and social analysis : the problem of economic calculation and the division of knowledge ; the cultural and institutional conditions which make possible social cooperation under the division of labor ; and the arranging ( and re-arranging due to changing circumstances ) of heterogeneous and multi-specific capital goods into a coherent production plan that must mesh with diverse consumer demands .
The role of money , interest , and prices in market analysis all point back to the central theme of the discipline --- the coordination of economic activities through time that results in the " wealth of nations " .
As we head into a new decade in a new century , we believe it is time to think anew the best way to communicate the animating ideas of our shared research and teaching interests .
Adam Smith represented the Scottish Enlightenment , but not all economists who followed Smith 's intellectual path were " Scottish " ; and the same is true we contend for those following in the intellectual footsteps of Menger , Mises and Hayek who represented the great contributions of the Austrian school of economics .
We hope by focusing on the substantive proposition of coordination ( including what it means , how it emerges , and what institutional arrangements facilitate or retard it , among many other important research questions ) we can avoid fruitless debates over intellectual heritage and intellectual purity , and instead open up the discourse to a wider set of economic thinkers .
As we said : " New Thinking for a New Decade . "

When a man died some 4,000 years ago in what is now western Greenland , he probably had no idea that his remains would provide the first genetic portrait of people of his era .
This man , known now as " Inuk " ( a Greenlandic term for " human " or " man " ) left for posterity just four hairs and a few small fragments of bone frozen in permafrost , but that is now all researchers need to assemble a thorough human genome .
And Inuk has just had his code cracked .
The researchers were able to sequence about 80 percent of the ancient genome , which is " comparable to the quality of a modern human genome , " Eske Willerslev , director of the Center for Ancient Genetics at the University of Copenhagen , said at a press conference held in the England February 9 .
He and his team , led by Morten Rasmussen , an assistant professor at the University , were able to sequence about three billion base pairs ( the human genome includes just over this amount ) , which is a finer resolution than that of previous genetic work on Neandertals and mammoths .
Their findings will be published February 11 in the journal Nature .
( Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group . )
At this level of resolution , the researchers noted , individual features and traits began to emerge .
" The guy had most likely brown eyes , brown skin " as well as a genetic predisposition for baldness , Willerslev said .
The presence of hair , then , might signal that he was rather young when he died and had yet to lose most of his hair , they noted .
The genome also tells us Inuk had the recessive gene for dry earwax ( as opposed to the more common wet form ) and " a metabolism and body mass index commonly found in those who live in cold climates , " David Lambert and Leon Huynenboth of the School of Biomolecular and Physical Sciences at Griffith University in Queensland , Australia , wrote in a commentary that accompanies the study .
Aside from painting a detailed picture of the individual the base pairs belonged to , the ancient code can tell scientists a lot about early human migration , much of which has so far been gleaned from archaeological sites and genetic studies of more contemporary people .
The researchers estimate that Inuk 's forbearers arrived in the northern New World ( which includes Alaska , Canada and Greenland ) some 5,500 years ago , but neither they nor he are closely related to the populations of people that inhabit that part of the globe today , as many have proposed .
" People have been puzzled by the relation of these inhabitants , " Willerslev said .
Two subsequent waves of cultures arrived in the Arctic area , and this new genetic study shows that Inuk 's group , of the Saqqaq culture , was of the earliest and does not appear to have intermixed with later inhabitants .
" We can show that this individual was neither a direct relative of Inuits or Native Americans , " Willerslev said .
In fact , Rasmussen noted , " their closest living relatives are [ a population ] in Siberia now . "
Such a definitive finding might clear up some of the mystery surrounding this culture 's origins , which Lambert and Huynen described as " hotly debated . "
But it still does not reveal just how or why the Saqqaq came to Greenland in the first place — or what caused their eventual demise .
Inuk 's remains were originally retrieved in the 1980s , the researchers noted , but then largely forgotten .
This period of obscurity actually helped to render them good candidates for sequencing , as it minimized the potential for contamination with contemporary human genetic material .
" The main difficulty with such work is that almost all excavated ancient tissues are contaminated with modern human DNA , not to mention substantial numbers of fungal and bacterial colonies , " Lambert and Huynen wrote in their commentary .
To overcome this challenge , the researchers studying Inuk found that everyone who was known to have handled the samples was of European descent , so they could test for contamination by looking for traces of modern European DNA .
If it had been handled by someone with a similarly Asian background , the results might have been a little hazier , the researchers explained at the press conference .
Hair , as opposed to bone or other biological materials , is also typically less prone to fungal or bacterial growth , they said .
Although Inuk 's genome is the first ancient sample to be thoroughly sequenced , the researchers do not expect that it will be the last .
More rapid and accessible sequencing is feeding the field , Rasmussen noted .
" As prices go down , it will be easier to do these types of projects , " he said .
Indeed , noted Lambert and Huynen in their commentary : " We have an increasingly powerful forensic tool with which to ' reconstruct ' extinct humans and the demographics of populations . "
Solid biological samples from millennia past might not be as common as stone tools or other archaeological evidence , but there are plenty of other candidates for sequencing , Willerslev noted .
The limiting factor will likely not be the number of specimens or even their potential contamination , Rasmussen said : " What will limit us is fragment size . "
In order to come up with enough genomic material to sequence and check as many as 20 times over , researchers need a large enough biological sample to study .
Such detailed insight can also provide new information about genetic mutations — from skin tone to genetic disease risk — across the millennia .
Establishing that sequencing the genome of ancient individuals is possible " opens up the possibility to go back in time and see " when genetic diseases became prevalent in different populations , Willerslev said .
And for more modern populations that met recent ends , such as many Native American groups and native Tasmanians , genetic sequencing can answer some previously unknowable information about those groups .
Universities must investigate measures , including random dope testing , to tackle the increasing use of cognitive enhancment drugs by students for exams , a leading behavioural neuro­scientist warns .
Student use of drugs , such as Ritalin and modafinil , available over the internet and used to increase the brain 's alertness , had " enormous implications for universities " , said Barbara Sahakian , a professor of clinical neuropsychology at Cambridge University 's psychiatry department .
Normally prescribed for neurological disorders including Alzheimer 's disease , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and narcolepsy , such drugs boost acetylcholine in the brain , improving alertness and attention .
Their use has prompted concerns that they could give students an unfair advantage .
" This is something that universities really have to discuss .
They should have some strategy , some kind of active policy , " Sahakian said .
" The coercion aspect is a strong one .
Some students say they feel it is cheating , and it puts pressure on them to feel they have to use these drugs when they do n't really want to . "
Sahakian , whose work is at the forefront of research on the effects of such drugs on healthy people , said urgent debate was now needed on the ethics of how society dealt with " smart drugs " .
Though data on long - term effects on healthy users was not yet available , some scientists believe that pharmaceutical advancement and ­cultural acceptance could make ­" cosmetic neurology " as popular as beauty " enhancements " .
" If a safe and effective drug is developed which enhances cognition , then I think it would be difficult not to allow access to it , " Sahakian said .
But if such drugs were then legal , many ethical issues had to be addressed .
Speaking before a lecture at the Royal Institution tomorrow on the ethical implications of smart drugs for universities and schools , she added : " The big question is , are we all going to be taking drugs in the next 10 years and boosting our cognition in that way ?
" And if we are , will we use them to have a shorter working week , so we can go home , spend more time with our families and have a good work / life balance ?
Or , will we go headlong into a 24/7 society where we work all the time because we can work all the time ?
" You have to consider there are things that could be beneficial about such drugs because we have an ageing population : people may have to work for longer , and their pensions may not be performing .
It may be , as you get older , that people may want to take a cognitive enhancement drug . "
Surveys in the United States indicate that 16 % of university students are using " smart drugs " .
There are global websites and chatrooms devoted to how to best use drugs to aid study .
Most buy the drugs over the internet .
" That is a real concern , because they are not aware of what they are ­getting , or how it could affect them , " Sahakian said .
A Nature magazine poll of 1,400 respondents – mostly scientists and researchers – indicated that one in five had used " smart drugs " .
Questioned about their attitude towards use , the majority frowned on their use in competitive situations , such as university entrance exams .
However , some admitted that they would feel under pressure to give their child a " smart " drug if other children were using them .
" If these drugs become , essentially , legal , it will be difficult to say you can't use them for a competitive exam , " Sahakian said .
" Students who do n't use them feel this is cheating .
This is something that universities should at least discuss .
Should there be urine testing ?
These questions have to be looked at . "

W hat separates us from the saints is reason .
All the saints I 've met are profoundly unreasonable .
And then there is Gavin .
He is 74 years old .
He wears a cardigan and a tie and his manners are courtly and his posture is perfect , and he reads as widely as any man can who is blind , and interested only in the Bible .
He is so poor he makes the regular poor look rich as Croesus .
He is a lily of the field .
He is unable to sow and unwilling to reap .
He has no home and no job although he once had turf , and income – he used to sleep on a grate , and he begged downtown .
No .
He will tell you that he did not beg .
He will say he stood on the street and if people chose to give him money , it was up to them .
That , in a way , is the story of his life .
I went to see Gavin recently .
He was staying in a room , courtesy of friends .
The weather was cold .
The room is temporary .
Someone had just given him a white cane .
He was not yet comfortable with it .
I asked him why he did not get help from the CNIB .
Gavin said , with the stoicism of a martyr , " God created me to begin with .
The power to create implies the power to maintain . "
The hell it does .
I bit my tongue .
He added , " If I 'm to be put through the wringer ... "
So be it .
What did he do when he worked ?
" I was a business manager . "
How did he become homeless ?
" My eyesight ; once I could n't earn my living ... "
He might have found help , but he would not ask for any .
" I disposed of my goods .
I gave things to the March of Dimes , Easter Seals , Value Village .
It is more blessed to give than to receive . "
That point is moot in my books .
And so he does not bother to have an OHIP card , which might get him some help .
He said , " I have no need of it . "
I did not understand .
He said , " I 'm on a sine curve .
You go in and you come out . "
You do , or you do not .
He said , " This is just a hiatus .
I 'm struggling .
I can see myself coming up . "
Then I guess I am the one who is blind .

I asked about his old age pension ; if he is 74 and has yet to collect , there must be a fair sum waiting .
" God has given me my daily bread for 50 years .
The taxes I paid are revenue of the Crown .
There is no entitlement . "
The hell there is n't .
Would he object if a friend had power of attorney , someone he trusted , someone who would do right by him ?
He sniffed .
" I 'm not a legal moron .
I 've been following the Lord for 50 years . "
Well , that 's all there is to it , then .
As if to clarify he said , " I do n't buy or sell in the sandbox .

PHILADELPHIA , Feb 14 ( Reuters ) - Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , moved a step closer to defaulting on a bond payment when its city council passed a 2010 budget that does not include $ 68 million in debt repayments on an incinerator .
Without the debt provision in the $ 65 million budget , the state capital may miss a March 1 payment of $ 2.072 million , a rarity for a municipal bond issuer .
Joyce Davis , a spokeswoman for Mayor Linda Thompson , confirmed the council ’s decision -- taken at a special session on Saturday -- and said the mayor is not commenting for now on the implications of exclusion of the debt payments from the budget .
The council also defeated a plan to sell city assets to help pay down the debt which is guaranteed by the city on behalf of the Harrisburg Authority , a separate municipal entity that owns the incinerator .
Council members also rejected Thompson ’s plan to raise property taxes and water rates .
The $ 2.072 million payment is the latest installment on a $ 300 million bond owed on the construction of the incinerator .
An additional $ 637,000 is due on April 1 .
City Controller Dan Miller said last year ’s payments on the incinerator were made from a debt service reserve fund that is now depleted .
Debt payments on the incinerator total $ 68 million in 2010 , or more than the city ’s general fund budget of about $ 60 million , Miller said .
Miller said on Feb. 9 he would “ not be surprised ” if Harrisburg fails to meet the March 1 payment .
Asked whether the city may file Chapter 9 bankruptcy as a way to get its debts under control , Miller said that was a “ possibility . ”
The tax - exempt municipal bond market , which states , cities and municipalities use to raise the funds to build roads , schools and hospitals , is viewed as very safe with a far lower default rate than the corporate bond market .
Just 54 municipal bond issuers rated by Moody ’s Investors Service defaulted on their debt between 1970 and 2009 , the agency said on Thursday .
The average five - year historical cumulative default rate for investment - grade municipal debt was 0.03 percent in the period , compared with 0.97 percent for corporate issuers .
The recession has raised concerns of an increase in defaults as states , cities and towns struggle to balance budgets as required by law in all states except Vermont .
So far , however , those fears have not been realized and ratings agencies have played down the likelihood of a spike in defaults .
Fitch Ratings in January cautioned cities against using the threat of bankruptcy as a weapon to win concessions from labor unions .
Even talk of bankruptcy can become self - fulfilling and undermines investor confidence in the market , it said .
Mahinda Rajapaksa easily won a second term as president Sri Lanka 's recently re-elected President Mahinda Rajapaksa is dissolving parliament , clearing the way for early elections , officials say .
Parliament was dissolved at midnight ( 1830 GMT ) and official sources say the poll will probably be held on 8 April .
Mr Rajapaksa won a second term in office by a large margin last month , but the outcome was rejected by his main rival , Gen Sarath Fonseka .
Former army chief Gen Fonseka was detained by security forces on Monday .
Opposition politicians say the government is engaged in a witch - hunt and have called for protests on Wednesday against the arrest .
Bitter campaign
The term of Sri Lanka 's parliament was to have ended on 22 April , with an election to be held as late as June .
The mixed group of opposition parties which supported Gen Fonseka have yet to decide how to fight this campaign and whether to stay together
The BBC's Charles Haviland
Opposition in disarray Election laws require a poll to be held between six and eight weeks from dissolution , and official sources say the date will most likely be 8 April , with parliament convening on 22 April .
The election commissioner must confirm the date of the election .
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says President Rajapaksa is hoping to capitalise on his presidential election victory in January by increasing the narrow majority of seats held in parliament by his Freedom Alliance .
Mr Rajapaksa fought the presidential poll on the back of the government 's successful military campaign to end the long insurgency by Tamil Tiger rebels in the north and east of the country .
Sarath Fonseka had been planning to take part in the elections Gen Fonseka also claimed credit for ending the civil war last year .
They fell out soon after the fighting ended and fought a bitter election campaign .
He was discussing the parliamentary election with supporters at the time .
They say the arrest is an attempt to prevent his involvement .
Although the opposition had rallied around the candidacy of Gen Fonseka , our correspondent Charles Haviland says it is not clear whether the dour general could really have continued to bring the opposition together .
He says its fractious group of parties was already breaking up and forming new sub-alliances .
But our correspondent says it is not impossible for the general to take part in the parliamentary contest while in detention .
Mr Rajapaksa's alliance will be hoping for an absolute , two - thirds majority in parliament to cement his grip on power .

In the last election in 2004 , the Freedom Alliance won 105 of the 225 seats in parliament and the main opposition United National Party 82 .
However , the Freedom Alliance has been able to maintain a workable majority with defections .
The Sri Lankan defence ministry says Gen Fonseka was arrested for breaking military regulations by holding discussions with politicians while serving on the national security council .
Gen Fonseka 's wife Anoma says she has not been allowed to see her husband since the arrest .
Military spokesman Maj Gen Prasad Samarasinghe said Gen Fonseka was permitted to see family members and had been allowed legal advice .

( CNN ) --
Nearly half the world 's primate species are in danger of extinction , according to a report released Wednesday by a major conservation group .
The main threat facing primates -- including apes , monkeys , and lemurs -- is tropical forest destruction , with the illegal wildlife trade and commercial bush meat hunting also playing roles .
Scientists say primates are humankind 's closest animal relatives .
Of the world 's 634 primate species , 48 percent are threatened with extinction , according to the report , issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
The Switzerland - based group calls itself the world 's oldest global environmental organization .
" This report makes for very alarming reading , " said Christoph Schwitzer , an adviser to the group , in a statement .
" Support and action to help save these species is vital if we are to avoid losing these wonderful animals forever . "
A handful of primate species count populations in the dozens .
For example , there are just 60 to 70 Asian monkeys known as golden headed langurs , found only on an island in Vietnam 's Gulf of Tonkin .
There are fewer than 100 remaining northern sportive lemurs , which live in Madagascar , and around 110 eastern black crested gibbons , found in northeastern Vietnam .
The report , which details the 25 most endangered primates , has been issued biannually by the International Union for Conservation of Nature since 2000 .
It will be formally released Thursday at Britain 's Bristol Zoo Gardens .

No photos or video of sweet suffering faces .
No popular vacation landscape for a backdrop .
No personal connective ties .
Are those the reasons the natural disaster in the Great Plains has gone below our philanthropy radar ?
How many of us knew anything about the massive winter storms that have left the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation without power or water or heat for nearly two weeks ?
( Yes , I know many reading this are on the East Coast , like me , nervously wondering if today 's latest blizzard will knock out our power .
But we have resources that tribal people with 80 % unemployment in the remote plains simply do n't . )
USA TODAY carried a story nine days ago but , like most media focused on millions suffering in Haiti , we did n't keep an eye on Native American who are still as freezing , isolated , and miserably unsafe now as then .
Outraged Keith Olbermann is now raising funds at MSNBC for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Storm Relief - Emergency Assistance Fund .
The Episcopal Bishop of South Dakota , John Tarrant is calling for relief funds from Episcopal Relief and Development , and set Valentine 's Day for a special collection to help the 30,000 Sioux in an area the size of Connecticut .
According to Episcopal News Service , Tribal Chairman Joe Brings Plenty , said they lost 3,000 power poles and the reservation water system .
The South Dakota National Guard , the state Department of Public Safety , and the Army Corps of Engineers have supplied some emergency generators .
But according to the release , food , medical supplies and additional generators are needed .
The tribe 's one and only grocery store lost all perishables .
Dialysis patients are also being evacuated three hours away , to Rapid City .
And more snow is on the way .
Is more aid ?
Does it help to show a photo , like the one here of dancers from Cheyenne River on a lovely summer day years ago , to give faces to real people who have desperate needs today ?
Are we like the applauding audience on that old TV show Queen For A Day where the housewife with the most piteous tale and the greatest audience response could win a new fridge ?
Do we move faster to help the cute , the convenient , the folks who tell the saddest story ?
Why do some causes get snowed with aid while others do n't ?
For the first time in many years , the state of New York owes me a tax refund — all of $ 13 .
But our governor , David Paterson , does n’t want to give it to me — at least not right away .
( And he wants to be re-elected ? )
I ’m not alone .
Paterson wants to hang on to about $ 500 million in tax refunds due the state ’s citizens .
It ’s an accounting dodge brought on largely by the political failure of the governor and the state Legislature to balance the budget .
By law , the state cannot run a budget year in the red .
So , rather than face the realities of a $ 1.4 billion budget deficit , New York ’s incompetent , selfish leaders do what they always do — punt , in this case , until next year .
That half billion will be rolled out of fiscal 2009 and into fiscal 2010 .
Out of sight , out of mind .
That ’s New York ’s insanely inept government :
Never deal with reality .
Maybe , state officials promise , I ’ll see my $ 13 in April , two and a half months from now .
Well , I ’d rather be the one collecting the interest on that $ 13 over that time rather than the state .
Sheesh .
Of course , New York ’s financial woes are n’t that simple , and it ’s not always ( but mostly ? )
Albany ’s fault .
Recession + people out of work = higher costs + lower tax revenues + increased fees + fewer services .
And New York ’s not alone .
One estimate puts the total fiscal 2010 budget deficit of all states at nearly $ 150 billion .
Perhaps that ’s why the nation ’s governors were meeting in Washington , D.C. , this past week .
That kind of shortens the distance between those who need to beg and those being begged of — like President Obama , host to the annual Governors Ball at the White House , and Congress , the federal equivalent of New York ’s moronic Legislature .
We need money , and now — that ’s the conversational topic prevailing at the National Governors Association Winter Meeting .
The governors are saying to anyone who will listen , reports Liz Sidoti , the AP ’s national political writer , that :
tax collections keep declining as Medicaid costs soar .
High unemployment persists .
States cut 18,000 jobs in January alone and more job losses are anticipated .
Because states are required to balance their budgets , shortfalls will be made up by raising taxes or fees or cutting services .
Like everyone else who ’s financially under water ( General Motors , Chrysler , financial institutions “ too big to fail ” ) , the states are looking to Washington for help to balance their budgets .
After all , the states reaped $ 135 billion in federal stimulus money last year .
Their reasoning : Unemployment stymies economic growth .
Seventeen states face double - digit unemployment .
The states want up to $ 25 billion in a jobs creation bill Congress is considering .
Creating more jobs would raise tax revenues .
That would reduce budget deficits — perhaps even lead to balanced budgets .
Perhaps .
But the balanced budgets that states might achieve in coming fiscal years would not necessarily represent full restoration of so many services and programs whacked by fiscal or political necessity in the past two years .
States have been under budgetary pressures for years and have repeatedly cut services and pumped up fees for those that remain for their citizens .
Newly balanced budgets would likely just represent an under - served , unsatisfactory , pricey status quo .
And all those increased fees for almost any state service you can name ?
They ’re not likely to go down , either .
No matter what happens to state budgets , no matter whether the president or Congress extends some billion - dollar largesse to the states , services and costs are not going to return to happier times .
And take note : 37 of those governors frolicking in D.C. this past week ( and who ’s paying ? ) face re-election this year .
If Paterson hangs onto my $ 13 , he wo n’t be getting my vote .
( Part of How You Guys - That 's Right , You GUYS -- Can Prevent Rape , and continued from Why Do Men Need to Know About Rape ? )
Rape is when one person wants and pursues a sexual act on , to or inside another person who does not want to participate , and who does not fully and freely consent to take part in that act .
Someone giving consent to sex is someone giving a clear , active and enthusiastic yes , and who is clearly , actively and enthusiastically participating throughout ( we ’ll talk in more depth about consent in a bit ) .
Partnered sex is about two people equally sharing something sexually , but rape , while it involves and effects both people , is only really about what one person , the rapist , desires and chooses to do to that other person against their will .
Unwanted sexual touch or sexual use of someone through force or coercion is rape .
To coerce someone sexually is to get them to engage in a sexual activity they do not want through guilt - trips or nagging , threats , bribes , intimidation or some other kind of emotional pressure or force .
Where on the body is unwanted touch rape ?
Touching someone ’s vulva or vagina , breasts , buttocks , anus , penis , testicles , mouth , or other parts of the body without permission , when that touch is intentional and sexual on your part , or is considered sexual by most people , are all rape or sexual assault ( in some areas , those terms mean the same thing , but in others , they differ based on the activity or situation ) .
It is also rape to make someone else touch YOU when they do n’t want to , or to force or coerce someone into doing something sexual with someone else .
It is rape when one person does something sexual on , to or inside a person who is unable to give informed consent to sex because they ’re asleep or otherwise incapacitated , like via drugs or alcohol ( even if they drank or drugged of their own accord ) , because they 're ill , injured , or emotionally bereft , or due to lack of physical , intellectual or emotional maturity , developmental disability , mental illness or because the person assaulting them is in a position of power over them , like a teacher , clergyperson or police officer .
( If you 're wondering why I do n’t say rape can be , say , vaginal intercourse or oral sex , rather than unwanted touch , that 's because words like sex or intercourse imply that both parties are mutually engaged and involved .
Because rape is n't sex for the person being raped , calling it sex not only enables rape , it also is a terribly hurtful thing to hear as a survivor , and one that can have a harsh impact on your sexuality : if rape was sex , then the victim was somehow complicit , and it also does n’t differentiate rape from the wanted , consensual sex we have and enjoy . )
It ’s also wise to think of attempted rape as very real sexual violence and violation , too .
Someone trying to rape you , but either failing to or deciding not to at some point , tends to leave the person almost raped with nearly as much emotional trauma as if they had been “ fully ” raped .
In other words , almost victimizing someone is still victimizing someone .
While sure , it ’s “ better ” to not - quite be raped than to be raped , I ’m sure you can imagine that it would be very traumatic to have your male best friend force you on the bed and rip at your clothes with the clear intent of raping you , even if he did n’t succeed in , or finish , doing so .
If some of this still seems unclear , that ’s understandable .
Not only is it often hard for people who have n’t been raped to figure out when rape has happened or what it is , it ’s sometimes hard even for people who HAVE been raped to figure it out .
Our culture has some seriously messed up ideas about sex , gender and sexuality which obfuscate the issue .
For instance , ideas that it ’s normal for women not to enjoy or initiate sex ( and abnormal for men to dislike any kind of sex with women at any time , including even when their partner is NOT enjoying it , or abnormal for men not to initiate ) , normal for women to not want sex as much as men ( and normal for male sexual needs to be more urgent than women ’s needs or for male sexual desire to be everpresent ) , or normal for women to want their sexual partners to dominate them without negotiation or concent ( and for male sexual partners to want to dominate that way ) are often stated and taken as absolute facts , even though those things are rarely normal , when we mean healthy , or biological in origin .
In the cases where they are common , these things often have more to do with how men and women are taught to enact or think about their sexuality than it does with our sex or gender , and with a sexual ethos that was designed to perpetuate a power hierarchy for men .
There are prevalent ideas that gay men or boys are fair game for anyone , that the first time a woman has sex she should feel devoured or violated and be in great pain , and that sexual violence is n’t a choice for men , but a biological imperative , but if we just do our homework and think about these things , it ’s pretty obvious to a smart person that they are not truths , but ideas which often excuse or deny sexual violence .
When it comes to young people , you are told so often that sex is something you ’ll regret if you have sex as a teen or an unmarried person , and that if you have sex , something terrible will happen .
So , young people who are raped can figure they ’re feeling the way they are because of sex , not because of rape : they were told they were going to feel terrible after all , right ?
And rape happens from strangers , not from your boyfriend , right ?
Young men who rape , thinking they were just having “ normal ” sex , might also have a hard time understanding that sex was rape because they have the idea that for their partner to be terrified and vacant , or to feel ashamed , guilty or victimized during or afterwards is normal .
Rape Poem
by Marge Piercy
There is no difference between being raped
And being pushed down a flight of cement steps
Except that the wounds also bleed inside .
There is no difference between being rapedAnd being pushed down a flight of cement stepsExcept that the wounds also bleed inside .
There is no difference between being raped
And being run over by a truck
Except that afterward men ask if you enjoyed it .
There is no difference between being raped
And being bit on the ankle by a rattlesnake
Except that people ask if your skirt was short
And why you were out anyhow .
There is no difference between being raped
And going head first through a windshield
Except that afterward you are afraid not of cars ,
But half the human race .
The rapist is your boyfriend ’s brother .
He sits beside you in the movies eating popcorn .
Rape fattens on the fantasies of the “ normal ” male
Like a maggot in garbage .
Fear of rape is a cold wind blowing
All of the time on a woman ’s hunched back .
Never to stroll alone on a sand road through pine woods ,
Never to climb a trail across a bald
Without that aluminum in the mouth
When I see a man climbing toward me .
Never to open the door to a knock
Without that razor just grazing the throat .
The fear of the dark side of the hedges ,
The back seat of the car , the empty house
Rattling keys like a snake ’s warning
The fear of the smiling man
in whose pocket is a knife .
The fear of the serious man
In whose fist is locked with hatred .
All it takes to cast a rapist is seeing your body
As jackhammer , as blowtorch , as machine gun .
All it takes is hating that body
Your own , your self , your muscle that softens to flab .
All it takes is to push what you hate ,
What you fear onto the soft alien flesh .
To bucket out invincible as a tank
Armoured with treads without senses
To possess and punish in one act ,
To rip up pleasure , to murder those who dare
Live in the leafy flesh open to love .
The fear of the smiling man
In whose pocket is a knife .
What is it like to be raped ?
It ’s very difficult to talk about what rape feels like at exactly the moment it happens or is going to happen , because words rarely cut it .
Rape is a physical , emotional , intellectual , spiritual , personal identity , gender and sexual violation , all at once .
At the moment it happens , for most rape victims , something in the fabric of the world as we knew it rips wide open .
For those who had such low self - esteem they already felt they only deserved pain or suffering , rape validates that feeling .
But the pain of rape does n’t stop once the rape is over : not even close .
During wanted sex with another person which is about the pleasure and personhood of everyone involved , we might feel excited , physically and emotionally high , close to that other person , awakened , taken care of , put in the best kind of spotlight , dizzy , heady or totally blissed - out .
We tend to have a silly grin on our faces afterwards that our friends often notice .
Even with sex that was n’t the best sex we ever had , when we have it with someone we like and care for , and when it ’s wanted , while we may be a little let down , we ’re not likely to feel traumatized or to be doing all we can to keep from crying or having a nervous breakdown .
What is in our heads the whole time we ’re having wanted sex is something like “ Yesyesyes -- moremoremore , ” not “ Nonono – stopstopstop . ”
It ’s “ I wish we could do this all day , ” not “ I wish he would just kill me and be done with it . ”
We should be present with our partner , glad they ’re there , not trying our best to block out what ’s going on and put our minds somewhere else in some effort to preserve our sanity and selfhood .
Most of us can agree that sex with another person which is wanted , and which absolutely was about us , not just the other person , will leave us feeling emotionally and physically uplifted or relaxed , not violated and injured .
After a rape , sexual abuse or attempted rape , a person who has been victimized often experiences what Ann Burgess and Lynda Holmstrom coined Rape Trauma Syndrome in 1974 .
RAINN outlines those three phases and their effects as follows :
The Acute Phase :
This phase occurs immediately after the assault and usually lasts a few days to several weeks .
In this phase individuals can have many reactions but they typically fall into three categories of reactions :
Expressed -
This is when the survivor is openly emotional .
He or she may appear agitated or hysterical , he or she may suffer from crying spells or anxiety attacks .
- This is when the survivor is openly emotional .
He or she may appear agitated or hysterical , he or she may suffer from crying spells or anxiety attacks .
Controlled -
This is when the survivor appears to be without emotion and acts as if “ nothing happened ” and “ everything is fine . ”
This appearance of calm may be shock .
- This is when the survivor appears to be without emotion and acts as if “ nothing happened ” and “ everything is fine . ”
This appearance of calm may be shock .
Shocked Disbelief -
This is when the survivor reacts with a strong sense of disorientation .
He or she may have difficulty concentrating , making decisions , or doing everyday tasks .
He or she may also have poor recall of the assault .
The Outward Adjustment Phase : During this phase the individual resumes what appears to be his or her “ normal ” life but inside is suffering from considerable turmoil .
In this phase there are five primary coping techniques :
Minimization - Pretends that “ everything is fine ” or that “ it could have been worse . ”
- Pretends that “ everything is fine ” or that “ it could have been worse . ”
Dramatization - Cannot stop talking about the assault and it is what dominates their life and identity .
- Cannot stop talking about the assault and it is what dominates their life and identity .
Suppression - Refuses to discuss , acts as if it did not happen .
- Refuses to discuss , acts as if it did not happen .
Explanation - Analyzes what happened - what the individual did , what the rapist was thinking / feeling .
- Analyzes what happened - what the individual did , what the rapist was thinking / feeling .
Flight -
Tries to escape the pain ( moving , changing jobs , changing appearance , changing relationships , etc. ) .
There are many symptoms or behaviors that appear during this phase including : Continuing anxiety , severe mood swings , a sense of helplessness , persistent fears or phobias , depression , rage , difficulty sleeping ( nightmares , insomnia , etc ) , eating difficulties ( nausea , vomiting , compulsive eating , etc ) , denial , withdrawal from friends , family , activities , hypervigilance , reluctance to leave house and / or go places that remind the individual of the assault , sexual problems , difficulty concentrating and / or flashbacks .
The Resolution Phase : During this phase the assault is no longer the central focus of the individual ’s life .
While he or she may recognize that he or she will never forget the assault ; the pain and negative outcomes lessen over time .
Often the individual will begin to accept the rape as part of his or her life and chooses to move on .
Some rape victims do not get to that resolution phase or take a long time to get to it , particularly those in communities or areas where they are blamed for their rapes or are without support and counseling resources .
Rape survivors also -- sometimes even years and years after a rape -- often have to deal with difficult reactions to their rapes from their sexual or romantic partners .
Given how much cultural stock is still put in women 's value as a sexual value -- and how often rape is seen as having " spoiled " a woman sexually -- and given the kinds of anger men have towards other men , but often misdirect at women , the person one 'd often look to for the most support can sometimes be just one more source of stress .
Too , since those who are raped do not tend to get a say in birth control or safer sex , many rape survivors also have to handle unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections in the midst of all the other trauma they ’re dealing with .
We can safely say that those after - effects are not what most people imagine they will feel after partnered sex , nor are they what most people experience after wanted , consensual partnered sex .
They are not things rapists tend to feel after they rape .
They are , however , what rape survivors feel and experience .

Newly released photographs show what a damaged World Trade Center tower and its collapse looked like from a New York Police Department helicopter as it flew nearby on September 11 , 2001 , in New York .
The aerial photos were obtained by ABC News after it filed a Freedom of Information Act request last year with the National Institute of Standards and Technology , which had collected the images for its investigation into the towers ' collapse .
A couple of the images show one of the twin towers burning after a hijacked airplane had flown into it .
Others show it collapsing , and the rest show the clouds of debris and dust spreading below after the towers crumbled .
Each of the 12 images offers a rare look at what the devastation looked like from above .
Hijackers flew two commercial jetliners into the twin towers that day , killing 2,752 people .
On the same day , hijackers flew another airplane into the Pentagon in Washington , killing 184 people .
A fourth hijacked plane , headed to an unknown target , crashed in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , killing 40 .
Sometimes Desperate Housewives is on at my house when I ’m on my computer , so I half listen to a few episodes here and there .
Most of them are relatively mundane , but when I watched this week ’s episode and heard an ex-stripper had taken up residence on Wysteria Lane , my ear perked up — the story lines were bound to get interesting .
But when that same ex-stripper came out as a lesbian , the show became must - see TV .
Former - stripper Robin Gallagher ( played by Julie Benz ) has taken up residence with Katherine Mayfair ( played by Dana Delany ) after deciding to quit the biz .
She has a few bumps along the way with the other housewives treating her like , well , the stereotype of a stripper — a ditzy harlot out to get their husbands and male children .
( I do n’t understand why women do this to each other , as if a female sex worker is something other than human . )
By the end of the episode , all of the women of Wysteria Lane made their peace with the new neighbor , although all but one of them thinks Gallagher is straight — Mayfair and Gallagher share a kiss while out on the town .
The narrator hints toward a potential lesbian tryst between the new roommates ( they ’ve U - Hauled already ) as the show comes to a close .
But if that does n’t get your attention , rest assured the pair will be steaming up the small screen .
“ This is the first time on Wisteria Lane that you ’ll see two women doing more than just kissing , ” Delany told E !
“ We ’re taking things to the next level .
I get to do it .
I ’m very honored . ”

For the first two years of my life , I was raised by nuns in a Catholic orphanage .
Back then , I was named baby Patrick , the son of an Irish woman who was a devout Roman Catholic .
As for the father , it was ' name unknown ' , according to the birth certificate .
I do n't remember my birth mother , even though apparently she was a regular visitor to the home , until she , or possibly the nuns , decided that there was no prospect of her ever bringing me up as her own .
It was , after all , the early Sixties - a harsh unforgiving climate for single mothers .
Decades on , I wonder sometimes if she would have coped as well as my adoptive parents did when , at the age of 22 , I told them I was gay .
Though they , too , were Catholic , they took the news in their stride and loved me just as much as before , and as much as their three birth children .
You might assume then , as an out , proud , gay man that I would be appalled by the Pope 's extraordinary public attack on Harriet Harman 's Equality Bill .
The Pope has warned that the Bill poses a threat to freedom of religious expression and faith because it means that the Church could be forced to employ openly gay members of staff or face being sued , and that Catholic adoption agencies will henceforth be required to give children to same - sex couples in contravention of their beliefs .
But , actually , far from being angered by his intervention , I agree with much of what he said .
More than that , I find myself wishing that our tonguetied Anglican bishops had the courage to speak out more often on the great moral issues of the day .
Quite simply , I believe that the Government 's decision to force the Church to abide by its equality legislation could hurt some of the most vulnerable members of our society - those whom I thought ministers had a duty to protect .
Indeed , children such as me , raised for two years in a Catholic orphanage , could be the real losers of Harman 's obsessive drive to force the Church to embrace her doctrine of legalised social engineering .
In any given year , the 12 Catholic adoption agencies in England used to place a minimum of 200 children with adoptive parents .
They have , by tradition , also handled a third of the boys and girls who have been judged ' most difficult to place ' .
Some of those children have to wait years before they are found a home .
Point of view : Despite being gay , Andrew Pierce agrees with much of what the Pope said about Harriet Harman 's Equality Bill
But the effect of the legislation from Harman is that those Catholic adoption agencies now have to consider placing children with gay couples , even though it goes against their spiritual teachings , or inevitably close down .
Some of the Catholic adoption agencies have reluctantly complied with the new legislation .
But if others decide they cannot sacrifice their principles and bend to Harman 's diktats , decades of experience will be lost and many vulnerable children will lose the care and dedication that has served them so well in the past .
What madness !
In my own case , the nuns of Nazareth House in Cheltenham looked after me until I was safely placed into the protective arms of adoptive parents who loved me from the moment they first took me to their home .
It is shocking even to contemplate taking that privilege away from hundreds of other children just to satisfy one politician 's dogma .
That 's not to say that I agree with all of the Pope 's edicts .
In particular , I find the Church teaching that homosexuality is ' intrinsically disordered ' deeply offensive .
But imposing legislation is not the answer to countering such outdated views .
First , it needs to be asked loud and clear : why would any gay people hoping to adopt children go to a Catholic agency ?
They do n't need to .
Rightly or wrongly , these days gay couples invariably have first place in the queue for an adopted child from state - run agencies because politically correct local authorities are attempting to make up for the years when gays were barred by the law from being adoptive parents .
Nor do the majority of gay men and women feel discriminated against by the Church , whether as employees or as members of the congregation .
I know gay teachers who work harmoniously in Roman Catholic schools , just as I know many gay men and women who regularly go to Mass and take the Holy Sacrament .
And if we 're being honest , it 's hardly a secret that for decades , if not centuries , many clergy , both Catholic and Anglican , have been privately gay .
Attack : The Pope has said that Ms Harman 's Bill poses a threat to freedom of religious expression
So why do we need the state to dictate the Church 's employment policies ?
The political fall - out could be far more far - reaching than Ms Harman imagines .
For the Pope has not just delivered a wake - up call to Labour MPs mindful of the potential five million Catholic votes at stake in the coming General Election .
He has also crystallised a growing fear among many gay people that far from helping to promote tolerance , Harriet Harman is in danger of undermining the great strides forward made in equality in recent years by provoking a backlash .
Since 1997 , the law has - rightly , in my view - been changed to make the age of consent for gays the same as that for heterosexual couples .
Gays can enter into legally binding civil partnerships , and they can adopt children .
I still smile when I see grannies in card shops asking for civil partnership cards .
The world has changed beyond recognition for the better for gays in the past decade .
So why do I fear that all that good work now risks being undermined ?
It is precisely because the very intolerance that was once targeted at gays is now being directed at those who have sincerely - held - if , in my view , misguided - objections to gay equality .
My doubts were underlined last year by the case of Pauline Howe .
The 67 - year - old had written a letter to Norwich Council , her local authority , objecting to a planned gay pride march .
Mrs Howe described gays as ' sodomites ' whose ' perverted sexual practices ' were responsible for spreading sexually transmitted diseases .
The response ?
Two police officers visited her at her home to warn her that she had committed a ' hate crime ' .
Really ?
Against whom ?
It 's not as though Mrs Howe had incited an angry mob to take up arms against homosexuals .
Even though I went on a gay pride march last year , I absolutely support Mrs Howe 's right to express her opinions , obnoxious though they were .
Then there was the case of the pensioners Joe and Helen Roberts , devout Christians , who wanted to distribute Christian leaflets alongside the gay rights literature promoted by their council .
They , too , had a knock on the door from the police .
The council thought they ' displayed potentially homophobic attitudes ' .
Sorry , no .
Just an alternative point of view .
What sort of society are we becoming that people are threatened by burly police officers with criminal prosecution for daring to utter outmoded opinions ?
It all began with the right and admirable intentions .
The Government was anxious to make amends for the years when homophobia was officially sanctioned via Section 28 - the piece of legislation which prohibited local authorities from promoting homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle .
But now , in the drive to impose the equality agenda , even if it conflicts with an individual 's religious beliefs , ministers risk fostering the view that they give gays precedence in all matters .
Surely the idea of equality is that we would all be treated as equal - those who support gay rights and those who oppose them .
Moral victories are won by argument , persuasion and example - not legislation .
I 'm afraid Ms Harman is a zealot .
She has called her Bill an 'opportunity not only to build a new economic order , but a new social one as well ' .
So what next ?
Order the Roman Catholic Church to lift its ban on women priests ?
Quotas for women bishops ?
Or perhaps , as she plots her own takeover of the Labour Party leadership , she is even now planning legislation that at least one contender for the next Archbishop of Canterbury will have to wear a skirt .
John Gotti can stop looking over his shoulder , for the time being .
Federal prosecutors decided today that they will not retry the alleged mafia Don on racketeering charges .
If they had pursued prosecution , it would be the fifth time the government went after " Junior . "
" In light of the circumstances , the Government has decided not to proceed with the prosecution against John A. Gotti , " said Preet Bharara , the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York , in a statement .
After his fourth trial ended in a mistrial last month , law - enforcement sources had speculated that the feds would finally quit because the jury pool had been tainted .
" Obviously we 're thrilled , " said Gotti 's defense lawyer Charles Carnesi .
" He wants to savor the moment with his family .
I 'm very pleased , I think they acted appropriately . "
Gotti has been free on $ 2 million bail since a jury deadlocked on Dec. 1 after deliberating for 11 days .
Seth Ginsberg , another one of his lawyers , called it the " right decision . "
" I hope that they stick to it this time and let John and his family be at peace , " Ginsberg added .
Three trials in 2005 and 2006 also had ended in hung juries , after the government presented evidence accusing Gotti of ordering a kidnapping and attempted murder plot against Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa .
In the latest trial , prosecutors for the first time attempted to tie Gotti to multiple murders , in addition to the claims about Sliwa .
The repeated hung juries left some comparing Gotti to his father , the late John " Dapper Don " Gotti .
The elder Gotti was convicted of racketeering in 1991 .
He was sentenced to life in prison and died in prison in 2002 .
Family members claim " Junior " Gotti has been a government target simply because of his last name .
The 45 - year - old mobster , born on Valentine 's Day in Queens , led the Gambino crime family for much of the 1990s while his father was in prison .
Gotti wants his six children to have something he did n't have while he was growing up – a present father .
His dad had already spent nine years behind bars by the time he was 13 .
Just call me Ed
February 5 , 2010 :
We let Eddie go Monday night of last week ( Jan 25th ) .
A vet came by our house and put Eddie to sleep with dignity .
Many of you have gone through the animal loss ordeal so you know the awful feeling .
Our house / my office feels empty now and it is hard to believe that he is gone .
We 'll remember his love of life , people and daily dog walks .
I figure I walked over 8000 miles with him and he kissed and touched the lives of countless thousands along the way .
He was a real charmer .
We 'll also remember that sweet innocent look that belied his sneaky tactics , his graceful trot , his radiating energy and unspoken communication expressed through his eyes .
Eddie ( or Ed as his many friends called him ) was diagnosed with malignant stomach cancer and low - grade liver cancer in early December .
He was given two weeks to two months to live .
Fortunately , we had a good Christmas ; although his energy level was dropping he appeared in good spirits .
After New Years , things got progressively worse .
In the end , he was eating very little and throwing up 3 or 4 times a day .
He was rapidly becoming weak and could n't walk very far .
Still , it was a tough decision to put him down because he was such a strong dog and could still rise to the occasion .
We are relieved that he is gone before the suffering got any worse but we miss him very much .
He made it to his half birthday which was Jan 19th so he lived for 12.5 years .
He was a remarkable , funny dog , loved everyone , lived a good life and always trusted us .

2010 Job Market : Where Will the Jobs Be? " GMA " workplace contributor Tory Johnson on bright spots in the job market .
Jan. 1 , 2010  --
This year was not kind to the U.S. worker .
Layoffs , furloughs , reduced hours and decreased benefits took a toll on our work force .
And while not everything will bounce back quickly in 2010 , experts say a few bright spots exist for those looking for work .
Here are some places to look if you 're in the job market .
Health Care
Market research firm Borrell Associates says health care , which topped the list in 2009 with more than 500,000 job openings , is expected to continue to hold first place next year as well , with job openings expected to exceed 600,000 .
This is a wide - open field : doctors , nurses , medical assistants , pharmacy technicians , home health care aides , electronic medical records specialists and more .
Career One Stops , a Web site sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor , connects job seekers with training programs every day to gain new skills for a career in health care .
You can also think about ways to leverage your existing skills to a position in health care , which is what Mary Beth Walker did when she was laid off from her role in high - tech public relations .
Out of work for nine months , she ultimately turned her attention to health care and landed as a marketing specialist for Overlake Hospital Medical Center in Bellevue , Wash .
Law Enforcement
Security and protection remain priorities at all levels of government .
At the federal level , forecasts call for 50,000 new hires , ranging from airport screeners to intelligence analysts , primarily at the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security .
( The federal government operates a Web site , USA JOBS , which explains the process for applying for federal positions and is the centralized location for federal job openings . )
There 's also above - average growth projected through next year for state and local law enforcement agencies , some of which have received stimulus money for such hiring .
At our first " GMA " job fair in Atlanta , Angela McRae , who had spent 33 years in customer service and finance at the Minneapolis - based Mars candy company , talked to every employer .
She was recruited by the one that told her it wanted her and that she could do it .
It was the police department of Suffolk , Va. McRae is now in academy training and , in April , will be sworn in as a police officer at the age of 60 !
( She does n't like talking about her age because , she says , it makes people think differently about her but I can't help but mention that detail because I 'm so thrilled for her success . )
New Year , New Career : Where Will the Jobs Be in 2010 ?
Sales
Sales openings are expected to grow more than 50 percent from 2009 but they still wo n't reach 2008 levels .
So , as with every category , competition will be steep .
Borrell Associates Inc. of Williamsburg , Va. , a research and consulting firm , said that more than 140,000 sales openings are forecast for 2010 across multiple sectors .
Bill Leversee of San Diego was laid off from his investment banking job when his former employer downsized .
Instead of selling financial products , he got a job with San Francisco - based SunRun Inc. , a leader in residential solar energy , selling solar panels .
He used to wear a suit and tie and now he's in khakis , meeting in people 's homes and climbing roofs to sell the benefits of solar panels .
Not only is it a sales job but it 's a green job too , another area where we 'll see growth in the year ahead .
With the Obama administration 's focus on green jobs , meaning they contribute to achieving environmental quality , we hope to get more clarity on what these jobs are , when they 'll be available and how exactly to apply .
Business Services
From accountants to administrative assistants , Borrell Associates predicts more than 400,000 openings in business services .
This is everything from accountants to managers to administrative assistants and more .
The growth is better than 2009 but not back to pre-recession levels .
Among the openings in demand , according to staffing firm Robert Half International of Menlo Park , Calif. , is credit managers to help businesses manage delinquent payments , manage cash flow and evaluate credit risk .
Astrid Racine in Orlando , Fla. , underwrote real estate bonds for a major bank until her department was dissolved .
Real estate and banking are two hard hit areas in the recession .
Because much of her job involved evaluating the credit worthiness of developers , she took that same skill and applied it in a new direction :
She 's now a credit analyst at a plastic recycler where she analyzes the credit of manufacturers that need her company 's products .

The annual Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) , which has been going on for many years , is a bellwether of where the action is on the right side of the political spectrum – and the news from the latest gathering has both the traditional Buckley - style right and the Obama - ite liberal - left in shock .
The CPAC presidential polls are a conference tradition , and the winner is often hailed as not only the up - and - coming champion of the Republican " hard " right but also a serious presidential contender .
The winner of the previous three CPAC polls , Mitt Romney , was accorded such status early on in part because of his CPAC victories , but this time he was left in the dust by congressman Ron Paul .
Headlines reported Paul ’s win as a " surprise , " but early indications of the Paulian domination of CPAC this year included the ubiquitous presence of Young Americans for Liberty ( YAL ) activists and the rock star reception given to Rep .
Paul himself .
The former – and perhaps future – Republican presidential candidate gave a half - hour peroration that boldly stressed anti-interventionist foreign policy as the key to reining in big government on the home front .
Invoking the shade of Robert A. Taft , and wondering aloud how we ’re going to pay for our empire , Paul traced the roots of our dilemma back to Woodrow Wilson , the quintessential " progressive " of Glenn Beck ’s worst nightmares .
Unlike Beck , however , whose anti-progressive polemics only mention World War I in passing , Paul realizes that the whole kit -n - kaboodle of progressivism – the income tax , the Federal Reserve , and the philosophy of government as an instrument of moral uplift –all culminated in US involvement in the Great War .
As Murray Rothbard pointed out , the war – portrayed by its advocates at The New Republic and among the nation ’s intelligentsia as a crusade for moral and spiritual uplift on a global scale – was the apotheosis of the progressive project .
The term " Wilsonian , " in foreign policy lingo , refers to the view that democracy and human rights can and should be advanced abroad at gunpoint .
We did n’t hear Beck , at this conference , where he was the featured speaker , or during one of his televised tirades , own up to the essentially Wilsonian foreign policy of the Bush administration , which he fulsomely supported .
Beck is the perfect right - wing populist archetype , who , armed with a little knowledge , manages to miss the essential lesson of the Bush years – that an interventionist foreign policy with globalist pretensions is incompatible with the desire for limited government .
Nor does Beck , in his many disquisitions on the evils of progressivism , mention the worst depredations of the " progressive " Wilson administration , which Ron Paul surely did : it warmed the cockles of my libertarian heart to hear , at a CPAC conference , the name of Eugene Victor Debs raised as a martyr to the cause of individual rights , on account of his being jailed for speaking out against World War I. Yes , and it was a Republican , Paul reminded his audience – Warren G. Harding – who finally freed Debs .
Ron truly is the anti-Cheney .
Too many conservatives , averred Paul , take a piecemeal approach to liberty : they do n’t understand that freedom is indivisible , and that you ca n’t have constitutional and strictly limited government while engaging in endless wars .
Beck , in his CPAC speech , likened the Republican party to a substance - abuser : the first thing you ’re supposed to do , he said , is recognize that you have a problem .
Beck would do well to follow his own advice : he should go on television and admit that he and his fellow " movement " conservatives are addicted to war , and warmongering .
Paul ’s CPAC victory is a stunning repudiation of the War Party ’s long - standing dominance of the GOP , and is bound to ramp up the already quite active campaign to smear and destroy him .
Neocon Dorothy Rabinowitz , in the midst of a jeremiad ostensibly aimed at Sarah Palin , points out that the liberals may hate Sarah for all the wrong reasons , but there are perfectly good neoconservative reasons for joining in the media pile - on , beginning with :
" The unsavory echoes of her regular references to ‘ the real America ’ as opposed to those shadowy “ elites , ” now charged with threats to the life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness of all real Americans .
Neither does she seem to have any idea of how that low soapbox oratory – embracing one kind of American as the real kind , those builders in the towns and cities across America – rings in the ear today .
It is not new . "
Neocons hate people who talk about the elites in less than reverent tones , because they think you ’re talking about them – which is often the case .
They hate any sort of populism , whether of the right or the left , because they see in it the seeds of revolution , and , of course , anti-Semitism .
Most of all they hate Ron Paul , because he and his followers embody the Jeffersonian values and culture of the American heartland , the old America of Bob Taft , America First , and a Republican party that was skeptical of overseas adventurism .
They are the " real Americans " Rabinowitz hates and fears , and , this year , they came to CPAC in droves .
A rebellion among conservatives has long been brewing , and the CPAC convention represents the first skirmish in a civil war on the right , a war that is essentially over foreign policy .
The Paul movement is well - organized , activist - oriented , and well - funded : more importantly , it has a well - grounded ideology , one that offers an alternative to the brain - dead neoconservatism of Republican party hacks and third - rate politicians like Rudy Giuliani – whose single delegate to the 2008 Republican convention fairly represents the strength of the Rabinowitz wing of the conservative movement .
As numerically tiny and largely discredited as the neoconservatives are on the right , the whole tone of Rabinowitz ’s disquisition is that of an arbiter , one whose blessings – or curses – are the final word on the subject of Palin , Paul , and , as it turns out , Rand Paul , Ron ’s son , who is running for the US Senate in Kentucky :
" Though it has n’t attracted wide attention , nothing Mrs. Palin has done recently has been worthier of notice than her endorsement of Rand Paul , now running in Kentucky ’s GOP senate primary .
Dr. Paul , an ophthalmologist and radical libertarian , holds views on national security and defense that have much in common with those of the far left .
Not to mention those of the considerable body of conspiracy theorists , antigovernment zealots , 9/11 truthers , and assorted other cadres of the obsessed and deranged who flocked to the presidential candidacy of his father Ron Paul , the congressman from Texas . "
Whatever sort of libertarian Rand Paul is , " radical " is hardly a fair description : here , after all , is someone who disdains the Obama administration ’s determination to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the Christmas Day bomber in civilian courts , and opposes the dismantling of Guantanamo .
Sure , he questions US policy in Afghanistan , Iraq , and elsewhere , pointing out that we do n’t need to be " nation - building " overseas when our own nation is falling to pieces , but such complaints are hardly the exclusive prerogative of libertarians , radical or otherwise .
Rabinowitz & Co. have their work cut out for them if they ’re going to try and convince conservatives that the Paul movement is " leftist . "
Good luck with that one .
The neocon method , however , is simple repetition : if you tell a lie long enough , and persistently enough , maybe , just maybe people will come to accept it .
" Conspiracy theorist , " " zealot , " " deranged , " " truther " – rinse , and repeat .
There is something oddly childish about the taunting polemical style of the neocons : what it boils down to is simple name - calling .
Rather than engage Paul ’s actual views , the idea is to drive him out of the public square by means of pure epithets .
Former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson joins the chorus :
" The left has a political interest in defining the broad backlash against expanded government as identical to the worst elements of the Tea Party movement – birthers and Birchers , militias and nativists , racists and conspiracy theorists , acolytes of Ron Paul , Tom Tancredo and Lyndon LaRouche . "
Ron Paul , avers Gerson , is preying on those " new to political engagement " who find " anger and paranoia intoxicating . "
( After all , there ’s nothing to be angry about : only the " paranoid " get angry . )
They " listen to Ron Paul attacking the Federal Reserve cabal , and suddenly their resentments become ordered into a theory .
Such theories , in politics , can act like a drug , causing addiction , euphoria and psychedelic departures from reality . "
Yes those drug addict - truther - paranoid - extremist - birther - militia types – how dare they so much as open their mouths !
The whole neocon pack of attack dogs is bound to be out in full force by Monday morning , on that you can depend .
Angry , paranoid , and full of hate – that describes Ron ’s critics to a tee .
They are merely projecting these attributes which they possess in full measure onto Ron Paul and his supporters .
The Rabinowitzes and Gersons of this world are angry that people are beginning to question the previously unquestionable : they ’re paranoid that their positions as opinion " leaders " and official arbiters of what ’s kosher and what ’s not are being overturned – and they ’re chock full of hate for anyone who , like Rep .
Paul , challenges their power .
As well they should be .
Because if Ron and the movement he leads is successful , their day is over and done .
" We never set out to have our beers become cult favorites among beer enthusiasts — it 's just something that sort of happened . "
The beers from Russian River Brewing Company in Santa Rosa , California are celebrated and coveted among beer lovers around the country .
His brews frequently appear at the very top of beer lovers ' lists .
From gloriously fresh - tasting IPAs such as Pliny the Elder to fascinating concoctions aged in local wine barrels , Vinnie Cilurzo is a master of great beer .
We 're honored to include him in our interview series .
Name : Vinnie Cilurzo
Location : Santa Rosa , California
Occupation : Brewer and Owner , Russian River Brewing Company
Tell us a little about yourself .
How did you learn to brew ?
I started out homebrewing back in 1988/1989 .
After continuing to homebrew and a trip to Europe , my hobby got out of control and eventually I started a brewery in Temecula , California , called Blind Pig Brewing Company .
I sort of did it opposite of normal — instead of going to work for someone else I found a couple of business partners and dove straight into brewing commercially .
How would you describe Russian River 's beers to someone who has never tasted them ?
For the most part the beers are RRBC are unique , full - flavored , but , very very clean in character .
I really pride myself in making very clean - tasting beers that are typically rich and full - bodied .
When I say " clean " a part of that is that the beers are dry .
Dry beers , that is , beers that finish with a small amount of residual sugar are more digestible , they finish cleaner on your palate , and they are more food - friendly .
Although we are known for our Double IPA Pliny the Elder and our line of barrel - aged beers at our brewpub we have a whole line - up of session beers that are lower in alcohol .
You and your wife own the brewery together .
Has she always been a beer person ?
What is her role in the business ?
Natalie has always been into beer .
She use to work in the wine business like me but when we opened the pub in Santa Rosa in 2004 , she came on full - time to the brewery and neither of us have looked back .
Back when I was homebrewing I would homebrew in the cellar of my folks ' winery in Temecula , California , I still remember she would often bring me dinner and we'd hang out , this was when I was developing an IPA recipe which eventually became the Blind Pig IPA recipe , a beer we still brew today at Russian River Brewing .
Natalie oversees the business side of the brewery and our very busy brewpub in downtown Santa Rosa .
I handle the brewing side of the business and distribution allocations .
What was the first beer you made ?
And which one has been the most exciting to make ?
The first commercial beer I brewed was at Blind Pig Brewing and it was a Double IPA — this was in 1994 .
As for the most exciting beer , it 's hard to say , along the way we 've done so many innovative things such as 100 % " wet " hop beers where we used all freshly picked hops from our hopyard , several different barrel - aged beers , a collaboration with an Italian brewer friend where we brewed with pepper , honey , roses , and violets , as well as some super hoppy IPAs .
If you had to pin me down to one brew , I 'd say HopTime Harvest Ale .
You often use wine barrels for aging your beers — Temptation in Chardonnay barrels , Supplication in Pinot Noir barrels — are you a wine drinker ?
I am a wine drinker , both Natalie and I are .
I tend to drink Pinot Noir , by far my favorite style of wine .
I do n't think there are any greater Pinot Noirs than what is being made here in Sonoma County and particularly the Russian River and Sonoma Coast appellations .
We just absolutely love these Pinots .
Besides access to local wine barrels , how has being in Sonoma affected your brewery ?
Our brewery has been shaped by Sonoma County because of the support we get from locals .
Your average Sonoma County person is a strong proponent to shop local and buy local products , we are very fortunate because of this .
Your beers have become cult favorites all around the country — did you expect this kind of success ?
Was there any point at which you doubted the venture ?
We never set out to have our beers become " cult favorites " among beer enthusiasts — it 's just something that sort of happened .
If you plan or strive for that , my guess is it wo n't happen because you 'll be trying too hard .
There are always doubts with small businesses .
Even up until the opening of our production brewery two years ago , I had doubts — not in the beers but whether we were making proper expansion decisions .
In the end , it has all worked out but there are always doubts , particularly when you are the owner .
What are you brewing now ?
Right now we 're not brewing many new beers — we 've just been sticking to our main beers .
Over the past year we 've been focusing on the quality of our beers from the production brewery , wanting them to taste even better and trying to get them to taste even closer to the beers we make at our brewpub .
We 've bought some new lab equipment and , most importantly , installed a state - of - the - art bottling line which has not only improved the shelf life of our hoppy beers but made the overall aroma and flavor better .
If you are distributing the brewing business is a very cash - intensive business .
Fans are clamoring for your beers — more Pliny the Younger , more Russian River beers in bottles .
How do you plan to face the demand ?
Will you increase your production ?
Any chance you 'll increase your distribution area ?
Allocations is a big part of my job now .
Natalie and I are very focused on not growing too fast .
Instead we focus on improving the quality of our beer and the brewery 's efficiency .
We are adding an automated corker and wire hooder to our bottling line to cut three days off bottling when we do a sour / barrel aged bottle run and cut our bottling days in half when filling Belgian styles such as Damnation .
We are also going 100 % solar at our production brewery , which will save us a lot of money in the long run , plus it 's right thing to do .
I spend a lot of time allocating for both local distribution and our distributors .
We do the best we can to supply all the markets we sell into .
The bottom line : to not let our brewpub run out of beer — at the end of the day the brewpub is still the foundation of our business .
That said , we hope to add another fermenter to our production brewery this year to help increase the production of Pliny the Elder and but allow us to use some of our current tanks for more Blind Pig IPA , Belgian style beers , and sour beers .
We are all about slow growth and not just growing and growing and growing just for sake of growth or money — that really is not our style .
There will always be a few pissed - off consumers out there who do n't understand why they can't get our beer .
They can't understand why we just do n't keep growing .
But it 's why our beer quality has stayed high , particularly with hoppy beers which do n't sit on a shelf too long at the store .
This keeps the hoppy beers tasting fresh .
How do you get inspired to make new beers ?
Getting away from the brewery so I can think away from the day - to - day issues .
As for making new beers , I usually get inspired when I 'm in Belgium , not necessarily from what I taste but just from being around the great brewing culture Belgium .
Do you have a Top Five list of Belgian beers ?
Hands down my favorite beer in the world is Orval , I love how it starts out fresh and hoppy when it 's young but , over time the Brettanomyces takes over and changes .
Brett adds a more funky edge to the beer .
The sour Lambic beers at Cantillon and Drie Fountain are great .
I still love Duvel and a very hoppy beer called XXX Bitter from De Rank Brewery .
There 's a new upstart brewery called Brewery De La Senne building a new brewery in Brussels right now .
Can you give us suggestions for pairing Russian River beers with food ?
I still think one of my favorite pairings is Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese from Cyprus Grove Creamery with our barrel aged Temptation .
The funkiness from the Brettanomyces yeast in the Temptation goes really well with the rich , earthy flavors of the goat cheese .
What are your hopes for the brewery for 2010 ?
An initial small expansion by purchasing more kegs and serving tanks for our pub as well as a new fermenter .
My hopes with the new fermenter is to fill in the supply gap we have with our current distributor .
I do n't want any new accounts , I just want our current accounts — whether we distribute directly to them or to one of our beer distributors — to be able to have a more steady supply of RRBC beer .
I 'm also hoping to get an R&D 10 or 20 gallon brew system so I can experiment with new brews to eventually make commercially .

As Hurricane Katrina bore down on New Orleans , the mayor issued a last - minute order for everyone to evacuate .
In the clamor to get out of the city , many pet owners left their animals with food and water , fully intending to return in a few days .
People without the means to leave the city on their own were forced onto busses and barred from bringing the furriest family members along .
The result was that tens of thousands of domesticated pets were left in a devastated city .
Those that survived the storm and the floods faced grim odds of surviving the heat without fresh water or enough food to last the weeks or months before their owners were permitted back into the city to rescue them .
MINE follows some of the hundreds of volunteers who mobilized in the hours and days after the storm , entering the city and capturing as many stranded pets as they could find .
These volunteers often provided life - saving medical care to the injured , dehydrated , and hungry animals .
Massive temporary animal shelters sprung up in the suburbs of New Orleans , where the lucky pets who survived waited to be reunited with their owners or adopted out .
It would not be easy or quick , or without ethical quandaries and lawsuits .
MINE tracks the stories of several of the rescued pets , their original owners , and their adopted families , raising questions about what constitutes pet “ ownership ” and how we regard animals as both family members and property .
One of the cruelties of Katrina was how it cast the refugee diaspora to the furthest reaches of the nation .
Many New Orleans residents had no homes to return to , and were barred by police and National Guard troops from reentering their neighborhoods to look for their animals .
Many had no means of reaching the animal shelters , since they had been bussed and flown to Houston , or Chicago , or Los Angeles .
Rescue groups went about trying to find homes for the pets in their care , sometimes erroneously designating them as “ owner surrender ” or “ stray . ”
People around the country opened their homes to Katrina dogs and cats , giving them loving homes and bonding with them .
It was convenient for adoptive families to imagine that the animals had been abandoned by their owners , or that their owners had been neglectful ; some people went so far as to say that Katrina was the best thing that could have happened to those pets .
For some , that may well have been true .
But many displaced pet owners were conducting tireless and frantic online searches for their lost pets , often feeling overwhelming amounts of helplessness , grief , and guilt for having had to leave them behind .
No comprehensive system for reuniting Katrina pets and owners ever existed .
In the fraught cases of the rescued pets and people portrayed in MINE , the original owners ' fight to get their animals back forces us to ask what makes a pet “ ours . ”
Is love enough ?
Update
Filmmaker Geralyn Pezanoski provided an update in August 2009 on how some of the people and pets featured in MINE have been doing since filming ended :
Murphy Brown is still happy and healthy and living with Ron and Ellen in Marin County , California .
They ’ve become friends with Debbie and Mary , the rescuers in St. Louis who worked to locate Murphy Brown for Gloria .
Malvin and Bandit moved into their newly remodeled house .
Sandra still talks to him often and when asked what ’s new , Malvin maintains , “ Nothing much changes around here — except for the weather sometimes . ”
Malvin turned 90 on January 17th of this year .
The last time we heard from Linda in 2008 , she said she needed to move on and focus on taking care of her mother and children .
They ’re still living in Baton Rouge and do n’t have plans to return to New Orleans .
Jessie Pullins was reunited with JJ after almost four years .
Despite the potential stresses of flying and being met by crowds and camera flashes , JJ emerged relatively calm and appeared at ease at Jessie ’s side .
Jessie ’s wife , Lorraine , and their kids are still living in Houston where they ’ll stay until the kids finish school and Lorraine can transfer her job to New Orleans .

No surprise , this strategist just came out and said it .
Democrats , why are you wasting your time trying to work with the other side when they will have NOTHING to do with you or this health insurance bill .
How many times does , " WAKE UP " have to be written .
And those on Medicare / Medicaid do you think the Republicans will have you continue on this program if they could get away with it ?

What is Bundler ?
Bundler is a structure - from - motion ( SfM ) system for unordered image collections ( for instance , images from the Internet ) written in C and C ++.
An earlier version of this SfM system was used in the Photo Tourism project .
For structure - from - motion datasets , please see the BigSFM page .
Bundler takes a set of images , image features , and image matches as input , and produces a 3D reconstruction of camera and ( sparse ) scene geometry as output .
The system reconstructs the scene incrementally , a few images at a time , using a modified version of the Sparse Bundle Adjustment package of Lourakis and Argyros as the underlying optimization engine .
Bundler has been successfully run on many Internet photo collections , as well as more structured collections .
The Bundler source distribution also contains potentially userful implementations of several computer vision algorithms , including :
F-matrix estimation
Calibrated 5 - point relative pose
Triangulation of multiple rays Bundler produces sparse point clouds .
For denser points , Dr. Yasutaka Furukawa has written a beautiful software package called PMVS2 for running dense multi-view stereo .
A typical pipeline is to run Bundler to get camera parameters , use the provided Bundle2PMVS program to convert the results into PMVS2 input , then run PMVS2 .
You might also be interested in Dr. Furukawa 's CMVS view clustering software , which is a helpful preprocess to running PMVS2 .
Lucid Imagination is the latest beneficiary of what I like to call the boil - in - a - bag open - source business model .
This is what happens when a few people spot a popular open - source project and decide to give it a corporate wrapper .
They corner the market on the expertise behind a given software package by hiring the 10 or so main developers .
Then they pick a fancy name , fire up a Web site , buy a few phone lines and stand at the ready , waiting for customers to start calling for support and other help .
This setup has a boil - in - the - bag flavor because the software has already done the hard part : it found a devoted audience .
All the entrepreneurs have to do is try to cash in on that proven popularity through support contracts and some marketing polish .
Red Hat ( support for Linux ) pioneered this business model , and start - ups like Cloudera ( support for Hadoop ) and Acquia ( support for Drupal ) are among the latest crop of bag boilers .
In the case of Lucid , the company hopes to profit from an open - source software package called Lucene .
When paired with some other software ( another open - source package called Solr ) , Lucene turns into the basis of a pretty powerful and fast corporate search system – the kind of thing companies use to trawl through and organize their internal data .
Thanks to the work of the open - source coders and its low - low price tag ( free ) , Lucene gives corporate search products from the likes of Microsoft , Google and Autonomy a real run for their money .
Companies like Netflix , FedEx , Verizon and Nike were Lucene users before Lucid even existed .
And , over the last year , since it was introduced , Lucid has managed to sign up a few of these folks as paying customers for its support services , along with some other big - name brands like Zappos.com and AT&T .
( The company claims a number of customers in the intelligence community as well , and is financed by the C.I.A. ’s venture capital arm , In - Q - Tel . )
“ Lucene is 10 years old , ” said Eric Gries , the chief executive at Lucid Imagination .
“ In the last two or three years , it became really good .
Now , we ’re seeing about 10,000 downloads a day of the software . ”
The interest in corporate search systems has increased steadily as businesses deal with ever greater volumes of data , and companies have used Lucene for a variety of tasks .
MySpace , for example , will perform searches on its user database to try to determine someone ’s age .
“ If there ’s a person who says he is 18 , but all his friends are in the fifth grade , then MySpace can see that , ” Mr. Gries said .
Verizon , meanwhile , uses Lucene to help customers find ringtones on its Web site .
More standard uses of the technology revolve around finding internal e-mail messages , photos and other documents .
The diverse nature of such files makes corporate search a particularly tough task .
It ’s also a very delicate type of technology since companies often rely on corporate search to find documents related to litigation .
There ’s big money to be had in this business .
Autonomy , for example , posted a 44 percent rise in revenue , to $ 517 million , through the first nine months of 2009 .
In 2008 , Microsoft acquired Fast Search and Transfer for $ 1.2 billion , hoping to add a deep search edge to its business software .
And at Google , the company sells a specialized server appliance to businesses .
Lucid thinks it can undercut these big guys in price .
It sells annual support contracts that cost $ 12,000 to up to about $ 50,000 , depending on the level of service .
Since Lucene is open - source , anyone with a pulse and some ambition could set up a rival company to Lucid with similarly priced or cheaper support services .
But like other boil - in - a - baggers , Lucid will focus on its deep bench of Lucene experts as its major edge .
Mr. Gries said the company was making “ in the millions of dollars in revenue ” a year .
Harsh Winter Halts Growth German Budget Deficit Hits 3.3 Percent of GDP
Germany 's budget deficit grew more than expected in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis and reached 3.3 percent of GDP , exceeding the euro zone limit of 3 percent .
The economy may contract again in the first quarter due to the harsh winter , but the falling euro is brightening the outlook for export industries .
So you lost your fantasy game last weekend because Maurice Jones - Drew took a knee to help the Jaguars manage the clock against the Jets rather than scoring a touchdown .
So did he .
Jim McIsaac / Getty Images
Maurice Jones - Drew 's kneel - down on the Jets 1 - yard line in Sunday 's game was smart move -- just not for his fantasy team .
I just spoke to Jones and he said he lost his game by five points and fell to 6 - 4 .
A devoted fantasy player , his unselfish act may cost him a playoff spot in his league .
“ That would have had me at 6 - 4 at the top of my league , ” he said .
“ It might cost me , but I trust that my team will step it up these next couple weeks and get us back into contention . ”
Here ’s an assessment of the fantasy - impact from ESPN.
com ’s fantasy guru , Matthew Berry .
And here ’s what our fantasy folks have to say about the effect of the play in just our leagues :
Approximately 10,000 ESPN.com fantasy owners lost this week because of Maurice Jones - Drew taking a knee rather than scoring .
Since every matchup has a winner and a loser , it 's fair to say that some 20,000 players were affected by the play one way or the other .
I read that to MJD .
“ That ’s awesome , that means that people are going to watch more , watch more Jacksonville games , ” he said .
“ They ’ve got to stay tuned , you never know what we might do . ”
Does he hope to produce an extra score down the road to help offset the loss ?
“ I ’m going to have to , I have to make it up for myself too , ” he said , before joking about help for the team avoiding a blackout of a home game for the first time this season .
“ You should tell those 10,000 that lost that if they come to the games , I will score next time .
Fly down to Jacksonville and come to a game . ”
Four years ago an alien arrived in my living room .
It was grey with big black eyes , scaly feet and feathers .
It spoke English and could bite , hard .
It also said “ I love you ” and would run around the house screaming “ Help , Heeeelp ! ” when it was time for a bath .
This alien is a 21 - year - old African Grey Parrot named Bennie .
She came to our house for a holiday and never left .
Since she arrived , she has become a much - loved member of our family .
I could not imagine life without The Benster , and that ’s good because she could possibly live for another 45 years .
Before Bennie , I was afraid of bi rds , enough to make me hide under the bed covers when a sparrow accidentally flew into our house .
But Bennie has a way of winning hearts and it was n’t long before she won mine , even though I later discovered the cute dance she liked to do for me was actually a mating dance !
( A side note : People wonder why Bennie has a guy ’s name .
The truth is , Bennie spent most of her life as a guy until she was “ sexed ” and found to be female .
Who knows what weird problems this created in her self - identity : she talks in both male and female voices . )
Bennie is amazingly smart .
She does n’t just imitate — she communicates with intent , and with cognitive meaning .
Just ask our dog .
Bennie has appointed herself the boss of the dog .
She tells the dog to “ sit down and shut up ” and “ git ” .
I have walked into our living room to find the dog cowering at the foot of Bennie ’s stand as the bossy bird berates her : “ You bad dog , what are you doing ?
Lie down , you bad dog . ”
Where does she get this from ?
We do n’t talk to our dog like that !
She can call everyone in our family by name , except for the cats .
To Bennie , every cat is called “ Shadow . ”
Once I was driving to work with Bennie in her cage beside me in the passenger seat .
About five miles from home , a cat ran in front of our car and barely escaped .
“ Shadow !
Uh oh ! ” Bennie called .
When Bennie is cold she says “ Brrr ” and when she is happy she congratulates herself by saying , “ Good girl , Goo Goo Ben . ”
We do n’t know why she says Goo Goo , perhaps as an abbreviation for Good .
She loves jokes .
When she trips or drops something , she says , “ Shit ! ” and laughs and laughs .
One of Bennie ’s best moments took place when we were watching Lord of the Rings on video .
As Aragorn leaned in to kiss the elf princess , Bennie piped up , “ I love you .
I love you ” , adding in a flurry of kissing sounds .
She definitely likes love not war .
When voices are raised or guns are firing on TV , Bennie often yells , “ You shut up , you bad . ”
Smarty Pants
African
Grey parrots are widely known to be amongst the most intelligent animal species .
This has been confirmed by scientific tests , most notably by Dr. Irene Pepperberg and the African Grey she worked with for 30 years named Alex .
Dr. Pepperberg and Alex demonstrated that African Greys have the ability “ to associate human words with meanings , and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape , color , number , zero - sense , etc . ”
Sadly ,
Alex died prematurely on September 6 , 2007 at age 31 .
His last words to Dr. Pepperberg were , “ You be good .
I love you . ”
I am reminded of a time two and half years ago when our old Golden Retriever Sandy was dying of cancer .
She was lying on a blanket on the floor and it was clear she had only a few hours left .
Bennie watched quietly for a long time from the perch atop her cage .
Then she climbed down onto the floor , walked over to Sandy and made a sorrowful sound as she bowed her head .
There was no doubt in anyone ’s mind that Bennie knew exactly what she was doing .
She was saying goodbye to her friend .
She did n’t make another sound for about two days after Sandy died .
According to Dr. Pepperberg , African Greys perform many cognitive tasks at the level of dolphins , chimps and toddlers .
“ [ Alex ] possessed more than 100 vocal labels for different objects , actions , colors and could identify certain objects by their particular material , ” according to The Alex Foundation .
“ He could count object sets up to the total number six and was working on seven and eight .
Alex exhibited math skills that were considered advanced in animal intelligence , developing his own “ zero - like ” concept in addition to being able to infer the connection between written numerals , objects sets , and the vocalization of the number .
Alex was learning to read the sounds of various letters and had a concept of phonemes , the sounds that make up words . ”
You can learn more about Alex and Dr. Pepperberg ’s work in the book Alex & Me .
The book gave me more insight into the remarkable minds of African Greys and inspired me to work harder at making life interesting for Ben .
I create games for her and work on teaching colours and numbers .
It saddens me to think of how many parrots are put in cages and ignored , or turfed out to pet stores because owners wonder why their birds are acting “ bad . ”
Bennie the Boss
African Greys need as much love , attention and entertainment as human toddlers .
And when they receive what they need , they are very giving , loving birds with great senses of humour .
They can also get you into trouble .
One night , we had some friends over for dinner .
The wine flowed until well past Bennie ’s 8 p.m. bedtime , which she is religious about unless there is something good on TV .
As our friends lingered over goodbyes near the door , I heard Bennie beginning to rustle around in her blanket - covered cage .
I heard her sigh and click .
Then she began muttering like a grumpy old man .
As one of our friends kept talking , it was finally too much for poor Bennie .
“ Blah , blah , blah , ” Bennie yelled out .
“ Good night . ”
Bennie also likes to yell at the yappy poodles next door .
“ Shut up , ” she ’ll holler in a deep , authorative voice .
“ You shut up . ” I finally had to tell my neighbour that it was my bird , not me , who was yelling at her dogs .
Wherever she goes and whoever she meets , Bennie makes friends .
She has sat in on job interviews at the business I co-own .
She has whistled at cute men ( in fact , that bird has great taste in men , and she has danced the rumba at house parties ) .
I always love it when people come to our house and are n’t aware we have a talking bird .
Suddenly , they will hear this voice calling “ Hello ” from the kitchen .
And if Bennie does n’t get an answer right away , she will then holler , “ Helllloooo ? ”
Sometimes I do feel a bit like Dr. Doolittle .
While Ben can occasionally be irritating ( especially when she beeps like the oven timer for the 40th time ) she is , on the whole , a pretty pleasant being to have around .
As I write this , Bennie is covered up for the night but she ’s still talking .
“ Whatcha doin ’ ? ” she asked in a voice that sounds like Bobby Kennedy .
“ Good night .
I love you .
Goodnight , Goo Goo Ben . ”
And then , just for good measure , she whistles a few bars from “ Old McDonald Had a Farm ” , her current favourite song .
She loves it when I sing , “ Old McDonald had a parrot , ee eye ee eye oh . ”

The number of women in Cornton Vale has increased by 90 % Additional funding to help reduce the number of women in prison is to be handed over by the Scottish government .
Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said each of Scotland 's eight Criminal Justice Authorities ( CJA ) would receive an additional £ 100,000 .
He said the number of women offenders in prison had increased " sharply and disproportionately " in recent years .
A recent report by Holyrood 's Equal Opportunities Committee said too many women were being locked up .
There has been about a 90 % rise in the number of women being sent to Cornton Vale , Scotland 's only female prison , over the past 10 years , compared with a 16 % rise for the male prisoner population .
The Equal Opportunities Committee report , which was published in November , found that 80 % of female inmates have mental health problems , almost all have problems with drug or alcohol addiction and many have children on the outside .
I will be expecting to see positive results - that means more support for women to get their lives back on track
Kenny MacAskill
Justice secretary Mr MacAskill said the extra funding demonstrated how seriously the government viewed the issue of female offenders .
He added : " The number of women offenders in the criminal justice system - especially the number in jail - has risen very sharply and disproportionately over recent years .
" Although women remain a very small proportion of the total prisoner population , the number of women prisoners has almost doubled over the 10 year period to 2007 - 08 - to a daily average of around 420 .
" In general , and as the committee report recognises , the health and other needs of women offenders are more complex and wide - ranging than those of male offenders .
So that is a range of needs that need to be addressed , be it in prison or in the community .
" I will be expecting to see positive results - that means more support for women to get their lives back on track . "
Each individual CJA will be allowed to decide how best to use the additional money .
But it could be used to introduce projects similar to the pilot support service with Barnardos for women from the south west of Scotland released from prison , and the Think Again project aimed at developing skills and confidence for women offenders in the Lothian and Borders .

White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer ripped Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) for blocking legislation that would extend COBRA and Unemployment Insurance benefits .
If the legislation is not passed , 400,000 people will lose their benefits .
Pfeiffer wrote , “ There ’s nothing wrong with someone taking a principled stand for something they believe in , but Senator Bunning voted to extend these same benefits in 2008 . ”
Pheiffer pointed out that after the healthcare summit , Republicans are returning to their obstructionist ways , “ But just when we thought we were seeing progress , we have been confronted with a disappointing return to tactics that could be harmful to the American people , with Senator Bunning ( R - KY ) blocking the extension of several critical priorities for middle - class families .
If Senator Bunning gets his way , hundreds of thousands of people could be ineligible for COBRA tax credits for health coverage created by the Recovery Act ; 400,000 individuals who cannot find work will lose their unemployment insurance ; thousands of small businesses will lose access to credit ; transportation projects and public safety programs across the country would be halted ; critical transportation safety personnel will be furloughed at a time of increased concern about the safety of our roads and highways ; and 600,000 doctors across the country who care for our seniors and veterans could be subject to a 20 % pay cut , including 8,105 in Senator Bunning ’s home state of Kentucky . ”
He discussed the hypocrisy of Bunning ’s 2010 position , “ There ’s nothing wrong with someone taking a principled stand for something they believe in , but Senator Bunning voted to extend these same benefits in 2008 .
Over the past decade , unemployment insurance extensions have been passed as emergency measures under Republican and Democratic Congresses alike .
So what we ’re seeing right now is politics at its worst .
It ’s a perfect example of why so many Americans are fed up with Washington . ”

The Communications Director called on Republicans to end their games , “ We need to think about how our actions will impact the American people , because they sent us here to work for them .
We need to put an end to the gamesmanship , and do whatever is in our power to put Americans back to work .
They expect and deserve nothing less of us . ”
The Republicans strategy is simple .
They are going to block anything that might help the American people right now , because they have to keep the electorate ’s anger level high in order to have a chance for victory in the November elections .
Republicans like Bunning are willing to hurt millions of Americans if they think that Obama and the Democrats will be assigned the blame for voters ’ pain .
Bunning , along with his fellow Republicans who also opposed the jobs bill , are making a huge mistake when they start opposing measures to help the people who have been most impacted by this recession .
Republicans are handing the Obama administration the club to beat them over the head with .
As Republicans continue to move too far to the right , they are opening up the door for Obama and the Democrats to retake the middle .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
The other day I complained about an article by Brookings economist Ted Gayer .
So did Brad DeLong , Paul Krugman , Ryan Avent , and Ezra Klein .
As I am a nobody writing on an obscure website , I was roundly ignored by all parties , but Gayer has responded to the others .
His response only reinforces the impression that he sees the world entirely in terms of platitudes from Economics 101 .
Gayer ’s basic shtick in his response is to set up a dichotomy : either people and businesses behave rationally or they do n’t ; either “ firms are better at identifying profit - making abatements ” or “ regulators are better at identifying profit - making abatements ” ; either people do what economists predict or we might as well abandon capitalism .
There are , after all , no gray areas in matters of faith .
When DeLong points out that McKinsey gets paid lots of money to identify profit - making abatements for businesses ( which , by definition , had n’t identified the profit - making abatements prior to hiring McKinsey ) , Gayer responds that it is n’t “ evidence against the profit - maximizing assumption ” because … the companies paid McKinsey to help them maximize profits .
Those who have n’t hired McKinsey presumably know , in advance of hiring McKinsey , that there are no profit - making abatements available to them .
Efficiency consulting , like all resources , is optimally distributed in this best of all possible worlds !
It ’s handy : if your definition “ what businesses do ” is “ profit - maximizing , ” and your definition of “ profit - maximizing ” is “ what businesses do , ” then yes , it ’s hard to find counter - evidence .
Businesses do in fact do what they do , and not something else .
Even better : Responding to Avent ’s point about the housing bubble , Gayer warns against “ abandoning economic principles ” just because people mechanically applying those principles have been spectacularly wrong in the recent past at the cost of widespread suffering .
Let ’s not be hasty !
What Gayer ’s really concerned with , however , is nestled in this self - referential argument :
If we accept that sometimes people and businesses do n’t rationally maximize profit , then we must abandon the dogma that “ market mechanisms ” are always and everywhere more efficient than “ prescriptive command - and - control regulations . ”
But we ca n’t abandon it ; we know it ’s true , because people and businesses always maximize profit .
The assumption justifies the dogma , the dogma justifies the assumption , and around we go .
There are two responses to this closed loop of an argument :
1. Command - and - control regulations are sometimes more effective .
In a perfect market peopled by Vulcans , market mechanisms … well , still would n’t be sufficient to capture public goods , but would be the best tool for most purposes .
But as much as it may break Gayer ’s heart , we do not live in perfect markets peopled by Vulcans .
We live in flawed , distorted markets peopled by human beings .
Sometimes to achieve our collective goals , we ca n’t rely on market mechanisms alone .
2 . The division between market mechanisms and command - and - control regulations is itself a false dichotomy .
The government , alone or in partnership with the private sector , can help reduce the transaction and administrative costs of efficiency investments by spreading information , properly aligning incentives , scaling up fledgling markets , reducing the cost of efficiency technology , etc. , etc .
There are a panoply of means to this end : R&D , direct investment , tax incentives , performance standards , education / communication programs , innovative financing mechanisms , government procurement policies , removal of perverse regulations , and on and on .
There are more policies in heaven and earth , Gayer , than are dreamt of in your economics .
The thing is , when you ’re living in the world of perfect markets and rational actors — the world of “ basic principles of economics , ” where human life behaves like the ideal gas of physics lore — intervention in the market is a net cost by definition .
( That this neatly dovetails with conservative ideology and the interests of powerful industries is , um , worth noting . )
You can point out ways that human life is n’t like an ideal gas , but some economists are religious believers : if facts contradict faith , it is facts that must give way .
Abstract
Objective
To review the evidence for the presence of prenatal and perinatal factors that affect the risk of autism and autism spectrum disorders .
Data Sources
Relevant articles were identified by searching MEDLINE , screening reference lists of original studies , and searching major journals likely to publish epidemiological studies on the topic .
Study Selection
For inclusion in this review , studies required ( 1 ) a well - defined sample of cases drawn from population - based registers or cohorts ; ( 2 ) standardized , prospectively collected obstetric information from birth records or registers ; ( 3 ) comparison subjects drawn from the general population with information on obstetric complications collected from the same source ; and ( 4 ) a standardized format for presentation of data , allowing for comparisons among studies .
Main Exposures Parental characteristics and obstetric complications .
Main Outcome Measures Rates of autism and autism spectrum disorders .
Results Seven epidemiological studies were identified that fulfilled inclusion criteria .
The parental characteristics associated with an increased risk of autism and autism spectrum disorders included advanced maternal age , advanced paternal age , and maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America .
The obstetric conditions that emerged as significant fell into 2 categories : ( 1 ) birth weight and duration of gestation and ( 2 ) intrapartum hypoxia .
Conclusions Evidence to suggest that parental age and obstetric conditions are associated with an increased risk of autism and autism spectrum disorders is accumulating .
Although not proven as independent risk factors for autism , these variables should be examined in future studies that use large , population - based birth cohorts with precise assessments of exposures and potential confounders .
Autism is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and language impairments and stereotyped , repetitive patterns of behavior .
1
Symptoms manifest by the age of 3 years , and affected individuals often require constant care from family members and professionals .
Other disorders that are included in the autism spectrum include atypical autism , Asperger disorder , Rett disorder , childhood disintegrative disorder , and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified .
Autism was previously reported to affect approximately 5 of every 10 000 children , 2 but prevalence rates of both autism and autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) may have increased markedly in the past decade .
3
Two recent population - based studies 4,5 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States reported ASD prevalences of 3.4 and 6.7 per 1000 children .
Although this increase may be artifactual to some degree , it may also reflect a true increase in the incidence of ASD and implicates an important role of environmental causes .
Most plausible neurodevelopmental theories of autism focus predominantly on genetic factors .
6,7
However , studies of monozygotic twins6 , 8 indicate that less than 70 % of twin pairs are concordant for autism and approximately 90 % are concordant for a broader spectrum of related cognitive or social abnormalities .
This finding suggests the presence of nonheritable , prenatal , and perinatal risk factors for autism , 9 a possibility supported by studies that have shown an association between autism and obstetric complications , prenatal or intrapartum use of medications , and parental preconception chemical exposures .
10,11
Parental , perinatal , and obstetric conditions have been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders , including Down syndrome , 12 dyslexia,13 mental retardation , 14 and schizophrenia,15 as well as with developmental difficulties , such as speech and language problems , 16,17 internalizing problems , attention problems , social problems , 18 - 20 and hyperactivity .
21,22 Despite significant research into the potential role of pregnancy and birth complications in the origin of autism , the causal nature of these associations is still disputed .
11 This dispute may be due to several current methodological limitations of studies that have examined associations between parental characteristics and obstetric conditions and risk of autism .
First , many early studies 23 - 25 that examined perinatal risk factors in autism had small sample sizes and consequently lacked the statistical power to detect meaningful differences .
Second , most studies used clinical rather than epidemiological samples , and such designs are especially prone to selection bias and ascertainment bias .
Third , different perinatal conditions may have different roles in the cause of autism .
However , many studies use aggregated scores of perinatal and obstetric conditions , such as obstetric suboptimality .
Aggregation of conditions might increase the likelihood of nondifferential misclassification of exposure and possibly attenuate the estimate of true associations .
Finally , some investigators relied on crude prenatal exposure data , such as maternal reporting of events that occurred during pregnancy .
Maternal recall is prone to bias , because mothers of children with autism are more likely to recall prenatal and perinatal events than mothers of controls .
This differential recall is likely to bias the true measure of association away from the null hypothesis and lead to spurious positive results .
Even when misclassification of exposure by the parent is not conditioned on whether or not the child has autism , it may still bias the results and attenuate a true association .
We sought to systematically review the evidence for the presence of prenatal and perinatal factors that affect the risk of autism and ASDs .
We have chosen to focus this review on studies that used large , population - based epidemiological samples to explore associations between prenatal and perinatal variables and the risk of autism and ASDs .
The focus on such studies has several advantages .
First , these studies have sufficient statistical power to detect differences in rates of autism between those exposed to adverse prenatal and perinatal events and those unexposed .
Second , when subjects are drawn from clinical samples , as compared with the general population , selection bias and lack of information on potential confounders are more likely to occur and threaten the internal validity of the study .
Third , results may be generalized to the underlying population with significantly less constraints .
Finally , such studies typically use standardized measures of exposures and valid and reliable ascertainment of outcome ( autism ) , whereas studies of clinical samples usually rely on data collected nonsystematically .
This review summarizes the findings from all of the epidemiological studies published to date .
We also endeavor to draw evidence - based conclusions , elucidate further the nature and extent of prenatal and perinatal risk in autism , and suggest directions of future research .
Methods
Inclusion criteria
Studies were included in the review if they fulfilled the following a priori defined set of criteria : ( 1 ) inclusion of a well - defined sample of cases drawn from population - based registers or cohorts ; ( 2 ) use of standardized , prospectively collected obstetric information from birth records or registers ; ( 3 ) inclusion of comparison subjects drawn from the general population with information on obstetric complications collected from the same source ; and ( 4 ) use of a standardized format for presentation of data on individual obstetric complications , allowing for comparisons between studies .
Search of studies
The search strategies used were ( 1 ) a computerized MEDLINE search for English - language biomedical articles that examined prenatal and perinatal conditions in autism and ASDs ( the following keywords were used : autism , risk , prenatal , perinatal , obstetric , and familial ) ; ( 2 ) screening of reference lists of original articles ; and ( 3 ) a manual search of major journals likely to publish epidemiological studies on the topic , including the New England Journal of Medicine , JAMA , Lancet , BMJ , American Journal of Epidemiology , Epidemiology , Archives of General Psychiatry , American Journal of Psychiatry , and British Journal of Psychiatry .
Results
Literature search
We identified 7 articles that reported results from epidemiological studies that fulfilled all 4 inclusion criteria .
The characteristics of the 7 studies and a summary of their main findings are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 .
Four of the 7 were population - based cohort studies , 26 - 29 and 3 used a case - control study design .30 - 32 Five different geographic locations were represented , including Denmark , 26,28,32 California , 27 Sweden,30 Western Australia,31 and Israel .29
The 3 studies from Denmark 26,28,32 have partially overlapping samples , but since they have slightly different methods and examined diverse and not always overlapping risk factors , we review the results of all 3 studies .
The study by Eaton et al26 includes a secondary analysis of a larger cohort , but the authors restricted the analysis to a smaller set of variables than used in the main analysis .
All studies included affected cases with either Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) 27,31 or International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) 26,28-30,32 diagnoses of autism , although 4 used a combined sample of autism and ASDs.27-29,31
Two of these 4 studies analyzed autism and ASDs separately .
26,31
Summary of findings
Crude estimates and adjusted estimates that take into account the effect of potential confounders are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 .
In this review , we focus on factors found by at least 2 studies and associated with at least a 50 % increase in the risk of autism ( ie , a relative risk of 1.5 or higher ) .
Such factors are less likely to be explained by mismeasured or unmeasured confounders .
When applying those criteria , 3 parental characteristics and 2 broadly defined obstetric conditions appear to be associated with an elevated risk of autism and ASDs across the 7 studies .
Parental characteristics
The parental characteristics that emerged as significant predictors of autism and ASDs included advanced paternal age , advanced maternal age , and maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America for children born in Denmark and Sweden .
The effect of advanced paternal age was examined in 4 studies .
Paternal age remained a significant risk factor for autism and ASDs in 3 of the 4 studies after controlling for confounding variables , including maternal age ( range of adjusted relative risk , 1.58 - 5.75 ) .28,29,32
In a recently published study , Reichenberg et al29 demonstrated a greater than 2 - fold increase in the risk of ASDs with each 10 - year increase in paternal age .
Advanced maternal age was one of the most frequently studied risk factors for autism and was associated with risk of autism in 6 of the 7 studies before controlling for potential confounders .
26-29,31,32
Older mothers have an increased risk of obstetric complications possibly due to uterine muscle dysfunction and diminished blood supply with age .33 Maternal age remained an independent risk factor in 3 studies also after adjusting for other variables : the relative risk for mothers 35 years or older was 3.4 in a US cohort , 27 2.3 in a Denmark study , 26 and 1.5 in an Australian study .
31
Only the Australian study , however , took paternal age into account in the analysis .
Maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America was associated with increased risk of autism in 2 studies : 1 from Sweden ( adjusted relative risk , 3.0 ) 30 and 1 from Denmark ( adjusted relative risk , 1.4 ) .28
Obstetric conditions
The obstetric conditions that appeared to increase risk of autism fell into 2 categories : ( 1 ) birth weight and gestational age at birth ( ie , duration of pregnancy ) and ( 2 ) intrapartum hypoxia .
Low birth weight ( LBW ) , defined as birth weight less than 2500 g , was examined in 5 studies , 26,27,30 - 32 but none have conferred LBW to be associated with increased risk of autism .
Data on gestational age were reported in 4 studies .
26,30 -32
Birth at less than 35 weeks was associated with increased risk of autism in 1 study32 ( adjusted relative risk , 2.6 ) .
Being small for gestational age or having LBW or slow growth was associated with a 2 - fold increase in risk in 2 studies ( range of adjusted relative risk , 1.6-2.1 ) .26,30 Birth weight and gestational age were combined in 1 study 26 to reflect the joint effects of these 2 variables and formulated into a separate variable called weight or growth risk .
One of the other studies 32 found only gestational age at birth ( adjusted relative risk , 1.3 ) but not LBW to be associated with autism .
Several obstetric variables may act as surrogates of fetal hypoxia , including low Apgar score , fetal distress , cesarean delivery , threatened abortion , and bleeding during pregnancy .
Measures of hypoxia were examined in 4 of the 7 studies .
Findings from all 4 studies suggested that an Apgar score of less than 7 predicts autism .
26,30 -32
In 3 of the 4 studies , a low Apgar score remained a significant risk factor in the adjusted analyses ( range of adjusted relative risk , 1.7-3.2 ) .26,30,32
In 1 study , several pregnancy complications were associated with an increased risk of autism , including bleeding , cesarean delivery , and congenital malformations .
30
Two of the 7 studies identified cesarean delivery as an independent risk factor for autism ( range of adjusted relative risk , 1.6-1.8 ) .30,31
In addition , a history of abortion26 or threatened abortion31 similarly increased the risk of autism .
Finally , bleeding during pregnancy30 and fetal distress31 emerged as 2 other significant risk factors for autism in separate studies .
Taken together , the studies suggest that hypoxia - related obstetric complications and fetal hypoxia may possibly increase the risk of autism .
Comment
According to our review , 3 parental characteristics and 2 obstetric conditions emerge as potential risk factors for autism : namely , paternal age , maternal age , maternal immigration , growth restriction , and newborn hypoxia .
In analyses that adjusted for confounding variables , these factors usually remained statistically significant .
Several variables were interpreted to reflect hypoxia , however , including low Apgar score , fetal distress , cesarean delivery , maternal hypertension , and bleeding during pregnancy .
In this section , we discuss the potential risk factors identified in this review and attempt to understand their etiological relevance to autism .
Advanced paternal age
Several studies 13,34-39 of clinical samples have reported advanced paternal age in individuals with autism or childhood psychosis .
The results of this review show that 3 of the 4 population - based studies 28,29,32 to examine paternal age reported a significant association with risk of autism and ASDs .
The fourth study31 also found that paternal age was older in fathers of case patients with autism compared with fathers of controls , although this relationship was statistically weaker in the adjusted analysis .
Thus , advancing paternal age is consistently associated with increased risk of autism and ASDs .
Advanced paternal age has been associated with several congenital disorders , including Apert syndrome ,40 craniosynostosis,41 situs inversus , 42 syndactyly , 43 cleft lip and / or palate , 44,45 hydrocephalus , 44 neural tube defects , 46 and Down syndrome .
47
In addition , advanced paternal age has been associated with schizophrenia15 and decreased intellectual capacities in the offspring .
48
The most widely proposed mechanism underlying these congenital anomalies is known as the “ copy error ” hypothesis , first proposed by Penrose .
49
After puberty , spermatocytes divide every 16 days , and by the age of 35 years , approximately 540 cell divisions have occurred .
As a result , de novo genetic mutations that result from replication errors and defective DNA repair mechanisms are believed to propagate in successive clones of spermatocytes .
These mutations accumulate with advancing paternal age and thus help explain how this disorder , which has a large genetic component , can be maintained in the population despite reduced reproduction in affected individuals .
Advanced maternal age
Increased maternal age has also been associated with several developmental disorders , including Down syndrome , 12 dyslexia,13 and mental retardation of unknown cause .
14 Brain damage of the fetus or neonate may also be more likely to occur in older mothers .
50 Early case - control studies 25,34,51 of autism have reported mixed results with respect to a proposed association between advanced maternal age and autism .
Our review indicated that 3 epidemiological studies 26,27,31 found advancing maternal age to be associated with increased risk of autism or ASDs , although results are not consistent across studies .
One of the 3 studies 26 found maternal age to be specifically associated only with Asperger syndrome .
One possible mechanism for the association between advanced maternal age and neurological and psychiatric disorders involves nucleotide repeat instability .
52 Trinucleotide or triplet repeats are 3 nucleotides consecutively repeated within a region of DNA and have been found to undergo a type of genetic mutation , termed a dynamic or expansion mutation .
In this type of mutation , through mechanisms that occur during DNA replication and are only partially understood , the number of triplets in a repeat increases .
53
Unlike repeats of normal length , in which length changes only rarely from one generation to the next , expanded repeats tend to be unstable and will typically become longer over successive generations .
During the past decade , nearly 20 diseases caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion have been identified , as well as other diseases caused by related mutations , including Huntington disease and fragile X syndrome .
More recently , trinucleotide repeats have been associated with the risk of autism .
54,55
Maternal immigration
Two studies 28,30 identified an increased risk of autism in children whose mothers were born outside Europe or North America .
This finding is consistent with previous work by Gillberg and Gillberg56 in a Swedish population - based study to examine autism in immigrants .
This increased risk has been suggested to indicate the presence of an underlying infectious cause because mothers may not receive immunizations in their new country and thereby lack immunity to certain infections during pregnancy that are otherwise uncommon in the country of origin .
56,57 Another possible explanation for this effect is selective migration of people with genetic vulnerability to autism .
This explanation would appear less likely , however , given that immigration requires integration into a new culture and acquisition of a new language , both skills that are presumably lacking in people with ASDs .
However , Gillberg et al57 have suggested that men with social impairments may more easily establish an intimate relationship with someone from another country .
This theory finds indirect support in work by Lauritsen et al , 28 who examined parental countries of birth and found the effect of maternal country of origin to have a greater effect than paternal country of origin .
However , the studies that demonstrated a maternal immigration effect in autism were conducted in Nordic countries .
Sweden and Denmark may receive immigrants from similar countries , and replication in other geographic regions is necessary before these results can be generalized .
Lbw and gestational age
Low birth weight is considered a marker for newborns at high risk for later neurological , psychiatric , and neuropsychological problems because it is a likely indicator of fetal growth problems and has been associated with prenatal risk factors , intrapartum complications , and neonatal disease .
58 Low birth weight is a particularly attractive marker because it is measured routinely and rather accurately and has been associated with a variety of cognitive difficulties and psychiatric outcomes in children , including speech and language problems , 16,17 internalizing problems , attention problems , social problems , 18 - 20 hyperactivity , 21,22 and learning disabilities .
59
There is also a substantial literature base on the relationship between LBW and intelligence .
Most studies 58,60 have demonstrated that , compared with normal - birth - weight children , LBW children have lower mean IQ scores .
Recent studies61 further suggest that birth weight is associated with IQ across the entire birth weight range .
However , our review suggests that LBW is not associated with increased risk of autism .
Low - birth - weight infants represent an etiologically heterogeneous group , and LBW is often an indicator of earlier intrauterine effects .
62 Premature infants are also typically physically small , and therefore the association between birth weight and gestational age is important to consider .
Similar to LBW , gestational age and particularly being small for gestational age have been associated with adverse health outcomes , including developmental delays and later intellectual impairments in childhood and adolescence .63-65
Evidence from case - control studies that used clinical samples of autistic children to explore an association between gestational age and autism is not consistent .
Abnormal gestational age , including prematurity and postmaturity , has been associated with an increased risk of autism in some25,51 but not all 23,34,66 studies .
Among the epidemiological studies within the scope of our review , only 4 examined gestational age as a potential risk factor for autism .
Two studies 30,32 found a significant association between being small for gestational age and autism , and another study 26 found an increased risk of autism in very light or slow - growth infants .
In summary , despite biological plausibility and fairly consistent findings that document a relationship between gestational age and the risk of autism , large population - based epidemiological samples with comprehensive data on potential confounders and plausible mediators are needed for a more conclusive investigation of these factors .
Hypoxic conditions
Several investigators have hypothesized that a set of perinatal conditions that indicate prolonged or acute oxygen deprivation ( hypoxia ) to the fetus may be a major risk factor for neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric disturbances .
67-69 Murray and Harvey70 reported that 3 regions in the brain are especially vulnerable to perinatal insult , including the basal ganglia , the hippocampus , and the lateral ventricles .
Neuroimaging studies71 have shown that the lateral ventricles in particular are larger in patients with autism compared with controls .
Brains of individuals with autism have also been shown to exhibit morphological hippocampal abnormalities .
72 Prenatal and perinatal conditions associated with fetal hypoxia are likely to be heterogeneous in origin73 and may include , in addition to overt fetal distress , conditions such as maternal hypertension , gestational diabetes , cord encircling of the neck , and prolonged labor .
74,75
Some indirect evidence also supports an association between hypoxia and hypoxia - related conditions and autism .
Juul - Dam et al66 found increased frequency of oxygen treatment among newborns who later developed autism and other pervasive developmental disorders , but this association was no longer significant after controlling for multiple comparisons .
Similar results , although not statistically significant , were reported by Gillberg and Gillberg.25
Among the epidemiological studies reviewed in this article , increased frequency of several variables that may reflect hypoxia - related conditions was detected in case patients with autism .
One study30 found significant associations with pregnancy - induced hypertension , bleeding , cesarean delivery , congenital malformations , and daily smoking during pregnancy .
The association with cesarean delivery should be considered with caution because it might be confounded by the indication to perform cesarean delivery , such as a significant obstetric complication .
Other studies identified provoked abortion , 26 threatened abortion , and fetal distress as significant risk factors .
31
However , most of these studies assessed only a few potentially hypoxic conditions .
Before concluding , several limitations of this review are worth noting .
First , our results were based on a limited number of studies ( 7 ) .
Second , diagnostic criteria varied across studies and may now be considered outdated in some ( eg , ICD - 8 and DSM - III ) , although Madsen et al76 in their 2002 study on measles - mumps - rubella vaccination and autism found that a change in classification system from ICD - 8 to ICD - 10 did not have a major influence on the overall results .
Similarly , the risk factors characterized in this review were evident across studies using different classification methods .
Furthermore , case assessments typically did not include gold standard measures such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised77 or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Generic,78 yet most studies report high reliability and validity of case sources .
Third , our conclusions were based only on data collected and reported by the reviewed studies .
Other potentially relevant risk factors may have been overlooked .
Fourth , the generalizability of the identified risk factors is limited by the difficulty of applying conclusions drawn from diverse ethnic populations , especially with a vastly heterogeneous disease such as autism .
Finally , the specificity of the results may be called into question because several other neurodevelopmental diseases , as noted , may likewise be associated with the identified risk factors .

Conclusions
Future studies should continue to explore whether parental characteristics and obstetric conditions are associated with an increased risk of autism and ASDs .
The parental characteristics identified through this review that are likely to have a true association with autism include advancing paternal and , to a lesser extent , advancing maternal age .
Because of a growing body of evidence supporting the presence of abnormal fetal brain development in ASDs , future studies should investigate obstetric conditions such as newborn hypoxia and LBW .
A broader autism phenotype , with characteristic social , language , and behavioral impairments , has been implicated .
Future studies may also seek to assess the impact of prenatal and perinatal risk factors on dimensional outcomes related to the autism phenotype in the general population .
Given the inconsistency present in some results , it is especially important for future studies to use large , population - based birth cohorts and to allow for precise and detailed assessments of exposures and potential confounders .
Perhaps the most important potential confounder to consider is genetic susceptibility to autism .
Genetic susceptibility , a well - known risk factor for autism , may be associated with obstetric suboptimality .
To determine whether prenatal and perinatal exposures are independent risk factors for autism , a measure of genetic susceptibility should be included in future studies .
To date there are no known genes for autism , and therefore a detailed family history should be sought .80 Such a history would allow for the assessment of genetic susceptibility as a confounder and would also help researchers examine the interaction of autism susceptibility genes with nonheritable , potentially preventable prenatal and perinatal risk factors for autism and ASDs .

WTF does “ Change Your Mind In 8 Seconds ” means .
What did i try to say , i really do n’t know .
Conservatives at the moment are evincing stratospheric levels of hubris .
It is a nearly universal belief on the right that President Obama has exploded the deficit , voters have turned against him for this reason , and embraced the Republican vision of more limited government .
All these myths are usefully contained within Peggy Noonan 's column today .
Here 's Noonan on Obama and the deficit :
The announcement subtly underscores the trope " The system is broken and progress through normal channels is impossible , " which is the one Democrats prefer to " Boy did we mess up the past year and make things worse . "
Here 's reality :
Here 's Noonan boasting of the public backlash against spending :
Mixed Metaphors
What ’s worse : declaring war against a social problem or calling for a Marshall Plan to solve it ?
Both are enduring and popular metaphors .
Unfortunately , both lead to bad government decisions .
Public policies shaped by such thinking more often than not result in waste , blind spots , and Manichaean mindsets that limit the search for more effective approaches .
Think of the long - running wars on drugs , terrorism , and cancer .
The results , all too predictably , have been more confusing than the problems .
In fact , no imitation of the Marshall Plan has ever worked , and no war on a big social problem has ever ended in defeat for the enemy ( save , perhaps , cigarettes ) .
But the allure of these spurious comparisons remains as strong as ever .
Without any apparent effect , Marshall Plans have been proposed to help Africa , the Middle East , New Orleans , Iraq , and even Wallonia , Belgium ’s least prosperous region .
Bill Gates wants a Marshall Plan to broaden access to technology , French President Nicolas Sarkozy urges one for his country ’s poor suburbs , and the AFL - CIO thinks the U.S. auto industry deserves its own Marshall Plan .
Advocates of war against big problems are just as plentiful .
We have been asked to go to war against poverty , drunk driving , email spam , and teen pregnancy , just to name a few .
In the United States , liberals denounce the Bush - era “ war on science ” while conservatives each year mobilize against the “ war on Christmas . ”
And of course , there ’s the favorite war of the global chattering class — the war against global warming .
“ This is World War III , ” Barbara Young , then head of Britain ’s Environment Agency , declared in 2007 .
“ This is the biggest challenge to face the globe for many , many years .
We need the sorts of concerted , fast , integrated , and above all huge efforts that went into many actions in times of war . ”
There are many good reasons why declaring war on a social problem or launching a Marshall Plan to help a country or region are such attractive metaphors for politicians .
Wars unite countries and stifle internal dissent .
Wag the Dog is not just the title of a movie in which a war is manufactured to rally support for a government , but also an age - old political tactic .
The war metaphor is also attractive because real wars — those between nation - states as opposed to those against concepts or bad socioeconomic trends — are finite .
University of Notre Dame scholar Daniel Lindley has found that the average length of a war is 308 days when the country that starts it wins and 660 days when initiators lose .
No surprise , then , that the war metaphor keeps getting deployed :
It boosts expectations that in a few years a major scourge — cancer , terrorism , poverty — will be eliminated .
“ War ” also holds the seductive promise of an open checkbook for the politicians who so liberally apply the term ; after all , budgetary constraints tend to disappear during war along with all those pesky rules .
Wars are for heroes , not for accountants who limit the resources needed for victory .
The Marshall Plan metaphor has been similarly irresistible , with its implications of massive funding and unquestioning public support .
But the original Marshall Plan launched by the United States to help Europe after World War II was neither as financially sizable nor as uncontroversial as proponents commonly assume .
( Economist Tyler Cowen estimated U.S. aid , which peaked at around $ 90 billion in today ’s dollars , was no more than 5 percent of the gross national product of the recipient nations . )
Still , the plan has come to epitomize a bold , massive — and successful — governmental mobilization .
Alas , these good metaphors yield bad policies .
The war on drugs , for example , has been more successful in spawning immense bureaucracies and winning big budgets and partisan political fights than in ending drug use .
Decriminalizing marijuana for medical purposes is becoming a popular reform in the United States , and 14 states have already adopted it , with more sure to follow .
But do we know if marijuana does indeed have the medical benefits claimed by reformers ?
No .
As a result of the mindset — and the policies — nurtured by the war on drugs , medical researchers have been blocked from access to marijuana and unable to scientifically test the claims .
Only now , after four painful and futile decades , is the war on drugs losing support .
HULTON -DEUTSCH COLLECTION /CORBIS
The same perils apply to the “ war on terror . ”
As former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski famously noted : “ The damage these three words have done — a classic self - inflicted wound — is infinitely greater than any wild dreams entertained by the fanatical perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks when they were plotting against us in distant Afghan caves .
The phrase itself is meaningless .
It defines neither a geographic context nor our presumed enemies .
Terrorism is not an enemy but a technique of warfare . ”
Indeed , the war on terror was even more spectacularly successful than the war on drugs in securing political , legal , military , and financial blank checks for those waging it .
But that , too , is changing as anti-terrorism efforts are now more carefully scrutinized , checks are written with more strings attached , and alternative approaches are tested .
Recognizing that language is power , U.S. President Barack Obama took a key first step in banning the bad metaphor .
At his insistence , the Pentagon was forced to lose its precious GWOT ( global war on terror ) acronym and the GWOT mentality that went with it .
But as many of his predecessors learned , Obama is finding that wars are hard to exit .
Once a war against poverty , crime , or terrorism is launched , announcing a unilateral truce is usually political suicide .
Instead , presidents get boxed into absolutist policies in which compromise is impossible and victory is the only acceptable outcome .
But no matter the complications , these wars are n’t going away — they ’re just too politically convenient .
It took only a few hours after Haiti ’s terrible Jan. 12 earthquake for pundits to call for a Marshall Plan .
One thing by now is certain , however : Although aid will materialize , a Marshall Plan will not .
As we all know but the metaphor users routinely and conveniently ignore , the Marshall Plan ’s success was driven by the hard - to - replicate conditions in Europe after World War II , with its highly educated populations , well - developed private sector , and relatively efficient public bureaucracies .
So : Beware the metaphor .
All these wars and Marshall Plans are getting the world nowhere .
But their frequent use does have a silver lining :
At least you ’ll know that whenever they are proposed , bad policies will soon follow .
New
Age guru and erstwhile sweat lodge expert James Arthur Ray was arrested and booked on three charges of manslaughter on February 3 , 2010 in Prescott , Arizona .
Bail was set at five million dollars , and as of Monday morning February 8 , Ray was still in the Yavapai County jail .
Since the October 8 incident that resulted in the deaths of three people in a Ray - led “ Warrior Sweat , ” Sheriff ’s deputies have interviewed hundreds of witnesses in the investigation leading to the indictments .
Dozens of participants were treated at area hospitals after the sweat lodge , and by the end of that fatal day Kirby Brown and James Shore were dead .
A third participant , Elizabeth Newman , died a week later at a hospital in Flagstaff , Arizona .
I am not a psychic or an attorney , but my experiences through the years with American Indian religious issues tell me this : even though James Ray will be sitting at the defense table , it will be our religious practices on trial in that courtroom .
And it will be experts who will argue both sides of the case .
Experts .
Experts on terrorism have led the United States into two wars since 9/11 and this past week on Fox News , political “ expert ” and former governor Sarah Palin shared her view that the Obama presidency could shore up sagging poll numbers by invading Iran .
Fertility experts have brought us the “ Octomom , ” and experts on the meaning of the biblical decree to “ go forth and multiply ” have TV viewers goggle - eyed over the nearly score of Duggar children in Arkansas .
In following the Ray story over the past few months , I am amazed at the number of non-Indian sweat lodge experts the media has been able to locate .
Few Indians if any have been interviewed ; and even decidedly liberal MSNBC featured Court TV anchor Ashleigh Banfield as their expert on the sweat lodge .
Banfield ’s expertise , admitted on air , was one sweat experience with her stepbrother or brother - in - law ( she was n’t sure how he was related ) , “ step - brother ” she added , “ that ’s it . ”
And the supposed kin by marriage was , “ uhm ” not an Indian .
Got it .
Indians ca n’t be experts .
But one white lady in one sweat with someone who is somehow related to her is qualified to tell the world really how it is with Indian traditions .
That is kinda , sorta how James Ray set up his spiritual Ponzi scheme , right ?
He knew someone who knew someone who did “ Indian sweats ” and presto and voilà , Ray is taking people on spiritual retreats at 10 K a head and then people start dying .
So , experts have to be brought in to figure out what happened .
No Indians mind you , just experts .
And the truth is , we do n’t want to be experts .
Why ?
Because we know there is no such thing as Indians , redskins , warriors , braves , chiefs , or savages .
Those are sports teams and ah , therein lies the rub .
Ray sold this scheme to the unwary because the real experts on Indian cultures have never been Indians .
Only non-Indians can be the experts .
And experts have repeatedly dubbed what we do as marginal at best — unadulterated savagery at its worst .
In the same way sports teams seek to own the balls - out brutality of the Indian warrior , James Arthur Ray brutalized sixty people in a plastic - covered hut less than the size of the average American living room .
Because , that is how Indians become warriors .
Right now Indians who do practice their tribal ceremonies are walking on edge .
Already in Arizona , state legislator Senator Albert Hale , who happens to be Navajo , has introduced a bill to regulate native - style religious practices on non-Indian lands .
The bill would require the State Department of Health to draft regulations in consultation with American Indian spiritual leaders .
The state legislature of Arizona might be surprised to learn that they already regulate sweat lodges — in the Department of Corrections .
American Indian inmates are required to follow rules which include pictures of sweat lodges built in the Lakota style , not Navajo , which is the tribal affiliation of a good number of inmates in the Arizona prison system ( an amazing fact that is a story for another time ) .
So , even though a non-Indian might be compelled to be put on trial for killing people with his “ ceremony , ” it is Native American religion which will be the defendant in this case .
Consider .
James
Ray ’s defense might be compelled to bring in experts to argue that he did the ceremony the right way — and to insist that occasional and “ unforeseen ” death is one of the by - products of American Indian religious practices .
After all , those folks paid ten thousand dollars for a “ Warrior Retreat , ” did n’t they ?
And native religions are , well , barbaric and cruel .
The prosecution would then be compelled to bring in their “ experts ” to argue that a non-Indian , who allegedly learned to do this ceremony from “ shamans ” all over the world , did the sweat lodge the wrong way .
Ray would be guilty of manslaughter by way of “ malpractice ” even if he is an “ expert ” on the sweat lodge .
We ’ve been there before .
Experts had to be brought in during the legal debates over the use of peyote in the Native American church ; anthropologists , who had spent a few days in the church , were deemed more qualified to judge the ceremony than Indians who grew up in the church .
In this case , we will be asked once again to kneel before experts to ensure that non-Indians who do hybridized and abbreviated versions of our tribal ceremonies do n’t kill anyone .
It is not enough to ask us .
And if MSNBC can’t find one single Indian to say this is wrong , we are in trouble .
Gallup tallied up its responses , took a look at political self - identification , and painted the map .
A " solid " lead is one of 10 points or higher .
A " leaning " lead is between 5 - 10 points .
Anything tighter is " competitive " .

Of course , this does't translate directly to electoral politics , with huge swaths of the country preferring the Democrats in theory , but pulling the levels for Republicans .
That is as much a failure of Democrats to ensure their core constituencies turn out to the polls ( younger and browner voters ) , and also a testament of the GOP to win votes based on divisive social issues , rather than substantive economic ones .
But this flies directly in the face of the notion that this is a " center - right " country .
It 's not .
Now , none of this means that 2009 was a great year for the Democratic Party .
Vis a vis 2008 , Democrats lost ground in all but seven states .
They were +4 in Nebraska ( their biggest gain ) , +2 in Arizona , +2 in South Dakota , +2 in Utah , and +1 in Kansas , California , and Maryland .
They held steady in South Carolina , Idaho , West Virginia , and Tennessee .
Beyond that , they lost ground .
Other than DC ( minus 9 , to a still dominant +66 ) , the biggest loss was Ohio , where Democrats lost eight points to a +10 advantage .
We all know Ohio is n't the kind of place you want to be losing political ground .
Then again , in a year that was supposed to signify the collapse of the Democratic Party , the losses were marginal in most places .
Fact is , Democrats are facing electoral disaster this year simply because of a demoralized base uninterested in turning out to vote .
The nation 's natural inclination is in support of Democratic policies .
If Democrats actually implemented one or two of them while in position of dominant power , we might actually start bringing many of those wayward voters home and into the polls .
After Tuesday night ’s City Council meeting , Oakland is one step closer to approving stricter gun control laws .
The Council unanimously approved a measure proposed by Larry Reid , who represents East Oakland .
It includes three proposed changes : Require the reporting of lost or stolen firearms to the Oakland Police Department , requiring a thumbprint for all ammunition purchases , and enforcing strict permit requirements for the sale of firearms and ammunition in Oakland .
The City Council is expected to consider the proposal for a final vote on Feb. 16 .
That idea to restrict the sale of firearms in Oakland has riled some people , because , as The San Francisco Chronicle reported , Oakland does not have any firearms dealers who sell to the public .
On its Web site , Calguns , the gun-rights group , said that the ordinance was “ an extensive , draconian regulation of firearms , firearm components , and ammunition vendors , which will basically make it impossible to have a gun store in the City of Oakland . ”
This is the second time in two weeks that city officials have asserted a gun-control stance .
On Jan. 19 , the Council authorized the city attorney , John Russo , to sign a friend - of - the - court brief in the case of McDonald vs. Chicago , which is to begin oral arguments at the Supreme Court this March .
McDonald would decide if state and local gun control laws are subject to the Second Amendment ( the Court ’s landmark gun control decision , District of Columbia v. Heller , applied only to Washington ) .
Oakland joins other jurisdictions , like Richmond , Sacramento and Alameda County , in asserting that the Second Amendment does not apply to state and municipal governments .
On Tuesday , I spoke to Mr. Russo and Reygan Harmon , a legislative analyst for Mr. Reid , about the status of gun-control laws in Oakland .
Their comments have been condensed and edited .
Q .
How did these proposals come about ?
What was the strategy ?
A .
Ms. Harmon : The Legal Community Against Violence approached the City of Oakland almost two years ago , when they did an audit of our municipal code .
They gave us suggestions on enhancing local gun-control laws .
A lot of the laws that are on the books prior to these proposed changes are no longer applicable because California state laws have changed .
This is cleaning up the municipal code , because we have n’t really looked at gun control laws in ten years .
A .
Mr. Russo :
The national landscape is in flux .
Our strategy is to try to find ways to protect ourselves .
That ’s really what it ’s about .
The reality is that we ’re trying to fashion solutions in the real world , as opposed to these people who want to have a very academic discussion about the scope of the Second Amendment .
Q .
Why include a proposal that regulates firearms dealers , when there currently are no licensed dealers in Oakland that sell to the public ?
A .
Mr. Russo : Council member Reid has one of the more challenged districts in the city .
I think he wants to be sure that nobody gets any ideas of opening something .
And if they did , they could regulate it under this law .
Q .
What impact can one city ’s gun control laws have ?
A .
Mr. Russo :
The reality is that this is something that ’s better handled federally or at the state level .
No question about that .
The irony is that ’s the argument that gets made by largely pointy - headed , theoretical pro-gun people .
But at the same time , they are vehemently opposed to federal regulation .
Still , if a couple people end up not getting killed , I ’m not going to apologize .
I ’m not going to try to take away efforts that will only be incrementally successful if they are life saving efforts .
Ms. Harmon : I think one city can do the best they can , and that ’s what we ’re trying to do .
We ’re working with neighboring cities like Richmond , San Francisco and San Mateo so we have similar legislation to make it more difficult for people to go city to city .
All we can do , or all San Francisco or Richmond can do , is tighten up the laws in their cities .
The researchers at the University of Antwerp 's Vision Lab caused quite a stir last year when they built a supercomputer with four high - end NVIDIA graphics cards , but it looks like they 've truly stepped up their game for their followup : a supercomputer that packs no less than thirteen GPUs .
That , as you might have guessed , presented a few new challenges , but after wrangling some flexible PCI cables into a specially - made case and loading up a custom BIOS courtesy of ASUS , they were apparently able to get six dual - GPU NVIDIA GTX295 cards and one single - GPU GTX275 card up and running with only a few hiccups .
As before , the big advantage with this approach is that you get an enormous amount of computing power for a relatively small cost -- twelve teraflops for less than € 6,000 , to be specific .

The Principality of Sealand is a unique little micronation with a colorful history .
Located six miles off the eastern shores of Britain , it is one of four Maunsell Naval Sea Forts deployed by Britain during World War 2 .
It was originally called Roughs Tower , and was was used to monitor and report German minelaying in the waters off England .
During the war , it was home to 150- 300 personnel , radar equipment , two 6 - inch guns , and two 40 mm anti-aircraft autocannons .
But after being abandoned by the Royal Navy in 1956 , this artificial island on the high seas has been the site of a pirate radio landing pad , a takeover , a controversial declaration of independence , a coup , and it ’s own miniature war .
The structure Sealand is built upon is technically a very large sunken ship , due to the way it was deployed .
It was built in 1942 on a pontoon barge at Red Lion Wharf as a superstructure of two hollow concrete towers topped with a deck , upon which other structures could be added .
The twin towers were divided into seven floors each , which provided dining and sleeping accommodations , and storage areas for generators and munitions .
When it was completed , three tugboats towed it out of to the Rough Sands sandbar six miles off the coast , where it ’s pontoon base was deliberately flooded to allow the structure to settle onto the sea floor .
Once Roughs
Tower ’s wartime duties were done , and the Royal Navy had cleaned it out , it sat unoccupied for a number of years .
Its first new tenants appeared sometime in 1967 , when a group of pirate radio broadcasters ⁠— operating out of nearby anchored ships⁠ — wanted a place to land their resupply helicopters .
But in September of that year , a competing pirate broadcaster named Roy Bates physically evicted Roughs Tower ’s illegal tenants , and became a squatter himself .
Roy Bates had previously operated a low - power station called Radio Essex from another sea barge , but it had been within the 3 - mile area of British legal control , and he had been caught and fined .
So he and his 15 - year - old son Michael gathered up the equipment , hauled it out to the Roughs Tower , and after a prolonged fight , took over control .
But the tower never did become home to pirate radio , as English laws changed soon thereafter to make seaborne pirate transmissions illegal even outside of the 3 - mile radius .
Nonetheless , Roy Bates maintained his control of Roughs Tower , and declared it the Principality of Sealand ; a sovereign , independent state .
This was after consulting with an attorney who found a loophole allowing Roy to claim the fort due to fact that it was in international waters , and that it was up for grabs due to “ dereliction of sovereignty . ”
Since it was outside of England ’s legally controlled area there was nothing the Royal Navy could do about this , but they did demolish another fort that stood beyond the 3 - mile boundary , to prevent a similar takeover there .
The following year , the legitimacy of this self - declared state would be put to the test when Michael Bates fired a warning shot at a British Trinity House vessel which approached the tower .
This led to Roy Bates ’ arrest when he next arrived on the mainland .
The case against Roy and Michael Bates was brought to court , where the judge ruled that Sealand was outside of British jurisdiction , therefore no ruling could be made against the Bates boys for their actions .
The authorities decided not to appeal this ruling , as it may have led to an undesirable precedent .
Things were relatively calm for a time after that .
Roy was approached by a few shady groups seeking to use his platform for their own ends , including smugglers , but he turned them all away , insisting that he would do nothing to harm the UK .
Sealand proclaimed the Constitution of the Principality in 1975 , and developed a flag , a national anthem , postage stamps , currency , and passports in the following years .
The national seal was designed to incorporate Sealand ’s national motto of “ E Mare Libertas , ” meaning , “ From the Sea , Freedom . ”
In August of 1978 , about ten years after independence was declared , Roy was approached by a consortium of German and Dutch diamond merchants who wanted him to fly to Austria to entertain a business proposition .
Upon their arrival , he and his wife Joan were met by five men who arranged for a meeting later that day , but the meeting time came and went without any word from the men .
Concerned , Roy and his wife tried to make contact with their son Michael at Sealand , but since there was no phone or radio on the artificial island , they had to call local fishermen and the coast guard .
“ I saw a big helicopter hovering over Sealand , ” one of them reported .
Things were beginning to look very suspicious .
Their worries were confirmed when they finally heard from Michael , many days later .
A helicopter had arrived at Sealand , claiming to have a Telex from Roy .
But upon landing , they took the platform by force with the assistance of the “ Prime Minister ” Roy had appointed , a man named Alexander G. Achenbach .
The invaders locked Michael in a cell for three days without food or water , then put him aboard a Dutch vessel which dropped him off in Holland with no money and no passport .
The Bates family enlisted armed assistance , including a helicopter pilot who had done some work on James Bond movies , and headed back to Sealand to storm the fortress and take back their country .
When they arrived , Michael slid down the rope onto the deck armed with a shotgun , and fired a shot .
The intruders quickly surrendered , and were held as prisoners of war until their home countries petitioned for their release .
Not much exciting has happened there since the miniature war of ’ 78 , though Roy was approached by a group of Argentineans during the Falklands War in 1982 ; they wanted to buy Sealand and set up camp “ right on Britain ’s doorstep . ”
He sent them away .
Today , Sealand ’s sovereignty and legitimacy are not recognized by any traditional States , however it is perhaps the best - known micronation in the world even though its inhabitable area is only 550 square meters .
It is quietly tolerated by the UK , which still claims ownership and control of the sandbar upon which Sealand sits .
Recently declassified documents show that the UK drafted plans to take the tower by force over 30 years ago , but such plans were not implemented due to the potential for loss of life , and the public relations disaster that would have followed .
Sealand ’s electrical generators are now tasked with powering the servers for HavenCo , a data hosting services company which was started on Sealand in the year 2000 .
The Bates are leasing the country exclusively to HavenCo Limited , which offers “ unparalleled security and independence to users who wish to take advantage of its Internet colocation services . ”
No smoking or drinking are allowed in the Principality , and no one is allowed more than three five - minute showers per week in the interest of conserving freshwater ; much of which is collected from rain .
Its population rarely exceeds five people , and in the sake of security , visitors are unwelcome .
Until 2001 , HavenCo was run by a man named Ryan Lackey who said , “ It ’s been good for us because a lot of people are afraid of the very draconian laws being passed in the US , and they want to get out in advance of those . ”
HavenCo claims it will destroy a customer ’s server if it ’s ever forced to hand over a customer ’s data to the authorities .
Sealand ’s original royalty are no longer residents at Sealand , instead living on the British mainland due to their declining health .
But there may be some big changes in store for the micronation , including the possibility of increasing the size of the island to allow for a hotel / casino resort .
Kindness goes a long way , even when it is just a small act .
Imagine a hostel in which revelers tip - toe silently through the dorms , cups of tea appear beside your bed while you ’re in the shower , and your bill has already been paid when you go to check out .
A figment of my imagination ?
Not necessarily .
Inspired by Danny Wallace ’s book Random Acts of Kindness : 365 Ways to Make the World a Nicer Place ,
here are
1 . Do the washing - up in the hostel , even when it ’s not yours .
2 . Write your top tips for nearby places and post them on hostel notice boards .
3 . When you ’re hosteling with friends , invite solo travelers out for dinner and drinks .
4. Travel with a plug - in mosquito repellent and keep the dorm mossie - free .
Raid makes a good one .
5 . Offer to guard other people ’s stuff at bus stations while they buy their tickets .
6 . Buy a CD from a local busker , copy it onto your iTunes and leave the CD in the hostel .
7 . Pack some biscuits and a magazine from home and give them to a compatriot who has been traveling for ages .
8 . When you ’re heading out for a heavy night , leave your toothbrush and whatever else you need out on your dorm bed so you do n’t have to rifle through you backpack at four in the morning .
Call or Skype your friends on their birthdays .
It ’ll mean all the more that you ’ve remembered to call from the Amazon .
9 . Offer to make the hostel reception staff a cuppa joe .
10 . Call or Skype your friends on their birthdays .
It ’ll mean all the more that you ’ve remembered to call from the Amazon .
11 . If you ’re next to a nervous flier , keep them talking during take off and landing to take their minds off the flight .
Hold their hand if need be .
12 . Rinse the hostel shower after use and clean the plughole .
13 .
Use cloth bags for your stuff rather than plastic ones .
Your dorm mates will love you for not rustling in the morning .
14 . Pack a few pairs of extra ear plugs and offer them to people trying to sleep in noisy dorms .
15 .
When you get on a local bus , pay for the person behind you too .
16 . Buy a bag of dry dog food and feed the strays as you wander around a new city .
17 .
When you leave a country , give your left - over currency to travelers heading in the other direction .
18 . Support new businesses that are n’t in the guidebooks .
19 .
After you take photos of other travelers , email them your pics .
If you take a great shot of a local , consider printing off the photo and taking them a copy .
20 .
Call your mum and tell her where you are .

The tsunami unleashed by a massive 8.8 magnitude quake off Chile has killed at least four people and left 11 others missing on the remote Robinson Crusoe islands .
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet sent two aid ships , two helicopters and a plane to the small archipelago of some 600 inhabitants more than 700 kilometres offshore in the Pacific Ocean .
The casualties were confirmed by Ivan de la Masa , the governor of Valparaiso , the nearest city on the Chilean mainland .
A huge wave measuring 2.34 metres crashed onto the Chilean coastal town of Talcahuano just after the quake struck .
The quake has left at least 214 people dead , though officials warned the toll could rise .
A team of French marine archaeologists working in the archipelago on the wreck of a Spanish galleon could not immediately be reached despite several attempts to contact them .
Their leader Arnaud Cazenave de la Roche spoke by telephone to AFP earlier this week .
The Robinson Crusoe islands get their name from the hero of Daniel Defoe 's novel , whose adventures were based on those of Alexander Selkirk , a Scottish sailor marooned there in real life by his captain in 1704 .

How much time goes into creating a new character for a game ?
A lot .
For every good idea a team will often have to sort through dozens of bad or misguided ones .
But after months of tireless iteration a fully fleshed out character begins to emerge .
BioWare ’s art director Derek Watts walks us through the process of creating one of Mass Effect 2 ’s more original teammates , Thane .
“ A lot of the time we will do the head first and then work on the body .
I chose Thane because he was the toughest character for us to get .
We had a written description of him to start with ; we usually get about a paragraph of text to start , and that 's all we really need .
For us the key words were “ career assassin ” .
The problem was , he was going to be the female love interest .
Now that does n't sound like much if you think about it , but it got us all mixed up a bunch of times , because women were going to have to find this guy attractive .
So we asked all the women in the office what they liked in their aliens , and that kind of got us going off a lot of weird directions in the beginning and made it harder than it should have been .
As far as men go – like with the Asari – you make her blue and give her the perfect body and you ’re good to go .
Women are more sophisticated than that .
This first set of drawings is by [ concept artist Ben Huen ] .
This is his phase 1 .
We had talked to a few different girls around office , and I know Jude Law had come up a couple times .
If you look at the guy on the left , the guy with the back paint on his eyes , he looks slightly like Jude Law .
But we were also looking at some birds of paradise , and you can see some version of Thane were he had decorative feathers ; we were thinking maybe he could 've been very proud of the way he looked . ”
“ This is done by artist Matt Rhodes .
He ’s been around for a while .
He did a lot of the characters from Mass Effect 1 – probably 95 % of them .
So at this stage we were actually talking to [ Mass Effect producer Casey Hudson ] , and we were thinking maybe Thane was like the perfect man .
Maybe he had like this mannequin head , but he had this slight fuzz of hair , almost like a baby – with number one you can see it on his forehead .
We kept messing around with this red mark that we thought might be his key feature .
What we usually do is get feedback from some people at this point , and the women looked at these and went , ‘ I 'm not sure about that guy .
He 's got a giant red mark on his face and he ’s creepy . ’
And we were like , ‘ what he looks cool . ’
So we went back to the drawing board . "
“ We almost started right from scratch again .
We were trying to reference more reptiles and marine life .
Then the women around the office found out about this , and they were like , ‘ you guys get hot blue aliens , and we get a guy with a fish head . ’
They were getting upset already , so we knew he had to be handsome .
He had to have that assassin vibe .
We had to be able to look into his eyes and get that feel from him .
We also looked at Abe Sapien from Hellboy because his character is pretty interesting .
We thought that might be a good reference for us to work towards .
The concept artist had an idea where maybe
Thane could be a shape shifter .
The problem is we would still have had to come up with one form that was his iconic appearance .
If he shape shifts all the time you wo n't be able to recognize what he looks like .
You would n’t really be able to advertise him on posters and whatnot .
If you look at the bottom row , third one over , you see that 's the one where we started to hone in on the final concept . ”
“ Once we got to this stage we were very happy with the way his nose looked .
We liked how his eyes were very big , and the reptilian ridges on his head .
We almost went with more of a snake - like patterning for his skin .
You can see these three metal earrings on the side of his head , we never actually put that in the final model .
We forgot .
I noticed it a while after we finished the model , and I was like ‘ where are those earrings ? ’
But it was too late and we said , ‘ screw it . ’ "
“ The body was n't as exhausting as the head .
This is Matt Rhodes ' attempt .
You see , we still have some of the old heads on there , but Matt was trying to explore what would happen if we had more flesh showing .
That did n't go over well .
We were n't very comfortable with the amount of skin .
We thought he looked like he was from a boy band . ”
“ This is pretty much the phase where we got it .
We decided to cover the body more .
You can actually see the progression .
We thought maybe he ’d have camouflage because he ’s an assassin .
Then we thought maybe he's a bit flashier , and you can see the cape .
The second one from the right – that 's the one we ended up going with .
It ’s got this incredible feeling to it .
We liked the open shirt and the cape .
He just looks like he has this confidence .
All in all , it 's a pretty great costume that shows off his body and his confidence as an assassin . ”
“ We got Matt to try a few color variations to get some more contrast just in case .
Sometimes we ’ll actually hit on the character fairly early and keep concepting just to see if there are more ideas to discover .
At this stage we were very worried about the jacket , and we were playing around with the idea of removing the jacket , but we tried it and it looked terrible .
He looked like a dude in a jumpsuit .
You do n’t know how important that little piece of fabric is on the back .
Without the jacket , it destroyed the character . ”
“ This is pretty well the final concept we did .
We always do a front and back , so the character artist can get the amount of information they need to start building an in - game model .
Overall , we are very happy with Thane .
He took a lot of work , but the great thing was we went to show him to a lot of the women in the office , and they actually really started to feel intrigued by this guy .
The thing that makes them come to life , of course , is the animation , and the writing , but after they did the acting and added that light filtering to his voice I think he turned out to be a great character in the game . ”
T hose hoping that consumer boycotts will derail Alberta 's tar sands are likely to be disappointed .
The abrupt backtracking on Thursday by one of two U.S. firms that had announced plans to avoid high - carbon - content tar sands oil is indicative .
Boycotts are tricky , particularly when necessities like oil are involved .
They can also cause counter - boycotts which is why , it seems , the trendy firm Bed Bath & Beyond switched gears and announced that it would n't ask truckers that deliver its goods to avoid tar - sands fuel .
It appears that the home furnishing supplier was unwilling to risk a consumer backlash in Alberta .
What 's more likely to kneecap the tar sands development is the same force that created it – wildly fluctuating oil prices .
Since Alberta has pinned all of its hopes on the tar sands , and since Canada seems to be pinning all of its hopes on Alberta , this would have serious repercussions here .
In environmental terms , the helter - skelter tar sands development has been disastrous .
Even Albertans , most notably former Conservative premier Peter Lougheed , have complained .
Huge swaths of landscape have been destroyed ; the province 's scarce water resources have been commandeered ; perhaps most bizarrely of all , vast quantities of non-renewable natural gas must be consumed to produce this equally non-renewable heavy oil .
All of this has been made possible by sky - high oil prices .
Without such prices , Alberta – whose conventional oil reserves are drying up – might have begun to move away from resource dependence .
But the siren call of easy money was too much to resist .
For Canada , the oil sands have been the counterweight to recession .
Ontario may not sell many cars in the U.S. these days .
But Alberta still sells top - dollar oil .
Moreover , the spillover from oil sands construction has been felt across the country , sheltering jobs and allowing the federal government to smugly boast about its handling of the economy .
Yet as our own history shows , oil prices are a weak reed upon which to lean .
Even last year 's brief price downturn was enough to saddle Alberta 's provincial government with its biggest deficit in history .
That government says prices have recovered and are sure to stay high .
But in its budget this week , it also admitted that its record in such predictions is badly flawed .
Last year , it was off by about 20 per cent .
Today 's high oil scenario is based on the assumption that the Chinese economy will continue to power the world , that the current demand for oil is real rather than speculative and that , over the longer run , cheaper wells wo n't come into production .
Yet none of these assumptions is ironclad .
Economic powerhouses invariably have clay feet ( remember the Japanese miracle , the Irish miracle , the Icelandic miracle ) .
No one is sure how much of the current high petroleum price is fed by real demand and how much is fed by edgy speculators shifting their cash from risky currencies into oil futures .
And no one is sure about geopolitics .
As long as Iraq is a basket case and Iran a pariah , the tar sands are golden .
But what happens when those two countries get their acts together ?
At 251 billion barrels , the combined proven oil reserves of Iran and Iraq far outstrip Canada's .
True , the U.S. government likes Alberta oil .
It 's close ; it 's in a friendly country .
And although ( contrary to the belief of U.S. ambassador David Jacobson )
Alberta 's oil reserves are not privately owned , they do belong to the most free - enterprise government in Canada .

But Americans like cheap oil even better than free - enterprise oil .
And if they can get that from Mexico or Saudi Arabia , they will .
Failed boycotts notwithstanding , Canada 's grotesque tar sands experiment is still on shaky ground .

Nicolas Sarkozy promised € 230 m ( £ 200 m ) in aid for Haiti today as he made the first visit by a French president to what was once his ­nation 's richest colony .
Sarkozy , who was greeted by the Haitian president , René Préval , as a brass band played the Marseillaise , toured a French field hospital and viewed the remains of the capital through the door of a helicopter .
" I want only to say to the Haitian people , ' You are not alone ' , " Sarkozy said on the grounds of Haiti's National Palace , one of many government buildings shattered by the 12 January earthquake .
Many were glad for the aid in a nation that was desperately poor even before the catastrophe that killed more than 200,000 people and caused billions of dollars damage .
" It is a pleasure to welcome the president because we want France to help us , " said Ovulienne Fortis , 38 , sitting in front of a squalid open - air camp where hundreds of earthquake survivors now live .
Some Haitians also see France 's renewed interest in their nation as a counterbalance to the US , which has sent troops there three times in the past 16 years .
But Sarkozy 's visit is also reviving bitter memories of the crippling costs of Haiti 's 1804 independence .
A third of the population was killed in an uprising against exceptionally brutal slavery , an international embargo was imposed to deter slave revolts elsewhere and 90 m pieces of gold were demanded by Paris from the world 's first black republic .
The debt hobbled Haiti for much of its history .
Some people handed out fliers in the streets protesting against Sarkozy 's visit and blaming France for enslaving Haiti .
Sarkozy acknowledged the " wounds of colonisation " during comments at the undamaged French Embassy , and later said , " I know well the story of our countries on the question of debt . "
With an eye on that old grievance , France has already said it was cancelling all of Haiti's € 56 m debt .
The aid package will also include reconstruction money , emergency aid and € 30 m in support for the Haitian government 's budget .
The Haitian prime minister , Jean - Max Bellerive , said the budgetary support was crucial : " It means we are going to use it the way we want , " he told AP .
Sarkozy said Haiti needs a reconstruction plan that bolsters the outlying provinces to help shift people away from Port - au - Prince , the Caribbean 's most densely populated capital .
He said one reason the death toll was so high was that the city was not built to sustain such a large population .
The idea is similar to proposals from Haitian , US and UN officials to move power away from the devastated capital and boost agriculture and tourism .
Haiti has been plagued by natural disasters and poor management even before a magnitude seven earthquake smashed the capital , Port - au - Prince , leaving more than a million homeless .
Haitian politicians this week diplomatically skirted a demand that ousted president Jean - Bertrand Aristide raised in 2004 : French reparations for past damages .
In 1825 , crippled by a US - led international embargo that was enforced by French warships , Haiti agreed to pay France 150 m francs in compensation for the lost " property " – including slaves – of French plantation owners .
By comparison , France sold the US its immensely larger Louisiana Territory in 1803 for just 60 m francs .
The amount for Haiti was later lowered to 90 m gold francs .
Haiti did not finish paying the debilitating debt – which was swollen by massive interest payments to French and American banks – until 1947 .
But Haiti's wealth was already destroyed .
It had been the world 's richest colony , providing half the globe 's sugar and other exports including coffee , cotton , hardwood and indigo that exceeded the value of everything produced in the US in 1788 .
By the early 1780s , half of Haiti 's forests were gone , leading to the devastating erosion and extreme poverty that bedevils the country today .
France 's other former colonies in the region – Guadeloupe , Martinique , St Martin , St Barts and Guiana – all have voted to remain part of France and send legislators to the French parliament .
Just one day after the unveiling of the iPad , Apple 's long - rumored tablet has ruffled feathers and turned heads .
With a familiar interface , Apple 's momentum , iTunes integration , and a price that the even non -geek can easily fall in love with , it has all the makings of a hit .
But deep inside lies something even more revolutionary .
At the heart of the iPad lies a tiny sliver of silicon .
A game changer within a game changer .
That 's Apple 's A4 , a system - on - a- chip ( SoC ) that reportedly combines a low - power CPU , a graphics processing unit ( GPU ) , and other hardware , much of which is still confidential .
What we do know is that it finds an almost ideal balance between battery life and speed , such that the iPad can animate and zip about at a pace that iPhone 3GS users could only dream of .
History behind the “ magic ”
The roots of the A4 begin in 2005 with a then three year old startup called PA Semiconductor .
At the 2005 Fall Processor Forum , PA Semi outlined a vision for a SoC PowerPC architecture , the G5 - derived PWRficient family .
As the name implied , the focus was on designing a high - performance multicore PowerPC chip that was ideal for mobile devices .
That very same year , Apple had to deal with what executive Tim Cook called “ the mother of all thermal challenges ” — putting a G5 processor into a PowerBook .
IBM had never intended for the G5 to operate in a machine as thin as a notebook , leaving Apple with nothing but the old PowerPC G4 chips for the remainder of the PowerBook line .
With PC notebooks outpacing Apple 's own technology , Apple had to look for solutions , and fast .
It was in these dire circumstances that Apple took notice of PA Semi , and the two became close partners in plotting out the future of PowerPC for Mac hardware .
Then came Apple 's fateful WWDC 2005 announcement , that the switch to Intel was now in progress ; future relations between Apple and PA Semi appeared to be severed .
But PA Semi's 150 engineers still delivered on their promises .
The sole member of the PWRficient family was released in February 2007 , first to the company 's closest partners , followed by a wider release later that year .
It boasted a very impressive set of specs , including two 64 - bit PowerPC G5 cores with two DDR2 memory controllers on a single chip .
It ran at 2.0 GHz with an average of 13 watts of power consumption and a peak of 25 watts .
Meanwhile , Intel 's more traditionally - designed Merom Core 2 Duo LV L7700 — the closest competition at the time — could only run at 1.8 GHz with a max of 17 watts .
Early the following year , Apple quietly purchased PA Semi , with many in the tech press speculating that Apple 's intent was to put its newly - acquired talent to work on chips made for future mobile devices , such as iPods and iPhones .
Then came a long period of silence that has lasted until now .
CPU / GPU hybrids today
Now we have the Apple A4 , a brand new design for a SoC produced and owned by Apple , using the same ARM architecture that powers the iPhone .
The A4 runs at 1GHz and supposedly helps the iPad achieve a maximum battery life of 10 hours , thanks to its tight placement of circuitry and small form factor .
In integrating a CPU with a GPU , it follows in the footsteps of other energy - efficient SoC processors , like Nvidia 's Tegra .
Until recently , the CPU and the GPU of a computer were separate pieces of hardware , often found on different boards or positioned far apart on the same motherboard .
Through SoCs and more ambitious designs , attempts have been made to fuse the two components together .
Intel 's Larrabee project tried to tie a GPU so closely to one of its own future desktop / laptop CPUs that a discrete GPU would become not only obsolete , but impossible to add to this design .
Tragedy struck , and Intel missed its benchmarks .
Now Larrabee has been reduced to such a degree that it will never see a wide release .
Intel had a another project up its sleeves , an SoC that wedded the Atom CPU to a GPU for LG - branded smart phones , called Moorestown .
But that project has only just been shown off at CES and is still a ways away from hitting stores .
Nvidia 's Tegra , on the other hand , has seen applications in portable media players , the Google Chrome OS - based netbook , and the Boxee Box .
While all of these products are interesting designs , Nvidia is only a chipset provider .
It can not dictate the exact specifications of any of these devices beyond what 's supplied by its very own Tegra .
New Frontiers
Ahead
With the A4 , Apple still maintains its long - standing relationship with ARM while delivering on performance , with a design that no competitor can use in its own products .
More to the point , the A4 puts a very critical part of Apple 's iPad under its very own control .
And that move is unprecedented .
Going back to the earliest days of the Mac , Apple chose Motorola 's 68 k series of chips to power its
Macs because they offered better performance than Intel 's equivalent technology .
In the early ’90s , the company migrated its Macs to the PowerPC architecture when Motorola could n't deliver a 68 k processor as fast and as energy efficient as Intel 's Pentium series .
Then , when the major vendors behind the PowerPC could n't keep pace with Intel 's Pentium IV and AMD 's Athlon series , Apple switched its Macs once more — this time to Intel 's own Core series .
Today , Macs remain beholden to Intel 's specifications .
If Intel can't keep pace , Apple will have to find yet another vendor for CPUs .
But now , with the iPad 's A4 , Apple has demonstrated a new option :
It has the ability to take existing designs and repurpose them to give its own products better performance than the competition .
It 's extremely unlikely that Apple could leverage ARM architecture for the Mac , as those processors are specifically made for low - power devices , not high - performance workstations or general computing .
However , if it could make headway through patents and cross-license agreements , Apple may someday be able to do this with another architecture , such as the now - standard x86 - 64 .
While this fits in well with Tim Cook 's declaration that Apple believes in controlling the technologies that run its own products , we 're still a long way away from returning to the days when a vendor made every single component of the computer by itself .
Economically , it does n't make sense for one manufacturer to have that kind of overhead .
That 's how prices remain low , and why IBM does n't produce every single component of the PC all by itself .
But it does demonstrate a brighter future ahead for Apple , and many in this industry have been shaken by the possibilities .
While the idea of Apple exerting even more control over its products is a fascinating possibility , there 's also an undercurrent of concern .
An Apple that possesses firm control of every component of its devices has the potential for greatness — but with great power comes great responsibility .
​ A bill to legalize , tax and regulate marijuana like alcohol was reintroduced today in the California Assembly .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) reintroduced the legislation , A.B. 2254 , which would create a regulatory structure similar to that used for alcoholic beverages .
The bill would permit taxed sales to adults , while prohibiting sales to or possession by those under 21 .
Marijuana is California ’s largest cash crop , with an estimated value of $ 14 billion in 2006 , nearly twice the combined value of the state ’s number two and three crops , vegetables and grapes .
​” The fact that California ’s largest cash crop continues to go untaxed and unregulated is astounding , especially in such tough economic times , ” said Aaron Smith , California policy director for the Marijuana Policy Project .
Nashville Predators fans , especially over the last few years , have had to deal with columnists from " traditional " NHL markets that would prefer to see the team relocated to more northerly climes .
That 's understood , and in some measure it 's part of what defines the fan base here - that " us against the world " mentality that bands the fans and the team together .
What gets frustrating , however , is when the hometown rag takes a decidedly anti-Predators angle , which appears to be just about any time there 's off - ice news to report .
That then becomes fodder for a fresh round of criticism from all over North America , particularly in Canada where the vultures are always circling for news of financial trouble for NHL teams .
I 've been a newspaper reader all my life , but Monday morning I 'm calling to cancel my subscription to The Tennessean , and I strongly urge all Nashville Predators fans to do the same .
It simply makes no sense to underwrite a " news " organization which continuously and deliberately publishes half - truths at the Preds ' expense .
There have been a number of objectionable articles run by the paper over the years , but what I read this morning set a new standard for yellow journalism ...
This latest episode started with an online report yesterday about the Metro Sports Authority 's finance committee meeting to discuss the tax lien filed on David Freeman , principal owner of the club .
Since the various owners have to file an annual statement assuring the city that they have sufficient net worth to back their guarantees to the city , it 's natural for Metro to be concerned about how the lien might affect Freeman 's guarantee .
The discussion also took a turn through some of the other financial stories around the team over the last couple years , as board member Rusty Lawrence connected dots with the " Boots " Del Biaggio bankruptcy and the failure of CIT Group to wallow in his own " sense of insecurity . "
Perhaps if he did n't get in the way of the team maximizing business opportunities within the arena , they'd be in a stronger financial position and Rusty would n't be left sucking his thumb , rocking in the corner .
That initial article then concluded with the scary note that the team can trigger an escape clause in the arena lease as early as summer 2010 if average paid attendance dips below 14,000 and the team suffers a cumulative net loss of $ 20 million .
What it lacked , however , is any balance ; the fact that the team made a small profit in 2007 - 8 , and a modest loss last season , making the $ 20 million figure an incredibly unlikely prospect any time soon ( since paid attendance is running close to last year 's , and the payroll has n't changed significantly ) .
Nor did it mention that CIT Group is coming out of bankruptcy with a restructuring plan in place , so the specter of them having to call in the team 's loan has passed .
The Del Biaggio shares were privileged in the sense that he was n't responsible for funding any operating losses by the team , so they do n't miss his presence on a daily basis , either .
Heck , the parties most injured by Del Biaggio were the ones who lent him money ; the banks , Craig Leipold , etc .
If anything , the rest of the Preds ownership group escaped that drama relatively unscathed .
That first article was bad enough , but this morning when I opened up the paper I was stunned to see that instead of fleshing the article out with some balance for the morning edition , they merely piled on the half - truths ever higher , blaring the headline " Are Preds on thin financial ice ? " on the front page of Section B .
This latest regurgitation includes tidbits like " Financial news surrounding the Predators has not been positive in 2009 . "
Really ?
You do n't consider rising attendance and the achievement of the 14,000 mark required for full NHL revenue sharing " positive news " ?
Or the fact that if they did make the playoffs ( which they only missed by 3 points ) , they surely would have made at least another small profit ?
How about the reports from recent Sports Authority meetings , which cite positive Sommet Center revenue figures for March , April , and May ( the latest numbers available ) ?
The revised arena lease was specifically designed to encourage the Predators ownership ( which runs the Sommet Center via Powers Management ) to bring more non-hockey events to the arena , and that appears to be working .
Worse yet , this article cites the nonsensical Forbes report on NHL franchise valuation and financial performance , a report widely criticized by anybody familiar with the circumstances .
It paints a terrifying scenario , however , so The Tennessean ran with it .
The paper declares that there is no positive financial news surrounding the team simply because they choose not to report it .
Nobody claims that the Sports Authority meeting or the Freeman lien are n't newsworthy events , although it boggles the mind to consider what Rusty and the gang thought they would accomplish by such public hand - wringing .
What is utterly lacking from the paper , however , is any sense of perspective , or a report on actual progress made by the Predators over the last few years .
The only news deemed fit to print is negative , apparently .
The Tennessean has proven all too ready to play the stooge when it comes to running down the local hockey team , whether it's at the behest of local deadbeats or foreign parties looking to swipe them out of town .
I , for one , refuse to finance that sort of nonsense any longer .
For more on this , check out The View From 111 , where Mark fleshes out some of the financial issues .
Also , check out previous examples of The Tennessean 's ongoing crusade to denigrate the Predators :
Smearing the owners of the team while ignoring the fact that during the franchise sale of 2007 they were manipulated by Jim Balsillie 's minions into stirring up trouble between the city and the team .
Proclaiming news of a supposed scandal involving ticket taxes before checking in with all the parties involved ; it turned out to be nothing more than a clerical error of dropping some language from the lease during negotiations , and everyone agreed that the Preds were paying the appropriate sums all along .
Skewing a minor story about the owners answering a capital call to cover the operating loss from last season by proclaiming that it " underscores the fragility of professional hockey operating in smaller and Southern markets . "
Any positive news about ticket sales was buried at the very end of the piece .

If you have ever used a public or open tracker , you know that reliability often comes with a half - hearted smile - trackers can go offline and return again , often without explanation or warning .
To help keep track of the status of public trackers , there 's now Trackon , the BitTorrent Tracker Tracker .
Public torrent have their critics , who mostly comment that they ’re slow , unverified or unreliable .
Only the latter is down to the tracker itself – the others are down to peers and sites .
Often public or open trackers are heavily loaded and operated on a shoestring budget , either as an ancillary project or out of someone ’s pocket .
This can leave them prone to unexpected downtime , requiring DHT or additional trackers to be added to torrents in order to find peers .
Additionally , the sudden announcement by The Pirate Bay to kill their tracker has left people scrambling for trackers as an alternative to DHT .
Previously , the only way to check if such a tracker was down was to ask on a forum , IRC channel or news sites like TorrentFreak , hoping that someone knows the answer .
Now , though , there is Trackon , a site that hopes to provide answers to these questions in a clear , concise and simple manner .
Trackon uses the Google AppEngine , just like its sister project Atrack .
This means that initial costs are low and reliability of the site should be good – exactly what is needed when it ’s reliability of sites being measured .
The site currently monitors 46 public trackers , including favorites such as OpenBittorrent , and DenisStalker .
Even better it a offers a recent history of status checks and also shows if trackers support SSL , which is a boon to those looking for secure communications .
Uriel , the genius behind Trackon ( and also Atrack ) told TorrentFreak that his motivation was finding a way to make the BitTorrent infrastructure more decentralized and reliable , without actually requiring any changes to the protocol or clients .
“ My conclusion was that a really easy to deploy tracker would make it possible for anyone to set - up and run their own trackers , either private or public .
Combining that with Google ’s AppEngine was just logical .
Trackon came from there , ” he explained .
Trackon is still in development and is having more features added as time goes on .
Meanwhile , the number of public trackers out there is surprising , exceeding Uriel ’s own expectations , “ I thought at first there would only be about a dozen trackers , but it ’s over fifty now , ” he told us .
If nothing else , Trackon proves that the hydra is alive , and spawning trackers .
Update :
The original Trackon project has shut down , but there is a new version here , which is open source .

Should I be funny and just leave that one sentence as a description ?
Nay !
Naw !
Heck naw !
Let ’s talk all about this bike right here , buddy !
The lines on it are simple yet dynamic .
The shape is extreme , as if we were living on an alternate timeline where this bike had grown from a bizarro world history .
And what is it made of ?
Carbon !
And what ’s its name ?
Hybrid City !
Yes , this is a carbon - based life - form .
This makeup allows for maximum weight reduction in the end product .
So let me tell you .
The one thing I got a big problem with .
HUGE PROBLEM .
Is that it ’s not covered with butterflies .
Ever since I saw that design so many months ago , I just can not get it out of my head .
BUT !
I ’ll tell ye what .
The matte black on this bike does quite the trick .
If anything is going to blank my platter , it ’s going to be matte .
Very wild !
And why is it called hybrid ?
Because it ’s half electric ?
No way .
It ’s because it ’s got high fashion and extreme styling at the same time as being ready to be considered a premium city bike for commuting and extensive rider base .
That ’s it !

3 Processes
A process is a program executing on the operating system .
It consists of a program ( machine code ) and a state of the program ( current control point , variable values , call stack , open file descriptors , etc. ) .
This section presents the Unix system calls to create new processes and make them run other programs .
3.1 Creation of processes
The system call fork creates a process .
val fork : unit -> int
The new child process is a nearly perfect clone of the parent process which called fork .
Both processes execute the same code , are initially at the same control point ( the return from fork ) , attribute the same values to all variables , have identical call stacks , and hold open the same file descriptors to the same files .
The only thing which distinguishes the two processes is the return value from fork : zero in the child process , and a non-zero integer in the parent .
By checking the return value from fork , a program can thus determine if it is in the parent process or the child and behave accordingly :
match fork ( ) with | 0 -> (* code run only in the child *) | pid -> (* code run only in the parent *)
The non -zero integer returned by fork in the parent process is the process id of the child .
The process id is used by the kernel to uniquely identify each process .
A process can obtain its process id by calling getpid .
The child process is initially in the same state as the parent process ( same variable values , same open file descriptors ) .
This state is not shared between the parent and the child , but merely duplicated at the moment of the fork .
For example , if one variable is bound to a reference before the fork , a copy of that reference and its current contents is made at the moment of the fork ; after the fork , each process independently modifies its “ own ” reference without affecting the other process .
Similarly , the open file descriptors are copied at the moment of the fork : one may be closed and the other kept open .
On the other hand , the two descriptors designate the same entry in the file table ( residing in system memory ) and share their current position : if one reads and then the other , each will read a different part of the file ; likewise , changes in the read / write position by one process with lseek are immediately visible to the other .
3.2 Complete Example : the command leave
The command leave hhmm exits immediately , but forks a background process which , at the time hhmm , reports that it is time to leave .
1 open Unix ; ; 2 3 let leave ( ) = 4 let hh = int_of_string ( String.sub Sys.argv .
( 1 ) 0 2 ) 5 and mm = int_of_string ( String.sub Sys.argv .
( 1 ) 2 2 ) in 6 let now = localtime ( time ( ) ) in 7 let delay = ( hh - now . tm_hour ) * 3600 + ( mm - now.tm_min ) * 60 in 8 9 if delay <= 0 then begin 10 print_endline " Hey !
That time has already passed ! " ; 11 exit 0 12 end ; 13 if fork ( ) <> 0 then exit 0 ; 14 sleep delay ; 15 print_endline " \007\007\007
Time to leave ! " ; 16 exit 0 ; ; 17 18 handle_unix_error leave ( ) ; ; Unix ; ; leave ( ) =hh = int_of_string ( String.sub Sys.argv .
( 1 ) 0 2 ) mm = int_of_string ( String.sub Sys.argv .
( 1 ) 2 2 ) now = localtime ( time ( ) ) delay = ( hh - now . tm_hour ) * 3600 + ( mm - now.tm_min ) * 60 delay <= 0 print_endline
" Hey !
That time has already passed ! " ; exit 0fork ( ) <> 0 exit 0 ; sleep delay ; print_endline " \007\007\007
Time to leave ! " ; exit 0 ; ; handle_unix_error leave ( ) ; ;
The program begins with a rudimentary parsing of the command line , in order to extract the time provided .
It then calculates the delay in seconds ( line 8 ) .
The time call returns the current date , in seconds from the epoch ( January 1st 1970 , midnight ) .
The function localtime splits this duration into years , months , days , hours , minutes and seconds .
It then creates a new process using fork .
The parent process ( whose return value from fork is a non-zero integer ) terminates immediately .
The shell which launched leave thereby returns control to the user .
The child process ( whose return value from fork is zero ) continues executing .
It does nothing during the indicated time ( the call to sleep ) , then displays its message and terminates .
3.3 Awaiting the termination of a process
The system call wait waits for one of the child processes created by fork to terminate and returns information about how it did .
It provides a parent - child synchronization mechanism and a very rudimentary form of communication from the child to the parent .
val val wait : unit -> int * process_status waitpid : wait_flag list -> int -> int * process_status
The primitive system call is waitpid and the function wait ( ) is merely a shortcut for the expression waitpid [ ] ( - 1 ) .
The behavior of waitpid [ ] p depends on the value of p :
If p > 0 , it awaits the termination of the child with id equal to p .
> 0 , it awaits the termination of the child with id equal to .
If p = 0 , it awaits any child with the same group id as the calling process .
= 0 , it awaits any child with the same group id as the calling process .
If p = −1 , it awaits any process .
= −1 , it awaits any process .
If p < −1 , it awaits a child process with group id equal to -p .
The first component of the result is the process id of the child caught by wait .
The second component of the result is a value of type process_status :
WEXITED r
The child process terminated normally via exit or by reaching the end of the program ; r is the return code ( the argument passed to exit ) .
WSIGNALED s The child process was killed by a signal ( ctrl - C , kill , etc. , see chapter 4 for more information about signals ) ; s identifies the signal .
WSTOPPED s
The child process was halted by the signal s ; this occurs only in very special cases where a process ( typically a debugger ) is currently monitoring the execution of another ( by calling ptrace ) .
If one of the child processes has already terminated by the time the parent calls wait , the call returns immediately .
Otherwise , the parent process blocks until some child process terminates ( a behavior called “ rendezvous ” ) .
To wait for n child processes , one must call wait n times .
The command waitpid accepts two optional flags for its first argument : the flag WNOHANG indicates not to wait if there is a child that responds to the request but has not yet terminated .
In that case , the first result is 0 and the second undefined .
The flag WUNTRACED returns the child processes that have been halted by the signal sigstop .
The command raises the exception ECHILD if no child processes match p ( in particular , if p is - 1 and the current process has no more children ) .
Example
The function fork_search below performs a linear search in an array with two processes .
It relies on the function simple_search to perform the linear search .
1 open Unix ; ; 2 exception Found ; ; 3 4 let simple_search cond v = 5 try 6 for i = 0 to Array . length v - 1 do 7 if cond v.( i ) then raise Found 8 done ; 9 false 10 with Found -> true ;; 11 12 let fork_search cond v = 13 let n = Array. length v in 14 match fork ( ) with 15 | 0 -> 16 let found = simple_search cond ( Array.sub v ( n /2 ) ( n - n /2 ) ) in 17 exit ( if found then 0 else 1 ) 18 | _ -> 19 let found = simple_search cond ( Array.sub v 0 ( n / 2 ) ) in 20 match wait ( ) with 21 | ( pid , WEXITED retcode ) -> found || ( retcode = 0 ) 22 | ( pid , _ ) -> failwith " fork_search " ; ; Unix ; ; Found ;;simple_search cond v =i = 0Array.length v - 1cond v.( i)raise FoundFound ->;; fork_search cond v =n = Array.length vfork ( ) | 0 -> found = simple_search cond ( Array.sub v ( n /2 ) ( n - n /2 ) ) exit ( found1 ) | _ -> found = simple_search cond ( Array.sub v 0 ( n / 2 ) ) wait ( ) | ( pid , WEXITED retcode ) -> found || ( retcode = 0 ) | ( pid , _ ) -> failwith " fork_search " ; ;
After the fork , the child process traverses the upper half of the table , and exits with the return code 1 if it found an element satisfying the predicate cond , or 0 otherwise ( lines 16 and 17 ) .
The parent process traverses the lower half of the table , then calls wait to sync with the child process ( lines 21 and 22 ) .
If the child terminated normally , it combines its return code with the boolean result of the search in the lower half of the table .
Otherwise , something horrible happened , and the function fork_search fails .
* * *
In addition to the synchronization between processes , the wait call also ensures recovery of all resources used by the child processes .
When a process terminates , it moves into a “ zombie ” state , where most , but not all , of its resources ( memory , etc. ) have been freed .
It continues to occupy a slot in the process table to transmit its return value to the parent via the wait call .
Once the parent calls wait , the zombie process is removed from the process table .
Since this table is of fixed size , it is important to call wait on each forked process to avoid leaks .
If the parent process terminates before the child , the child is given the process number 1 ( usually init ) as parent .
This process contains an infinite loop of wait calls , and will therefore make the child process disappear once it finishes .
This leads to the useful “ double fork ” technique if you cannot easily call wait on each process you create ( because you cannot afford to block on termination of the child process , for example ) .
match fork ( ) with | 0 -> if fork ( ) <> 0 then exit 0 ; (* do whatever the child should do *) | _ -> wait ( ) ; (* do whatever the parent should do *)
The child terminates via exit just after the second fork .
The grandson becomes an orphan , and is adopted by init .
In this way , it leaves no zombie processes .
The parent immediately calls wait to reap the child .
This wait will not block for long since the child terminates very quickly .
3.4 Launching a program
The system calls execve , execv , and execvp launch a program within the current process .
Except in case of error , these calls never return : they halt the progress of the current program and switch to the new program .
val val val execve : string -> string array -> string array -> unit execv : string -> string array -> unit execvp : string -> string array -> unit
The first argument is the name of the file containing the program to execute .
In the case of execvp , this name is looked for in the directories of the search path ( specified in the environment variable PATH ) .
The second argument is the array of command line arguments with which to execute the program ; this array will be the Sys.argv array of the executed program .
In the case of execve , the third argument is the environment given to the executed program ; execv and execvp give the current environment unchanged .
The calls execve , execv , and execvp never return a result : either everything works without errors and the process starts the requested program or an error occurs ( file not found , etc. ) , and the call raises the exception Unix_error in the calling program .
Example
The following three forms are equivalent : execve " / bin/ls " [ | " ls " ; " - l " ; " / tmp " | ] ( environment ( ) ) execv " / bin/ls " [ | " ls " ; " - l " ; " / tmp " | ] execvp " ls " [ | " ls " ; " - l " ; " /tmp " | ] * * *
Example
Here is a “ wrapper ” around the command grep which adds the option - i ( to ignore case ) to the list of arguments : open Sys ; ; open Unix ; ; let grep ( ) = execvp " grep " ( Array.concat [ [ | " grep " ; " - i " | ] ; ( Array.sub Sys.argv 1 ( Array.length Sys.argv - 1 ) ) ] ) ; ; handle_unix_error grep ( ) ; ; * * *
Example Here ’s a “ wrapper ” around the command emacs which changes the terminal type : open Sys ; ; open Unix ; ; let emacs ( ) = execve " /usr/bin/emacs " Sys.argv ( Array.concat [ [ | " TERM=hacked - xterm " | ] ; ( environment ( ) ) ] ) ; ; handle_unix_error emacs ( ) ; ; * * *
The process which calls exec is the same one that executes the new program .
As a result , the new program inherits some features of the execution environment of the program which called exec :
the same process id and parent process
same standard input , standard output and standard error
same ignored signals ( see chapter 4 )
3.5 Complete example : a mini-shell
The following program is a simplified command interpreter : it reads lines from standard input , breaks them into words , launches the corresponding command , and repeats until the end of file on the standard input .
We begin with the function which splits a string into a list of words .
Please , no comments on this horror .
open Unix ; ; open Printf ; ; let split_words s = let rec skip_blanks i = if i < String.length s & s.[i ] = ' ' then skip_blanks ( i+1 ) else i in let rec split start i = if i >= String.length s then [ String . sub s start ( i- start ) ] else if s.[ i ] = ' ' then let j = skip_blanks i in String .
sub s start ( i - start ) :: split j j else split start ( i+1 ) in Array.of_list ( split 0 0 ) ; ;
We now move on to the main loop of the interpreter .
let exec_command cmd = try execvp cmd .(0 ) cmd with Unix_error ( err , _ , _ ) -> printf " Cannot execute %s : %s
%! " cmd. (0 ) ( error_message err ) ; exit 255 let print_status program status = match status with | WEXITED 255 -> ( ) | WEXITED status -> printf " %s exited with code %d
%! " program status ; | WSIGNALED signal -> printf " %s killed by signal %d
%! " program signal ; | WSTOPPED signal -> printf " %s stopped ( ???)
%! " program ; ;
The function exec_command executes a command and handles errors .
The return code 255 indicates that the command could not be executed .
( This is not a standard convention ; we just hope that few commands terminate with a return code of 255 . )
The function print_status decodes and prints the status information returned by a process , ignoring the return code of 255 .
let minishell ( ) = try while true do let cmd = input_line Pervasives .
stdin in let words = split_words cmd in match fork ( ) with | 0 -> exec_command words | pid_son -> let pid , status = wait ( ) in print_status " Program " status done with End_of_file -> ( ) ; ; handle_unix_error minishell ( ) ; ;
Each time through the loop , we read a line from stdin with the function input_line .
This function raises the End_of_file exception when the end of file is reached , causing the loop to exit .
We split the line into words , and then call fork .
The child process uses exec_command to execute the command .
The parent process calls wait to wait for the command to finish and prints the status information returned by wait .
MILWAUKEE --
The Milwaukee Brewers are erecting a statue of baseball commissioner Bud Selig outside Miller Park and will unveil it on Aug. 24 .
Selig headed a group that bought the Seattle Pilots in bankruptcy court in 1970 , moved the franchise to Milwaukee and renamed it the Brewers .
He became acting commissioner in 1992 and took the job full - time six years later , turning control of the team over to his daughter , Wendy Selig - Prieb .
The Selig family sold the team to a group headed by Mark Attanasio in 2005 .
" The Brewers and Miller Park are in this city because of the commissioner 's vision and dedicated efforts , " Attanasio said Monday .
Selig 's foundation donated statues of Hank Aaron and Robin Yount that were unveiled when Miller Park opened in 2001 .
Selig 's statue , which will be more than 7 feet tall , will be built by the same designer , Brian Maughan .
So , What Does it Really Take to Sell Your Home Fast ?
That ’s a question that we are asked several times a week .
There are really 3 main ways to sell your home quickly
1 . Hire a real estate agent to list your home on the local Multiple Listing Service ( MLS )
This first method typically will get you the hire price , but it comes at the cost of having to patiently wait months or sometimes even years to get your home to finally sell .
2 . Try to sell your house yourself “ For Sale By Owner ” ( FSBO )
This 2nd method is n’t for the faint at heart .
Though you can save some fees by not having to pay for any real estate agent ’s commissions , it will require you to perform all the marketing and contract writing services all by yourself .
3 . Sell your house to a company that buys houses
This method is by far the easiest way to sell a house fast but you need to make sure you pick a reputable company .

An interesting example of a company that spoon - feeds their customers is Ted ’s Montana Grill .
At any other restaurant , the bill would come at the end of the meal , with the sum total of everyone ’s meals , and the entire group would struggle to calculate how much each of them owed .
Cash is exchanged , tip calculators are whipped out , and there ’s always that one jerk ( me ) who only has a credit card .
Figuring out how to split the bill is an ordeal .
At Ted ’s , it is n’t .
A $ 75 bill , nicely divided into four sections showing what each person ordered and how much it cost .
You know exactly how much you owe without having to think about it or argue with your friends .
As Larry David said , no one wants to do math after eating a meal .
Ted took that to heart .
It might seem trivial to do something like this .
There ’s no impact on the bottom line .
But it ’s an unexpected surprise , and it leaves customers feeling happy .

The Falcon 9 Rocket and Dragon Spacecraft :
See the craft in detail , plus how it stacks up to a Russian Soyuz rocket and NASA 's space shuttles .
NASA 's spaceshuttles are flying their final missions this year , but one commercialspaceflight company in California has a new , privately - built rocket standingready to replace the aging workhorse .
SpaceExploration Technologies ?
( SpaceX ) new Falcon 9 rocket is already assembled inCape Canaveral , Fla. for a debut in the first half of 2010 .
A following flight , sometime between May and November , would launch the cargo - carrying Dragonspacecraft to resupply the International Space Station .
Dragon couldalso eventually loft NASA astronauts into space by as early as 2014 .
Just don'tcall it a taxi service , said Gwynne Shotwell , president of SpaceX .
The company , founded by PayPal entrepreneur Elon Musk , has already launched satellites toorbit on its smaller , unmanned Falcon 1 rockets .
" Elonstarted this company with the hopes of making space more accessible forprofessional crews ?
not necessarily joy - riders or tourists ?
and really tofacilitate the manned exploration of space , " Shotwell told SPACE.com .
NASA 'sproposed 2011 budget request would scrap its new spacecraft plans and , instead , set aside about $ 6 billion over the next five years to support commercialspaceflight .
That marks a major shift toward using private companies suchas SpaceX to launch both cargo and humans into low Earth orbit .
SpaceXalready holds a $ 1.6 billion contract with NASA for 12 flights to resupply thespace station .
Another company , Virginia - based Orbital Sciences , is building anew Taurus 2 rocket to launch its own cargo ship to the space station for NASAunder a $ 1.9 billion contract for eight flights .
? One of themost exciting things , to me , about the 2011 NASA budget is that it acknowledgesone of the biggest barriers to exploring space , and that barrier is how do youpay for it , ? said former NASA astronaut Ken Bowersox , who is now SpaceX?s vicepresident for astronaut safety , during a Feb. 2 NASA event in Washington , D.C.
Bowersoxsaid it is up to NASA and the government to set new destinations in space .
Private companies like SpaceX have to figure out how to get there .
? It ?s areally great thing to watch what happens when you blend the skills that areonly available in the government with the flexibility and creativity of privateindustry , ?
Bowersox said .
Firstlaunch jitters , again
Still , SpaceX has not sugar - coated the challenges of launching a brand new rocket .
The company enduredrepeated heartbreak with three failed launches of its smaller Falcon 1 rocketbeginning in 2006 , but finally tastedsuccess during the fourth launch in September 2008 .
A fifthcommercial launch in July 2009 marked two clean launches in a row , or what Shotwell deemed a " critical milestone " for the company .
She addedthat the people at SpaceX remain " stubborn " and " tenacious " even as they acknowledge the challenges that lay ahead .
" Historyshows that the first two flights of any vehicle is a struggle , " Shotwellsaid .
" We 're certainly not rushing to the flight line . "
For Falcon9 , SpaceX has taken painstaking steps to get it right the first time .
The two - stagerocket stands 180 feet ( 55 meters ) tall and is capable of hauling spacecraft orpayloads weighing up to 23,000 pounds ( 10,450 kg ) to low - Earth orbit .
SpaceXhas designs for a heavy - lift version , which would use two additional boostersto launch payloads of up to 70,548 pounds ( 32,000 kg ) to low - Earth orbit .
The companybuilt the main components of two Falcon 9 vehicles just for qualification andpropulsion tests .
That means the rocket slated for launch from Cape CanaveralAir Force Station in Florida actually represents the third Falcon 9 vehiclethat SpaceX has built .
But all thecomputer simulations and firing tests on the ground can only go so far , Shotwell explained .
Only launch day will show just how well a rocket 's guidanceand control perform under actual flight conditions .
Safety incommercial spaceflight
SpaceX plansto launch many unmanned cargo flights with Falcon 9 and establish a safetyrecord before putting astronauts aboard .
Yet it and other commercialspaceflight providers still face a numberof doubts from the U.S. Congress , as well as from supporters of thecancelled Constellation program .
" We 'renot talking about putting crew on the first Falcon 9 flight , " Shotwellsaid .
She added that the idea of commercial spaceflight being inherentlydangerous was " ludicrous , " and pointed to commercial airlines asexamples of reliable private enterprises .
Anindependent advisory panel also issued a January report that said privatecompanies do not meet NASA 's crew - rating standards .
Elon Musk , founder and CEO of SpaceX , countered by calling the Aerospace Safety AdvisoryPanel 's findings " bizarre . "
He and Shotwell questioned how the panel came to itsconclusion after barely spending any time reviewing SpaceX 's vehicles or data .
" Commercialcompanies rely on the quality of their products and services to stay inbusiness , and quality for ISS missions clearly means safety andreliability , " Shotwell noted .
" We stay alive based on our trackrecord . "
NASA has notyet officially established safety standards to rate commercial vehicles thatwould carry astronauts into space , but it has shared some of its existingguidelines , NASA officials have said .
SpaceX has adopted temporary guidelinesbased on those existing crew ratings in anticipation of the U.S. space agency ' sdesires .
" Wedo n't anticipate that they 'll make it any easier on us , and we do n't want to betreated in a special way , " Shotwell said .
" We 're designing the safestvehicle that we possibly can . "
The newcommercial space zone
Fiveastronauts have already undergone preliminary training with SpaceX's Dragonspacecraft , so that they know how to receive the unmanned Dragon during dockingoperations with the space station .
But SpaceX has also prepared for the daywhen astronauts themselves will ride Dragon into space .
The mainchange for making Dragon crew - ready involves adding a launch escape system forthe astronauts .
Otherwise the spacecraft needs very few alterations to carryhumans versus cargo , Musk noted during the spaceindustry teleconference .
" We 'reconfident of being able to do it at $ 20 million per seat , " Musk said .
Bycontrast , a ride into orbit aboard the Russian Soyuz costs NASA approximately $ 51 million per person .
NASA 's newbudget also includes extending the space station 's life until 2020 ?
a prospectwelcomed by SpaceX .
" Itcertainly provides a longer - lasting market for resupply activities , " Shotwell said .
" On the other hand , I think that we 've invested anincredible amount of money in the ISS , and we 've forged important politicalrelationships in that process . "
For now , SpaceX is fully focused on fulfilling the first part of its Commercial OrbitalTransportation Services contract , which involves three Dragon flightdemonstrations .
" For a$ 278 million investment on NASA 's side , they 're getting access to a brand newrocket and a Dragon spacecraft that can shuttle cargo , " Shotwell said .
" I can't imagine a better value for the dollar . "
Technology by team behind the MP3 will offer fans a new way to listen to music and could be key in the fight against piracy
A new way of experiencing music – billed as the most significant development in digital music since the invention of the MP3 – was unveiled at the biggest ­conference in the music industry calendar today .
MusicDNA , a digital music file , could help the embattled industry by encouraging music lovers to pay for the latest hits , according to developers .
The team that first worked on the MP3 , which turned the music industry on its head , today revealed what they hope will become its successor at the Midem industry conference in Cannes .
MusicDNA files will not only contain music but bring together a range of artist information , from artwork and song lyrics to tour dates and Twitter feeds .
A fan buying a MusicDNA file of Florence and the Machine 's Lungs , for example , could watch – on their computer screen or music player – videos of recent performances , pore over artwork and sleeve notes , find out about concerts and buy a tour T - shirt , while following any blogs or tweets the musician might write .
" Out of a rusted old VW Beetle we are making a Ferrari , " said Stefan Kohlmeyer , the chief executive of Bach Technology , which has developed the file .
" We are taking an existing idea , giving the end user a lot more and making that file much more valuable – like transforming a tiny house into a huge villa . "
The file is one of a range of ideas being proposed by technology companies as they clamber to meet the needs of the rapidly developing digital music market .
Technology giant Apple released iTunes LP last September , a format which includes interactive album artwork and bundles multimedia elements alongside the music .
A similar format , known as CMX , is being developed by the four major record labels .
Meanwhile MXP4 , another music tech company , has created a file that provides multimedia content as well as interactive music applications .
Which of the formats will come out on top remains to be seen , but they are a step in the right direction , according to Paul Brindley , of digital music specialists Music Ally .
" It is difficult to recreate the value of a physical product digitally but we are going to see a lot more artists offering a premium product to real fans that are special and higher value , " he said .
The MusicDNA technology could prove key in the fight against piracy , said Kohlmeyer .
The information given with the legally downloaded files will update automatically with tour dates or releases , but pirated files will remain static .
" At the moment there is no real incentive to buy a legal file .
If we concentrate on making the legal file , we can help the entire music industry , " he said .
It is not known how much the technology will cost .
Bach says the price will be set by record labels and retailers , but hopes it will be in a similar range to current digital files .
It will be launched this spring .
The company has joined forces with independent labels including UK - based Beggars Group – home of Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead – as well as Tommy Boy Entertainment and Delta records in the US , though no major labels are yet on board .
Tom Silverman , the founder and CEO of Tommy Boy , said MusicDNA would provide a much - needed boost to artists and fans because it would connect the two long after the initial sale .
" It is a boon for fans as it can offer multiple levels of artist stuff based on the fan 's passion level .
It 's a boon for labels because this high - value consumer experience is not clonable , yet highly viral , and gives them full content and pricing flexibility .
Their imagination is their only limit …
If MP3s were the cassette , MusicDNA will be the CD . "
Most of us ca n’t tell our secant from our cotangent .
But the forms are everywhere , and Nikki Graziano wants to help us see them .
Graziano , a math and photography student at Rochester Institute of Technology , overlays graphs and their corresponding equations onto her carefully composed photos .
“ I wanted to create something that could communicate how awesome math is , to everyone , ” she says .
Graziano does n’t go out looking for a specific function but lets one find her instead .
Once she ’s got an image she likes , Graziano whips up the numbers and tweaks the function until the graph it describes aligns perfectly with the photograph .
See more of her Found Functions series at Nikkigraziano.com .
When graphed , this trigonometry function produces an ever - repeating wave of peaks and valleys that mirror the natural curves Graziano sees in plants .
( October 2008 . )
“ It ’s a pretty famous function , ” Graziano says of this bell curve in the sky .
( June 2009 . )
Surrounded by piles of snow last spring , Graziano says she could n’t help but take some photos like this one .
( April 2009 . )
Nature speaks a language , Graziano says , and sometimes that language can look pretty complicated — like the function whose graph mirrors the shape of this pile of sand .
( March 2009 . )
Hollywood ’s going 3 - D , and so has Graziano .
She ventured into the third dimension to produce graphs that map the contours of plants .
This one is a hyperbolic parabloid .
This function describes 3 - D representations of a repeating sine curve .

A life - size bronze sculpture of a man by Alberto Giacometti has been sold at auction in London for the world record price of £ 65,001,250 .
It took just eight minutes for bidders to reach the hammer price after L'Homme Qui Marche I opened at £ 12 m at Sotheby 's auction house .
Sotheby 's said it was the most expensive work ever sold at auction .
An anonymous phone bidder bought the work for £ 58 m .
The £ 65 m price tag includes the buyer 's premium .
The sculpture is considered to be one of the most important by the 20th Century Swiss artist .
It had been estimated to sell for between £ 12 m and £ 18 m but furious bidding saw more than 10 rivals bump the price up , eventually reaching the hammer price of £ 58 m .
Georgina Adam , editor - at - large of The Art Newspaper , said the price was so high because there were so few Giacometti sculptures and it was very rare for them to be put up for auction .
How can a piece of art command such a price , especially in today 's economic conditions ?
BBC Arts editor Will Gompertz investigates Read Will 's blog
She told the BBC : " There 's a market which is sort of exceptional for exceptional things .
" If something is a one in a lifetime opportunity , people will really step up to the plate and they will spend enormous amounts of money because it was a now or never opportunity . "
The previous record for an art work sold at auction -$ 104,168,000 ( £ 58,520,830 ) - was held by Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe which sold in New York in 2004 .
Other works have reached more in private sales .
Jackson Pollock 's No5 , 1948 , reached $ 140 m ( £ 73 m at the time ) in 2006 .
The sculpture had been expected to sell for between £ 12 m and £ 18 m
Another art work also exceeded expectations at Sotheby 's Impressionist and Modern Art sale .
Gustav Klimt's Kirche in Cassone went for £ 26,921,250 , above the £ 12 m to £ 18 m estimate .
Paul Cezanne 's
Pichet et fruits sur une table was sold for just under £ 12 m .
Melanie Clore , of Sotheby 's Impressionist and Modern Art department , said : " We are thrilled to have sold these great works this evening and that they have been recognised for the masterpieces that they are .
" The competition which generated these exceptional results demonstrates the continued quest for quality that compels today 's collectors . "

The Wavelight concept coverts mechanical energy captured by ocean waves into electrical energy to illuminate a series of LED lamps .
Each lamp is tethered to its neighbor with a weight anchored to the sea floor .
The lights are designed to attract attention for rescue operations or to warn passing ships to steer clear .
A very intriguing design but are LEDs powerful enough ?
What happens if the anchor is n’t long enough to reach the sea floor ?

Web applications are nice .
They ’re useful , they ’re cross- platform , users need no installation , no upgrades , no maintenance , not even the computing or storage power to which they are used .
As weird as it may sound , I ’ve even seen announcements for web applications supposed to run your games on distant high - end computers so that you can actually play on low - end computers .
Go web application !
Of course , there are a few downsides to web applications .
Firstly , they require a web connexion .
Secondly , they are largely composed of plumbing .
Finally , ensuring their security is a constant fight .
How many pipes do you need ?
If you have ever developed a web application , you know what I mean by plumbing : just writing an online TODO list — the equivalent of maybe twenty minutes of work in Visual Basic , in Python , Java or Objective - C — requires mixing an insane amount of languages , to define your user interface ( HTML , JavaScript , CSS ) , to define your storage ( DDL , DML , DCL , plus possibly an ORM language ) , to get your server and your client to communicate ( XML , more JavaScript , PHP or one of its competitors , as well as some HTTP and a little MIME configuration ) , to launch your application ( whichever configuration languages are used by your server ) .
Of course , if your application is a bit more complex and requires something like compatibility with smartphones , or like distant storage , or distributed computing , or backups , or modularity ( in the world of the web , it ’s called “ web services ” ) … well , you will probably require a few additional languages .
All of this is just plumbing .
Only once you have written it can you concentrate on the core of the application .
And once the application is written , the pain is just starting , because chances are that your application can be attacked by hijacking the link between your user interface and the core ( cross - site scripting ) or between the core and the storage ( SQL injection ) or by keeping the user interface and replacing the application core ( man - in - the - middle attacks ) or by replacing the user interface by a malicious client or by taking the place of a currently connected user to steal some of its credentials ( rebinding ) or by taking advantage of low - level bugs ( buffer over / underflows ) , etc .
None of this is a show - stopper , of course — just take a look at the web and you will see thousands of web applications .
Just like the complexity of Software Development Kits in the early days of Windows , MacOS or X did n’t stop adventurous hackers from developing desktop applications .
But of course , if twenty - five years of desktop application development have taught us one thing , it is that the life of developers can be made easier .
Nowadays , a few generations of SDKs later , Windows developers have .
Net , C# and Visual Studio , Macintosh developers have Cocoa , Objective - C and XCode , while X - based developers have the libraries of Gnome / KDE , Python and a variety of programming environments .
The growing popularity ( and libraries ) of Haskell , F# , OCaml , Scala and other functional programming languages could mean that one of the next generations of SDKs will increase safety and security .
The web has n’t quite reached that stage yet .
Even the state - of - the - art in web frameworks only provides features slightly more advanced than early Windows / Mac / X SDKs : low - level bindings for low - level mechanisms , designed to ensure low - level properties .
Or , rephrased differently , in the current state of web development , GMail , Google Maps or Facebook are still considered complicated applications , although they are conceptually quite simple and should therefore be equally simple to implement .
We can do better .
How ?
By removing the need for plumbing .
By providing automated mechanisms for ensuring high - level security properties .
By providing language support for common patterns .
Enter OPA
Let me introduce OPA .
OPA , or One Pot Application , is a complete development platform for web applications and web services .
Development in OPA requires no plumbing .
Applications developed with OPA are automatically checked for safety and security before they are executed .
Applications developed with OPA are automatically ( and provably ) immune to cross -site scripting , to SQL injections and to most existing forms of attacks .
And OPA provides language support for storage , communication between client and server ( Ajax and Comet ) , concurrency , distribution , mobility , etc .
With OPA , we intend to skip several generations of SDKs and provide right now a high - level and modern programming platform .
OPA has been 6 years in the making : 4 years of sketches , mockups and prototypes as part of academic research projects and 2 years of actual implementation at MLstate .
A few days ago , OPA has officially entered demonstrable status .
Not quite ready for prime time , but definitely usable for development .
Do you want to write an online note - taking application ?
That ’s about 20 lines of code , from scratch .
A minimal chat ?
About 30 lines .
A multi-channel , distributed chat ?
About 80 lines .
A minesweeper ?
About 100 .
We ’re using it to develop utilities , content management systems , tools for administrations and games .
Pre-alpha builds of OPA have been distributed to selected partners .
A public version will be made available within a few weeks , as well as commercial applications developed with OPA .
In the meantime , we are busy improving the syntax , completing the standard library , making error messages intelligible , fixing the bugs and extending the range of safety and security checks .
Interested ?
Well , few details are public at this time .
However , you can take a look at a video recorded during ICFP presenting OPA and MLstate .
Stay tuned .

The 21st century has seen an increased national desire to become more environmentally friendly , and Kentucky is no exception .
We have some of the most fertile soil in the United States , and with tobacco and coal on their way out the door , we need viable income alternatives that can steer us in a sustainable direction .
As this is the case , one of the smartest moves that we Kentuckians can make is to write and enact legislation that will make the growing and selling of industrial hemp and marijuana legal again .
It is important to understand that there are differences between hemp and marijuana because they have different functions that are important to the present and future of Kentucky .
In resolving some of the problems that we humans have created during the Age of Patriarchy , we will need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels , synthetics ( including plastics ) , and trees .
We will also need to heal the wounds of those who suffer from mental disorders , imbalances , diseases , and reduce the needless deaths caused by prescription drugs that medical marijuana can replace .
In achieving these goals , we the people need to resurrect locally and nationally the legal cultivation and selling of both industrial hemp and marijuana .
The Plant
In 2010 , many people still think of industrial hemp and marijuana as being one and the same or indistinguishable , even though botanically speaking they are cousins .
Hemp is an English word that has been used for varieties ( i.e. , cannabis sativa ) of the Cannabis plant that have been bred and used for food , fiber , paper , fuel , seeds , oil , etc. Marihuana is derived from the Spanish word marijuana and has been used for Cannabis varieties that have been bred over time and used for medicinal , therapeutic , and / or recreational purposes like cannabis indica .
Hemp and marijuana both belong to the plant family Cannabaceae and genus Cannabis L. Although they originally belonged to different species , since the mid to late 20th century they have been botanically grouped together with six other species as Cannabis sativa L.
This intentional grouping made it possible for the Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 to classify marijuana and industrial hemp as the same plant , even though the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 made a distinction between industrial hemp and marijuana .
The 1937 Act brought with it heavy taxes , excessive paperwork , and possible fines and / or prison time for marijuana commerce that led to a decrease in the cultivation and personal use of marijuana , thereby making it easier for later laws to make it illegal .
The Cannabis ( genus or Cannabis L. ) plant is a native of central Asia and may have been cultivated as early as 10,000 B.C. Around 3000 B.C. , Ayurvedic medicine used bhang — produced from the dried and crushed leaves , seeds , and stems — to treat problems that included diarrhea , epilepsy , nausea , fever , diabetes , asthma , and menstrual disorders .
In 2700 B.C. , the first written record of medicinal usage is made in the pharmacopoeia of Shen Nung ( one of the fathers of Chinese medicine ) for constipation , gout , malaria , fevers , menstrual problems , and rheumatism .
The West came late to using marijuana as medicine , but in 1621 English clergyman Robert Burton wrote in The Anatomy of Melancholy that marijuana could be used for the treatment of depression .
Between 1840 and 1900 , more than 100 papers were written and published in Western medical literature about using marijuana to treat various diseases and ailments .
Marijuana was listed in the United States Pharmacopoeia and National Formulary from around 1852 until 1941 , which means that it was used for prescription and / or over - the - counter medicines .
The United States Pharmacopoeia went so far as to list marijuana as one of the least toxic substances .
On the other hand , even though prescription ( non-illicit ) drugs have a much shorter history than marijuana , according to a 1998 study in the Journal of the American Association , the deaths caused by adverse drug reactions in hospitals have been listed as being between the fourth and sixth leading cause of death in the United States .
The Law
I am not an expert in law , but the actions taken by the federal government through the passage of laws by Congress related to the regulation of hemp and marijuana can be brought to the U.S. Supreme Court on their ( possible ) illegality .
This is because in United States v. Butler ( 1936 ) it was decided that the “ regulation and control of agricultural production are beyond the powers delegated to the Federal Government ” ( United States v. Butler ) .
This means states can argue that the Controlled Substances Act ( a subset of The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act ) of 1970 is in violation of United States v. Butler because industrial hemp was an agricultural product prior to the Revolutionary War and was grown by farmers at the request of the federal government during World War II .
( It will be harder for marijuana since it 's name is of Spanish origin . )
California is a good example of a state that is defending its rights in this regard .
Following the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970 , Congress recommended the creation of a presidential commission to study marijuana because it did not want to permanently categorize marijuana as a Schedule 1 substance — an illegal drug with no medicinal uses — without having substantial knowledge about it .
The commission , named the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse , consisted of 14 members named by President Nixon and Congress .
Of his allotted ten appointees , President Nixon named Raymond Shafer , former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania and former prosecutor , the chair of the commission .
In March 1972 , The National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse , commonly called the Shafer Commission , released their findings in “ The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse : Drug Use In America : Problem in Perspective . ”
One journalist cited the findings as the “ most comprehensive review of marihuana conducted by the federal government . ”
The commission advised that marijuana be treated similarly to alcohol in the Volstead Act of 1919 ( used to enforce the 18th Amendment ) in that an individual who possessed ( including casual or non-monetary transfer ) marijuana in public would be fined but would not receive a warrant or a record of any kind as the criminal justice system was to not be involved .
Law enforcement could not search a private establishment without probable cause of “ unlawful sale . ”
In addition , the Shafer Commission recommended changes to the treatment of marijuana — classified as contraband — in the Controlled Substances Act. Several members of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse also favored legalization of marijuana .
However , President Nixon denounced the report and started the “ War on Drugs ” through an onslaught of propaganda and myths that continue today through the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) and other groups , which have made it difficult to enact state and federal legislation to re-legalize industrial hemp and marijuana .
Potential Benefits of Legalization
Medical marijuana has been made legal in thirteen states including Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington .
The first state to make the selling of medical marijuana legal was California with Oakland as the epicenter of the movement .
In the summer of 2009 , the citizens of Oakland voted to impose a 1.8 % sales tax on the sale of marijuana that would go directly into the city ’s general funds .
According to Karen Klein in a recent article for Business Week , the Harborside Health Center , an Oakland marijuana dispenser , has a yearly revenue of $ 20 million and therefore pays Oakland approximately $ 360,000 annually through city taxes on medical marijuana .
If California legalizes marijuana with the Marijuana Control , Regulation and Education Act , they anticipate additional yearly revenue of $ 1.38 billion .
In California , newspapers have reported that some of the medical marijuana growers ( many that were almost destitute a few years ago ) are now achieving taxable and legal incomes that exceed $ 100,000 .
Here in Kentucky , one online pro-legalization website , MarijuanaLobby.org , estimates that Kentucky loses an annual revenue of $ 38,750,000.00 it has yet to enact legislation to legalize marijuana — money that can help to buffer our expected budget shortfall .
In addition to the financial benefits of medical marijuana , the people can benefit from seeing a decrease in the prescribing of non-illicit drugs by doctors .
This will greatly benefit Kentucky because the deaths attributed to prescription drugs disproportionately affect the rural population .
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) stated in 2004 that , with its 164 % increase from 1999 to 2004 , Kentucky had one of the highest increases in accidental deaths due to deadly drug overdoses .
To counteract this trend , the legal sale of marijuana should be promoted and established for those illnesses and ailments for which humans have known to benefit like AIDS , cancer treatment , glaucoma , pain reduction , seizure control , affective disorders ( including depression ) , gout , etc .
The people can also benefit financially from being allowed to grow and sell marijuana legally .
The ten - year depression ( in the news it has been called a recession ) has devastated families , single parents , small and even large businesses and has hurt those that live at or below the poverty line .
Kentucky is one of the five poorest states , and in 2007 , 17.2 % of our population lived under the federal poverty level , which was about 4 % higher than the national average .
Hemp , marijuana 's illegal cousin , has long been known for its strength , durability , and vitality , which has made it one of the most functional agricultural products in history .
The plant has more than 200 uses , including food ( for humans and birds ) , fuel , oil , textiles ( including canvas bags and clothes ) , plastics , paint , paper , livestock bedding and food , building materials , rope , sails , and now eco-friendly bricks that have a very low conductivity and good insulation in both the heat and cold .
One acre of industrial hemp can produce more usable fiber than four acres of trees or two acres of cotton .
In addition , when growing hemp , insecticides , pesticides , and herbicides are not needed .
It can also be used in crop rotation cycles ( used in the system of organic gardening ) to add vital nutrients back to the soil that are lost when growing crops like corn and tobacco .
It was reported in 1951 in A History of the Hemp Industry in Kentucky that Kentucky accounted for 50 % of the industrial hemp production during the 1800s .
In a 1998 study , The Center for Business and Economy Research at the University of Kentucky reported that if Kentucky were to create hemp processing plants that it would “ have an economic impact of 771 full - time equivalent jobs and $ 17,600,000 in worker earnings . ”
Because of the increased desire for environmentally friendly and / or sustainable products in the past decade , the economic impact of industrial hemp may be more than reported .
The total amount of money lost in the United States and Kentucky from importing hemp and its by products is not known .
However , based on the increase in popularity of hemp products , it can be assumed that we are losing millions , if not billions of dollars yearly in revenue from having to import hemp products .
By growing hemp on more than family farms , there is the real possibility of increasing the production capacity of industrial hemp for sale , which will increase the state ’s taxable revenue streams .
Since its cultivation will be legal , Kentucky will generate income through the sales tax ( on non -food related hemp by - products ) , income taxes of the growers , from the processing plants , etc .
We the people and the states ( through states ’ rights ) need to reassess our view of industrial hemp and marijuana .
We must put an end to the demonization and fear mongering that keeps these plants and their products illegal .
In doing so , we need to educate ourselves on the facts and work to change the laws at the state and national level , so we can collectively benefit from these agricultural products with histories as old as agriculture itself .
After we arm ourselves with knowledge , we need to lobby our state legislators to pass 2009 Senate Bill 131 ( introduced in the Senate on 12 February 2009 ) , which will legalize hemp production .
We need to contact our state legislators to add industrial hemp and marijuana to be included in the crop diversification that resulted from House Bill 611 .
Lastly , we need to circulate factual information to our lawmakers in Frankfort , to our neighbors , farmers , gardeners , schools , public and private , and newspapers to educate the populace about the truth .

If you 're interested , we 've now got a website : noclexington.com
In our last VoIP installment , we looked at the main reasons why SIP has become a widely adopted protocol , but we left details of the protocol 's inner workings fairly vague .
This article will drill down into the way the Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP ) works , and it should serve as a good starting point for really learning SIP .
If you have n't already done so , you are encouraged to read the previous article , although it 's not a prerequisite .
This introduction also covers the latest SIP extensions and changes , so it gives a complete view of the protocol 's current state , rather than just the basic , underlying RFC .
Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP ) is a VoIP signaling protocol .
As its name suggests , it has everything to do with setting up sessions , which means it has the responsibility for starting a session after you dial a number ( or double - click , in some cases ) .
As such , SIP 's role also includes maintaining user registrations with a server , defining session routing , handling various error scenarios , and , of course , modifying and tearing down sessions .
We 'll present this introduction in two parts .
In the first part , we 'll focus on the SIP foundation layers .
These layers allow creating a network of SIP servers .
In the next article , we will go through the way a phone communicates with the rest of the world using this server network , based on the same foundation layers .
SIP Foundations
Message Structure
SIP shares the same message structure as HTTP and RTSP .
As a result , most of the text description here would fit these protocols as well .
Each message is either a request or a response .
All messages are text - based and have the following form :
First line
Headers
Empty line
Optional body
The first line is different for a request and a response .
A request 's first line uses the following format :
< method ( request type ) > < URI ( address / resource ) > < version >
For example , a SIP request 's first line can be :
REGISTER sip:arstechnica.com SIP/2.0
A response comes in the form of :
< version > < code > < reason phrase >
The version is the same in all messages .
The code is a 3 - digit value , and the reason phrase could be any text describing the nature of the response .
A proper first line in the response could be :
SIP /2.0 200 OK
It 's easy to scan the first characters of a message to detect whether it's a request or a response ( " / " is not a valid character for the method field , therefore even a generic parser could differentiate a request from a response ) .
Next come the headers of the message .
Some headers contain vital information and thus are mandatory , but many headers are optional .
Each header has a name and a value , and some have parameters .
For example :
Contact : sip:gilad@voxisoft.com ;Expires=2000
Contact is the header name , sip:gilad@voxisoft.com is the value , and expires=2000 is a parameter .
Other parameters may appear separated by semicolons .
Some headers may appear just once in a message , and some may appear multiple times .
An equivalent approach to using multiple headers is to separate each value - parameter set with a comma .
Some headers have a compact form for which the header name is shorter .
For example , you can use " m " instead of " Contact " .
After the last header , there 's an empty line followed by the body of the message .
The body could be anything , even binary information .
The header Content - Type specifies the type of the message body .
In order to know the length of the body , you have to look at the Content - Length header .
( If the transport type is UDP , then the Content - Length header is not mandatory .
It is , however , mandatory for TCP ) .
One common use of the body is to encapsulate the media negotiation protocol within the SIP message .
That 's pretty much what you need to know in order to understand the basic structure of SIP .
It is rather straightforward , and anyone who is already familiar with protocols that have similar structure will feel right at home .
Of course , we still have to understand what this text means and what a SIP device should do with the messages it sends and receives .
Transport Types
By default , SIP messages are sent on port 5060 if they 're unencrypted .
Encrypted messages are sent over port 5061 .
One can specify a port other than the default within the SIP address and override this default value .
SIP mandates support for both UDP and TCP , but it can successfully operate on practically any transport type .
It defines different behavior per transport only when the characteristics of the specific transport require it to do so .
For example , UDP does not guarantee delivery , so SIP retransmits the messages .
In TCP , such retransmission is really unnecessary ( and confusing ) , so no one should retransmit a message .
For the most part , other than the transaction layer ( detailed in the next sub- section ) , almost no other component changes its behavior due to the transport .
In fact , because SIP operates hop - by - hop ( clients do not usually communicate directly , but rather use proxies along the signaling path to send and receive messages ) , each hop could change the transport type .
So a client may receive a message over TCP even if the original message was sent over UDP .
SIP 's transport type independence enables the possibility of defining new transport types that were not originally included when SIP itself was first defined .
For example , RFC 4158 is a very short RFC that defines SIP over SCTP .
For connection - based transports ( e.g. , TCP and SCTP ) , the state of the connections is maintained .
Connections are kept open and reused to save time and resources .
The recommendation is to keep a connection open for at least 32 seconds after the last message , but in practice it 's application - defined .
Because there is no defined limit for the number of different SIP messages that one can send on a connection , two devices such as proxies usually have one or very few connections between them .
NAT vs. VoIP
One of the main challenges that VoIP protocols have encountered , and SIP is no exception , is the existence of NAT devices .
NATs usually aggregate several IP addresses ( in many cases within a private network ) to a few external IP addresses , mapping different traffic from different IP addresses to different ports .
( This is a very simplistic description of NATs ; there are in fact several ways NATs can work , but this is a common one that 's easy to describe ) .
In order to map different addresses to IP and ports , NATs usually maintain a dynamic mapping table .
If traffic from 172.16.1.1 with port 5060 maps to a public IP address with port 10000 , the NAT will keep this mapping as long as it has a flow of packets from that address .
If the flow stops , the NAT will remove this mapping after a configurable amount of time to allow another internal IP and port to use the external IP and port combination .
VoIP 's problem arises because signaling protocols are as minimalistic as possible in terms of traffic .
In order to allow the rest of the world to locate a device , the device first registers by sending a REGISTER request .
A response from the registrar accepting this registration will usually tell the device that its registration is valid for a long time , most commonly an hour .
Now , suppose a NAT is located between the client and the server .
When the REGISTER request is sent , the NAT maps the device 's internal IP and port to an external one .
When the response is sent back , the NAT has the proper mapping to the original IP and port .
If the client does not send any packets to the server ( for example , does not make a call ) , the NAT may remove the mapping it created during the registration .
The outcome of this scenario is that incoming calls cannot reach the client .
The proxy server receiving the request to the registered client cannot reach the internal IP address without the NAT mapping .
It 's because of this NAT issue that RFC 5626 was introduced .
This RFC defines the techniques that a client can use to maintain the NAT mapping .
It introduces the concept of a flow that should be maintained by the registering client .
The client sends two empty lines ( carriage return and line feed , or CRLF ) on connection - oriented flow ( TCP and SCTP ) and expects to receive from the server a single empty line as a response .
For connection - less transports , the client maintains the flow by using STUN ( defined by RFC 5389 ) .

January 18th , 2010 • 100K , Controversies , The Industry
This post is for MLK Day .
It ’s also prompted by the coincidental approximate anniversary of RaceFail , which began in January of last year .
( Missed the fun ?
Google is your friend .
But here is a good place to start . )
For those who want the Twitter version , RaceFail was a several - months - long conversation about race in the context of science fiction and fantasy that sprawled across the blogosphere .
It involved several thousand participants and spawned several hundred essays — and it has n’t really ended yet , just slowed down .
But the initial outburst was very frank , and frequently very heated , and over the course of the whole thing a number of well - known or influential personalities in the field said things that revealed problematic assumptions / thinking about people of color , or race issues in general .
Hence the “ fail ” suffix .
Since then I ’ve been to lots of conventions and readings , chatted with other authors / editors / publishers on mailing lists and in person , and I ’ve started to notice changes that I attribute to RaceFail fallout .
First the personal : I suspect the increased awareness of the SFF zeitgeist re race issues has helped The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms get more attention , since it ’s an epic fantasy written by a writer of color , with a protagonist of color .
Ca n’t complain about that .
Also , I ’ve seen a number of conventions dedicate panels and programming tracks ( or in some cases the whole con ) to discussing race , and trying to attract more fans of color .
People are quicker to raise objections now when anthologies and awards purporting to survey the field underrepresent women and people of color ; and the usual silly defenses ( e.g. , “ Maybe there just are n’t any [ insert group ] writing good SFF ! ” ) do n’t fly as far .
Writers are thinking more about what they write , and the unexamined assumptions that might be in their work .
Readers are thinking more about why their bookshelves might contain an overabundance of white male authors and protagonists .
And back to the personal : I feel more comfortable being myself now than ever before , after more than 20 years as a fan and aspiring writer in this field .
Used to be I was the only brown face in the room at most SFF events and gatherings ; used to be even I thought this was normal , and that I was some kind of rarity — even though practically every other person of color I know , including family and significant others , was a fan of SFF in some form .
( One of the most powerful moments for me in RaceFail was when the participating fans of color decided to do a very informal roll call , and illustrated just how non-rare we were . )
Used to be I ground my teeth but kept silent when hearing fellow fans say asinine , bigoted things , because the whole room seemed to agree with them and I did n’t feel safe or brave enough to raise an objection .
Used to be I fended off half a dozen hands reaching out to touch my hair on my way through every dealers ’ room .
Used to be I considered SFF events work — necessary for the sake of my writing career , something to be grimly endured , not enjoyed .
For fun I went elsewhere .
And it used to be very noticeable that I could at least broach the subject of race in every other aspect of my life — academia , the counseling psych field , political activism of course , literature / art in general — but not in SFF .
The conversations would simply shut down , often thanks to respected personages / fans who would emphatically declare that there was no racism in the genre outside of a few unimportant loudmouths , and no need to discuss race since there was no racism , so let ’s move on to something interesting like quantum physics .
Now , suddenly , everyone ’s talking about race , and I cannot tell you how happy that makes me .
But here ’s the thing .
A lot of people I ’ve met in the past year — clarification ; a lot of white people — seem to think the “ fail ” part of Race Fail lay in the fact that it occurred at all .
It was too angry for anything productive to happen , they say ; there ’s a time and a place for such conversations but not now ; there ’s a way to have such conversations but not this .
The gist of the objections seem to lie in the belief that SFF could have , would have begun the changes that I ’ve experienced this year , even if RaceFail had never occurred .
The people involved could ’ve raised their objections in a calm and reasoned manner , at which point respectful conversations would have taken place , and the genre would ’ve listened .
We ’re all smart , progressive people .
We did n’t need RaceFail to make us change .
To which I say : bullshit .
If we did n’t need RaceFail , then why did it occur ?
The angry questions that it raised did n’t emerge from a vacuum ; they ’ve been here all along , and had in many cases been expressed already .
W. E. B. DuBois was one of the first black SFF writers , and his stories — written over a hundred years ago ( and one of which can be found now in the Dark Matter anthology ) asked these questions then .
I ’ve seen essays from Octavia Butler , Samuel Delany , Joanna Russ , and many others which directly addressed all of it , often in calm , reasoned language using the most delicate of tones .
These conversations have been taking place since long before I was born ( I ’m 37 ) .
So why have I not seen the SFF culture change significantly until 2009 — the year before we maybe make contact ?
Come on , we ’re supposed to be talking to aliens by now , and instead we ’ve only just started really talking to each other .
If reasoned conversation was all it took to trigger change , the transformations of RaceFail would ’ve happened a long time ago .
So here ’s what I think .
RaceFail was a good thing .
In fact , I think it was a necessary thing — not just for me and other writers / fans of color , but for the SFF field as a whole .
Bear with me ; I ’m going to have to put on my psychologist hat to explain this .
Some of you may have heard of Lewin ’s classic theory of change .
Paraphrasing broadly , Lewin posited that stable organizations / systems inherently resist significant change , mostly due to inertia .
They ’re frozen in place by the weight of their own history , the comfort of tradition , participants who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo , and so on .
So the only way to enact change in such a system is to destabilize it — unfreeze it .
Then quickly push through changes before a new state of stable equilibrium is reached and the system freezes again .
The way I see it , RaceFail was the big thaw for the SFF field .
Fans of color , and white fans who were tired of the old ways , literally heated things up with an outpouring of long - pent rage .
That fury was utterly necessary , because it shocked the whole genre enough to make it pay attention .
Without that , SFF would have remained resistant — frozen — against such radical ideas as why are all these futuristic stories full of white people , when they ’re already a minority on the planet now ?
and y’know , maybe erasing the brown people from your fantasy continent , or making them allegorical orcs , is a bad idea .
Like I said , these issues are not new .
Apropos of the US holiday today , in the 1960s Martin Luther King , Jr. understood full well how much power SFF has to influence the public consciousness , and how important it therefore was to fix the field ’s problems with race .
But that ’s how solidly frozen SFF has been : eyes locked on the stars , face turned resolutely forward , neck too stiff and eyes too glazed over to take even the briefest of self - assessing glances down at itself .
For fifty years .
Until RaceFail turned up the heat .
We ’re still in that warming period for now — still realizing the extent of the problem , cataloging the damage done , starting up preventative therapy for the future .
When the inevitable refreezing occurs , I have no idea what the new SFF will look like .
Browner , definitely .
A little more reflective and humble , hopefully .
I suspect it will both resemble other literary fields to a greater degree , and yet continue to subvert them as it should — because this is still the literature of ideas and myths , the subconscious made concrete .
We can not be “ normal ” and thrive .
But neither can we be as unique as the mastodon — another long - frozen creature that thawed out too late , and ended up as somebody ’s funky - tasting dinner .
Because that ’s the thing Lewin realized over the course of his research : cultures that do n’t go through this periodic unfreezing process ?
Die .
So I say , bring on the next * Fail .
I know , I know , it ’s painful — but so was the old system , and it ’s going to take a lot of work to fix that .
We ’ll know the system is ready to stabilize again when the * Fail debates stop happening .
This is n’t something we have to work toward ; it will happen organically , a natural part of the change process .
I , for one , ca n’t wait to see the result .
ETA : D’oh .
Fixed Delany ’s name .
Thanks , Jed Hartman .
I came across your work through your website and I also looked for you on Deviantart because I admired your talent and inspirational work .
I was surprised at the news I found when I was here .
I have two 7 year old daughters of my own and could not begin to fathom what it is to lose a child .
It 's every parents biggest fear .
I do n't know any details of what has happened and I do n't know what my words could possibly do to help take the pain away ... but I look at death of a close loved one this way .
I ask myself , what would the person tell me if they were right next to me and see my suffer and crying ?
Would they let me suffer in pain and agony ?
Or would they want their life to be remembered and celebrated ?
My heart and prayers go out to you and your family .
My god give the guidance and strength to focus and overcome this great loss .
I know
you will pull through .

Like the disturbed genius in Hollywood ’s “ A Beautiful Mind , ” Walter K. Sartory was a brilliant mathematician with a grave mental illness .
It made him the perfect victim .
Sartory worked for 30 years at Tennessee ’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory , which was built in secret for the atomic bomb project and became America ’s largest science and energy lab .
Sartory ’s work on nuclear weapons remains classified , but he published pioneering papers on reactor design , medical centrifuges and other subjects .
He won a top award at the lab and held three patents .
“ You only played chess with Walt two or three times because you were always humiliated , ” said John Eveleigh , a British biochemist who worked at Sartory ’s side .
“ And I played chess for Oxford , so I was n’t an amateur . ”
Sartory was treated most of his life for paranoid schizophrenia .
He believed the CIA trained ants to spy on him .
He battled social phobias so acute that he turned down a high - paying job rather than submit to an interview .
When Sartory retired in 1992 , he shut himself in a tiny apartment and used algorithms to invest on Wall Street .
The savant built a $ 14 - million portfolio before the stock market crashed last year , records show .
With therapy and new medicine , he began to travel .
He moved to Hebron in March 2008 to be near the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport .
He had no immediate family and knew no one in the area .
Then last February , old friends phoned police to say the 73 - year - old recluse had vanished .
Their plea for help came too late .
Sartory had been abducted , drugged and duct - taped to a chair , police later concluded .
He surrendered his financial accounts but died after he was denied the medicine that kept his panic attacks at bay .
His body was stuffed in a trash can , doused with gasoline and burned .
“ We all struggle to have faith in mankind , ” said Linda Tally Smith , the commonwealth ’s attorney who will prosecute the case .
“ To think a man who was already paranoid , who lived his whole life in fear of others , could fall prey to something so horrific is heartbreaking . ”
Exploitation of the elderly , and of the mentally ill , is a sad but growing trend .
Prosecution is also more common thanks to surveillance cameras and other new tools .
But few cases present such a grim mix of pulp fiction and Greek tragedy as the lonely death of Walter Sartory .
Last January , Sartory spent three days visiting Therese “ Terri ” Davis , 60 , in Binghamton , N.Y .
They had met on an Internet site for people with personality disorders .
This was their first date .
“ He was so shy , so quiet , ” she recalled .
“ We held hands .
I ’m pretty sure he never held anybody else ’s hand before . ”
Sartory told her that government agents sometimes tampered with his car .
“ And when we went out to eat , he thought the waitress was laughing at him .
I could n’t get him to smile . ”
Sartory also complained of a pushy housekeeper back home named Willa Blanc .
At 47 , she wore big blond wigs and rhinestone - encrusted fake fingernails , even when cleaning homes , and drove a candy - apple red 2007 Corvette .
Blanc worked in Sartory ’s neighborhood and offered to clean his house in mid-2008 .
He declined , but she kept bothering him , he said .
Sartory also complained about Blanc to Ann Cartee in Sterling , Va .
They had met in an Internet mental health forum years before and spent hours together on the phone nearly every day .
“ He said Blanc would knock on his door , barge in , and before you know it , she was there for two hours , ” Cartee recalled .
“ He did n’t know how to get her to leave . ”
When Sartory returned from Binghamton , he found that Blanc and her 27 - year - old son , Louis Wilkinson , had cleared his driveway of snow .
Blanc handed Sartory mail , including financial statements , that she had taken from his mailbox .
Less than a month later , on Feb. 26 , Cartee and her husband , Robert , called the Boone County Sheriff ’s Department in Kentucky to say their friend had not answered phone calls or responded to e-mails in 10 days .
The Cartees also sent police several of Sartory ’s recent e-mails .
In one , he wrote that he had changed his locks in case Blanc had stolen a copy of his house key .
“ I do not trust her , ” Sartory wrote .
“ I might be merely paranoid , but I suspect she might be running some sort of confidence racket .
Or she might be casing my house to see if it is worth robbing . ”
Deputies checked Sartory ’s beige bungalow several times .
But the shades were drawn , as usual , and nothing seemed amiss .
They left notes under the door .
Then , on March 4 , deputies noticed the garage door was unlocked and entered the house through there .
They discovered that the scientist had converted his living room into a monitoring station for extra-terrestrial life :
Six powerful computers were running a program that analyzed radio signals from outer space .
Deputies found Sartory ’s schedules .
He set precise times to brush his teeth , get dressed and so on , and then checked off each completed task .
In the kitchen , they found the prescription pills Sartory took daily to ward off psychotic episodes .
He would not have left home without them .
Neighbors mentioned seeing a van from the cleaning service Molly Maids in Sartory ’s driveway .
Company officials disclosed that Blanc , who sometimes worked for them , told them that she and Sartory “ would be traveling ” indefinitely .
On March 10 , Sheriff ’s Chief Det. Coy Cox stopped at Blanc ’s two - story brick home in nearby Union , Ky .
She assured him she had just seen Sartory in a grocery store and promised to call when she heard from him .
The next day , Cox found a letter in Sartory ’s mailbox from Fidelity Investments .
The detective faxed a subpoena to Fidelity , which informed him that Blanc had added her name to Sartory ’s brokerage account .
Cox raced back to Blanc to demand an explanation .
This time , she said she had passed Sartory in his silver Prius .
“ I said , ‘ That ’s not what you told me before , ’ ” Cox recalled .
“ She was totally cool , did n’t blink an eye .
She said , ‘ Really ?
Well , he ’s fine .
He ’s probably home now . ’ ”
As Cox drove away , Blanc packed a bag and fled with her son .
Police were ready .
Surveillance teams shadowed the pair as they changed hotels and cars three times in two days and shuffled cellphones to avoid being traced .
The trackers lost them in Cincinnati traffic .
But other clues quickly emerged .
Cox interviewed Blanc ’s husband , an electronics engineer .
He said she had been his maid before they married .
But she emptied his financial accounts , he said , and ran up $ 500,000 in debts .
The mortgage company foreclosed on their home in mid-February , the engineer added .
That was just before Sartory disappeared .
The engineer also disclosed that Blanc had totaled his Chevrolet Trailblazer on Feb. 22 .
She had been on her way to rural Indiana to visit a friend with whom she liked to gamble , he said .
Cox drove to Indiana .
Police told him Blanc was hauling a large plastic trash barrel when she crashed the SUV .
She told police at the scene that the 50 - gallon can contained firewood .
The lid was fastened with bungee cord , and no one bothered to check .
She insisted that the tow - truck driver return the wrecked SUV , barrel and all , to Kentucky .
Once there , police say , Blanc and her son moved the trash barrel to a rented Dodge van and drove back to Indiana .
Blanc had stopped shortly before the accident to gamble at the Argosy , a riverboat casino on the Ohio River .
Now , on her second trip with the barrel , she stopped at another gaming hall .
“ They played bingo until it got dark , ” Cox said .
Then they drove to her friend ’s farmhouse about 40 miles southwest of Indianapolis .
The farmhouse owner , Dwayne Lively , later told police that Blanc and her son drove up but did not stay .
But Lively ’s daughter , Amanda , pulled up just as detectives were leaving and gave a more alarming story .
“ She said Willa Blanc just showed up and said she had a large dog in the trash can , and paid her dad $ 1,000 to help them burn it , ” prosecutor Smith said .
“ They took all night to do it .
This was even weirder than we were imagining . ”
Blanc ’s son “ got third - degree burns from churning the fire , ” said his lawyer , Jason Gilbert , a public defender .
Blanc , he added , “ did n’t sleep for 48 to 72 hours during this period .
She was manic . ”
Police found charred human remains , a pair of burned metal - rim glasses , and steel tread from incinerated tires scattered in the nearby Morgan - Monroe State Forest .
Arrest warrants were issued for Blanc and Wilkinson .
Police spotted Blanc ’s Corvette at a Red Roof Inn early the next day in nearby Sharonville , Ohio , and arrested them both .
Blanc and Wilkinson have pleaded not guilty to charges including murder , kidnapping , theft and abuse of a corpse .
They are being held in lieu of $ 10 - million bail each in the Boone County jail .
After his arrest , Wilkinson told Cox that he was “ tired of his mother controlling his life ” and of being her “ slave . ”
He gave two videotaped statements .
The grisly details spilled out at subsequent court hearings .
Wilkinson lived in the basement of the house his mother and her husband shared .
He had discovered Sartory confined there on Feb. 16 or 17 , he said .
The elderly man ’s hands and feet were taped to a chair , and tape covered his mouth .
He appeared drugged .
Wilkinson said his mother ordered him to stay in the basement and locked the door .
He said he pulled the tape from Sartory ’s mouth , and the captive asked if the “ terrorist had been paid ” and pleaded to be set free .
Denied his pills for several days , Sartory repeatedly vomited and struggled to breathe .
Wilkinson said he tried to revive him three times with mouth - to - mouth resuscitation , but never called 911 .
Wilkinson told detectives he carried Sartory “ like a baby ” up the stairs at one point to get him medical help , but his mother ordered him to stop .
It ’s not clear when Sartory died , but Wilkinson said they stored the body in the trash can for two days in the garage .
Before Sartory died , police say , he gave Blanc his computer passwords and a power of attorney granting control over his bank and brokerage accounts .
He also appeared to revise his will to leave Blanc the bulk of his fortune , although police believe the document is forged .
Blanc withdrew $ 210,000 from Sartory ’s account , the maximum available , before her arrest and was due to get $ 1.3 million more the day Cox sent his subpoena and Fidelity stopped the transfer .
Cox also checked at the Chevrolet dealership where the SUV had been towed after the accident .
A salesman said Blanc had erupted in fury when she learned that someone already had bought a new , top - of - the - line Corvette ZR1 that she wanted .
The car cost more than $ 100,000 .
“ She became very irritated , very angry , ” Cox said .
“ She told them she was about to get $ 7.5 million in cash . ”
When police searched her home , he said , they found a book with a title like “ How to Choose Your Prey ” in her safe .
“ In her mind , he was perfect , ” Cox said .
“ She ’s tapped out .
He has lots of money .
He does n’t know anybody .
He lives behind closed doors .
He ’s trying to communicate with ET .
Who would miss him ? ”
At an hourlong court hearing Dec. 2 , Wilkinson stared at the floor , never looking at his mother .
She fidgeted and glared at reporters through sparkling Dolce & Gabbana designer glasses above her black - and - white prison stripes .
Smith said she will seek the death penalty for Blanc when the case goes to trial , probably in the summer .
Joanne Lynch , a public defender who represents Blanc , said the case is in a preliminary stage and the facts are still undetermined .
Boone County Circuit Judge Anthony W. Frohlich has scheduled a hearing today to determine whether Wilkinson is mentally competent to stand trial .
His lawyers also will seek to have his confession tossed out .
Sartory ’s last known act was to send two dozen red roses on Valentine ’s Day to Terri Davis , the woman he visited in Binghamton .
“ The flowers were so beautiful , ” she said .
“ I tried calling him and calling him and calling him .
And then I heard the news .
And I cried , and I cried , and I cried . ”

Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and her daughter Bristol have issued a statement on Facebook blasting Fox ’s TV network for running a show that makes fun of individuals living with Down ’s Syndrome .
On Sunday ’s Family Guy , the character Chris Griffin dates a woman suffering from Down ’s Syndrome .
The woman says her mother was the former governor of Alaska , suggesting she ’s making fun of Palin ’s youngest son , Trig , who has the condition .

“ My dad ’s an accountant , and my mom ’s the former governor of Alaska , ” the mentally challenged character quipped .
In a Facebook statement , Sarah Palin called “ yesterday ’s Fox show ” “ another kick in the gut , ” and asked , “ when is enough , enough ? ”
She posted a statement allegedly written by her daughter , Bristol .
“ When you ’re the son or daughter of a public figure , you have to develop thick skin .
My siblings and I all have that , but insults directed at our youngest brother hurt too much for us to remain silent .
People with special needs face challenges that many of us will never confront , and yet they are some of the kindest and most loving people you ’ll ever meet .
Their lives are difficult enough as it is , so why would anyone want to make their lives more difficult by mocking them ?
As a culture , should n’t we be more compassionate to innocent people – especially those who are less fortunate ?
Should n’t we be willing to say that some things just are not funny ?
Are there any limits to what some people will do or say in regards to my little brother or others in the special needs community ?
If the writers of a particularly pathetic cartoon show thought they were being clever in mocking my brother and my family yesterday , they failed .
All they proved is that they ’re heartless jerks . ”
The show also involves an extended song about a “ Down Syndrome ” girl .

Death toll rises to 300 in Chile
Update : Tsunami warning canceled
Update : Expert says Hawaii ‘ dodged a bullet ’
Update : Initial predictions may have overestimated tsunami size
Update : Experts say tsunami becoming more powerful at it hits
Two million people have been affected by the massive earthquake that struck central Chile on Saturday , said President Michelle Bachelet in a statement Saturday .

Bachelet said in a television address that forces of nature were testing the country .
“ And once again they ’ve put to the test our ability to deal with adversity and get back on our feet , ” she said .
“ And we are examining every way to restore all the basic services in the country .
But there ’s still a lot to do . ”
The tsunami that struck Hawaii stirred up sediment and tossed around some waves , but did no apparent damage , according to reports since it struck late Saturday afternoon .
More than 100,000 people were evacuated from areas that officials said would face 14 - ft. high waves , but instead was hit by waves no higher than 5.5 feet .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center canceled their tsunami warning soon after .
ADVERTISEMENT
Hawaii “ dodged a bullet , ” said Gerard Fryer , a geophysicist with the center , suggesting that Hawaii escaped the large - scale destruction in Chile , where an 8.8 - magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami to crash into the coast , killing at least 300 people .
Asked about the difference the center ’s failure to accurately predict the size of the tsunami , Fryer said the center would be looking into it .
“ It ’s been a long day , ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
An AFP correspondent said buildings in the capital “ shook like jelly ” .
Scientists still expect the quake to cause more tsunamis across the Pacific ocean , but in Hawaii , there were no immediate reports of widespread damage , injuries or deaths in the U.S. or in the Pacific islands .

“ We can breathe a sigh of relief , ” one of the center ’s directors said .
“ I think we saw a very good roll out of our program . ”
The tsunami was causing a series of surges that were about 20 minutes apart , and the waves arrived later and smaller than originally predicted .
The highest wave measured 5.5 feet ( 1.7 meters ) high , while Maui saw some as high as 2 meters ( 6.5 feet ) .
Despite the big wave ’s no -show , officials said , the tsunami warning gave Hawaii residents good practice for the real deal .
“ We know the system works now because we had a test in a real - life situation , ” said Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi .

Sirens blared in French Polynesia to warn residents to find higher ground as a tsunami watch went into effect across the Pacific ’s “ Ring of Fire ” after the 8.8 - magnitude quake in Chile , which left at least 122 people dead .
Nations along an arc stretching from New Zealand to Japan implemented emergency plans that were beefed up after the Indian Ocean disaster of 2004 , when a series of immensely destructive tsunamis killed more than 220,000 .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center , set up by Pacific governments after a tsunami unleashed by a deadly 9.5 magnitude earthquake in Chile in 1960 , warned of possible “ widespread damage ” as outsized waves raced across the ocean .
“ We could be looking at an all - day event , ” US National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Lau told AFP in Washington .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It will stop once it hits the land masses on the other side of the Pacific , in Asia .
The wave is spread out across the entire body of water in the Pacific . ”
Authorities in the US state of Hawaii , where the warning centre is based , said residents would shortly start hearing tsunami sirens .
“ If you live anywhere in the evacuation zone , you have to evacuate , ” Oahu Emergency Management Department John Cummings said .
“ We ’re going to treat this as a destructive - type tsunami . ”
One tsunami measuring 7.7 feet ( 2.34 meters ) slammed into Talcahuano , one of about 11 coastal towns in Chile hit by the wave , according to the Pacific centre .
There was no immediate word of casualties .

Chile ’s remote Robinson Crusoe Island , some 700 kilometres ( 430 miles ) from the mainland , was also smashed by a huge wave , while President Michelle Bachelet announced a partial evacuation of Easter Island .
The pan-Pacific tsunami warning applied also to Central America , and authorities as far afield as Russia ’s Sakhalin island were monitoring the potential for tidal trouble .
In the tourist paradise of French Polynesia , the local government said the first waves were expected to reach the Gambier archipelago imminently .
Sirens and loudspeaker announcements woke up residents in the middle of the night .
New Zealand warned of a wall of water up to three metres ( 10 feet ) high potentially hitting some of its outlying islands and part of the South Island , as the country ’s National Crisis Management Centre went on alert .
The civil defence ministry said the tsunami could strike the country ’s east coast from 7:05 am Sunday ( 1805 GMT Saturday ) .

The Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre warned of the “ possibility of dangerous waves , strong ocean currents and foreshore flooding ” along the coast between Sydney and Brisbane .
Authorities in Indonesia and Taiwan said they were monitoring , while Philippine officials started planning for possible evacuations .
Jake Phillips , a forecaster with Australia ’s Bureau of Meteorology , played down the risk of major flooding in heavily populated coastal areas .
“ But there is a marine threat and that would include anyone out boating or rock fishermen , ” he said .

Memories are still raw in Samoa , American Samoa and Tonga of a terrifying tsunami that trashed entire villages in September , leaving 184 dead .
The Hawaii operation manages a network of early - warning electronic buoys strung across the Pacific Ocean .
But the September waves came so suddenly as to give little time for escape .
A week later , a rapid succession of quakes off Vanuatu created panic across the South Pacific .
The region is in the middle of the “ Ring of Fire ” , a belt of seismic fury responsible for most of the world ’s tremors and volcanoes .
Any tsunami will show up in Australia from about 8:15 am on Sunday ( 2115 GMT Saturday ) , officials said .

Seismic waves could reach the east coast of Japan around noon Sunday ( 0300 GMT ) , according to the country ’s meteorological agency .
“ We would like people to be fully on alert for related information , ” agency official Yasuo Sekita told a hastily arranged news conference , as Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama ordered his government to be ready for relief work .

Letter from Bordentown : Able Was I Ere I Saw ... New Jersey ? by Eric A. Powell
Unearthing the North American refuge of an exiled Bonaparte

Driving north on Park Street out of Bordentown , New Jersey ( population 3,953 ) , I catch glimpses of the Delaware River on the left , beyond thick stands of trees .
Not quite a mile out of town , the biggest cranberry processing plant in the Ocean Spray empire spreads out to the right .
Across the road is the 150 - acre campus of the Society of the Divine Word , a retirement community for Catholic missionary priests .
The campus is on the edge of a vast Native American site known today as the Abbott Farm National Landmark .
Archaeological investigations in the area since the late 19th century have shown that beginning 8,000 years ago this section of the Delaware has been a magnet for settlement .
A little north is one of the largest known Middle Woodland period ( A.D. 1�1000 ) villages on the East Coast .
But as I turn into Divine Word , a two - story , early - 19th - century house is a reminder that the Middle Woodland is n't the only time period that interests archaeologists in these parts .
Veit and his team found pieces of marble , likely from a mantle , among the ruins of the first mansion at Point Breeze .
( Courtesy Richard Veit ) Veit and his team found pieces of marble , likely from a mantle , among the ruins of the first mansion at Point Breeze .
( Courtesy Richard Veit )
The house was once part of the 1,800 - acre estate of Point Breeze , owned by the French Count de Survilliers from 1816 to 1844 .
His estate manager lived in this house , which was standing here on January 4 , 1820 , perhaps the most dramatic night in Bordentown 's history .
That night , the count arrived in his carriage from Trenton to a horrific sight .
His mansion , which he had spent many thousands of dollars building and decorating according to the latest European fashions , was engulfed in flames .
The greatest private art collection in North America was in danger of going up in smoke .
Just as he reached the mansion , the roof collapsed , but the count must have been heartened by the sight of dozens of Bordentown locals rescuing paintings , furniture , jewels , books , and anything else they could carry .
That night , the youth of Bordentown even formed a guard to protect the count 's belongings .
Miraculously , all of his art was saved , and not a single valuable was stolen .
One of the paintings the residents of Bordentown probably rescued was Napoleon Crossing the Alps at the Great St. Bernard ( 1815 ) , painted by Jacques - Louis David , which today hangs in the Ch�teau de Malmaison outside Paris .
This majestic painting , showing a heroic Napoleon leading his troops over the Alps in 1800 , was in the count 's collection .
It had a special place in his heart , since it is one of the most famous depictions of his younger brother .
For as everyone from Bordentown knew , the Count de Survilliers was just a minor title of Joseph Bonaparte , former king of both Naples and Spain , now in exile and reduced in status to an ordinary , if extraordinarily wealthy , resident of the state of New Jersey .
The remains of Joseph Bonaparte 's mansion are now the focus of archaeologists , led by Richard Veit of Monmouth University , who have excavated at Point Breeze for the past three years .
After driving onto the sleepy Divine Word campus , I see Veit and his crew at work in a shallow trench near the banks of the Delaware .
To reach them I have to walk past a vegetable garden carefully tended by retired priests , who are some of the most enthusiastic supporters of Point Breeze archaeology .
Slender and gray - haired , the soft - spoken Veit is examining a piece of pottery that has just been excavated by his Monmouth students .
It is among some 20,000 artifacts found so far .
" We 're digging an outbuilding , " he says , and points to an expanse of grass closer to the river .
" That 's where Joseph 's house was . "
After three years of working at Point Breeze , Veit is comfortable calling the king by his first name .

Note : Journaling is available in MongoDB v1.8 + and is the default in v2.0 .
This post is pretty old .
Update ( 3/16/2011 ) : MongoDB v1.8 includes journaling
Update ( 4/9/2010 ) : real time replication and blocking for replication are implemented in v1.6
We get lots of questions about why MongoDB does n’t have full single server durability , and there are many people that think this is a major problem .
We wanted to shed some light on why we have n’t done single server durability , what our suggestions are , and our future plans .
To start , there are some very practical reasons why we think single server durability is overvalued .
First , there are many scenarios in which that server loses all its data no matter what .
If there is water damage , fire , some hardware problems , etc … no matter how durable the software is , data can be lost .
Yes - there are ways to mitigate some of these , but those add another layer of complexity , that has to be tested , proofed , and adds more variables which can fail .
In the real world , traditional durability often is n’t even done correctly .
If you are using a DBMS that uses a transaction log for durability , you either have to turn off hardware buffering or have a battery backed RAID controller .
Without hardware buffering , transaction logs are very slow .
Battery backed raid controllers will work well , but you have to really have one .
With the move towards the cloud and outsourced hosting , custom hardware is not always an option .
Requirements for web applications are also changing .
99.99 % uptime is no longer the goal , people want 100 % uptime as much as possible .
If you have durability through a transaction log , then you have to replay it to come back up .
If you have a master and slave in the same data center and you lose power , both will have to recover which could take 5 - 30 minutes . [ 1 ]
Another feature of new non-relational databases is horizontal scalability .
While MongoDB ’s auto - sharding is still in Alpha , we still feel this is a core component .
With horizontal scalability comes many servers .
If you have a 100 node cluster , worrying about every machine is a liability .
If a machine goes down in the middle of the night , you want the system to recover as fast as possible , without human intervention .
Given that , and that a high percentage of failures are hardware , the best thing is to just mark that server as inactive , and ignore it until someone can look at it easily ( could be hours or days ) .
Given all this , we ’re not saying durability is n’t important , we just think that single server durability is n’t the best way to get true durability .
We think the right path to durability is replication ( local and remote ) and snapshotting .
That ’s why we ’ve spent so much time making replication fast and easy and work over wide area networks in MongoDB .
We are currently planning many more enhancements to replication to make it better .
psuedo real - time with optional blocking for writes until on multiple servers
replica sets instead of replica pairs
easier to create new slaves with large data sets
Now - there are definitely some cases where single server durability is the best option .
It is on our road map , its just not on the short list right now .
We know what we want to do and how we want to do it , it ’s just a matter of code :)

Some databases such as CouchDB use an append only model that allows for instantaneous restarts .
However , this type of design usually requires compaction routines to be run periodically , so can be costly in high update scenarios .
Ron Paul wins CPAC straw poll
Texas Rep. Ron Paul won the 2010 CPAC straw poll tonight , a victory that will further energize his already enthusiastic supporters but will have little effect on the coming presidential contest .
Paul , who ran for president in 2008 , took 31 percent of the vote .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had won the past three CPAC straw polls but placed second this time with 22 percent .
Romney is considered the current frontrunner for the 2012 nod .
No other candidate scored in double digits .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who did not speak at CPAC , took third place with seven percent .
( Full results are below . )
Be careful not to read too much -- or much at all -- into these results .
Paul 's supporters are loyal and loud but not , ultimately , that large a group as proven by the fact that he did not win a single primary or caucus in 2008 .
Last November , Mr. Wilkes was described as “ co-conspirator No. 1 ” in a plea agreement signed by Representative Randy Cunningham , a California Republican on the House Appropriations Committee .
In the plea deal , Mr. Cunningham admitted accepting more than $ 2.4 million in cash and gifts from Mr. Wilkes and other contractors .
Another defense contractor , Mitchell J. Wade , pleaded guilty to paying some of the bribes .
Mr. Wilkes could also figure in a related federal investigation into the House Appropriations Committee .
The inquiry has focused on ties between Mr. Lowery , who left Congress and became a lobbyist , and Representative Jerry Lewis , a California Republican who is the chairman of the committee and the former chairman of its Defense Subcommittee .
Speaking publicly for the first time since Mr. Cunningham ’s plea agreement , Mr. Wilkes said in recent interviews that he had done nothing wrong and did not believe that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Lowery had broken the law .
Mr. Wilkes , who has not been charged in the Cunningham case , has refused prosecutors ’ appeals to plead guilty .
But Mr. Wilkes acknowledged that he was a willing participant in what he characterized as a “ cutthroat ” system in which campaign contributions were a prerequisite for federal contracts .
“ I attempted to get help and advice from people who could show me the way to do it right , ” Mr. Wilkes said .
“ I played by their rules , and I played to win . ”
Mr. Wilkes said he was speaking now to rebut false assertions about him by prosecutors and the news media .
While it is unknown whether his account is complete and it is impossible to verify his recollections of certain conversations , many aspects of his story were confirmed by federal records , other documents and interviews with people involved in the events he described .

We agree , Rob .
Mathematical completeness is necessary , though not sufficient .
As you say , " It is necessary , that there also be a demonstrable , one - to - one correspondence , between ' every ' physical entity / property , and each mathematical symbol , relevant to the physical phenomenon being described . "
A mathematically complete theory , then , is one that guarantees measured correspondence between symbol and physical result .

“ It ’s a bit like a romantic relationship , ” says Christopher Isham , describing his collaboration with Andreas Döring .
Certainly the two physicists can claim to share their own unique understanding of the world , as many in love do .
Together they are proposing a radical new way to view reality — one that takes you into a new " mathematical universe " where notions of " truth " and " falsehood " no longer apply , but where the paradoxes of quantum mechanics suddenly make sense .
Their journey together began five years ago .
In September 2004 , Isham was already a prominent name in theoretical physics , researching deep conceptual questions at Imperial College in London .
He was wrestling with some of the most profound mysteries of modern physics , including the quest for a theory that unifies general relativity with quantum mechanics .
His work caught the attention of Döring , then still a PhD student at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe - University in Frankfurt , Germany .
Specifically , Isham and a few like - minded colleagues were attempting to use , a well - developed mathematical apparatus that had rarely been used in physics , to build a quantum theory of the universe .
( See " Topos or Not Topos . " )
Döring ’s first e-mail was typical of a tentative young suitor — he expressed his admiration and asked for a " date . "
Or rather , he asked Isham if there was a chance that he could come to Imperial and work with him .
Isham remembers liking Döring right from the start .
" I was very impressed with him , both as a person and a researcher , " he says .
" He ’s obviously very bright , but he ’s also a nice person .
I put a lot of stock in a person ’s personality .
" The young scientist came to London and started working at Imperial a year later , in December 2005 .
The two began meeting weekly , and a collaboration into topos theory was underway .
Isham and Döring ’s working relationship was not without obstacles , however .
Isham suffers from a neurological disease and needs a cane to walk , so he prefers to work from his home in London when possible .
So Döring would swing by Isham ’s apartment for intense brainstorming sessions that begin with tea and chatter before turning to physics .
Döring and Isham ’s partnership has even inspired a movie .
In 2007 , filmmaker Ilian Metev shot a documentary of the partners at work , called .
" What attracted me to their work was a certain creative , almost electrifying energy with which their dialogue of ideas would relentlessly grow , " Metev says .
In contrast to Isham and Döring ’s dynamic partnership , the duo are working to bring together two of the biggest theories in physics that have been notoriously hard to unite .
General relativity , which explains the interactions of cosmic bodies , and quantum mechanics , which defines interactions at the subatomic level , have both proven successful at their separate ends of the universe , the very large and the very small .
But the two theories have so far refused to mesh with each other .
A unified theory , the so - called Holy Grail of modern physics , would either meld the two together or replace them with something that works at both extremes .
For more than a dozen years now , Isham has been convinced that topos theory might provide the answer .
Do n’t confuse one type of theory with another , though .
Unlike general relativity or quantum mechanics , topos theory is n’t a theory aboutthe universe works .
Instead , it helps Isham and his allies think about the world using a completely different form of logic — and even different conceptions of truth .
" What Andreas and I have been arguing is that we need to change mathematics itself to solve this problem , " I sham says .
" I do n’t mean to find a different branch of mathematics .
I mean actually change mathematics , the whole whack , completely .
" Reconstructing the rules of logic sounds mind - bending — and it is .
But quantum theory wreaks havoc with logic at the best of times .
For example , it suggests that the universe is n’t the solid construct it seems but actually an array of possibilities collapsed into a single reality by the act of observation .
So maybe mind - bending concepts are exactly what ’s called for .
According to quantum mechanics , you cannot ask what the properties of a quantum particle are before it is measured .
Prior to observation , the particle exists in a superposition of multiple contradictory states .
There ’s no simple yes / no or true / false answer to questions about the state of the particle .
Topos theory may be able to incorporate this murky quantum logic .
It underlies the laws of mathematics and logic that we use , and is more fundamental than either , the physicists argue .
Each topos describes a different " mathematical universe , " with its own mathematical constructions and logic .
And each topos can be used as a different lens through which to view the world , depending on requirements .
Isham and colleagues have identified a topos in which quantum theory appears to make logical sense — as long as you embrace a new type of logic , in which " true " and " false " are no longer your only options .
There are now multiple shades in between .
A different topos recreates classical reality with its firm " yes " and " no " answers .
Isham and Döring believe that every physical system , from atomic particles to the universe as a whole , can be viewed through different topoi .
"
In a sense , using a toposchanging the whole of mathematics , " says Döring .
" One chooses a ’ mathematical universe ’ in which to argue .
" The work has won fans .
" It ’s really quite wonderful , " says John Baez , a physicist at the University of California , Riverside .
So how do you keep grounded , when you spend your days rewriting reality ?
It helps that Isham ’s background was originally in electrical engineering .
" It ’s very easy to get seduced , " I sham says .
" The mathematics is very intriguing , but we have to keep in mind that we ’re working on theoretical physics .
" Staying focused on the ultimate purpose of your intellectual endeavor is one of the many lessons that mathematician Döring has learned from working with Isham , who often reminds him to " think like a physicist .
" Döring now lectures at Oxford University , UK , and shares these lessons with his students .
His move makes those weekly meetings with Isham in London harder .
" I strongly hope to keep up the collaboration with Chris in some form , even though the style will surely change , " Döring says .
In other words , it ’s not a breakup .
It ’s the beginning of a long - distance relationship .

Aeration for Home Brewing Beer
This week we look at how to enhance your home brewed beers using a technique called aeration .
Aeration with oxygen is very important for fermenting beer , but needs to be applied at the right time to brew good beer .
Let ’s take a look at aeration and how important it is for brewing great beer at home .
Aeration Explained
Lets start with some basic definitions .
Aeration is the injection of oxygen into the wort during the brewing process , usually after boiling and cooling cooling and just prior to fermentation .
The act of boiling wort forces most of the oxygen out of solution .
Unfortunately , as we covered in our article on fermentation and the yeast life cycle , yeast requires a great deal of oxygen during the “ lag phase ” when it is rapidly multiplying in the wort .
Without enough oxygen , the yeast will fail to reproduce sufficiently , leaving an incomplete fermentation .
Before we get to how to best add more oxygen , lets look at two other important terms .
Another term you may hear is “ hot side aeration ” , which refers to exessive splashing or aeration of the wort during the boil or before we ’ve had a chance to cool the wort down .
The problem with adding oxygen while the wort is hot is that it can oxidize the melanoidins in your beer leading to a stale flavor .
A study by the late George Fix suggests that hot side aeration can occur at temperatures as low as 86 F ( which is pretty low ! ) , so it is important to cool your wort before aerating it .
A third term , called oxidation is closely related to the first two .
Oxidation occurs when you add oxygen after the lag phase of yeast growth ( i.e. later in fermentation , or after the beer has fermented ) .
In this case , the effect is exactly what is seen when you left your pony keg at college out for a few days with an air pump on it .
The air oxidizes the finished beer , leaving a strong stale flavor .
So you clearly do n’t want to introduce oxygen in your beer after lag fermentation has started .
Aerating your Wort
So far we ’ve learned that hot side aeration is bad , oxidation is bad , but proper aeration of the cooled wort is good .
Now lets look at how to put this information to good use in our beer .
Yeast needs between 8 and 10 parts per million ( ppm ) of oxygen to properly reproduce in the lag phase .
A level of 8 ppm is achievable using air alone ( which is 21 % oxygen ) , but achieving a higher level requires a tank of pure oxygen .
The best time to aerate your wort is as soon as it is cool .
Ideally this can be done during transfer to the fermenter or immediately after transfer to the fermenter .
If you aerate after pitching your wort , do not aerate for long as the lag phase generally starts withing a few hours of pitching the wort .
There are three basic methods for aerating wort :
Splashing – Splashing the wort around in the fermenter can actually add some oxygen to the solution .
You can achieve the same effect by splashing the wort around during transfer – for example using a cap at the end of the siphon that splashes the wort out the side a bit .
While splashing will not achieve as high an oxygen content as injection , it is a good option for those on a limited budget .
Splashing is far superior to no aeration at all .

Splashing is far superior to no aeration at all .
Agitation – Agitation is done by stirring rapidly with a spoon , whisking the wort around with a wisk or rocking the entire fermenter .
Generally a sterilized whisk is best if you have open access to the wort .
Whisk the beer vigorously for several minutes before adding your yeast .
Agitation is a step above splashing , as it generally gets more oxygen into the solution .

Injection –
There are many ways to inject air or oxygen directly into the wort .
The simplest setup involves using an inexpensive aquarium pump with a inline sterile filter .
Note that the filter is needed to prevent bacteria and other organisms from being drawn in with the air .
I also recommend using some kind of carbonation stone or aeration stone at the end of the tube to help diffuse the air .
Care must be taken to sanitize the stone and tube before using it .
A more elaborate injection system would use an actual oxygen bottle and regulator to inject oxygen .
However , even the relatively cheap aquarium pump injection system can achieve the 8 ppm ideal aeration level needed for your wort .
For many years , I used the splashing / agitation system , but for less than $ 25 you can move up to an aquarium pump , filter and carbonation stone and significantly improve the fermentation of your beer .
I will add a final note – do n’t forget the use of a properly sized yeast starter , for without a starter you still risk poor yeast production and subsequent problems in your beer .

Linux tools
Here are a few application for Linux and other unices written in plain C .
Dynamic search in console
tgz · git · man
The selector command is a real - time interactive pattern matcher in console .
It can be used to visit efficiently files in general , and shell history in particular .
For the latter , contrary to what the readline C-r does , it does not show only one entry at a time , but restricts in real time the display to all the entries matching the pattern .
You can at any time select one , which will be injected in the input buffer of the current tty .
Its aims are somehow similar to those of dmenu , but it is a pure tty command that can be used in console .
You can read the selector man page for more information .
You can clone the repository with
git clone https://fleuret.org/git/selector/
It is general enough to be used with any shell , but was written for and tested with bash , and it has a short - cut option -- bash , which is just equivalent to a bunch of other flags .
A bash - specific script is provided , so you just have to add to your ~/. bashrc
source bash - selector.sh -- hist --cd
This will install a M-r bindings for a super history search , redefine the cd command to keep an history of the directories you visit , and install a key - bindings M-c to search it .
As far as I know , this software works on Linux amd64 , Linux i386 , Linux ARM , MacOS , and FreeBSD 8.0 .
The -v option is broken on the latter , since TIOCSTI is .
Indexing and searching in mboxes efficiently
tgz · git · man
The modern way of dealing with mails consists of keeping everything , and using search tools to retrieve rapidly mails from a certain sender , or related to a certain subject , etc .
Multiple tools such as notmuch , or mu follow this philosophy .
My mymail command is similar in spirit , but simpler .
It can visit directories recursively and create index files from all the mboxes it finds , or retrieve mails listed in such index files , whose senders , recipients , subject , etc. match specified regexps .
The index files are flat text , with a bunch of lines for each mail .
The indexing takes into account fields which are usually ignored .
For instance , the sender is defined by aggregating not only the From : field , but also Reply - to : and the leading " From " line of each mail .
Check the mymail man page for more information .
The following command will index all the mbox files present in the directories ~/ archives / mails / 2010 and ~ / archives / mails / 2011 ( recursively ) and create an index file / tmp / mymail / 2010-2011/mymail.db
mymail -- db- file /tmp/mymail/2010-2011/mymail.db
\ -- index \ ~/archives / mails/2010 ~/archives/mails/2011
and the following one will search in all the database files *.db located ( recursively ) in / tmp / mymail , for all the mails having " bob.something " as sender or recipient , without " spam " in the subject , received over the last 31 days , and create an mbox file / tmp / mymail / mbox .
mymail -- db- pattern ' \.db$ ' -- db- root /tmp/ mymail \ -- output /tmp/mymail.mbox \ -- search 'p bob.something ' \ -- search '!s spam ' \ -- search ' month '
Despite not using a fancy database , both indexing and search are pretty fast .
On my laptop ( i7 , ssd ) , it takes 20s to index 6.5 Gb of mails , and 2s to retrieve 4150 mails and create the corresponding mbox .
A standard search request takes less than a second .
You can get the source code , the man page , and a wrapper for the emacs email reader vm by cloning the repository with
git clone https://fleuret.org/git/mymail/

( load " ~/sources/gpl/mymail/mymail - vm.el " ) ( define - key vm-summary - mode - map " \\ " ' mymail /vm-visit - folder ) ( setq mymail/default - search - request " today " mymail/default-additional - search - requests " !s ^\\ [ SPAM\\ ] " ) ( add - to - list ' recentf - exclude " /tmp/mymail-vm -.*\.mbox " )
and I modified the script I use to retrieve mails to automatically update the mymail indexes .

An alarm if the current file is not under vc
The function defined in alarm - vc.el checks if the file loaded in the current buffer is under cvs , subversion or git and adds an alarm in the modeline if it is not while some files in the directory are .
You just need to load the source file to activate the thing .
A word / character counter in the modeline
The function defined in text - counters.el automatically counts the number of words and characters in the region delimited by the previous line of " - " and the next line of " - " and displays them in the mode - line .
I activate it automatically when in text - mode with
( add - hook ' text - mode - hook ' tc/add-text-counters-in-modeline )
in my .emacs.el .
A dynamic string - selector
The function selector / select in selector.el is a dynamic regexp - matching interface .
While you type , the buffer dynamically refreshes its content to show only the strings matching the regexp you have typed so far .
It is very useful for instance to find files among those recently opened .
You just have to add to your ~/.emacs.el
( require ' recentf ) ( recentf - mode 1 ) ( when ( load " selector " t t ) ( define - key global - map [ ( control x ) ( control r ) ] ' selector/quick - pick - recent ) ( define - key global - map [ ( control c ) ( control s ) ] ' selector/quick - move - in- buffer ) ( define - key global - map [ ( control x ) ( control b ) ] ' selector/switch - buffer ) )
Lookup words in the dictionary
If you often write things in English and need to lookup words , the lookup - dict.el command can be handy .
It calls the dict command with either the content of the selected region or the word at point and displays the result in a new buffer .
Just add
( load " lookup - dict.el " ) ( define - key global - map [ ( control \? ) ] ' lookup - dict )
in your ~/.emacs.el to associate that command to the C -? key .
Use mplayer under emacs
This is a major mode that provides a front - end to mplayer to avoid all those fancy GUIs young kids love those days .
It displays your list of mp3 and web radios in a buffer and allows you both to control mplayer and organize sequences to play .
It is still very primitive though .
You can check this impressive screenshot .
I have the following in my ~/.emacs.el :
( when ( load " media.el " nil t ) ( setq media / expert t media / history - size 1000 media/ playlist - file " ~/private/media - playlists " media / mplayer -args ' ( " - softvol " " - framedrop " ) media /url - list '( " ~/mp3 " ( " http://72.20.6.90:8156/listen.pls " . " bsp.org " ) ( " http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/live/mp3.m3u " . " Swiss Jazz " ) ) ) ( define - key global - map [ ( meta \\ ) ] ' media ) )
Press ` ? ' to get a very short help , or look for the media /* in the binding list given by C-h b .
Handle rendez - vous and alarms
To remember rendez - vous , dead - lines and important things in general I wrote enotes.el , which can store notes , each associated to a date and a warning time .
An alert pops up at the warning time , and a new warning time is automatically set .
The whole stuff is simple and light to use .
Here is a screenshot .
Read the comments in the source to see how to use it .
I have the following in my ~/.emacs.el :

Distort and smooth ( 1996 )
tgz · git
The distort program corrects the " fish - eye " effect of the QuickCam .
If you already tried to take pictures of scenes with lines , or just close - up portraits , you must have seen how the QuickCam distorts the image .
For example , a homogeneous gride will be deformed like the top - row pictures .
To handle this , I wrote a small soft that distorts the image in such a way that the gride shown above gets back its homogeneous aspect .
This soft is called distort and , given the a list of a distorted gride intersection coordinates , it distorts a picture to straight it out .
Here are two examples of pictures before and after a correction .
The second program is supposed to help you improve the shade of gray .
Maybe have you noticed that when you zoom on a quickcam picture , you can see a terrible pixel noise such as on the left picture .
One can see on such picture two problems :
First there is a random noise on the grey - scale levels , which can be corrected with a simple averaging on a few pictures .
Second , there is a more structured noise .
No idea if this phenomenon is standard on all QuickCam or not , but as you can see on this detail , odd columns are ligther than even ones .
The program I propose here , called smooth , can perform both corrections .
The picture on the right is an example of what can be done , using 32 pictures to compute the averaging , and using for reference picture a picture of a white wall , also smoothed with 32 pictures .

A turmite is a kind of 2D Turing machine .
It has an internal state , and at each step , depending on its internal state and the color of the cell it is on , it puts a new color in the cell , moves in one direction ( ahead , right , left ) , and picks a new internal state .
The idea comes from the French version of " Scientific American " , and I made a program on Amiga to simulate a bunch of them , with some reproduction and mutation rules .
You can clone the repository with

White , 27 , began with the Scottsdale Police Department on Nov. 14 , 2005 , and resigned on June 22 , 2009 .
According to Scottsdale police internal affairs documents requested by The Arizona Republic , White wrote that she worked 64 hours from February to May 2009 when she was either on vacation or sick .
Those hours resulted in a loss of $ 1,814.40 , the report states .
Supervisors began their investigation after they received a timesheet for White during a two - week period in May where she requested on - call pay and compensatory time earned for staying an extra 30 minutes for a meeting , but did not document 24 hours of sick time .
At the time , White called the missing sick hours from her timesheet an " oversight . "
Further investigation revealed that on three separate days , from February to April 2009 , White requested vacation days , but wrote 30 hours as work days on her timesheet .
In addition , in February , White took three sick days , but only wrote down two on her timesheet .
When questioned , White told investigators that she realized in February 2009 that her vacation hours were going to be low and she would need more hours for planned vacations in May and June .
" I knew that in the future I would need the time off and that I could n't just deplete the bank , " White said , according to the records .
White said she had used the time off to care for her girlfriend 's two children and could n't financially afford to take the time off without pay .
She told investigators , " I know what I did in February and it was wrong . "
White is the second Scottsdale detective in the past month to voluntarily surrender certification to AZPOST .
The board on Jan. 20 accepted former Scottsdale police Detective Kenneth G. Varichak 's certification after the 9 - year police veteran admitted to internal investigators that he left an assignment early to help his wife with a surprise birthday party .
Islamabad , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
Another senior Afghan Taliban leader has been arrested in Pakistan , two Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN on Monday .
Security forces arrested Mullah Abdul Kabir last week from a religious school in the district of Nowshera , 54 miles ( 88 km ) northwest of Islamabad , the officials said .
Nowshera is located in Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province .
The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media .
Mullah Kabir served on the Taliban 's Council of Ministers and governed the eastern zone of Afghanistan during the Taliban rule of the 1990s , said Imtiaz Gul , head of the Islamabad - based Center for Research and Security Studies .
The eastern zone included the provinces of Nangarhar , Nuristan , Kunar and Laghman .
Kabir is the fourth Afghan Taliban leader to be arrested by Pakistani security forces in the past several weeks .
Last week , U.S. and Pakistani officials confirmed the arrests of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , Mullah Abdul Salam and Mullah Mir Muhammad .
" This arrest underscores a change in Pakistan 's policy , " Gul said .
" This suggests their level of cooperation with the U.S. is much better than in the past . "
Gul said the new level of cooperation could be in response to Washington 's recent decision to tone down its criticism of the Pakistani military .
" The Pakistani military has finally convinced the U.S. military establishment not to publicly condemn it , " said Gul .
" When you criticize the Pakistani military publicly , it reduces room for maneuvering for Pakistan 's institutions .
It becomes difficult for the military to motivate the lower and middle rank officers .
Finally , there is a much better equation between both military establishments . "
In a statement to CNN , Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied that Mullah Kabir had been arrested .
Forget cricket bats , golf clubs and carbon dioxide .
Australia has found a new weapon in its war on the dreaded cane toad : cat food .
Researchers with the University of Sydney found that a few tablespoons of cat food left next to ponds in the Northern Territory attracts fierce Australian meat ants , which then attack baby cane toads as they emerge from the water .
The results of the study were published in the British Ecological Society 's Journal of Applied Ecology this week .
It is the latest weapon in Australia 's seemingly endless battle against the cane toad , which was introduced from Hawaii in 1935 in an unsuccessful attempt to control beetles on sugarcane plantations .
The toads bred rapidly , and their millions - strong population now threatens many species across Australia .
Early cane toad killing methods included whacking the creatures with golf clubs or cricket bats .
In recent years , most groups dedicated to fighting the pests have turned to freezing or gassing them with carbon dioxide .
Still , the toads ' population continues to explode .
Cane toads emit a poison that attacks the heart of would - be predators .
But the University of Sydney researchers found that meat ants are impervious to the toads ' poison , said Rick Shine , a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Sydney who supervised the research .
" A single toad can have 30,000 eggs in a clutch , so there 's a heck of a lot of tadpoles turning into toads along the edge of a billabong , " he said .
" You can literally have tens of thousands of toads emerging at pretty much the same time .
They are vulnerable to meat ants if the colony discovers there is a source of free food . "
Between July and September 2008 , researchers studied tens of thousands of cane toads emerging from cat food - lined ponds and found that 98 per cent of them were attacked by meat ants within two minutes .
Of the toads that escaped , 80 per cent died within a day from ant - inflicted injuries .
The baby toads are less than a centimetre in size , about the same as a meat ant .
The aggressive ants have strong jaws and can kill even larger animals by sheer numbers .
' Unequal fight '
" It 's a pretty unequal fight , " Shine said .
" The toads have this terribly stupid response to attack — which is just to freeze and do nothing . "
Not all think the study is valuable .
Graeme Sawyer , an official with Frogwatch , an environmental group dedicated to wiping out the toxic amphibian , said the cat food technique just is n't powerful enough .
" The impact of meat ants on cane toads can be significant with a small number of cane toads , but when you get areas where there are large number of cane toads it does n't seem to make any difference at all , " he said .
Australia 's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said encouraging ants to attack cane toads is inhumane .
" RSPCA Australia recognizes that cane toads must be controlled , but urges researchers to concentrate on identifying effective methods that do not cause unnecessary pain or distress , " the group said in an email .
Shine acknowledged the study does n't have all the answers .
" You 'd have to be a desperate optimist to think that we 'll ever see the end of cane toads in Australia , " he said .
Revised and expanded at 12:50 ET , with comment from Political Media president Larry Ward .
The Republican party took down its innovative link - shortening tool Tuesday for several hours after pranksters had a field day using the tool to associate the GOP with bondage sites .
As part of its new media strategy , the Republican party launched a new site called GOP.am on Monday .
It 's a URL shortener designed to make it easy for conservative web surfers to exchange links to web pages .
Pranksters almost immediately began using the service to link to controversial or ironically intended websites , such as the official site of the American Communist Party , a bondage website and a webpage advertising a sex toy in the likeness of Barack Obama .
GOP .am apparently started blocking such links at some point Tuesday morning , and the GOP .am homepage was taken offline .
The website is back online late Tuesday morning PST , and the company that designed the site in collaboration with the Republican National Committee plans to add an automatic filtering system to help with the high volume of what its president calls " pornographic , lewd " or " hateful " URLs being added to its service .
Possibly the first branded URL shortener , GOP.am was designed by the RNC's new media consultants , Political Media , to work somewhat like bit.ly , in that it shortens URLs so that they can be more easily exchanged through short messaging services like Twitter .
Google launched its own URL shortener Monday afternoon , and Facebook now has one , too .
But unlike bit.ly , GOP .am includes a toolbar at the top of the screen that follows users as they click through to see whatever pages the links go to – particularly awkward when that website is the alt.com bondage site , and the technique is combined with a URL that adds animation of RNC chairman Michael Steele walking around on the lower right as if he 's showing off the website .
Users of the Balloon - Juice website entertained each other last night by exchanging scores of such links , which have since been blocked .
Political Media president Larry Ward told Wired.com that Political Media , which collaborated with the Republican National Committee on GOP.am , is filtering URLs posted the site on an hourly basis , using manual and eventually automated techniques .
" Our objective is to keep it clean , " said Ward .
" We 're not going to remove someone who puts GOP.am on Barack Obama 's page , we 're not going to remove somebody who puts it on the communist page .
The links that we 're going to edit are the pornographic ones , the lewd ones – obviously those type of links or anything that is overtly … hateful , we 're going to remove those . "
He 's not worried about the volume of prank URLs presenting a filtering problem because automating filtering , which could have been implemented before GOP .am launched but was not , will help its staff manually delete the links , and interest in pranking the system will die down .
" We 're going to do a pretty good job at it , " said Ward , who clarified that while the Republican party collaborated on the creation of GOP.am , the site is officially property of his Republican - affiliated new media consultancy , Political Media .
" We 're building a filtering system which should be in place shortly , and on top of that we 're going to manually monitor and block the IP addresses that post that kind of stuff , and eventually , the novelty of it will wear off and we 'll get less pranks , so to speak .
But in the meantime we 're just going to monitor it on an hour - by - hour basis and make sure that it 's used for the purposes for which it was intended . "
This updated screenshot depicts the GOP .am - linked version of this story .
The toolbar includes branding for the GOP , links for re-propagating the link on Twitter , Facebook and other sites , and a " donate to the GOP " button .
Political Media , whose other clients include Republican candidates , think tanks and the House of Representatives Agriculture Committee 's Republican minority , according to a Political Media spokesman , designed it with conservative users in mind .
Political Media's Ward told Wired.com he saw the pranks coming a mile away .
" Believe me , we were well aware that this was going to happen , " he said .
" We 've been on the internet doing business for every aspect of it since 1996 .
I was well aware exactly what was going to happen . "
When the Republican party announced a plan in March to reinvent its online strategy , chairman Steele said , " Bottom line is if we have n't done it , let 's do it .
If we have n't thought of it , think of it .
If it has n't been tried , why not ?
If it 's going to be ' outside the box ' — then not only keep it outside the box , but take it to someplace the box has n't even reached yet . ' "
The Republican plan ( .pdf ) was received with mockery from detractors and members of the Republican party alike , for its alleged vagueness and reliance on buzzwords .
A note on the front of GOP .am warns , " If you use it for spamming or illegal purposes , your GOP . am URL will be disabled . "
Although the pranksters ' links qualify as neither illegal nor spam , GOP.am has removed many of them , which now lead to an error page .
The site also says , " This service is provided without warranty of any kind , " so GOP .am is free to block the links .
Still , the prank - deletion process could prove time - consuming enough for the RNC to decide to remove the toolbar and animation of chairman Steele eventually .
Now , the site 's back up , and the toolbar and animation still appear .
Ward told us Political Media plans to keep both elements of the service in place .
So for now , GOP .am - shortened links that are not blocked by the site 's filters will still display GOP . am 's toolbar .

Among the natural products on pharmacy shelves , I was rooting for Ginkgo biloba for the prevention of dementia .
For one , dementia is a horrible illness .
Secondly , currently available drugs for Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) have little meaningful effect .
Thirdly , preliminary data with ginkgo for AD looked encouraging .
I recall reading this systematic review back in 2000 .
One sentence jumped out at me ( the bolding is mine ) :
We conclude that for selegiline , vitamin E , lecithin , linopirdine , and propentofylline the published data do not provide support for efficacy .
Based on the evidence we reviewed , it is our conclusion that donepezil , metrifonate and rivastigmine , however , all provide statistically significant modest benefit on cognitive performance and global functioning to the elderly with probable AD who are eligible for inclusion in clinical trials .
The magnitude of the effect is similar for all of the medications .
The results from the trials of ginkgo biloba are promising but the effects are smaller than those from the above mentioned therapies .
So the effect , while weak , was just about as bad as the prescription alternatives .
For a “ natural ” remedy , that ’s pretty good .
But as with most small clinical trials , what appears to be clinically and statistically significant usually disappears when larger , more rigorous trials are conducted .
And that seems to be the case now , with a publication in the December 23 , 2009 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
But before we dive into the trial , let ’s look at why ginkgo is even being studied at all .
The Background
Ginkgo biloba is a popular product – it ’s the most prescribed supplement in Germany ( and apparently the treatment of choice for dementia ) , and is # 9 in sales among herbals in the United States ( $ 99 million in 2008 ) .
Ginkgo trees are not only attractive , but their leaves are used to make the medicinal product , usually in the form of an extract .
( Ginkgo seeds contain a toxin and are considered unsafe for consumption . )
Ginkgo leaves contain several biologically active compounds including flavonoid glycosides and terpinoids .
With respect to prevention or treatment of dementia , it ’s been proposed that the constituents might work by reducing oxidative damage to neurons , or from providing general anti-inflammatory effect .
It has also been proposed that ginkgo improves circulation , perhaps through an antiplatelet effect .
Another possible mechanism is that ginkgo might have direct effects by reducing cell death – though this has not been established .
Ginkgo biloba supplements are usually well tolerated .
Side effects are typically mild , with stomach upset the most common complaint .
Spontaneous bleeding is the most concerning rare side effect reported with treatment , and there are several case reports of bleeding in the brain and eye that are associated with ginkgo treatment .
It ’s not certain that ginkgo is the cause , but it ’s troubling .
Clinical trial results have been reassuring on this point , with reported side effects largely equivalent to placebo .
Still , the known antiplatelet effects , and the bleeding case reports , have led to warnings about use in combination with other antiplatelet drugs .
It ’s not recommended for people with a history of bleeding problems , or in combination with medications that can increase bleeding risks ( warfarin , anti-inflammatories , etc. )
Ginkgo seems to reduce the action of some liver enzymes , so it can indirectly affect other drugs as well .
Combining ginkgo with any medications , in the absence of consultation with a pharmacist , is not advised .
Ginkgo has been studied extensively , albeit in small , short - duration trials .
The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates it “ Possibly Effective ” for age - related memory impairment , cognitive function , dementia , diabetic retinopathy , peripheral artery disease , premenstural syndrome , Raynaud ’s syndrome , and vertigo .
Digging into the dementia research , the issue of poor trial quality is repeatedly cited as a confounder in interpreting the data .
Indirect comparisons , like the systematic review cited above , have suggested that if ginkgo does has an effect , it ’s more modest than drug treatment .
Before we look at the latest trial , let ’s consider how what we ’re studying and how we look for an effect .
Alzheimer ’s is the most common form of dementia in adults .
It is progressive , and non-reversible .
From the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ,
Initially , people experience memory loss and confusion , which may be mistaken for the kinds of memory changes that are sometimes associated with normal aging .
However , the symptoms of AD gradually lead to behavior and personality changes , a decline in cognitive abilities such as decision - making and language skills , and problems recognizing family and friends .
AD ultimately leads to a severe loss of mental function .
These losses are related to the worsening breakdown of the connections between certain neurons in the brain and their eventual death .
Evaluating whether a drug ( or “ natural ” remedy ) works to prevent dementia is challenging .
The disease course is a progressive decline in function – the intent with treatment is to prevent , slow , or delay , that decline .
Randomized , controlled , double - blind trials are essential – it is impossible to determine if any treatment has an effect without comparisons to a control group .
Because of the challenges with diagnosis , the slow onset , and the gradual decline in function , clinical trials need to be designed carefully .
A good trial would follow a large number of patients for a long period .
It would also study a large population , so that even a modest effect could be detected .
We ’d also want to study a population that ’s healthy – without dementia , but we might include those with mild cognitive impairment .
This would help us answer whether ginkgo useful to prevent dementia .
And that ’s exactly what this study set out to answer .
The Study
The Snitz et al study was a follow - on study to the DeKosy et al study published in JAMA in 2008 .
Briefly , DeKosy established that Ginkgo biloba was not effective in reducing the incidence of dementia or Alzheimer ’s disease .
This newest study reports on cognitive decline , a pre-defined secondary outcome in the same population as the DeKosy study .
The authors sought to determine if Ginkgo biloba affected the rated of cognitive change , and if it had specific effects on different cognitive functions ( e.g. , memory , language , attention , etc . )
Volunteers aged 75 or older were recruited in four US cities .
Those with dementia were excluded , though mild cognitive impairment was acceptable .
If you were n’t taking drugs that could interact with ginkgo , and were generally healthy , you were probably eligible for the study .
It was a good generalizable sample of the elderly population .
This was a huge study : 3069 patients were randomized .
The population size was selected to accommodate for patients that would drop out , yet still be large enough to detect a clinically meaningful difference from the ginkgo .
Patients were randomized to either Ginkgo biloba 120 mg twice daily ( “ EGb 761 “ , donated by Schwabe Pharmaceuticals ) or an identical placebo .
This brand of ginkgo biloba is standardized to the main active ingredients , and the dose was chosen based on results from prior clinical trials .
Both patients and researchers were blinded to the actual treatment given .
Patients were evaluated when they entered the trial , and regularly with two validated dementia screening test , the 3MSE and the ADAS - Cog.
Comprehensive neurological testing was conducted annually starting in the third year of the study .
Patients were followed , on average , for 6.1 years in total .
The results can be summarized simply :
There was no significant difference between the groups , either overall or in any of the specific cognitive areas tested .
There is no evidence that ginkgo has any effect on those that develop dementia , or on cognitive effects of normal aging .
To see if “ pre-treating ” patients with ginkgo had any effect , the researchers compared results from years 3 to 4 to year 6 .
Again , no effect .
Criticisms of the Study
The manufacturer of the ginkgo supplement used , Schwabe , dismisses the results .
Their criticisms can be summarized as follows , with my comments in [ brackets ] :
The placebo group barely declined in function .
Ginkgo cannot be shown to be effective when the control group declines so little .
[ Because of a lower than expected dementia rate in the trial , the trial was extended until the required number of dementia cases occurred that would be sufficient to detect a difference .
No difference was noted between the groups . ]
Cognitive performance was measured using a blunt dementia - screening tool .
Specific testing did n’t start until 500 patients had left the study .
[ The authors note this , and did a secondary analysis which was consistent with the primary analysis .
The “ blunt ” screening tools are validated evaluation tools for dementia ( 3MSE and ADAS - Cog .
No difference was noted between groups . ]
Of patients that remained in the study , only 60 % ( placebo and ginkgo ) were taking the product .
[ The study was powered to adjust for this , as non-adherence was evaluated in the intention - to - treat analysis .
Notably , adherence was slightly lower ( though not significantly ) in the ginkgo group . ]
Conclusion
The largest and best - designed study to examine Ginkgo biloba has found it ineffective in reducing the incidence of dementia , Alzheimer ’s disease , or in reducing the rate of cognitive decline in older adults .
This is a persuasive study .
In a population that is very close to the “ real world ” that might consider taking the product , no effect of ginkgo has been shown .
The product studied was the most - evaluated ginkgo product and one standardized for active ingredients .
Given the documented risks of bleeding with ginkgo , the risk - benefit calculation now tilts strongly away from treatment :
There are risks , and no demonstrated benefits .
It ’s time for pharmacists to start recommending against self - treatment with Ginkgo biloba for the treatment or prevention of dementia or cognitive decline .

ELEANOR HALL : A menagerie of curious species , ranging from a Rhinoceros - sized wombat to a sheep - sized echidna , once roamed the Australian continent .
Most died out long before European settlement .
But two researchers , who 've just published a paper in the journal , Science , say there 's now compelling evidence that humans are responsible for the demise of the super - sized animals .
This theory , though , is contested by an archaeologist who 's been conducting research at one of Australia 's most significant archaeological sites .
As Timothy McDonald reports .
TIMOTHY MCDONALD : When English naturalists were first presented with the preserved specimen of a Platypus , they thought it was so bizarre it must have been a hoax .
Imagine then what they might have thought had they been faced with a wombat the size of a small car , or one of the many other fanciful creatures that died out long before Europeans ever arrived in Australia .
BARRY BROOK : There was an ancient possum which was a carnivore about the size of a lion ; and there was a huge lizard , like a goanna , but about six - metres long ; and there was a bird , bit like an emu , but about twice as heavy and half as tall again .
TIMOTHY MCDONALD : Barry Brook is a Professor of Climate Change at the University of Adelaide 's Environment Institute .
He says a debate has raged for some time over why these creatures vanished .
Some have argued that climate change killed them off .
But Professor
Brook says the evidence is now extremely strong that humans were the cause .
BARRY BROOK : Everywhere we look in Australia , it seems that there was a very short overlap between people and megafauna .
TIMOTHY MCDONALD :
At the centre of a the debate is site in western New South Wales , called Cuddy Station , where archaeologists have found the remains of megafauna as well as stone tools , leading some to believe that there was a lengthy overlap between humans and Australia 's largest animals .
Barry Brook says new dating methods indicate that many of the bones are much older than the tools , suggesting that if humans and megafauna did co-exist , they did n't do it for very long .
He says the tools and the bones may have been washed there in a flood , which explains why they were found in the same layer of sediment .
BARRY BROOK : It 's quite clear in fact that a lot of these are old bones that have been eroded out of a river bank or some other deposit and washed down there and then redeposited and in the stone tools have been mixed in with it .
TIMOTHY MCDONALD : But the theory is disputed by Judith Field , who 's an honorary research fellow in archaeology at the University of Sydney .
She 's studied Cuddie Station for more than a decade and says there 's no evidence that a flood pushed all the detritus into one big pile .
JUDITH FIELD :
What we have here are bones lying in a deposit in an anatomical order in some case .
So it 's quite clear that the animal died where it dropped and it's been enclosed by very , very fine grain clothes and silk .
Not only that but the stone tools around them are very sharp , have been used , and are very clearly not been washed in from anywhere .
TIMOTHY MCDONALD : Dr Field says it 's more likely that the extinctions did n't occur as one mass event , and instead occurred slowly over tens of thousands of years .
She says it 's clear that many species died out well before humans arrived , but there 's scant evidence to say definitively how Australia 's megafauna died out .

First - time director Tom Ford has surprised the critics by making one of the year 's best films .
Can he take all the credit – or is great cinema always a team effort ?
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 1 March 2010
Homophone corner : " The fact is , there are n't too many directors who know anything about light metres or camera lenses " .
Tom Ford wanted to be a ­director so much , he bought a movie .
He obtained the rights to a Christopher ­Isherwood novel , lifted the cast from his contacts book and the budget from his bank balance .
Ford made his ­millions in the rag trade ; first as the creative director of Gucci and then as the creator of the Tom Ford fashion label .
He freely admits that , ­until ­recently , he had no film - making ­experience whatsoever .
It would be nice , then , to dismiss A Single Man as a bungled vanity project , a hubristic folly from a man with more dollars than sense .
­Annoyingly , the shoe wo n't fit .
A ­Single Man boasts a deft , Oscar - ­nominated performance from Colin Firth as a bereaved academic facing stark life choices in sun-splashed , early - 60s California .
It is a film that confidently marries style with substance ; a seductive drama that lightly references Hitchcock , Douglas Sirk and Luchino Visconti .
Already the critics are dubbing it Death in Venice Beach .
But here 's the thing .
A Single Man is a superb first film from a man who , by his own admission , knew next to nothing about the nuts and bolts of making a movie .
So I 'm confused .
Does this make Ford some kind of ­genius savant ?
Or does it say something about the art of directing , wherein the dreams of one person are built on the backs of others ?
Just look at the credits .
All those cast members ; all that crew .
In what sense is this " a film by Tom Ford " , exactly ?
I blame the auteur theory , which ­elevated the director to a God - like ­status and allowed him ( and it usually is a him ) to hog all the credit .
Hitchcock was an auteur , we are assured , and so was Orson Welles .
And yet , in later years , the titles designer Saul Bass ­insisted that it was he and not Hitchcock who had engineered the shower scene in Psycho ( surely the most purely Hitchcockian scene of them all ) , while US critic Pauline Kael made a case for the writer ( Herman ­Mankiewicz ) and the cinematographer ( Gregg Toland ) as the real driving forces behind Citizen Kane .
It has been said that the end credits of Titanic last longer than the real Titanic took to sink ( the ones on Avatar achieve a ­similar level of transcendental ­longevity ) .
But do n't mention that to director James Cameron , the self - crowned " king of the world " .
A Single Man , as it happens , is just one of a recent run of acclaimed films from first - time film - makers with a track record outside the industry .
They include the artists Steve McQueen ( Hunger ) and Sam Taylor - Wood ­( Nowhere Boy ) , as well as TV comedy writer Armando Iannucci ( In the Loop ) .
Nowhere Boy and In the Loop share the same producer : Kevin Loader .
­Debut directors of any stripe , Loader tells me , typically need more reassurance than those who have been in the business a while .
" They need help ­getting the relationships in place ; ­figuring out how to work best with the crew around them .
Then there is the politics of the cutting room .
First - time directors might not be sure just how much ­freedom they 've got , and how much they 're going to get busted by other producers and those who have invested in the film .
That 's where the help comes in .
Certainly there was a bit of head - butting with certain people on Nowhere Boy . "
When von Trier went awol
So , OK , directors need help in order to realise their vision .
But where does the help stop and the heavy ­lifting begin ?
It 's fair to say that some film - makers are in command of all ­aspects of the process , while others have only the foggiest notion of what a camera actually does .
On top of that , some directors are hands - on , others can be conspicuous by their absence .
Late last year , I sat in the auditorium at the European film awards and saw the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle pick up a prize for his work on Lars von Trier 's Antichrist .
" Lars , it was great when you were there , " Dod Mantle said .
" But you were n't there very ­often . "
Or take the case of The ­Wolfman , a forthcoming horror ­blockbuster that found itself shuttled between directors .
Certain portions , it is whispered , were shot without ­anyone officially in charge .
Theoretically , says Loader , it is ­entirely possible for a film to direct ­itself .
A solid cast and crew can be ­relied on to fill in the gaps left by a ­director who is either inept or awol .
" Oh , it happens all the time , " he says .
" Directors come through the machine and barely register on the seismograph .
That 's especially common in TV .
­Perhaps it 's harder on a feature film , because I 'm not sure the actors would let you get away with it .
But yes , it still happens .
If you have a good team around you , they could probably make a film without direction . "
Nick James , who edits film magazine Sight & Sound , would go along with that .
If it 's the case that anyone can direct a film , then it's also the case that anyone can not direct a film .
" I know stories about very well - known figures who are revered for directing films and who basically do nothing , " he tells me .
" They just put their name on it at the end . "
Is this a problem ?
­According to James , there is a simple formula for making a film .
" There are two things to get right at the start : the casting and the shot - list .
After that you can basically sit back .
The fact is , there are n't too many ­directors who know anything about light metres or camera lenses .
But that 's not ­necessarily a bad thing . "
Nor does he have any problem with describing Ford as an ­auteur .
A Single Man , he says , reflects its ­director 's background in that it is " art - directed to death " .
Moreover , Ford has the wealth and prestige to ­ensure that his film was tailored to fit his exact specifications .
" Independent wealth has never hurt anybody who wanted to make films , " James says ruefully .
" It 's no ­accident that a lot of the great ­independent directors of European ­cinema – like Visconti , for instance – were independently wealthy . "
British director Peter Strickland is not a millionaire .
Like Ford , however , he decided to finance his first feature from his own pocket .
The award - winning Katalin Varga is a haunting , poetic revenge saga set in the wilds of Romania .
It was shot for a paltry £ 25,000 with a skeletal , 11 - strong crew .
This involved Strickland pitching in on everything from sorting parking permits to arranging the catering .
Yet even here there were limitations .
" I could never ­operate a 16 mm camera , " he confesses .
" And I know nothing about sound . "
' Directing is not rocket science '
But that 's all right , he assures me .
That 's how a film set works .
" The cameraman does n't have a clue what 's ­going on with the sound , and the sound man wo n't know one end of a camera from the other , and the director might not know much about either .
But ­directing is not rocket science .
It 's about working with the departments and keeping an eye on the bigger picture . "
I ask whether Katalin Varga is credited as " a film by Peter Strickland " and he admits , slightly sheepishly , that it is .
" That 's what marketing people do ; it 's a branding thing , " he explains .
" Not that I 'm complaining or anything . "
Actually , I 'm not either .
Strickland wrote the script and called the shots .
He cooked for the crew and paid for the food , so he is surely entitled to claim the end product as his own .
No doubt the same is true for Ford , whose film is similarly bought and paid for , like a patented fashion design runup elsewhere by professional tailors .
Even so , I can't help feeling for all those unsung heroes – the lighting technicians , sound engineers and editors who have the power to make or break a motion picture , only to find ­themselves relegated to the wings , like the elves in Santa 's workshop .
" I 'd like to think that Katalin Varga is my film , " says Strickland .
" But you 're right : it 's not as though I 'm the author of a novel .
Film is a team ­effort .
Without the cast and crew , it 's nothing . "
A Single Man is out tomorrow .
Katalin Varga is out on DVD on 22 February .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
Two missiles fired from an American drone aircraft killed at least six militants in North Waziristan on Sunday , Pakistani security officials said .
American drone attacks have recently increased in the region , on the border with Afghanistan , which is the main hub of Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban faction led by Sirajuddin Haqqani , whose fighters are involved in attacks against NATO and American forces in Afghanistan .
The target of the attack on Sunday was a compound in the town of Mir Ali .
The identity of those killed was not clear .
The Pakistani military is currently involved in an offensive in South Waziristan , the base of the Pakistani Taliban , but is under increasing pressure from the United States to expand the offensive to North Waziristan .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s rulers must compromise with opposition figures to avoid a worsening of the political turmoil , the son of the late dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri said in comments released on Saturday .
In an interview with Germany ’s Der Spiegel magazine , Said Montazeri said he hoped Iran ’s rulers would come to their senses and called on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to resign .
“ Things ca n’t go on for long like this , ” Montazeri was quoted as saying in an interview conducted by mobile phone from his home in Qom .
It was unclear when the interview took place .
“ I think the future structure of our society is not so important .
It could be an Islamic Republic , a secular republic , or as far as I am concerned , even a monarchy .
The main thing is that people can live in freedom and in prosperity , ” he said .
Anti-government protests have flared repeatedly since a disputed presidential election last June , throwing Iran into its most serious internal crisis in the Islamic Republic ’s 30 - year history .
In the last week , there have been bloody confrontations , arrests and hardline demands for the strong suppression of opponents of the government .
Asked by Der Spiegel if he expected a bloodbath , Montazeri said : “ I hope it wo n’t come to that .
I still hope the rulers will come to their senses and make compromises and take the path of national reconciliation .
If they do n’t , my country will be in a much worse state in one year ’s time than it is today . ”
Montazeri also insisted that Ahmadinejad should resign .
“ The people responsible must apologize for their wrongdoings and repression in the last months .
That would be the condition for a continuation of the Islamic Republic .
And after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has resigned , the presidential office must be handed to the candidate who won most votes at the election -- Mr ( Mirhossein ) Mousavi , ” said Montazeri .
Opposition leader Mousavi alleges the June presidential vote he lost to Ahmadinejad was rigged .
The government denies this .
Mousavi said on Friday he was ready to die for his reformist campaign , defying hardline calls for his arrest or execution , and demanded the release of political prisoners , respect for press freedom and a change in the election law .
Mohsen Rezaie , a conservative presidential contender in June , urged Iran ’s leaders on Friday to consider Mousavi ’s demands as a “ constructive ” solution to reduce tension , the semi-official ILNA news agency reported on Saturday .
Rezaie is a secretary of the powerful arbitration body , the Expediency Council , led by influential former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Iranian security forces clashed with supporters of Montazeri ’s father after the cleric died in December at the age of 87 , according to reformist websites .
Why the Census Bureau can and must start collecting the home addresses of incarcerated people
Submitted by Peter Wagner , Eric Lotke and Andrew Beveridge to the U.S. Census Bureau on February 10 , 2006
in advance of the Bureau 's report to the Appropriations Committee on using prisoners ' homes of record in the Census
I. Introduction .
Traditionally , the Census Bureau has enumerated incarcerated people as residents of the Census block that contains the prison in which they are incarcerated .
The Census Bureau has long held that a fair and equitable Census count requires not just a complete count , but a count of people in the correct place .
New uses of Census Bureau data and changing demographics require the periodic examination of the residence rules .
Since the 1980 Census , the percentage of Americans incarcerated in correctional facilities has increased four - fold .
Recent research has shown that correctional facilities are frequently located in areas that are geographically and demographically far removed from the communities to which most incarcerated people belong .
Counting prisoners as residents of the prison location causes unexpected distortions in Census data for rural communities and creates significant burdens on state and local legislative data users who rely on the Census for redistricting purposes .
The original constitutional mandate of the Census was simple : to determine the relative population of each state for Congressional apportionment .
As American society has grown more complex , so too have the residence rules used to determine where to count the population .
Over the last two hundred years , the Census has changed how it counts college students , missionaries , overseas military and many other groups .
Counting prisoners at the facility probably made sense at the first Census in 1790 when few people were in prison and when the data was not used for redistricting .
Things are different now , and the data collection methods need to change .
The means used to count people in prison now requires a similar update and change .
Increasingly over the last century , Census data down to the local level has been used to guide social and governmental research and policy .
Starting in the 1960s , the Supreme Court issued a series of " One Person One Vote " decisions which required state and local governments to redraw legislative district boundaries at least once per decade in order to ensure that districts were equal in population and that each resident had an equal stake in government .
These cases created in state and local government a new class of data users who needed accurate demographic data down to the block level in order to draw legislative districts .
Since 1975 when Congress passed PL94 - 171 , the Census Bureau has worked closely with local governments to make Census Bureau data useful for local redistricting by adjusting Census Bureau geography to follow local political boundaries .
While the Census Bureau has been responsive to matching the shape of Census blocks and tracts to local boundaries , it has not been so responsive to counting only " local " residents within those boundaries .
Prisons present a significant distortion on local populations .
Currently , there are more than 2 million people in prisons and jails .
Since the 1980 Census , the percentage of Americans incarcerated in correctional facilities has increased four - fold , with more than 0.7 % of Americans currently incarcerated .
Certain demographic groups are disproportionately affected by these trends ; for example more than 12 % of the population of African - American men in their late 20s is currently incarcerated .
Recent research has shown that correctional facilities are increasingly located in areas that are geographically and demographically far removed from the communities to which most incarcerated people belong .
According to Department of Agriculture Demographer Calvin Beale , although non-metro counties contain only 20 % of the national population , they are the host for 60 % of new prison construction .
In the 1990s , an astonishing 30 % of new residents of upstate New York were people being sent to prison .
The result of counting large external populations of prisoners as local residents leads to misleading conclusions about the size and growth of communities .
One study of incarcerated populations in the Census found 21 counties in the United States have at least 21 % of their population in prison .
Counties that see prisons close their doors report that their Census populations declined when in fact their actual population did not .
Conversely , population growth reported by some counties is due to the importation of prisoners to a new correctional institution .
If not for the construction of new prison cells , 56 counties the Census Bureau identified as growing during the 1990s would have in fact reported declining populations .
Because Latinos and Blacks are incarcerated at three to seven times the rate of Whites , where incarcerated people are counted has tremendous implications for how Black and Latino populations are reflected in the Census .
For this reason , the African - American subcommittee of the Census Bureau 's Race and Ethnicity Advisory Committee recommended that the Census Bureau count prisoners as residents of their pre-incarceration addresses .
Unlike other " group quarters " populations , prisoners do not choose to be at the facility and are not considered part of the surrounding community .
Contrary to popular understanding , most prisoners are serving short sentences .
The average state prison term served in the United States is 34 months .
Typically , individuals move to several different prisons during the course of their stay , at the discretion of the custodial agency .
When a prisoner 's sentence is completed , he or she will not be permitted to stay in the facility and will most likely return to the community that he or she was removed from when the incarceration began .
The 784,000 people in local jails on a given day are either awaiting trial or are serving sentences that are generally under one year .
Thus , counting prisoners as residents of the correctional facilities incorrectly equates an involuntary short - term stay with a permanent move to the prison community .
This practice is inconsistent with other census rules which properly credit hotel guests and other temporary visitors to their home communities .
Reflecting the involuntary and short - term nature of incarceration , and a concern that including the residents of correctional facilities could distort the local democratic process , many state constitutions define residence for a prisoner as the place he or she resided prior to incarceration .
In November 2005 , the Appropriations Committee directed the Census Bureau to :
" undertake a study on using prisoners ' permanent homes of record , as opposed to their incarceration sites , when determining their residences .
The Bureau should report back to the Committees on Appropriations on its findings within 90 days of enactment of this Act . "
This document is intended to review the importance of this issue and address the legal and practical concerns that have been raised by the Bureau in the past .
We review the existing evidence and conclude that is both desirable and possible to count prisoners as residents of their pre-incarceration addresses in the PL94 - 171 redistricting dataset .
Finally , we offer some suggestions as to how the Census Bureau can study this issue , collect the data and then publish it in the next decennial Census .
II .
State and local legislators have unique data needs that require incarcerated people to be counted at home .
Counting prisoners as residents of the prison towns rather than of their homes affects most data users and all of the Census Bureau 's data products .
While the number of uses of Census Bureau data is inconceivably large , we imagine it would be preferable for most uses that prisoners not distort the statistics of the prison - hosting community .
In many cases , particularly for studying high incarceration communities , it would be preferable to have those people counted at home .
But redistricting is different than this discussion of data user preference because the legislatures actually need prisoners counted differently .
For that reason this document focuses on the two major groups that use the PL94 - 171 redistricting data set -- state and local legislatures -- and discuss how these two different groups are negatively impacted by the current method of enumerating prisoners .
To avoid the most significant distortions in districting , state legislatures need prisoners counted at home , where as local legislatures merely need to be able use a PL94 - 171 dataset that does not contain the prison populations .
Each decade , state legislatures use Census data to redraw congressional and state legislative districts .
The current practice of crediting prisoners to the census block with the prison results in drawing legislative districts near prisons that have large numbers of non-residents .
One legislative district in New York is 7 % prisoners ; a legislative district in Texas is 12 % prisoners ; and 15 % of one Montana district is prisoners imported from other parts of the state .
The existence of these legislative districts with artificial populations increases the voting strength of the real prison - district residents and dilutes the voting strength of residents in every other district in the state .
The urban communities that have large numbers of residents incarcerated outside the district , see their voting strength diluted beyond that of the average district in a state , though it is impossible to calculate this precisely because the necessary Census data on origin has never been collected .
The impact on local legislatures , such as county boards , is even more pronounced .
Because the district sizes tend to be relatively small , a single prison can have a significant impact .
In our research , we have discovered a number of districts where the majority of the population in some districts are prisoners from other parts of the state .
Rural residents who live in the same community as a prison but not immediately adjacent to it frequently see their votes diluted on local issues quite severely .
This issue and the controversy it causes in New York State is most thoroughly described in this July 2004 comment letter from three residents of rural Franklin County New York to the Census Bureau 's Redistricting Data Program :
We are writing to express our concern that the Census Bureau 's method of counting incarcerated people as residents of the facility makes it difficult to use Census data in local county redistricting .
We are two former legislators in Franklin County , New York and a private citizen .
All of us have been involved in redistricting litigation to enforce the creation of equally sized districts .
While the Census Bureau is very helpful in adapting its geographic units so that county government can readily use Census data in local redistricting , we have found that who the Census Bureau counts within our election districts creates unnecessary controversy and confusion .
Left uncorrected , Census counts of prisoners leads to a significant change in how our county legislatures work .
Franklin County is in Northern New York on the Canadian border .
Census 2000 reported our population at 45,622 including 5,512 state prisoners in 5 state prisons .
Almost 5,000 of the prisoners are in 3 large prisons in the Village of Malone .
We do not consider the prisoners to be residents of our community as they originate outside of our community , have no interaction with it and immediately leave the district when their sentences expire or the Department of Corrections chooses to transfer them elsewhere .
Franklin County has always excluded state prisoners from the base figures used to draw our legislative districts .
To do otherwise would contradict how we view our community and would lead to an absurd result : creating a district near Malone that was 2/3rds disenfranchised prisoners who come from other parts of the state .
Such a district would dilute the votes of every Franklin County resident outside of that area and skew the county legislature .
We know of no complaints from prisoners as a result , as they no doubt look to the New York City Council for the local issues of interest to them .
While Franklin County has consistently excluded prisoners from its redistricting population , our research into the practices in other counties has revealed a diversity of approaches .
This diversity stems not from a difference of opinion on whether prisoners are a part of the prison town , but from a difference of opinion as to whether it is permissible to modify Census Bureau figures .
We will give the examples of Greene County ( south of Albany ) , St. Lawrence County ( directly to our west ) and Wayne County ( east of Rochester ) .
Prior to 2002 , the Greene County New York Legislature used unadjusted Census figures for its county redistricting .
An increase in the prison population during the 1990s meant that 6 % of the county 's Census population was in two state prisons in Coxsackie in the northeast corner of the county .
When The Daily Mail reported that Coxsackie would be getting an extra legislator from the arrangement , there was a large protest and the county reversed course and drew district lines based on data that excluded the prison population .
St. Lawrence County , which borders Franklin , is the only county we know of to have previously excluded prisoners from its redistricting base and now includes them .
The county did this on the basis of advice from their county attorney about a 1993 state case , which other counties read to require exclusion .
Factually separate from the legal analysis , the legislators admit that the prisoners have no stake in issues of county taxation or policy making .
Most critically , there was a large public effort in the county to attempt to repeal the most recent redistricting legislation precisely because large external populations were included making the votes of 8 residents near the prisons worth as much as 10 residents elsewhere in the county .
According to our survey , about 1/3rd of the New York counties with prisons exclude prisoners from their local redistricting population base .
This may be a minority of counties , but with the exception of St. Lawrence County , we know of no local county that included the prisoners after the issue became known to the public .
In fact , our research in Wayne County may express the magnitude of the problems caused by how populations are credited to our communities .
The Wayne County Board of Supervisors is apportioned with weighted votes to each town .
The Board told us that they do not consider prisoners to be residents and including prisoners in the Butler Shock Camp would have a significant impact on the weighted voting scheme .
However , the County was under the incorrect assumption that prisoners were not credited to the town of Butler .
While the Board was aware that Butler had a small population , its actual population is much smaller than the Board -- relying on Census figures -- had been lead to believe .
Conclusion
We appreciate the data that the Census Bureau supplies to our communities and thank you for your efforts to make it easier to use this data in our redistricting efforts .
As part of your deliberations establishing the 2010 Redistricting Data Program , we urge you to not count prisoners as residents of our communities .
We are continuing to explore how local communities respond to the problem of drawing legislative districts with significant numbers of prisoners who are not members of the community .
Colorado and Mississippi require county governments to exclude the correctional populations in the census from county districts .
New Jersey requires school board districts to do the same .
Virginia law encourages counties that have a Census population that is more than 12 % prisoners to exclude the correctional populations prior to redistricting .
We have also identified individual communities in California , Florida , Massachusetts , Illinois and Louisiana that without explicit state authorization have excluded prison populations prior to redistricting .
But , as will be discussed in section VIII C , the current format of PL94 - 171 makes this very difficult for rural communities to do , and with only a small change the Census Bureau could facilitate this type of simple data correction .
Because available data on prisoner origin does not allow an analysis of the impact on urban city council districting , this document concerns itself with the very large problem created for small prison hosting communities that must draw legislative districts on the basis of population .
III .
How prisoners are counted has occasional effect on funding .
Our review of state , federal and local funding streams reveals that where prisoners are counted has an occasional impact on governmental financial distributions .
The most rigorous examination of how prisoner counts affect funding is " Prisoners of the Census : Electoral and Financial Consequences of Counting Prisoners Where They Go , Not Where They Come From " in the Pace Law Review .
Although Census data does play a role in the distribution of more than $ 1.5 trillion each decade in federal funds , the vast majority of these funds are unaffected by where prisoners are counted .
The two largest programs , Medicaid and Highways , amount for 74 % of the total , though as block grants to states they are unaffected as long as prisoners stay within the same state .
The majority of other federal funds are in tailored programs that match the program to the need .
The low incomes of prisoners do depress per-capita income figures , but they are not included in the more frequently used household income and poverty statistics .
Simply put , most government programs are designed with sufficient precision that they are not affected .
In contrast , state sales taxes are often affected by the decisions of the Census Bureau .
Most states distribute sales taxes with portions going directly to the state general revenues , portions returning to the point - of - sale , and portions going to municipalities or other local governments on the basis of population .
Thus , communities that host a prison receive an additional , unearned portion of the state sales tax .
Another example is Virginia 's method of distributing state aid for K - 12 education .
Unlike other states , that use formulas that focus on pupils enrolled , Virginia distributes state aid based on a complex formula that includes the county population as a factor .
The end result is that Sussex County , which has a Census population that is 19 % people in prison , receives $ 115,000 extra as a result of the incarcerated population .
In contrast , Henrico County ( Richmond ) loses roughly $ 200,000 as a result of " exported " population .
It is not a great deal of money , but it illustrates the kind of low - level distortion created by population counts .
Other affected fund distributions include U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Appalachian Regional Commission which makes $ 60 million available annually to impoverished Appalachian communities based on a formula that includes total population of each county .
Such formulas inadvertently reward communities that build prisons by giving them a larger share of the funds intended for their region .
Typical of the distortions that the Census creates , the communities that pay the largest price are not the urban communities that most people in prison call home ; rather , they are similarly situated rural communities that lack the advantage of a population artificially inflated by a prison .
IV .
The law does not prohibit -- and may require -- the Census Bureau to collect incarcerated people 's home addresses .
The Census Bureau has frequently deferred an honest discourse on the best place to count incarcerated people by pointing to D.C. v. Commerce , 789 F. Supp. 1179 ( 1992 ) that held that the Bureau 's practice was not " arbitrary and capricious . "
The Bureau has been less eager to discuss whether its policy is wise or whether it is permissible under equal protection voting rights jurisprudence .
IV . A. D.C. v. Commerce does not prohibit the Census Bureau from exercising its discretion to modify the " usual residence rule " .
The Census Bureau 's conclusion that D.C. v. Commerce , 789 F. Supp. 1179 ( 1992 ) requires it to continue to count prisoners as residents of the prison towns is incorrect .
In that case the Court held merely that the current counting methodology was not " arbitrary and capricious " under the Administrative Procedure Act , that the Court was not called upon to perform a de novo review , and that the Census Bureau was not , as a matter of law , required to use the " best available " procedure . ( p. 1188 ) .
This ruling is hardly a ringing endorsement of present practice ; indeed , it is virtually an invitation to do better .
The Census Bureau 's African - American subcommittee of the Race and Ethnicity Advisory Committee accepted the invitation .
In October , 2003 it recommended that :
" ... prisoners , including those housed outside their states , be counted as residents of their pre-incarceration addresses for purposes of Congressional apportionment , state redistricting , the distribution of financial aid to their home communities , and to permit those communities to have more resources to meet their needs upon their return . "
The Census Bureau 's African - American advisory committee is a subcommittee of the larger Race and Ethnicity Advisory Committee , a group appointed to offer guidance to the Census Bureau on policy questions of race and ethnicity .
Given the reality that 2.5 % of African - Americans in the United States are currently incarcerated -- in prisons and jails often far from their homes -- how incarcerated populations are counted is of particular concern to those seeking a complete , accurate , and useful count of the African - American population .
Shortly after the advisory committee meeting , the Census Bureau issued the following response , which skirts the importance of this issue to a fair and accurate count of African - Americans and misstates the applicability of D.C. v. Commerce :
Currently , we have no plans to reevaluate the methodology that we use for counting prisoners at the institution where they are incarcerated ....
In 1992 , the United States District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the principle of usual residence ( District of Columbia v. U.S. Department of Commerce ) .
In that case , prisoners who were residents of the District of Columbia were incarcerated in a prison located in the State of Virginia and , consequently , counted as residents of Virginia in the 1980 census .
The District of Columbia claimed that this action violated the Administrative Procedures Act , Article 1 , Section 2 , Clause 3 of the Constitution ( the authority for taking the decennial census for the purpose of apportionment ) , and the " due process clause " of the fifth amendment , and that it would cost the District $ 60 million over the decade .
The court ruled that the application of the Census Bureau 's " usual residence rules " to prison inmates was a rational decision that was neither arbitrary nor capricious , and that it did not violate the constitutional command of the census clause .
In other words , the court decided the Census Bureau could count the inmates at their usual place of residence as it is defined above .
This statement indicates a misinterpretation of D.C. v. Commerce .
First , while the case does not require a change in the usual residence rules , neither does it prohibit one .
More importantly , the case was brought by the plaintiffs after the 1990 Census was already taken , and it alleged that the Census Bureau 's enumeration of D.C. prisoners as residents of Virginia was going to cost the District federal funds .
Voting rights were not made a part of this after - the - fact lawsuit filed against the Census .
The court made it clear that the Census Bureau has no control over how various federal agencies use the data to distribute funds , and the judge recommended that the District of Columbia seek to change how federal funds are distributed .
Under the Administrative Procedures
Act , a court may reverse the actions of an agency in matters like this only where the agency 's action was " arbitrary or capricious . "
Showing that a defendant 's actions did not meet " mere rationality " is very difficult for a plaintiff to do , as the plaintiff must show not that she would have preferred a different outcome , but that the agency failed to consider the relevant factors and made a clear error of judgment .
( D.C. at 1185 . )
Given the chaos that would be caused by courts second - guessing Census Bureau decisions after the Census is complete , such a high legal standard makes sense .
Under the facts alleged in D.C. v Commerce , counting prisoners as residents of the prison location in the 1990 Census was not an arbitrary and capricious act .
But here , the African American Advisory Committee and this submission suggest that the 2010 Census should count prisoners at home .
A court case saying that a methodology was n't clearly wrong , does n't mean that the Bureau is required to do it again , especially when the Bureau 's own appointed advisors on African - American issues recommended a change more than six years before the next census .
IV .
B . The law may require a change in how prisoners are counted under a 14th Amendment equal protection and voting rights analysis .
A post -Census claim to redo the Census because of an alleged impact on federal funds may be precluded by D.C. v. Commerce .
However , a lawsuit alleging a violation of the 14th Amendment 's due process protections because of the impact on voting rights would likely trigger review of the Census Bureau 's counting method under the strict scrutiny standard .
Under this standard , the burden would be on the Bureau to defend its decision to not facilitate the drawing of proper state and local legislative districts .
In 1963 , the Supreme Court decided Reynolds v. Sims , in which it interpreted the 14th Amendment 's equal protection clause to require state legislative districts to be divided on an equal population basis .
As the court remarked , " legislators represent people , not trees or acres .
Legislators are elected by voters , not farms or cities or economic interests . "
The principle is that " the weight of a citizen 's vote can not be made to depend on where he lives . "
In violation of this principle , current Census methodology means that the weight of a citizen 's vote greatly depends on whether a large prison is nearby .
Crediting prison communities with large external population of prisoners -- who are local residents in no sense other than in the Census -- turns the " One Person One Vote " principle on its head .
There can be no doubt that rural prison towns do not share a " community of interest " with urban prisoners or their loved ones .
Above , in section II , three residents of rural Franklin County New York argued that they do not consider prisoners to be residents of their community .
Taren Stinebrickner - Kauffman surveyed the Indiana legislature and found the same thing :
I sent to all members of the lower house of the Indiana state legislature a brief survey that included the following question :
Which inmate would you feel was more truly a part of your constituency ?
a) An inmate who is currently incarcerated in a prison located in your district , but has no other ties to your district .
b ) An inmate who is currently incarcerated in a prison in another district , but who lived in your district before being convicted and / or whose family still lives in your district .
Every single one of the forty respondents who answered the question -- regardless of their political party or the presence or absence of a prison in their district -- chose answer ( b ) .
Had the responses been more ambiguous there might have been reason to repeat the survey with other groups of legislators .
However , unless there is something highly anomalous about Indiana , it is quite clear that representatives do not consider inmates to be constituents of the districts in which they are incarcerated - unless , of course , they happen to have prior ties to those districts .
Drawing state and local legislative districts that contain large numbers of prisoners from outside the district is not just unfair , it frequently has a larger impact than the 5 % population deviation limit established by the Supreme Court to define the extent of permissible population deviation for legitimate state interests such as protecting traditional community boundaries .
Prisoners are external populations that are not " traditionally " rural in any sense of the word .
Communities should not be forced to reapportion with population data that violates the equal protection rights of the resident voters .
V. Counting prisoners is far easier than counting overseas Americans .
Counting special populations is always controversial , but a change in how prisoners are counted would not meet the difficulties seen in recent Census test of the feasibility of including overseas American in the decennial census .
In response to citizen request and a Congressional mandate , the Census Bureau conducted a test enumeration of overseas Americans in early 2004 in Kuwait , Mexico and France in order to study the feasibility of including these people in the next decennial Census .
While U.S. government employees overseas have typically been counted , other groups of Americans have generally been excluded .
In a September 2004 review of the test enumeration , the Government Accounting Office concluded that the test was a failure and the effort should be halted because of low response resulting from one simple fact : overseas Americans are hard to locate .
Americans overseas are not required to register their locations with the State Department or local governments , so there is no master list of overseas Americans to send forms to .
The only method that could be used was a public relations campaign that resulted in less than 5,400 responses in these three countries with high numbers of Americans .
In the stateside Census , participation in the Census is mandatory and the Census Bureau starts with a master address list of every dwelling in the country .
The Bureau can readily determine the completeness of their count by visiting residences that do not return a form .
In correctional facilities , finding the population is even simpler : it is the only population that is by definition counted by the government several times a day .
In fact , in many cases the data the Census Bureau wants already exists in administrative records .
VI .
Changing how prisoners are counted would not mean that how students are counted would need to be changed .
Some Census Bureau officials have suggested that changing how prisoners are counted might also require that the method of counting college students also be changed .
We do not believe this to be the case .
Unlike college students , prisoners are not a part of the local community .
While some colleges are partially self - reliant communities , prisons are entirely so .
Students are welcome and encouraged to come in to town to purchase goods and services and to rent apartments .
Students can register to vote in the local community and may decide to stay permanently after graduation .
While the majority of students will eventually leave the college town , they will not necessarily return to their parents ' home community .
College is a time of transition in a person 's life .
But for the duration of their time at the college , the college is the place they willingly intend to be for the time being : that 's the very definition of residence .
People in prison are different .
Prisoners are barred from leaving the facility without official permission .
Forty - eight states bar prisoners from voting , and those that allow prisoners to vote require the voting to be done via absentee ballot back home .
Finally , parole regulations frequently require prisoners to be returned to their original county of conviction upon release .
While students are a part of the community that hosts the college , prisoners are not .
VII .
It is feasible for the Census Bureau to collect and process prisoner 's home address information as part of Census 2010 .
At the request of the National Academy of Sciences Residence Rules Panel , we examined which sources of home residence data existed and made a number of suggestions in our written submissions concerning the best way to gather this information .
We summarize this information below , and then add a new piece of evidence from Census 2000 showing that the Census Bureau can collect and process home address information for incarcerated people .
VII .
A. Direct enumeration of prisoners is possible and would provide additional benefits to Census data beyond home residence .
The most direct solution to the problem is to collect information from incarcerated people directly rather than from administrative records .
The National Academy of Sciences has twice recommended that the Census Bureau rely less on administrative records for enumerating group quarters populations .
Direct enumeration of prisoners is safe and appropriate .
Although prison officials often warn of safety problems , social workers , volunteers and other civilians enter prisons quite frequently to no ill effect .
The journalist accounts of the prisons where Census 2000 forms were distributed directly to prisoners reported that the prisoners were cooperative , suggesting that this direct approach could be used more widely .
Distributing forms directly to prisoners would have at least 5 collateral benefits to overall Census accuracy :
Increasing precision .
Addresses provided to the Census by people in prison at the time of the census will be more precise than addresses provided to prison administrators at time of intake , simply because they are more current .
For example , people who were living with their families and expect to return to their families can provide the current family address .
Addresses so provided will be at least as accurate as the unstable addresses used for homeless people , migrant workers and even the highly mobile urban youth who sometimes end up behind bars for a while , and is certainly more accurate than counting them as residents of entirely different congressional districts .
Increasing respondent candor and accuracy .
The Census Bureau has considerable experience working with sensitive populations .
In its work , the Census Bureau is clear about why it collects the data it does , how it will be used and how its privacy will be protected .
It would seem reasonable to expect prisoners to be more candid with Census Bureau officials than they would be with the state Department of Corrections regarding the last address and other information .
Creating uniformity in data collection procedures .
In Census 2000 , the method of counting prisoners varied from prison to prison .
In some prisons , forms were distributed to and collected directly from prisoners .
In other facilities , administrators used official records and submitted a report to the Census Bureau .
Reducing the imputation rate for data collected about prison populations .
Census 2000 suffered from an unexpectedly high reliance on administrative records for group quarters populations .
The missing data rates " reached as high as 50 percent for all group quarters residents and as high as 75 percent for prison inmates . "
As described further in this section , prisoners are likely to fully participate in the Census at very high levels and make large scale imputation unnecessary .
Aiding the Census Bureau in spotting duplicates in the response process .
Collecting only facility addresses for group quarters populations makes it difficult to distinguish processed from unprocessed Census forms , resulting in problems with electronic duplication of paper records .
An earlier National Academies panel suggested in Counting Under Adversity and another panel formally recommended in Reengineering the 2010 Census that home address information be collected to facilitate unduplication .
If prison and Census officials encourage prisoners to fill out Census forms , we expect the great majority will do so .
About.com reported the enumeration of prisoners at Folsom State Prison in California and favorably compared their cooperation to that of the public at large :
At 4:30 pm on April 3 , 2000 , officials of California 's Folsom State Prison handed out 4,000 Census 2000 questionnaires to prisoners .
Three hours later , 3,300 -- 82 percent -- of the census forms had been completed and returned .
Not bad compared to a response rate of only 67 percent from California 's non-inmate population .
This report from the Salt Lake Tribune indicates similar findings even with the 10 prisoners on death row , and shows that the prisoners willingly participated in the Census .
Unfortunately , many Census officials in other regions did not " prefer personal interviews with residents to ensure accuracy " :
Rather than asking administrators for a nose count , census takers prefer personal interviews with residents to ensure accuracy , particularly for the wider - ranging long forms given to every sixth American .
As a crew chief for the special - places operation , [ Census Bureau employee Robert ] Comfort covered the state prison in Draper .
Prison guards feared some prisoners might smear excrement , blood or other substances on their forms , but the documents came back clean and , almost without exception , completed .
" The prisoners in maximum security were actually pretty helpful , " Comfort said .
" We also counted about 10 people from death row , and they did n't give us a fight .
. . .
The guards may have told them they would lose privileges if they did n't help out . "
" Not so , said Jack Ford , prison spokesman , who speculated the prisoners just chose to behave .
Still , he admitted he worried when the census team went through the prison 's maximum - security facility .
" We have some prisoners in super - max that have proven to be security problems in the past , " Ford said .
" Rather than pass forms back and forth , " Ford said , " We had [ census takers ] ask them the questions through the cell . "
We will discuss the quality of the data collected at the Utah State Prison in section VII C .
VII .
B . Much of the home address information the Census Bureau would require already exists in administrative records
The National Academy of Sciences asked us if state Departments of Correction maintain electronic records of home addresses and what the research says about the accuracy of this data .
The majority of states do collect home residence information at the time of intake into the correctional system and maintain these records in an electronic format .
It should therefore be possible to use these records to assign most incarcerated people to a new address outside of the facility .
However , the process may be labor intensive and it is not available in every state or many local jails .
Although it seems reasonable to expect state correctional datasets to grow more complex and complete over time , we do not expect that administrative records can answer all questions the Census Bureau needs in 2010 .
According to the leading geo-spatial analyst of prisoner origin , policy analyst Eric Cadora , about 30 state Departments of Correction maintain electronic administrative records of the home addresses of prisoners .
The states that maintain this information most often do so by asking prisoners to self - report a last address during intake , but often the addresses are not updated until the time of release .
For example , the state of Kansas contains a complete dataset of the last known address for its state prisoner population .
Based on data published to the county level , the North Carolina Department of Corrections appears to have a virtually complete dataset of home residences for its population .
According to an analysis of the prison population on October 31 , 2004 published in the Department 's online research query tool , in only 0.17 % of the records ( 63 out of 36,136 ) was the home residence county " unknown " .
This is only slightly higher than the number of records of county of conviction that were reported as " missing " and " other " .
The North Carolina data appears to be complete , though the precision below the county level is unclear .
There has been one published study that includes a discussion of the geo-spatial accuracy of this type of data : Political Punishment : The Consequences of Felon Disenfranchisement for Rhode Island Communities , released by the Rhode Island Family Life Center in September 2004 .
The study found that the Rhode Island Department of Corrections collects a last known home address from persons entering the correctional system and maintains this list for all persons incarcerated under sentence , on probation or on parole .
Over 88 % of the relevant data in that study was successfully located to the tract level .
The Rhode Island Family Life Center excluded from its analysis those who reported out - of - state addresses .
In only 4.4 % of the remaining records , research partner Providence Plan was unable to geo -code the address back to the town level .
The address records were essentially blank .
Because their analysis also required a tract level analysis of urban Providence , the Providence Plan attempted to geo-code all addresses reported within that city .
They were able to do so in 92.6 % of the Providence cases , which the analysts reported in an interview that this was a higher success rate than they had experienced using other datasets .
VII .
C. Census 2000 data for the question " Where did this person live 5 years ago " demonstrates that the Census can in fact collect and process home information for the incarcerated population .
The Census Bureau has considerable experience gathering and geo-coding addresses provided by respondents , and in at least some cases successfully did this with prisoners .
While most Census forms are processed based on the address the form was mailed to , on the long form the Census also collects work addresses down to the street level for commuting statistics and collects migration data by asking the respondent for the town of residence 5 years prior .
The migration data is geocoded to the tract level , and the previous residence information is published at the county level .
As discussed above , in 2000 the Census Bureau 's method of counting prisoners varied from region to region and from facility to facility .
In many places , the Bureau relied on administrative records and received much criticism from the National Academy of Sciences for this .
We know from press reports and our interviews that in a small number of states and prisons , the Bureau distributed short forms to all prisoners .
We have been able to identify a small number of prisons were the Census Bureau also distributed long forms to prisoners and we can evaluate the quality of this data by looking at the published imputation rates for particular questions .
When the respondents fail to answer all of the questions on the form , the Census Bureau frequently fills in the blanks with the statistical process of " imputation " .
For example , if one household skips a few questions , the Census Bureau might use the answers from the neighbor 's forms to estimate race , ethnicity or other data .
Low imputation rates mean that the Census Bureau received many complete and valid responses , high imputation rates means that the Bureau was unable to collect the data it sought and had to fill it in by statistical means .
The frequency of imputations for various questions are published in separate tables in the Summary Files , so it is possible to determine how effectively prisoners can provide -- and the Census Bureau process -- an address outside of the facility for their residence 5 years ago .
According to press reports , long forms were distributed to 1/6th of the prisoners at the Utah State Prison and the California State Prison at Lancaster .
Lancaster has its own Census Block group , and the prisoners in the Utah State Prison account for 66 % of the population in its block group .
By way of comparison , Rikers Island ( the New York City jail ) appears to have been enumerated by administrative records .
Not surprisingly , the 5 year migration data was imputed for 100 % of Rikers Island 's block group , but only 51 % of the California State Prison and 5.6 % of the block group that contains the Utah State Prison .
This analysis of Census 2000 data shows that the distributing census forms directly to prisoners results in higher quality data than relying on administrative records .
Further , it shows that it is possible for the Bureau to enter prisons , distribute forms , collect home address information and then process that data .
Our analysis is based upon press accounts of Census Bureau procedures and an analysis of block groups that are predominantly prisons .
The publicly accessible Census data does not describe which methods of enumeration were used in which prisons , nor does it allow us to separate incarcerated responses from non-incarcerated responses in the same block group .
For these reasons , we can not be more precise about low imputation rates of prisons where prisoners filled out long forms ; but the internal Census data will contain this information .
The Census Bureau should conduct a review of its records as to how individual prisons where enumerated and compare that with the imputation rate generally and the migration imputation rate specifically , in order to determine which of the enumeration methods used in 2000 was the most successful at accurately capturing complete data that they did n't need to impute .
With almost 1 % of the population in prison -- and 12 % of young Black men -- it is critical that the Census Bureau count this population fairly and accurately .
VIII .
What reform would look like -- 3 options .
Although this document expresses concern about the impact of prisoner - misenumeration on demographic analysis , its primary concern is with the impact on the political districting process .
As the Census Bureau is currently planning to replace the long form in 2010 with the American Community Survey , we here address only potential changes to data sets based on the short form : PL94 - 171 and Summary Files 1 and 2 .
We discuss three different proposals that would each meet the needs of redistricting data users while potentially also benefiting , but not harming , other data users .
The first proposal counts prisoners only at home in all data products based on the short form .
The second proposal creates alternative tabulations for only the PL94 - 171 redistricting data .
The third proposal is a subset of the second , and would allow users of PL94 - 171 to remove incarcerated populations from the census counts but would not provide the necessary data to credit prisoners back to their home communities .
None of these proposals affects the residence rules for prisoners in the American Community Survey .
VIII .
A. Enumerate incarcerated people as residents of their home Census block as part of a new group quarters housing type : " temporarily incarcerated " .
The Census Bureau could change the usual residence rule to count prisoners only as residents of their home Census block in all data products based on the short form : PL94 - 171 , Summary File 1 and Summary File 2 .
This new residence rule would be modeled on that designed for non-institutional group quarters :
Count prisoners at the facility only if they do not report a usual and valid address elsewhere .
The Census Bureau should create a new group quarters population type for prisoners : " temporarily incarcerated " .
As a result , prisoners would continue to be excluded from the tables based on the " household " universe , such as Table P16 in Summary File 1 " Population in households " , or Table P17 " Average household size " .
However , prisoner 's home addresses would be indistinguishably represented in the PL94 - 171 redistricting data and in all Summary File 1 and 2 tables based on the total population .
VIII .
B . Allow redistricting data users to choose whether they wish to count prisoners at home , at the facility , or neither , by providing alternative counts for census blocks that contain correctional facilities or the home addresses of incarcerated people .
Alternatively , the Census Bureau could follow the advice of redistricting and Census Bureau expert Nathaniel Persily at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and not decide where to count prisoners .
The Bureau can simply collect both home and facility addresses as described above in section VIII A and publish alternative versions of only the PL94 - 171 redistricting dataset .
As Professor Persily wrote , in a paper submitted to a Census Bureau symposium in 2004 : " In doing so , the Bureau would remain true to its mission as information provider without having to take a stand on exactly where states and localities should place prisoners . "
States and localities could decide what dataset they wish to use .
This proposal is even simpler than it sounds because PL94 - 171 is a very small dataset with only 4 tables of summary statistics on total population , for the population 18 years and over , for different races and for Hispanic / Latino origin .
By contrast , Summary File 1 contains 286 detailed tables plus more than 100 maps and other products .
Summary File 2 contains 47 detailed tables .
It would be possible for the Census Bureau to create a special tabulation of the PL94 - 171 data that would identify the prison populations at the prison and allow jurisdictions to remove prisoners from the census data .
The almost 2 million prisoners counted in Census 2000 were counted within only 5,692 Census blocks , so only that small number of blocks would need to be reported .
Allowing jurisdictions to add the prisoners back to their home addresses would require a second special tabulation of PL94 - 171 tables , which is well within the Bureau 's abilities .
Although there are more than 8 million census blocks , we estimate that perhaps no more than 200,000 census blocks would include the homes of incarcerated individuals .
Because about 3 million census blocks contain no population , the American population lives in only 5 million census blocks .
As the two million prisoners disproportionately come from a small number of communities , it would seem reasonable to expect that only a tiny portion of census blocks would be affected by this special tabulation .
VIII .
C. Allow data users to locate and remove correctional facilities from the PL94 - 171 data , which would be simple to implement with minimal impact on other operations .
Currently , many jurisdictions that might like to remove correctional facilities from the Census cannot do so because the law requires the completion of redistricting before or only shortly after the only Census product to identify correctional facilities -- Summary File 1 -- is released .
Identifying the Census blocks that contain correctional facilities and providing their correctional populations in the PL94 - 171 data is the simplest of the reforms suggested above .
If the Census Bureau feels that insufficient time remains before the 2010 Census to fully implement either proposal A or B ( above ) in full , it could allow PL94 - 171 data users to identify and remove correctional facilities without waiting for the later release of Summary File 1 .
There is no legitimate reason not to implement this reform .
IX .
State and local proposals to adjust census data do not absolve the Census Bureau of the responsibility to change how prisoners are counted .
In previous articles and submissions we have highlighted the efforts of jurisdictions to adjust the federal census data so that it meets their needs and people are counted in the right place .
These efforts are vivid evidence that people would prefer that the Census counted incarcerated people differently .
However , the fact that these jurisdictions can fix the Census Bureau 's mistakes does not mean the Bureau should continue to make them .
In order to fairly serve its data users in state and local government , the Census Bureau must change how it counts prisoners .
As we will show , it is not only inconvenient for data users to fix the Census Bureau 's mistakes , for some communities it would be impossible for practical or legal reasons .
IX . A. Local adjustments of Census counts of prisoners
The New York constitution declares that incarceration does not change a residence .
In rural Franklin County , where almost 11 % of the population reported in the Census is incarcerated prisoners from elsewhere in the state , the chair of the county legislature called ignoring the prisoners during redistricting a " no- brainer " .
He was right .
It made no sense to draw a district around the prisons in the town of Malone that was would be 2/3rd prisoners who did not live in the county .
But there is another relevant issue :
It was possible for Franklin County to take the 2000 Census data , and two years later , take the prisoners out and be left with just the actual residents of Franklin County .
The New York City Council -- in to whose districts most of the prisoners counted in Franklin County actually belong -- had no such choice .
When they drew their districts in 2002 , it was too late to put the prisoners back in to their Census data because the Census Bureau did not collect this information .
In the 2002 Importing Constituents : Prisoners and Political Clout in New York report , the Prison Policy Initiative was able to use correctional data to calculate that the Census Bureau credited 43,740 New York City residents to upstate prison towns , but those records did n't say exactly where in New York City those prisoners reside .
Taking the prisoners out is easy , but putting them back in after the fact is a different matter altogether when the Census Bureau did n't ask the right questions about residence .
IX . B. State adjustments of Census counts of prisoners
A different , legal , problem exists with some state level adjustments .
Kansas currently adjusts the federal census to count students and military at their home addresses for purposes of redistricting .
The state starts the planning for this about a year before the federal census is undertaken and then there is a relatively simple process of fixing the federal census data when it arrives .
Illinois and New York State currently have bills pending that would create similar processes in those states for prisoner counting .
Unfortunately , not every state that wants to can follow suit with a simple change in their statutes .
In Massachusetts , for example , such a statute would violate a 1990 amendment to the state constitution that the " federal census shall be the basis for determining the representative districts " .
Massachusetts , which was the last state to abolish its state census to rely on the federal census precisely because its top court viewed the U.S. Census Bureau 's definition of usual residence to be incompatible with the state constitution 's definition of " inhabitant " , is now stuck .
Unless it changes the state constitution yet again , Massachusetts is forced to use Census data regardless of how illogically the Census Bureau may count the population .
While the state constitutions in New York and Illinois have some flexibility on what data is used for redistricting , many other states are in the same situation as Massachusetts and must use whatever the federal Census provides .
It is therefore critical that the Census Bureau change how it counts prisoners if every state is to be able to fairly draw legislative districts to contain equal numbers of actual residents .
IX . C. Proposals to adjust census do not release the Census Bureau from its obligation to count the population fairly and accurately .
Counting prisoners at the facility probably made sense at the first Census in 1790 when few people were in prison and when the data was not used for redistricting .
Things are different now , and the data collection methods need to change .
Jurisdictions that are impatient waiting for the Census to update its methodology should be commended for taking matters in to their own hands .
But the Census Bureau should not assume that every jurisdiction has the practical ability or even the legal option to fix the Bureau 's mistakes after the fact .
If we want an efficient national fix to the problem of where prisoners are counted in the Census , that solution needs to come from the Census Bureau itself .
X. Conclusions
The decennial census is an extraordinary tool and the effort that goes into it is truly impressive .
We believe that solving this problem of people in correctional facilities is critical - they presently number roughly 0.7 % of the entire population and in excess of 12 % of certain segments of the population ( African American men in their late twenties ) .
Numbers this large need to be enumerated with the greatest possible precision .
In 1999 , then Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt opposed an 11th hour attempt to change how prisoners were counted in the Census .
But more well conceived proposals presented during the 2010 Census planning process have since gained his support .
In 2004 , he wrote that accuracy requires not that just the population be counted , but that they are counted in the correct place .
Fairness is also at stake :
Changes in the criminal justice system over the last three decades call into question the fairness of counting persons where they are imprisoned rather than where they were living when arrested , and to which they return on release .
Current census residency rules ignore the reality of prison life .
Incarcerated people have virtually no contact with the community surrounding the prison .
Upon release the vast majority return to the community in which they lived prior to incarceration .
( In these , and in additional ways , prisoners differ from college students , the other sizable group living , though in their case voluntarily so , away from ' home . ')
With over 1.4 million people in prison , and 650,000 people returning home from prison annually , where to count the incarcerated population is no small matter .
Counting people in prison as residents of their home communities offers a more accurate picture of the size , demographics , and needs of our nation 's communities ...
The next census is still more than 4 years away , but if the Census Bureau begins planning now , there is still time to test and implement even the largest of the proposals suggested here .
The Census Bureau has selected San Joaquin County in California as one of the sites for its 2008 dress rehearsal .
This county contains more than 7,000 prisoners in a number of different facilities and would be an excellent place for the Census Bureau to test and fine tune the optimal way to gather , process and publish the home address information of our nation 's incarcerated population .
We encourage the Census Bureau to make the necessary adjustments and to fulfill its tradition of providing information of the highest quality .
We are available to assist if we can be useful .

THE government has banned the extremist group Islam4Uk , forcing it to change its name to Brian Thompson .
Following a high - level inquiry by the Daily Mail , home secretary Alan Johnson said he had proscribed the organisation under a series of names it goes by including Al Muhajiroun , Beard Force and Anjem and the Hurricanes .
Mr Johnson said : " We can only keep Britain safe from terror by continually restricting the number of names these organisations have access to .
" By forcing them to be constantly ordering new stationery and car stickers we can ensure they have no time to say those horrid things that make the editor of the Daily Mail phone me from the tinfoil - lined , underground capsule beneath his garden shed at three o'clock in the morning . "
He added : " Eventually they will be reduced to using an ever - changing sequence of numbers and not even the angriest young muslim man is going to want to join an organisation that does n't have any words in its name . "
Terror experts have backed the home secretary insisting the IRA was a legal organisation for much of the 1970s allowing it to not only carry out violent attacks but set up a chain of discount carpet warehouses and a frozen food delivery business .
A spokesman for Brian Thompson said : " We expect Brian Thompson to be banned within hours , so we have prepared a series of names to last us until at least mid-March including Phil Jackson , Barbara Evans and Big Jim Barker 's Dixieland Jazz Quartet .
" Anyway , who 's up for having loads of crazy opinions about stuff ? "
The City of Vancouver has drawn fire from safety experts after letting go of its chief electrician just weeks before the opening ceremony of the 2010 Olympic Games .
Ark Tsisserev was the chief electrical inspector and electrical safety manager for the city until his dismissal last month .
The city says his position was eliminated in a recent round of budget cuts , but Tsisserev 's former colleagues say the decision just does n't make sense .
" Why would they let him go before the Olympics ? " said Bill Burr , former chief electrical inspector of B.C .
" The chief electrical safety officer has all kinds of things to do in a busy time like this .
There 's all kinds of temporary installations going up , tents and all those activities that have electrical power in them . "
Dave Jackson worked with Tsissereve until his retirement in 2007 , and said he is one of the best of his profession .
" I was totally surprised to hear Ark had been dismissed , " Jackson said .
" He 's probably recognized as the number one expert in Canada on electrical codes . "
Industry leaders have written to Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson demanding Tsisserev be reinstated -- but the mayor says his plate is already full .
" I 'm not dealing with staffing issues , " Robertson said .
" I 've been full - up with Olympic preparations . "
Robertson added he is sure there are no safety issues with Olympic sites or venues .
The city says a senior building official will handle Tsisserev 's responsibilities , and that electrical inspections will continue as normal .

Press D ( + DK optional ) , then immideatly press Z for fake shot .
This is very effective if used properly ( you will make the Goalkeeper and eventually some of the defenders go the wrong way ) .
You can also use S then Z for fake pass or A then Z for fake lob pass / cross .
The most simple way to get past an opponent is the DK dribbling .
Do n’t forget , when you try this , that you do n’t have to run all the time .
Try to simulate you are going left ( while running slow ) , then go right and in the same time hold E .
You should practice this in order to get it right .
You must make a lot of midfield pressing to get the ball from the opponents .
When the ball is in the midfield you should n’t slide for the ball .
You just have to hold Q and to try to deposes your opponent with a conservative tackle .
When the opponent lobs the ball forward you can press A or S to try making an interception , or press D to clear the ball .
If you have no other option to stop the opponent attackers then hold W to charge the goalkeaper .
Release the key when you think it ’s time for him to make a save .
You can also hold W to make your goalkeaper catch / clear incoming crosses .
Use Q key when you are defending .
If your marking players ( the other players that you ca n’t control at a moment ) are too far from the opponent players hold Q and they will make pressing .
This hepls you to act more quickly when an opponent receives the ball .
Used careful , this tip could let the opponent attackers stay off - side .
When you gave away a corner , it ’s easy to defend if you know how .
Press S until you control the right player , then you should hold on W ( to charge the goalkeeper ) and press D+DK to clear the ball with a defender .
Use E key to move your marker faster .
Do n’t forget to change the set pieces .
This is very important because some set pieces are more effective ( the goalkeapers wo n’t come out for the ball so often ) .
