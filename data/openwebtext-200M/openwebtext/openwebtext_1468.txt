Ronald Reagan is honored by , among other things , an airport , a freeway , an aircraft carrier and -- ironically for a critic of big government -- one of the biggest federal buildings in Washington .
Now , some of the late president ’s admirers are launching a new effort to add another honor : printing his likeness on a $ 50 bill in place of Ulysses S. Grant’s .
In polls of presidential scholars , Reagan consistently outranks Grant , said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry ( R - N.C. ) , who introduced legislation to make the change .
But at least one Democrat who serves on the House Financial Services Committee , where the proposal has been sent , is n’t ready to jettison Grant for “ someone whose policies are still controversial . ”

“ Our currency ought to be something that unites us , ” said Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - Sherman Oaks ) .
Grant admirers , who credit him for leading the Union Army to victory during the Civil War , were none too pleased either .
“ I ’m very upset , ” said Keya Morgan , a New York - based Grant scholar who has a Web page on the 18th president .
“ I have all the respect in the world for Reagan , but what he accomplished is not anywhere as important as what Ulysses S. Grant accomplished . ”
An earlier proposal to put Reagan on the dime in place of President Franklin D. Roosevelt drew objections from Democrats , for whom Roosevelt is as much of a hero as Reagan is for Republicans .
An effort to put Reagan on the $ 20 bill in place of Andrew Jackson drew opposition from Tennessee lawmakers .

A 2005 move to put Reagan on the $ 50 bill never made it out of the House Financial Services Committee , even though Republicans controlled the chamber at the time .
“ President Reagan is indisputably one of the most transformative presidents of the 20th century , ” McHenry said in a letter to colleagues seeking their support .
“ Like President Roosevelt on the dime and President Kennedy on the half dollar , President Reagan deserves a place of honor on our nation ’s currency . ”
The move comes as efforts are underway in California and Nevada to name mountains after Reagan and as planning gets underway for a yearlong observance in 2011 of the 100th anniversary of Reagan ’s birth .

I was reading a recent article in the Los Angeles Times about how the cold spell in Florida is killing many of the nonnative animal life .
Burmese Pythons and African Rock Pythons are buying the farm on a major scale .
Iguanas are falling dead from trees .
Nonnative fish are dying by the thousands .
The Mayan cichlid , walking catfish , and spotfin spiny eel , are among the fish floating lifeless to the water ’s surface .
I would take this to mean that this is nature ’s way of telling these invasive animals to get the hell out of where they do n’t belong .
Not that they had a choice in the matter , as many were brought over on ships , or in the case of the snakes , they were former pets that were let go in the Everglades when the novelty wore off or when the hurricane deposited their former domiciles on FEMA ’s statistical list of trash .
Nevertheless , these animals who thrive in the warmer climes of he tropics will only thrive so long when the temperature takes a dramatic turn .
Yes , I would take this as part of nature ’s way of rearranging the order of things .
I have to wonder what else does nature have in store for us .
We are inundated with dire predictions about global warming , which is not global warming , really , but dramatic climate change .
What ’s this mean ?
It means that not everything will warm up , but in places that are already warm , it will probably get warmer still .
In the colder spots on the climate , it may get colder still .
Yet the Arctic is melting and Florida has a cold spell .
Who knows what is really going on ?
What I do know is that things change .
I have stood in places up on the high desert of Four Corners , Monument National Valley and further North .
It is hard rock , bone dry .
Yet in places you can still see actual dinosaur footprints in what is now rock or really hard ground .
Dinosaur footprints .
I kid you not .
This is the legacy of an earlier time when this vast region was under water , either covered by seawater or vast marshes that prevailed for millions of years .
Things change .
As a civilization that wants to believe that all things are safe and permanent , we have yet to get the memo that the planet is ever changing and in doing so is making things more or less secure at his own universal discretion .
Or in reaction to the conditions we inflict upon our planet .
Suffice it to say that while some of the global changes my be cyclical , it still does n’t mean it is a good idea to pollute the hell out of it .
You ca n’t treat the Earth like a rental car and expect it to run smoothly .
Common sense would have it that dumping poisons into our water , filling our air with toxic crap , and leaving piles of waste on our lands and in our oceans will hardly result in something positive .
Common sense would say if you put poison in water then you will poison yourself when you drink the water , and poison the fish that live in that water .
Who you will eat .
In short , global warming may not be a result of our human transgressions , but our human transgressions are n’t helping things either .
No matter how long we care to live in denial .
You do not have to tie natural cycles and human pollution together to validate the fact the planet is going through changes .
Planetary cycles can still take effect , regardless of human pollution .
But for sure as hell , human pollution is not going to improve the situation , any .
Poison the oceans , the fresh water and the landscape , and it is still poisoned , whether there is climate change or not .
Common sense should bear that out .
But , unfortunately , common sense is not so common .
It took certain people hundreds if not thousands of years to realize that crapping upstream and drinking the same water downstream will result in disease .
People in some spots took thousands of years to correlate sex with the making of babies .
In some places on the globe , it seems it is still the case .
Recognizing the existence of germs took awhile .
And then there is the money factor .
There are those who are making money and those who are making more money by ignoring the obvious .
It is cost effective n the short run to ignore the obvious .
If you take the precautions and impose the industrial standards to eliminate or reduce pollution it will cost you bucks in the short run .
This cuts into your bottom line .
The bottom line in America and most countries is the major modern religion and messing with the bottom line for the sake of such minor considerations as the welfare of humanity borders on sacrilege .
Then there are the people who are allegedly in power .
The legislators .
What was once a somewhat responsible body of lawmakers who tried to oversee the well being of their constituents , looks more like a group of small time hustlers , working the corridors of government for their next corporate handout .
With some exception , most are being paid by their keepers to assure us that all is well and that they are maintaining “ our way of life . ”
They are paid to nod their heads and look the other way , examining their purses and the prospects of future elections , which more often than not conflicts with public interest .
In short , depending on which side of the argument you come down on , most of the exploration of global change and its consequence is based on mixes of scientific research , religious and social conjecture , guesswork , and omission .
Why omission ?
Good question .
We leave a lot of things out of any argument .
We do this out of convenience .
While there are obscure noises about overcrowding , increased strain on an already fragile infrastructure and ecosystem , we do n’t talk much about overpopulation .
We fear for social and political repercussions when entertain the fact that the world has too many people .
We are are overcrowded .
Some of the population is undernourished .
And most of the population is undereducated and hardly prepared for the next decades of the twenty - first century .
We cover this by talking about the unique quality of every human being and making Hallmark cards of our sentiment , without addressing the true dangers that overpopulation will create .
We talk about global warning and claim hundred of millions will die .
What we do n’t do is say that if we keep flooding this planet with the crushing hordes , it will cause natural reaction .
And natural reactions are often grim and consequential .
We cry over an earthquake in Haiti but ignore the fact that overcrowding , ignorance and the rest may well result in a pandemic , the likes of which we have never experienced .
Yes , it is a pity for Haiti , but if watching a quarter million die on one small island is nearly unbearable , what will it be like when hundreds of millions , billions , start dying from previously unknown diseases ?
Diseases for what there will not be a cure .
So we argue out of convenience .
Convenience in this case means we pick and choose the safer salient points while leaving out the dozens of considerations that may really cause us harm .
We find consolation in sentiment when pressing issues loom before us .
We deal in modern day superstitions and embrace the religious either in its traditional form or as some metaphysical salad bar to support whatever half baked theory we are using to confront very real global events .
I would consider that more people have died from ignorance than anything else .
Ignorance has led to war , has caused us to crap upstream and drink downstream .
We overpopulate out of ignorance of the consequences and how it reduces the general well being of this planet .
We declare theory and conjecture as truth and fact , although we have not yet been able to gather all the relevant information .
We are ignorant and proud of it .
Will all this happen ?
It ’s probable but not certain .
History is often a cruel prognosticator of what life has in store .
Historically , civilizations have come and gone .
Civilizations here have vanished .
There is room to speculate that even on other planets what was once living is now long since dead .
But then there is the other side of the coin .
Despite the cold spell in Florida , not every nonnative animal has died .
the smaller pythons are surviving , as they are able to adapt by slipping into smaller rock crevices and other spots that may keep them warm enough to ride out of the cold .
Only half the green iguanas have succumbed .
Maybe it ’s dumb iguana luck , or it is Darwin ’s Laws of Natural Selection , or the Survival of the Fittest , as it is sometimes known .
Or as the more religious will inveigh , it is the hand of divine providence .
I do n’t know .
In the case of how and why some live and others do n’t everyone has a valid opinion .
As long as it remains an opinion and is n’t carved in stone as absolute fact .
What we do know is that things chance .
Nothing remains the same , whether we want it to , or not .
And life goes on .
Karl Rove , who was President George W. Bush 's political mastermind , has divorced after being married for 24 years , Politico reports .
" Karl Rove and his wife , Darby , were granted a divorce last week , " said family spokeswoman Dana Perino , who was Bush 's press secretary .
" The couple came to the decision mutually and amicably , and they maintain a close relationship and a strong friendship .
There will be no further comment , and the family requests that its privacy be respected . "
Here 's what a family friend told Politico :
" After 24 years of marriage , many of which were spent under incredible stress and strain during the White House years , the Roves came to a mutual decision that they would end the marriage .
They did spend Christmas together with their son , and they plan to spend time together in the future .
They maintain a strong friendship , and they both feel that that friendship is a source of comfort and inspiration for their friends and family . "

In a pretty rare and none - too - often seen photograph from 1982 , Steve Jobs can be seen cruising along on a 1966 BMW motorcycle .
The photo originally ran in a 1982 National Geographic article titled “ High Tech , High Risk , and High Life in Silicon Valley ” .
In the article , Jobs is quoted as wishing that the Apple computer becomes the “ Volkswagen of the Industry ” while opining about why his generation was more at ease with computing .
“ For us , computers have always been around , ” Jobs stated , “ That ’s what separates us guys from you guys .
You were born B.C. — Before Computers .
And it ’s because of this place .
I was born here .
When I was 14,1 was asking famous computer engineers here questions .
Apple came out of the microprocessor , created in this valley just five miles from here . ”
The article observes that Jobs also owned a Mercedes at the time , and indeed , it remains his car of choice to this day , but its Jobs ’ love for his BMW that ’s most interesting .
In plaid shirt and jeans , he still prefers , as a friend said , “ to drive his motorcycle to my place , sit around and drink wine , and talk about what we ’re going to do when we grow up . ”
One of Steve Jobs ’ talents is his ability to see the big picture , an often understated gift in the fast moving world of tech .
Jobs understands that while technology moves and morphs at warp speed , the larger technological changes that seep into and affect our culture occur at a much slower rates .
Notably , even the 27 - year old Jobs of 1982 was able to grasp this .
“ The broad integration [ of Computers ] into society , though , is going to be a 10 - or 15 - year process , ” Jobs stated , “ But I believe we are already making a little ding in the universe . ”

Convicted TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez earned $ 75,000 a year working undercover for the U.S. Secret Service , informing on bank card thieves before he was arrested in 2008 for running his own multimillion - dollar card - hacking operation .
The information comes from one of Gonzalez 's best friends and convicted accomplices , Stephen Watt .
Watt pleaded guilty last year to creating a sniffer program that Gonzalez used to siphon millions of credit and debit card numbers from the TJX corporate network while he was working undercover for the government .
Watt told Threat Level that Gonzalez was paid in cash , which is generally done to protect someone 's status as a confidential informant .
The Secret Service said it would not comment on payments made to informants .
Gonzalez 's attorney did not respond to a call for comment .
" It 's a significant amount of money to pay an informant but it's not an outrageous amount to pay if the guy was working full time and delivering good results , " says former federal prosecutor Mark Rasch .
" It 's probably the only thing he was doing – other than hacking into TJX and making millions of dollars . "
Gonzalez 's salary highlights how entwined he was with the government at the time he participated in the largest identity theft crimes in U.S. history .
Gonzalez , 28 , is set for sentencing this week on three indictments covering nearly every headline - making bank - card theft in recent years , including intrusions at TJX , Office Max , Hannaford Brothers , 7 - Eleven and Heartland Payment Systems ( which alone exposed magstripe data on 130 million credit and debit cards ) .
The hacker 's plea agreements contemplate a total prison term of between 17 and 25 years .
Rasch says Gonzalez 's $ 75,000 is nothing compared to the million - dollar payouts some undercover informants get for high - risk , high - value cases such as Mafia investigations .
But Gonzalez 's payments dwarf the meager handouts given previous computer crime informants .
Identity thief Brett Johnson , aka Gollumfun , said he earned $ 350 a week – the equivalent of about $ 18,000 a year – while working undercover in the Secret Service 's Columbia , South Carolina , field office helping catch card thieves .
Johnson was recruited by the agency in 2005 after he was arrested buying merchandise with counterfeit cashier 's checks ; his public service ended 10 months later when agents discovered that , like Gonzalez , Johnson was two - timing them , running a fraudulent tax - return scheme during his off hours that was bringing him an extra $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 each week .
Another carder , David " El Mariachi " Thomas , worked undercover for 18 months for the FBI in 2003 and 2004 running a carding site called The Grifters out of a Seattle apartment .
The bureau paid rent and expenses for him and his live - in girlfriend , and bought the computers he used to run the undercover operation , but did n't pay him a salary .
In the 1990s , informant Justin " Agent Steal " Petersen was reportedly paid $ 200 a week while helping the FBI build a case against Kevin Mitnick , then the number one hacker target on the government 's radar .
For his part , Gonzalez began working for the Secret Service when he was arrested making fraudulent ATM withdrawals in New York .
Under the nickname " Cumbajohnny , " he was a top administrator on a carding site called Shadowcrew .
The agency cut him loose and put him to work undercover on the site , where he set up a VPN the carders could use to communicate – a supposedly secure communications channel that was actually wiretapped by the Secret Service ’s New Jersey office .
That undercover operation , known as " Operation Firewall , " led to the arrest of 28 members of the site in October 2004 .
After the site went down , Gonzalez changed his nick to " Segvec " and moved to Miami where he resumed his life of crime under the noses of the agents who were paying him .
Authorities finally arrested him in May 2008 .
After many months , he directed them to a stash of more than $ 1 million in cash buried in a barrel in the backyard of his parents ' home .
Rasch says a number of factors determine what an informant is paid , such as whether they have specialized technical skills or have infiltrated an underground organization ; whether they 're putting themselves or family members at risk ; and whether the investigations they work involve stolen funds that the government has a good chance of recovering .
" If I 'm working on a case involving $ 20 million in fraud and the government is likely to get some of that money back , $ 75,000 is chump change , " Rasch says .
" They do n't use paid informants that often ....
Criminals will ordinarily cooperate [ without payment ] in return for a non-prosecution " or sentence reduction .
The Department of Justice publishes nonbinding guidelines that discuss the necessity of monitoring informants and assessing a criminal 's suitability to be one , but they do n't provide standards for doing so .
Per the attorney general 's guidelines , two law enforcement representatives are required to witness any payment made to a confidential informant and document the payment in the case files , indicating if it's for information , services or expenses .
The informant must also sign or initial a written receipt .
At the time of the payment , the law enforcement agents are required to advise the confidential informant that the payment may be taxable income that must be reported to the IRS and state agencies .
The Secret Service 's embrace of Gonzalez as a professional informant may have reinforced his criminal behavior .
Gonzalez felt he'd been rewarded for his preoccupation with computers , according to a letter written by his sister to one of his sentencing judges .
" All this seemed okay at the time , but psychologically it was feeding an obsession that in the end would become my brother ’s downfall , " Frances Gonzalez Lago told the court in December .
Gonzalez is set for sentencing Thursday in U.S. District Court in Boston for the TJX , Office Max , and Dave & Buster 's breaches .
He appears in front of a different judge the next day for sentencing on the Heartland , Hannaford and 7 - Eleven thefts .
The government is seeking a sentence of 25 years in prison .

Swimming with dolphins may be sold as a life - affirming experience , but research shows that it can be traumatic for the sea mammals themselves .
So is it time to stop ?
It regularly features as one of those transformative experiences to notch up on the " things to do before you die " bedpost - swim with dolphins and discover the very essence of life .
Many tour operators feature it in holiday packages .
" You will feel completely free and at one with nature as you swim majestically along side these incredible creatures , " is how one sells the experience .
Touching is n't recommended
But now doubt has been cast on health effects of dolphin swimming - not for humans , but the dolphins themselves .
British researchers have found that swimming close to bottlenose dolphins and trying to touch them can be highly stressful for the aquatic creatures - preventing them from resting , feeding or nurturing their young .
Lori Marino , a neuroscientist at Emory university in Atlanta , said they could suffer " psychological problems " stemming from swimming with tourists .
So should thrill - seekers looking for that ultimate life - changing experiences avoid this in future ?
The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) thinks so , primarily because it disturbs dolphins in their natural habitat .
And since dolphins breathe air and so surface regularly , they can be followed by fast - moving vessels like water - skis and speedboats .
" People think if they make a disturbance , the animals will just move away , " says spokesman Mark Simmonds .
" But animals live in certain habitats .
We might displace them , and they may not necessarily have a place that 's equally good to go to . "
Hands off
The study focuses on tours off the coast of Zanzibar , Tanzania , where up to 30 boats will invade one pod and swimmers chase the dolphins in hopes of making physical contact .
This can lead to the dolphins becoming unsettled - especially as the tours run throughout the day .
When dolphins feel sociable , they swim near boats Newcastle University 's Dr Per Berggren , who conducted the research , is equally concerned that if the dolphins leave - they can swim up to 50 miles a day - Zanzibar 's tourism - driven economy will suffer .
" If this activity continues , it eventually will push them away .
We have n't said to stop swimming with the dolphins .
But you need to do this in a very careful way . "
There are tour operators who try to interact with the sea creatures in a more responsible way , by limiting numbers of boats and passengers , and letting the dolphins take the lead .
In the open sea off the coast of Portugal , Amanda Stafford , of The Dolphin Connection , tells clients to wait for the dolphin to approach them - and keep their hands to themselves .
If dolphins are n't feeling sociable , they make it obvious .
" Dolphins in the wild can go in so many directions , " she says .
" You have to be able to read their behaviour to see when they 're interested in socialising . "
But even this is too much , says Mr Simmonds , not least because of the risk of transmitting diseases between humans and dolphins .
" We like people going to see the animals , " he says .
" [ But ] the best thing is to watch the animals from land . "
Dolphins like to travel in pods
And keeping dolphins captive at resorts or aquatic parks is akin to torture , says Dr Horace Dobbs , founder and honorary director of International Dolphin Watch , as it separates these sociable animals from their pods .
" It would be like locking me in a lavatory .
We should respect [ dolphins ] in the same way that we respect other people . "
Humans do seem to feel a sense of kinship with dolphins , intelligent , playful , talkative creatures that they are .
And separate research shows people feel the benefit from getting up close and personal with dolphins , says Dr Dobbs .
This is because dolphins are thought by some , including Dr Dobbs , to emanate " chi " - the essential life force in Chinese medicine , and the basis of various therapies for clinical depression , autism and brain damage .
And Ms Stafford says her own studies in Australia show that when people interact with dolphins , their brainwaves show a more relaxed , dream - like state .
It also stimulates the release of endorphins - known as the happy chemical - which induces feelings of joy .
So we may feel the benefit of swimming with dolphins - but the feeling may not be mutual .
" If a dolphin turns up , hordes of people turn up .
They have an effect on the human psyche , " says Dr Dobbs .

Immigrants from an obscure corner of Mexico are changing heroin use in many parts of America .
Farm boys from a tiny county that once depended on sugar cane have perfected an ingenious business model for selling a semi-processed form of Mexican heroin known as black tar .
Using convenient delivery by car and aggressive marketing , they have moved into cities and small towns across the United States , often creating demand for heroin where there was little or none .
In many of those places , authorities report increases in overdoses and deaths .
Immigrants from Xalisco in the Pacific Coast state of Nayarit , Mexico , they have brought an audacious entrepreneurial spirit to the heroin trade .
Their success stems from both their product , which is cheaper and more potent than Colombian heroin , and their business model , which places a premium on customer convenience and satisfaction .
Users need not venture into dangerous neighborhoods for their fix .
Instead , they phone in their orders and drivers take the drug to them .
Crew bosses sometimes call users after a delivery to check on the quality of service .
They encourage users to bring in new customers , rewarding them with free heroin if they do .
In contrast to Mexico ’s big cartels -- violent , top - down organizations that mainly enrich a small group -- the Xalisco networks are small , decentralized businesses .
Each is run by an entrepreneur whose workers may soon strike out on their own and become his competitors .
They have no all - powerful leader and rarely use guns , according to narcotics investigators and imprisoned former dealers .
Leaving the wholesale business to the cartels , they have mined outsize profits from the retail trade , selling heroin a tenth of a gram at a time .
Competition among the networks has reduced prices , further spreading heroin addiction .
“ I call them the Xalisco boys , ” said Dennis Chavez , a Denver police narcotics officer who has arrested dozens of dealers from Xalisco ( pronounced ha - LEES - ko ) and has studied their connections to other cities .
“ They ’re nationwide . ”
Their acumen and energy are a major reason why Mexican heroin has become more pervasive in this country , gaining market share at a time when heroin use overall is stable or declining , according to government estimates .
The Xalisco retail strategy has “ absolutely changed the user and the methods of usage , ” said Chris Long , a police narcotics officer in Charlotte , N.C. , where competition among Xalisco dealers has cut prices from $ 25 to $ 12.50 per dose of black - tar heroin .
“ It ’s almost like Wal - Mart : ‘ We ’re going to keep our prices cheap and grow from there . ’
It works . ”
Xalisco bosses have avoided the nation ’s largest cities with established heroin organizations .
Instead , using Southern California and Phoenix as staging areas , they have established networks in Salt Lake City ; Reno ; Boise , Idaho ; Indianapolis ; Nashville ; and Myrtle Beach , S.C. , among other places .
From those cities , their heroin -- called black tar because it ’s sticky and dark -- has made its way into suburbs and small towns .
In Ohio , where Xalisco networks arrived around 1998 , black tar has contributed to one of the country ’s worst heroin problems .
Since then , deaths from heroin overdoses have risen more than threefold , to 229 in 2008 , according to the Ohio Department of Health .
The number of heroin addicts admitted to state - funded treatment centers has quintupled , to nearly 15,000 .
In Denver , fatal heroin overdoses rose from six in 2004 to 27 in 2008 after Xalisco networks became established .
The dealers have been especially successful in parts of Appalachia and the Rust Belt with high rates of addiction to OxyContin , Percocet and other prescription painkillers .
They market their heroin as a cheap , potent alternative to pills .
There are no official estimates of how much money Xalisco networks make , but narcotics agents who have busted and interrogated dealers say that a cell with six to eight drivers working seven days a week can gross up to $ 80,000 a week .
Among the idiosyncrasies of Xalisco dealers is that they generally do not sell to African Americans or Latinos .
Instead , they have focused on middle - and working - class whites , believing them to be a safer and more profitable clientele , according to narcotics investigators and former dealers .
“ They ’re going to move to a city with many young white people , ” Chavez said .
“ That ’s who uses their drug and that ’s who they ’re not afraid of . ”
Xalisco networks have expanded despite federal investigations in 2000 and 2006 that sent almost 300 people to prison .
Only in recent years have narcotics agents grasped the full reach of the system and its origins in Xalisco , which lies at the foot of volcanic mountains where opium poppies grow .
The county consists of the town of Xalisco and 20 villages with a total population of 44,000 -- about the size of Los Angeles ’ Silver Lake neighborhood .
Landless sugar - cane workers , eager to grasp their version of the American Dream , provide a virtually endless supply of labor for the heroin networks , one reason the system has proved so hard to eradicate .
The rise of the Xalisco networks is a peculiar tale of dope , poverty and business smarts that connects a remote corner of Mexico with vast stretches of America ’s heartland .
Max tells his story
Two pioneers of the Xalisco model met in the early 1990s in the Northern Nevada Correctional Center , where they were serving time for drug offenses .
One of them agreed to discuss the system ’s beginnings and its spread on the condition that he be identified only as Max , an alias he said he used as a heroin dealer .
Max said he was familiar with the U.S. heroin trade and that his partner , a native of Xalisco , had access to supplies of black tar and workers from his hometown .
When the two were released from prison , Max said , they set up a heroin ring in Reno .
At the time , dealers sold heroin from houses , which police could easily target .
Max and his partner had a better idea : Dealers could circulate in cars and receive instructions via pager ( and later by cellphone ) .
Soon a system evolved : Drivers carried heroin doses in their mouths in tiny uninflated balloons , each about the size of a pencil eraser .
Addicts dialed a number , as if ordering pizza .
The dispatcher would page the driver with a code indicating where to meet the addict .
If drivers were busted , the small amounts of heroin and the absence of paraphernalia reduced the risk of lengthy prison sentences .
To avoid attracting attention , they dressed modestly , drove beat - up cars and never carried weapons .
From Reno , the partners expanded to Salt Lake City , Denver , Honolulu and other cities .
Max said the heroin was manufactured in Xalisco .
According to court records , dealers and investigators , the Xalisco entrepreneurs paid the Arellano - Felix cartel for permission to take it across the border in Tijuana .
The heroin wound up in the Panorama City apartment of a couple from Xalisco , who repackaged it and sent it to the networks via courier or Federal Express , according to federal court records .
Max , who went to federal prison for his role in the scheme , said one reason the system did not evolve into a cartel controlled by one person or family is that Xalisco County is made up of ranchos , small villages famous for their independent spirit and intense rivalries .
“ We ’re real envious of each other .
Families cannot work together , ” he said .
Still the system was there for anyone to use .
It also appeared in Southern California , where many Xalisco immigrants live .
It ’s unclear whether those dealers copied Max and his partner or came up with a similar system on their own .
Returning frequently to Xalisco , immigrants compared notes on how to improve the business model .
As word spread , more farm boys went north to see how it was done .
Youths hired as drivers would learn the business , then go back home and secure their own supplies of black tar .
They returned to the United States as crew chiefs .
“ Whoever gets the customers , it ’s because he ’s got better stuff or better service , ” Max said .
“ Nobody tells anybody what to do . ”
New business model
In the summer of 1995 , Ed Ruplinger , a sheriff ’s narcotics investigator in Boise , noticed Mexicans tooling around town selling heroin packed in small balloons hidden in their mouths .
After arresting a few of them , Ruplinger found they were from a place he ’d never heard of : Nayarit , Mexico .
Tapping their phones with court approval , he discovered most of the calls were placed to a man named Cesar “ Polla ” Garcia - Langarica in Ontario , Calif .
“ He was the first McDonald ’s in town , so to speak , ” Ruplinger said .
Almost all of his calls were to people in Xalisco , later identified as his assistants .
Ruplinger determined that Garcia - Langarica also had cells in Portland , Ore. , Honolulu and Salt Lake City .
He overheard him saying he ’d moved into Boise because competition from other Xalisco networks had forced him out of Denver .
Boise was n’t Garcia - Langarica ’s for long either .
One of his former drivers became a competing crew boss .
Still , “ they were not shooting each other in the street , ” Ruplinger said .
“ They ’d know each other .
It was just a job .
I kept realizing that this is huge . ”
In 1998 , officers raided apartments in Boise .
Five of Garcia - Langarica ’s employees pleaded guilty and received prison terms .
Garcia - Langarica , who was also indicted , remains a fugitive .
In Portland , black - tar heroin had been dealt on downtown streets by Hondurans or Guatemalans -- until the late 1990s .
Then , police noticed that new dealers , all from Nayarit , were making deliveries by car all over the city .
In 1999 , Multnomah County Health Department workers , examining coroner ’s reports , found that deaths from black - tar heroin overdoses had more than doubled since 1996 , to more than 100 a year .
An ad campaign urging junkies not to shoot up alone helped drive down that figure , although lately it has crept back to the levels of the late ‘ 90s .
In Portland and elsewhere , competition among Xalisco dealers and the resulting lower prices changed the nature of the heroin trade .
No longer were burglaries and holdups the measure of a city ’s heroin problem .
Junkies could maintain their habits cheaply .
A spike in overdoses was the mark of black - tar heroin ’s arrival .
“ The classic picture of a heroin addict is someone who steals , ” said Gary Oxman , a Multnomah County Health Department doctor who conducted the study of overdoses .
“ That disappears when you have low - cost heroin .
You could maintain a moderate heroin habit for about the same price as a six - pack of premium beer . ”
It was the same in other cities where Xalisco dealers settled .
In Denver , addicts say the cost of a dose of black tar has dropped as low as $ 8 .
In the Utah County suburbs of Salt Lake City , it was more than $ 50 a dose in the early 1990s .
“ Now we ’re seeing it for $ 10 to $ 15 per balloon , ” said Bruce Chandler , program services manager for the county ’s Foothill Treatment Center .
Eastern expansion
Until the late 1990s , Mexican black - tar heroin was available only west of the Mississippi .
To the east , Colombian powder heroin predominated .
But over the last decade , production of Mexican heroin has climbed rapidly , reaching an estimated 18 metric tons in 2007 , while Colombian output has dropped , partly because of U.S. - funded efforts to eradicate Colombian poppy fields , according to the 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment issued by the U.S. Justice Department .
As a result , “ Mexican criminal groups are expanding Mexican heroin distribution in eastern states , where previously only South American heroin had been available , ” the report said .
Estimates of Mexican and Colombian heroin production in the report suggest that black tar now accounts for two - thirds or more of the U.S. heroin market .
According to narcotics agents and former dealers , Xalisco immigrants drove black tar ’s eastward expansion , moving into Columbus and from there to parts of rural Ohio and Pennsylvania and to Nashville and Charlotte .
In many of these places , heroin had been rare .
Addicts more commonly used prescription pain pills .
Black tar is cheaper than pain medications .
Xalisco dealers exploited that advantage and pushed relentlessly for new customers .
Addicts in Columbus say they offered rewards for referrals to new users : eight or 10 free balloons of heroin for every $ 1,000 in sales an addict brought in .
Typical of these heroin entrepreneurs was a youth who called himself Manny Munoz - Lopez .
He began as a driver in Columbus and rose to become a cell leader when others sold their networks and returned to Mexico .
In 2006 , he expanded to the suburbs of Pittsburgh , where police say he took the name Julio Ramirez .
Prosecutors say he recruited junkies at methadone clinics to be salesmen as well as customers .
Gary Palacios , now serving a prison term in Pennsylvania for selling heroin , said he became Ramirez ’s wholesaler for north Pittsburgh .
Ramirez shook up the local market , he said .
Before , dealers waited for users to come to them .
Ramirez ’s drivers actively sought out customers .
For every 20 balloons an addict bought , Ramirez gave five free ones , Palacios said .
Pittsburgh junkies had been using diluted white powder from Colombia .
“ We brought that tar up and . . . the junkies fell in love , ” Palacios said in a telephone interview .
“ It was way cheaper and way more powerful . ”
In 2007 , state narcotics agents busted the ring , arresting Ramirez , Palacios and others .
Ramirez , sentenced to seven to 15 years for conspiracy to distribute heroin , did not respond to a letter requesting an interview .
“ They really created a market that did n’t exist before they got here , ” said Marnie Sheehan - Balchon , the deputy state attorney general who prosecuted the case .
Xalisco networks soon were operating across the Eastern United States .
In Charlotte , Chris Long noticed them when he became a narcotics investigator in 2001 , and he has been arresting dealers ever since .
“ They ’re all from Xalisco , ” Long said .
Expanding from Charlotte , they carved out territories in Greenville , N.C. , and Charleston and Myrtle Beach , S.C .
“ It will not go away , ” said Will Kitelinger , a Myrtle Beach narcotics agent .
When a driver is arrested , a replacement arrives within two weeks and is quickly up to speed , he said .
“ They literally know where the customers live and go to their houses and introduce themselves . ”
Xalisco ’s Sanchez family turned Nashville into a distribution hub , according to federal investigators and an indictment .
In 2006 , they dispatched a young driver named Hector to Indianapolis to conquer new territory .
“ We were looking to expand the heroin market to more places in the United States , ” Hector said by phone from the federal prison where he is serving time for conspiracy to distribute heroin .
He was interviewed on the condition that his last name not be disclosed .
“ They told me ‘ We ’re going to give you three ounces to go to Indiana . ’
You want to begin in a place that ’s clean and you make it grow . ”
Hector said he paid his drivers , all from Xalisco , $ 1,000 a week plus expenses .
He soon had dozens of customers and was ordering new supplies every four days , he said .
“ It was some of the strongest I ’ve ever seen , ” said Floyd Warriner , a longtime drug user from Indianapolis who is serving a 10 - year federal prison term for conspiracy to distribute heroin .
More than 50 Sanchez workers were arrested in a nationwide bust in 2006 .
But the Xalisco networks continued to proliferate , and their product began to appear in communities where users were n’t prepared for its potency .
Among them was a small town in West Virginia , 160 miles south of Columbus , where before the fall of 2007 , few people had ever heard of black - tar heroin .

Erich Segal , best known as the author of Love Story , died on Sunday of a heart attack , his friend Ned Temko said today .
He was 72 .
Segal wrote the bestselling book about love and bereavement , which became a chart - topping film , in 1969 when he was 32 and a classics professor at Harvard .
As its most famous line , " love means never having to say you 're sorry " , entered popular culture , Segal became a celebrity and regular on TV shows , as well as a commentator on the Olympic games for the ABC network .
However , he continued to write right up to his death , producing more than half a dozen novels , essays , literary criticism and , with his dear friend and comrade - in - comedy , Jack Rosenthal , a new English translation of the opening Friday - night Hebrew prayer for the West London Reform Synagogue .
His last major work , in 2001 , was a scholarly look at the history of comedy , and of dirty jokes , from the ancient Greeks through to Stanley Kubrick 's Dr Strangelove .
Segal is survived by his wife and editorial collaborator , Karen , his elder daughter , the writer Francesca Segal , and his younger daughter Miranda , a student at Bristol University .
MADRID — Greece set off the crisis rattling the euro zone .
Spain could determine whether the 16 - nation currency stands or falls .
The euro zone 's No. 4 economy , Spain has an unemployment rate of 19 % , a deflating housing bubble , big debts and a gaping budget deficit .
Its gross domestic product contracted 3.6 % in 2009 and is expected to shrink again this year , leaving Spain in its deepest and longest recession in a half - century .

Jaclyn Friedman is , in short , a feminist rock star .
She is the executive director of WAM ! : Women , Action & the Media .
She edited the incredible Yes Means Yes ! : Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World Without Rape , and continues the work of dismantling rape culture in her weekly pro-sex column .
She writes as compellingly about taking off her shirt for fun as she does her college sexual assault .
And she has been fucking under these conditions for nearly 20 years .
Fucking while feminist presents a peculiar set of challenges for the pro-sex single .
How do you talk rape culture on a first date while still managing to get laid once in a while ?
How do you find the feminist guy who wo n’t self - flagellate to the point of unfuckability ?
How do you avoid dying alone , basically ?
Friedman agreed to talk to me about establishing a feminist fucking litmus test , the art of locating non-douchey sex partners online , and the secret perks of fucking a feminist .
Sexist :
So I was eating dinner with my boyfriend the other day and I started talking about my opinions on rape kits and shit , and I realized that I could probably never talk about this stuff on a first date with someone I had never met .
JF : And if you were me , you would go the a first date , and he would ask , “ So , what do you do ? ”
My online dating profile says that I ’ve written a book and I ’m writing another one .
So they ask about it .
And then literally ten minutes into a first date I ’m talking about rape culture .
How does that usually work out ?
JF :
The way I hope it will work is that they ask these initial questions before we meet in person .
So then they can go offline and collect their thoughts and then respond to me .
My profile says I ’m a feminist .
So a lot of people who would be really scared off by me , we do n’t get very far .
When the whole Polanski thing was going down , I had this big argument with a guy about Polanski .
First date .
And last one .
Do you have any feminist litmus tests ?
JF : I would like for there to be a set of feminist litmus tests that I could reference and use to find the right guy .
Right now , I feel like I ’m in an endless cycle of asking myself , “ Am I willing to let this slide ? ” I ’m mostly dating guys right now , which is fairly new for me .
From my early 20s to my mid-30s I dated exclusively women and trans men .
I ’m not romanticizing that , like “ it ’s so much easier with women ” — - let me tell you , it ’s not .
But it ’s a different set of questions you have to ask .
I do n’t feel like I can go in to these dates expecting dudes to know as much about feminism or sexuality studies or rape culture , the stuff that I live my life talking about and thinking about .
I feel like I ’m going to die alone if I do that .
. . .
Here is what ’s depressing about dating while feminist .
Feminism is what I do with my life , it ’s how I spend my days , it ’s my job , it ’s not just an opinion I have among many other opinions .
If I had a hardcore litmus test , the pool of men I could date would be so tiny .
And then when you weeded out men who are gay , the men I do n’t find attractive , the men already in monogamous , committed relationships — - really , I would never get laid again .
So I do feel that I have to try to be flexible out of necessity .
But if I were to end up with someone — - and I do want a long - term , stable relationship with someone at some point — - they would have to be feminist on some basic level .
They would have to be .
Right now my basic litmus test is this :
Is he interested in feminist issues when I bring them up ?
And can he talk about them in ways that express curiosity and engagement and respect , instead of defensiveness or dismissiveness or attachment to stereotypes ?
If we can talk about this stuff in ways that are interesting and productive , I can work with it most of the time .
Have you ever turned anyone feminist ?
JF : That would be lovely , would n’t it ?
If I could turn a man feminist with the power of my vagina ?
It has n’t happened yet .
. . .
When I was younger , I dated mostly women and trans men .
Those relationships did n’t work out , obviously , they had their own issues .
But the feminist thing was n’t as much of an issue .
And the only cisgender man I ’ve been in a longterm relationship was a feminist when I met him .
We would have feminism arguments where I was educated by him , and vice versa .
And I thought , well , how lucky I am to have found a feminist guy !
And he ended up being an ass . . . in somewhat unrelated ways .
Is there anything that men can mention in their dating profiles that tips you off to feminist compatibility ?
JF : I ’m e-mailing a guy right now I really want to meet who used the word “ heteronormativity ” in his profile . . . aside from that , which almost never happens , more what I look for is .
. . you know the Bechdel Test for films ?
It states that any good film has to have two female characters who talk to each other about something other than a guy .
Well , this is my test :
When I look at personal ads , I look at their lists of favorite books , movies , and music , and they have to list women in all of those categories .
They do n’t have to have a majority of women , but they have to know that women exist in the culture and be fans of some of them .
It ’s a pretty low bar — - or it should be .
I used to look for guys who do n’t list Fight Club in their favorites , but I ’ve had to relax that rule , because all dudes evidently love Fight Club .
I do draw the line at Ayn Rand .
It ’s more about avoiding red flags than anything else .
. . .
I also do n’t respond to any guy who says they ’re looking for a woman who “ does n’t have drama , ” not because I have a lot of drama , but because I feel like that is code for women who have opinions .
. . .
I also have a couple things in my profile that are screeners , that I ’m hoping will turn off people I do n’t want to be bothered by .
I mention feminism .
I say I ’m a size 16 .
But I do it all in a flirty way , like , ‘ size 16 can be sexy , ” not in a way that says , “ I AM ALL THESE THINGS .
DEAL WITH IT . ”
So when you tell people that you ’re a feminist , do they have assumptions about what the sex is going to be like ?
JF : If you Google me , it ’s pretty obvious where I stand on the sex stuff .
Whenever I end up talking about my work on rape , I also am immediately communicating that I ’m a pro-sex feminist .
. . .
I have been with some men who are surprised that I am , shall we say , less than vanilla in bed . . .
A couple of guys were shocked that I like to play various games in bed , because I ’m a feminist .
That ’s always really interesting to me .
I ’m always like , ‘ Are you kidding me ?
The feminists I know are the craziest women in bed you can find ! ”
Those are the moments where I feel like a one - woman feminist PR machine .
I ’m instructing the world one man at a time that feminists are really fun to sleep with .
So do you meet guys who pass the feminist test but then turn out to be disappointments for other reasons ?
JF : Oh God .
There is a type of feminist guy who is so eager to fall over himself to be deferential to women and to prove his feminist bona fides and flagellate himself in front of you , to the point that it really turns me off .
And it makes me sad , because politically , these are the guys that I should be sleeping with !
You know what I ’m talking about ?
YES .
JF : Everyone knows what I ’m talking about .
And some of them are even really cute !
I want to say to them , “ If you could be a person , like a whole , complicated person , who I feel like I could crack jokes around , then I would really like you . ”
But they ’re so serious about their feminism at every moment that I do n’t feel like a person to them .
I feel like I ’m on a pedestal , almost .
I know that they ’re not going to disagree with anything I say under any circumstances .
And I do n’t feel like I can make a raunchy joke about sex , because they ’ll be horrified .
. . .
I hate to be critical of our allies in any way , because we need them , but there ’s something about that certain kind of hyperfeminist guy that makes them unappealing to date , to me .
I suspect it has something to do with our internal conceptions of masculinity , which is terrible on my part .
I think it ’s also that they have n’t really gotten comfortable with their feminism yet .
JF : Yes .
They have n’t internalized their feminism , so it ’s always being externalized .
And it places a lot of pressure on the women they ’re with .
There ’s this very self - conscious performance of feminism .
And it does sometimes feel like they want a cookie .
. . .
OK , I know this is such a delicate conversation to have , but I want those guys to wake up because those are the guys I want to want to sleep with !
So do you have any other fucking while feminist horror stories ?
JF : . . .
What happens to me that drives me up a tree is this :
The guys who respond to me and are like , ‘ You ’re awesome .
You ’re kind of a hellcat . ”
They think it ’s cool and kind of bad - ass that I ’m outspoken and passionate about things .
They think that ’s really hot .
They ’re into it .
But then when that outspokenness gets applied back to them , it ’s suddenly game - over .
You know the idea of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl ?
She ’s light , and quirky , and she has no inner life of her own , and just there to serve our hero ’s development and erotic interests .
I sort of feel that I get cast in these dudes ’ narratives as the Hellcat Dream Girl , there to prove how bad - ass they are because they ’re dating such a bad - ass woman .
They think it ’s cute or sexy .
But when I use that smart , outspoken bad - assery to challenge their own perspectives , it ’s suddenly not sexy at all .
It happens when they say something that I disagree with , and I act like a person and not someone that is playing out their particular fantasies .
It ’s happened to me a million times . . . they want it as a trophy .
“ Hey , look at my bad - ass girl . ”
They do n’t want to deal with me as a person .
It follows this pattern where it usually comes from a person who seeks me out .
They try to seduce me .
They think I would be an accomplishment to conquer or something .
They seek me out and try to get me interested in them , and then I am , and then they flee .
. . .
I feel like the same thing happened with the guy I dated for two years .
He liked the idea of being a guy who would be with someone like me , but ultimately it turned out that he wanted someone who would n’t challenge him as much , a person who was easier and quicker to sweep away .
I got evidence of that when , within three months of breaking up with me , he was dating a 23 year old who lists her political views on Facebook as “ moderate . ”
Do you ever feel like there ’s a conflict between your life as a professional feminist and your personal life ?
JF : Oftentimes I wonder what the people who know me professionally would think about the compromises I make when I ’m dating .
I wish this were a live conversation where other feminists were weighing in .
I ’d like to know what other women are doing .
Am I making the right compromises here ?
Should dating require these sorts of compromises ?
Is there any tactic that produces better results ? . . .
I feel very unsure about what the best way is to live my politics and have a sex life .
I really feel in the weeds about it .
But it ’s something I think about all the time , and I do n’t feel like I have the answers .

Bag tax raises $ 150,000 , but far fewer bags used
The District's 5 - cent bag tax generated about $ 150,000 during the month of January to help clean up the Anacostia River , even though residents have dramatically scaled back their use of disposable bags , according a report city officials issued Monday .
In its first assessment of how the new law is working , the D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue estimates that city food and grocery establishments issued about 3.3 million bags in January , which suggests a remarkable decrease .
Prior to the bag tax taking effect Jan 1 , the Office of the Chief Financial Officer had estimated that about 22.5 million bags were being issued per month in 2009 .
Council member Tommy Wells ( D - Ward 6 ) , sponsor of the bag tax bill , said the new figures show that city residents are adapting to the law far more quickly than he or other city officials had expected .
" While it 's difficult to project the annual results based on just the first month 's experience , the report shows that residents are making great strides in reducing disposable bag use , " Wells said .
The tax , one of the first of its kind in the nation , is designed to change consumer behavior and limit pollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed .
Under regulations created by the D.C. Department of the Environment , bakeries , delicatessens , grocery stores , pharmacies and convenience stores that sell food , as well as restaurants and street vendors , liquor stores and " any business that sells food items , " has to charge the tax on paper or plastic bags .
A Washington Post poll conducted in January found that District residents were almost evenly split on whether they supported the tax , with 46 percent supporting it and 49 percent opposed to it .
Support for the bag tax was highest in Northwest Washington , where about six in 10 residents supported it .
District officials had estimated that the tax would generate about $ 10 million during the next four years for environmental initiatives .
The money will be sent to the newly created Anacostia River Cleanup Fund , which will spend it on various projects .
But in January , the tax only generated $ 149,432 , suggesting that the bag tax might fall short of revenue projections .
According to Wells , large retailers in the city have reported that disposable bag usage has dropped by more than half since the tax went into effect .
" I 'm thrilled with these results , " Wells said .
" Not only are we reducing the number of disposable bags entering our environment , but we also have new resources flowing in to help with the cleanup of the Anacostia River . "

Even though the idea of formal alignment between the freezes of Debian and Ubuntu did n’t hold , there has been some good practical collaboration between the maintainers of key subsystems .
There are real benefits to this , because maintainers have a much more fruitful basis for sharing patches when they are looking at the same underlying version .
Harmonization for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Debian Squeeze
I think this is where we stand now :
Ubuntu Debian RHEL SLES Kernel 2.6.32 + drm-33 2.6.32 + drm-33 2.6.32 2.6.32 GCC 4.4 4.4 Python 2.6 2.6 OpenOffice.org 3.2 3.2 Perl 5.10.1 5.10.1 Boost 1.40 1.40 X Server 1.7 1.7 Mesa 7.7 7.7 Mono ( thanks Jo Shields ) 2.4- snapshot 2.4-snapshot
I ’m sure there are inaccuracies , please help me keep this up to date , sabdfl on freenode is the best way to reach me .
The RHEL and SLES numbers are third - hand , so up - to - date information would be appreciated .
The actual release dates of Ubuntu LTS and Debian will vary of course , because of different priorities .
And there ’s no requirement that the same base version be used for every major component – there may well be differences allowing for different approaches .
But where we do have it , we ’ll be able to collaborate much more effectively on bug fixes for key upstream pieces .
If a lot of distributions pick the same base upstream version , it greatly increases the value of extended shared maintenance and point releases of that upstream .
Why every two years ?
Two years is a compromise between those who want 1 year releases for better support of cutting - edge hardware and those who want 7 year releases so their software stack does n’t change before their job description does ;-) .
A whole - year multiple has several advantages .
It means we can schedule the processes that are needed for collaboration at the same time of year whenever we need them – unlike 1.5 or 2.5 year cycles .
Three years was felt to be too long for hardware support .
Two years is perceived to be the Goldilocks Cadence – just right .
What are the criteria for choosing a common base version ?
In both the Ubuntu and Debian cases , we ’ll be making a release that we support for many years .
So be looked for versions of key upstreams that will pass the test of time .
Sometimes , that means they ca n’t be too old , because they ’ll be completely obsolete or unmaintainable in the life of the release .
And sometimes that means they ca n’t be too young .
In general , it would be better to be reviewing code that is already out there .
But there are also lots of upstreams that do a credible job of release management , so we could commit to shipping a version that is not yet released , based on the reputation of the community it ’s coming from .
What if there ’s no agreement on a particular kernel , or X or component - foo ?
We will almost certainly diverge on some components , and that ’s quite OK .
This is about finding opportunities to do a better job for upstreams and for users , not about forcing any distro to make a particular choice .
If anyone feels its more important to them to use a particular version than another , they ’ll do that .
Open invitations
It ’s really helpful to have upstreams and other distributions participate in this process .
If you ’re an upstream , kick off a thread in your mailing list or forums about this .
Upstreams do n’t need to do anything different if they do n’t want to , we ’ll still just make the best choices we can .
But embracing a two year cadence is the best way you have to be sure which versions of your software are going to be in millions of hands in the future – it ’s a great opportunity to influence how your users will experience your work .
Of course , we ’d also like to have more distributions at the table .
There ’s no binding commitment needed – collaboration is opportunistic .
But without participating in the conversation one can’t spot those opportunities !
If you represent a distribution and are interested , then please feel free to contact me , or Matt Zimmerman , or anyone on the Debian release management team about it .
I think this is a big win for the free software community .
Many upstreams have said “ we ’d really like to help deliver a great stable release , but which distro should we arrange that around ? ”
Upstreams should not have to play favourites with distributions , and it should be no more work to support 10 distributions as to support one .
If we can grow the number of distributions that embrace this cadence , the question becomes moot – upstreams can plan around that cycle knowing that many distributions will deliver their work straight to users .

Intel Turbo Boost Performance Advantage Revealed
The Intel Core i7 and the Intel Core i5 are Intel 's new desktop processors based on the Nehalem microarchitecture , which evolved from the Core microarchitecture that powered the highly successful Intel Core 2 line of microprocessors .
Like its predecessors , the new Core i7 and Core i5 processors are manufactured using Intel 's high -k ( hafnium ) dielectric and metal gate technology .
However , that is where the similarity ends .
Unlike the Core 2 processors , the new Core i7 and Core i5 processors have a monolithic design .
That means the entire quad - core processor is fabricated on a single die .
The quad - core version of the Core 2 processor , on the other hand , combines two dual - core dies in a multi-chip package ( MCP ) .
The newer Clarksdale core ( powering some Core i5 processors ) also uses the latest 32 nm process technology .
Finally , the Core i7 and Core i5 processors feature a slew of new technologies :
an integrated DDR3 memory controller
a three - tier cache design
QuickPath Interconnect ( or Direct Media Interface for some Core i5 processors )
Intel Turbo Mode technology ( now renamed Intel Turbo Boost )
This article will focus on the mysterious Intel Turbo Boost Technology .
It has been bandied about by Intel as a nifty way to improve the Core i7 and Core i5's performance with older applications that cannot fully utilize its four processing cores , but what exactly is it ?
What Is Turbo Boost ?
Multiple processing cores greatly increase a processor 's performance .
However , the sad fact is that many applications and games are not designed to support more than a single processing core , much less 2 , 4 or even 8 cores .
Unless specifically designed to be multi- threaded , these software will only make use of a single processor core , even if your processor has many more processor cores to spare .
This is a big problem for modern multi-core processors as it squanders most of the processor 's performance - it essentially works like a single - core processor .
If most of your software are single - threaded , then there is very little reason for you to upgrade to a multi- core processor .
You would not be going any faster with the other processing cores just idling away .
This problem became even more of an issue when quad - core processors became common with the introduction of the Intel Core 2 Quad processor and the new Intel Core i7 and Core i5 processors .
Even software that were multi- threaded in nature were mostly optimized for dual - core processors .
This made the quad - core processors pointless in all but a few select applications .
To address this issue , Intel introduced the Turbo Boost Technology in all Nehalem - based processors ( e.g. Intel Core i7 and Core i5 processors ) .
Despite the fancy name , this is really nothing more than a dynamic overclocking feature .
What it does is automatically overclock the processor by 1 - 2 speed bins ( of 133 MHz ) .
Originally conceived to provide a performance boost for single - threaded applications so that the Intel Core i7 / i5 processors will not look like pointless upgrades from the Intel Core 2 family of processors , Intel eventually enabled overclocking for all four cores .
So the Intel Turbo Boost Technology is no longer about improving the quad - core processor 's single - threaded performance .
It has now become a general overclocking feature .
All Nehalem - based processors have a minimum upper limit of one speed bin ( + 133 MHz ) .
Even if all four cores are active , they would be overclocked by at least 133 MHz .
For example , a Intel Core i7 -965 Extreme Edition processor that officially has a clock speed of 3.2 GHz would actually be running at a minimum of 3.33 GHz .
While this may seem like a free upgrade ( which it is , in a way ) , it is also a disingenuous way to make the Nehalem processors seem faster than other processors on a clock - to - clock basis .

The game will link to Toy Soldiers ( pictured up top ) , an Xbox Live Arcade game launching Wednesday .

Though they are linked , the two games are different .
Match Defense is a single - player 2D gem- matching game , a descendant of Tetris Attack and Bejeweled draped in a World War I theme .
Toy Soldiers is a 3D real - time strategy game pitting a player 's collection of vintage war toys against either a computer - controlled enemy force or against other players over Xbox Live .

This pair of World War I games establishes what may be the first connection ever between a Facebook game and a console game .
Players of either game are contributors to a massive virtual war effort , the game 's Microsoft producer Justin Robey explained to Kotaku today .
Those who play the Facebook game can choose a side for the war — Central forces or Allied — and contribute their score totals for every three rounds of the game they play to their side of the war .
Players of the Xbox 360 game , whether competing in solo missions or against friends in multiplayer , will also contribute points to their respective side .
All those points will determine which countries the competing forces take .

Today , for example , via Facebook , I contributed to the Allied effort to take Austria - Hungary .
My side is winning , and the fate of that country will be determined about four hours after this story goes live .
The first side to take eight countries wins the war .
Those who play the Xbox 360 game when it launches tomorrow may be able to sway the fortunes of another battle in the war , but from my office , via Facebook , I 'll either be able to join them or help push them back .
Players can check the status of the war either on Facebook or through a menu option in Toy Soldiers .

Connectivity between game systems is not a new idea .
Nintendo has long tried to sell gamers on the idea of games that link GameBoy or Nintendo DS play to play on Nintendo consoles .
The PlayStation 3 supports a technology that allows people to play some PS3 games remotely via their PSP .
But this idea of pooling Facebook and Xbox 360 gamers into one grand competition has not been executed before .
Nor has a console gamer ever been given the opportunity to — sort of — keep playing an Xbox 360 game even when they 're sitting at their computer at work .

" This is the next big thing in terms of how we can have three screens and a cloud , " Robey told Kotaku .
He was referring to the technology goal of enabling a person to access programs — games , in this case — from any screen , be it TV , phone or computer , all linked together , accessible wherever you are .
The integration between Facebook and Xbox 360 gaming is going to get even tighter very soon .

In about a week , Microsoft will add a feature to Match Defense that will let people connect the game to their Xbox Live accounts .
If they own Toy Soldiers , the 360 game , their point totals in the Facebook game will be multiplied , making their contributions to the war effort even more valuable .
Those who forge that link will have the points they generate on the 360 version of the game contribute to the side of the war they choose on Facebook — regardless of which side they play on the 360 game .
Both factors will make the connected gamers the most potent players in the overall war .
Robey discouraged me from thinking of the connection between Match Defense and Toy Soldiers as Microsoft 's delivery of the company 's long - undelivered promise of Xbox Live Anywhere .
He said that the Live Anywhere idea involves access to one 's Xbox Live friends across devices and providing that Live experience , Gamerscore and all , across devices .
This Toy Soldiers 360 - Facebook link , he said , is more about designing " game experiences that are screen - relevant " and connecting them .

The foundation has been laid .
What can be built upon it may be even more impressive .
When I ran into Match Defense 's lead designer , Ken Lobb , at the DICE gaming summit a couple of weeks ago , we began discussing what all this could become .
Imagine extending one 's experience of playing a console game by playing more of it — or a version of it — on Facebook .
Imagine where Microsoft could go with Achievements and expansions , with making it so that we would always have some way of playing a game we liked — or of beating up on gamers we do n't .
How about a Facebook gamers war vs. Xbox gamers ?
Lobb said this kind of stuff is possible .

Facebook games and console games have linked together this week .
Sign of a big change in game development ?
If nothing else , Robey said , look for more of this from Microsoft in the future .
There is only one conceivable reaction to the fast - spreading crisis in the Catholic church : horror .
Only the most virulent anti-papist could ever have quite envisaged the scale of child abuse and the doggedness of the church 's desire to stifle scandal .
The rest of us are astonished and appalled .
Quite rightly , Angela Merkel saw fit to intervene .
After decades – perhaps we should rather be referring to centuries – of obfuscation , the Catholic church has to be called to account for what has happened .
Since abuse allegations first emerged in the early 90s in the UK and Ireland , the denials , both those of officials and those which ordinary Catholics told themselves , have shifted several times .
Initially the church authorities declared it was just a few bad apples , but last summer the Ryan report exposed decades of systematic abuse of thousands of children in Ireland .
Another line of defence was that it was a particular Anglophone problem with roots in Ireland 's excessively deferential Catholic culture , which had then been exported to the US and Australia .
Now this explanation is falling apart as abuse allegations emerge across Europe in Germany , the Netherlands , Switzerland and Italy .
Last summer , scandal erupted in the Hispanophone media when stories in Spain and Mexico alleged that Marcial Maciel , the Mexican founder of a religious order , the Legion of Christ , and much favoured by Pope John Paul II , was found to have fathered several children .
After allegations of child abuse , the entire order – with institutions in several Latin American countries – is now under investigation by the Vatican .
Oxford church historian Diarmaid MacCulloch argues that this is as he predicted in his book on the Reformation .
Back in 2003 he warned that when allegations of child abuse spread to non-Anglophone countries , the results would be " catastrophic " for the church .
Old cultures of deference have succeeded in repressing the truth for longer , but now even they are disintegrating .
Another defence put forward by many loyal Catholics has been that the incidence of child abuse by religious figures has been broadly in line with secular society ; but even this argument looks increasingly unsustainable .
The current issue of the Catholic weekly , the Tablet , carries a thoughtful article by the head of Berlin 's Institute of Sexology and Sexual Medicine which acknowledges that the church 's celibacy requirement may have appealed – misleadingly appearing to offer a solution – to paedophiles ' conflicted sexuality .
While the debate about disproportion continues , what is increasingly clear is that the church 's determination to preserve its institutional power and authority repeatedly involved suppressing the truth – even when that put children at further risk .
This is utterly bewildering to faithful Catholics raised to revere and trust the institution and its priests .
But it is equally disturbing for those vaguely anticlerical Catholics ( yes , they exist in surprising numbers ) who have tended to regard priests as a necessary embarrassment , an unavoidable irritant whom they did their best to avoid while still finding great inspiration in the faith .
The latter position is hard now to sustain ; what the crisis starkly exposes is that one of the defining characteristics of Roman Catholicism has been the central role of the priest , and that it is fundamentally flawed for two reasons .
Both are rooted in the medieval theology that when a man becomes a priest , his nature is fundamentally changed – he becomes a different sort of human being .
As such , he firstly no longer has the normal human sexual needs ; and secondly , he has a particular authority which deserves ( and expects ) unquestioning respect .
Both assumptions are still widely evident in the Catholic church today .
Many priests have an extraordinarily inflated view of their position – there are exceptions , but they are rare .
Priests belong to a church hierarchy which owes much to the Roman empire .
The pattern of obedience to superior authority ensured that there was no system of the checks and balance essential to prevent abuse of power .
Nor has there been much tolerance for challenge and debate ; an entire institutional culture has increasingly been dominated by the imperative of self - preservation .
The commitment to the prestige and authority of the institution has been paramount – and too often that has been at the cost of individual lives .
Modernity has only exacerbated these tendencies ; the Catholic church became more centralised around a strengthened papacy in the 19th century – at exactly the same time as European states were becoming more democratic .
The result has been an astonishingly successful global institution in some respects , acquiring millions of new adherents over the course of the 20th century in Africa and Asia .
But the necessary impetus for reform has been crippled .
" This is nemesis .
An organisation consumed by hubris was bound to get its comeuppance , " declares MacCulloch , presenter of the BBC 's recent History of Christianity .
" Are we about to see another reformation as the angry faithful reject how they have been conned ? "
Perhaps MacCulloch is too hopeful ; more likely than another reformation is a less dramatic emptying of the European Catholic churches .
The crisis simply accelerates what is already happening : the drift away from a model of religious experience which younger generations find increasingly unintelligible .
Despite all the talk in Ireland and elsewhere of inquiries to ascertain the truth and " rebuild confidence in the church " , such initiatives are very unlikely to achieve that outcome .
Inquiries prompt more lurid headlines as they expose further the scale and detail of the abuse .
They are necessary and important , but they will not save the Catholic church .
The church 's loss of moral authority is only a part of a bigger picture .
Financial ruin provoked by compensation claims is another – as the Boston archdiocese well knows .
And one of the most acute and pressing consequences of the abuse scandal is that it exacerbates the problem that the church is running out of priests as vocations collapse ; a model of religious practice based on the mass will be unsustainable in many parts of Europe within a decade or two .
There will be plenty celebrating the Catholic church 's plight , and it is hard not to agree in some part with MacCulloch , that hubris has played a huge part in this institution 's history and its current crisis .
But it is also important to acknowledge that this is more tragedy than anything else .
For the victims , their families , their congregations – many of whom see no cause for celebration despite their need for truth – and for those causes on which the church has proved a trenchant champion , stirring lazy consciences on the arms race , global inequality and capitalist excess .

The W3C SPARQL Working Group
has published a First Public Working Draft of SPARQL 1.1 Property Paths , which
defines a more succinct way to write parts of basic graph
patterns and also extend matching of triple pattern to arbitrary
length paths .
The group also published six updates , namely :
Turkey has threatened to downgrade its strategic relationship with the US amid nationalist anger over a vote in the US Congress that defined the mass killings of Armenians during the first world war as genocide .
Barack Obama 's administration , which regards
Turkey as an important ally , was today desperately seeking to defuse the row .
It expressed its frustration with the House of Representatives ' foreign affairs committee , which voted 23 - 22 yesterday in favour of a resolution labelling the 1915 massacre of up to 1.5 million Armenians a " genocide " .
A furious Turkey may now deny the US access to the Incirlik air base , a staging post for Iraq , as it did at the time of the 2003 invasion , or withdraw its sizeable troop contribution to the coalition forces in Afghanistan .
On the diplomatic front , the US needs the support of Turkey , which has a seat on the UN security council , in the push for sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme .
Turkey is also helpful to the US on a host of other diplomatic issues in the Middle East and central Asia .
The White House and state department began work today to try to prevent the controversial issue making its way to the floor of the house for a full vote .
In Turkey , Suat Kiniklioglu , the influential deputy chairman for external affairs in the ruling Justice and Development party ( AKP ) , warned of " major consequences " if the resolution was accepted by the full House of Representatives .
" If they choose to bring this to the floor they will have to face the fact that the consequences would be serious – the relationship would be downgraded at every level , " he said .
" Everything from Afghanistan to Pakistan to Iraq to the Middle East process would be affected .
" There would be major disruption to the relationship between Turkey and the US . "
His comments reflected deep - seated anger throughout Turkish society , as well as an official determination to press the Obama administration into making sure the resolution progresses no further .
Turkey withdrew its ambassador to Washington for urgent " consultations " immediately after the vote , which was screened live on nationwide television .
Its foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , appeared to blame the outcome on the White House , and said that describing the 1915 Armenian killings as genocide was an insult to Turkey 's " honour " .
France and Canada have both classified the killings as genocide , unlike Britain .
" The picture shows that the US administration did not put enough weight behind the issue , " Davutoglu told a news conference .
" We are seriously disturbed by the result . "
The mass killing of up to 1.5 million Armenians has long been a highly sensitive subject in Turkey .
While the issue is now more openly debated than in the past , Turkish officials insist that to describe it as genocide equates it with the Nazi Holocaust .
Turkey admits that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died , but disputes suggestions that it was part of a programme to eliminate the population , insisting instead that many died of disease .
It has also suggested that the numbers have been inflated , and pointed out that many Turks died at the hands of Armenians .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , who is on a visit to South America , stressed that both she and Obama opposed the house vote and wanted to see it go no further .
She said any action by Congress was not appropriate .
" We do not believe that the full Congress will , or should , act upon that resolution , and we have made that clear to all the parties involved . "
Asked how she squared her support for the Armenian campaign on the election campaign trail with her new position , she said circumstances had changed , with the Turkish and Armenian governments engaged in talks on normalisation and a historical commission established to look at past events .
" I do not think it is for any other country to determine how two countries resolve matters between them , to the extent that actions that the United States might take could disrupt this process , " she said .
The chairman of the Armenian National Committee of America , Ken Hachikian , who led the lobbying campaign to get the house committee to back the resolution , today dismissed the Turkish threat of reprisals .
" This is part of a Turkish pattern or huffing and puffing .
With the other 20 countries that have passed similar resolutions , they made similar threats and then it was business as usual , " he said .
Hachikian , who is based in Washington , said he hoped the vote would go to the full house before 24 April , Armenian genocide commemoration day .
He accused Obama and Clinton of hypocrisy in trying to block a vote , saying they had supported the Armenian campaign during the presidential election .
He said the Turkish government had spent $ 1 m during the past few months lobbying members of Congress .
His committee had spent only $ 75,000 , which included adverts in media outlets read by members of Congress and their staff .
Although Hachikian claimed to have the votes needed , and 215 members of the 435 - member house have publicly backed the resolution , the chances of a full vote are small , given the opposition from the White House and state department .
The vote came as attempts at rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia – which have no diplomatic ties – had already run aground .
A protocol signed in Geneva last October promising to restore relations has yet to be ratified by the parliament of either country .
Both Turkish and Armenian analysts voiced fears that the protocols may now be doomed .
As I 've noted before , Haiti's earthquake recovery problems were exacerbated by the economic and trade policies pushed on them by the United States .
Now Bill Clinton has admitted as much :
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti --
The earthquake not only smashed markets , collapsed warehouses and left more than 2.5 million people without enough to eat .
It may also have shaken up the way the developing world gets food .
Decades of inexpensive imports - especially rice from the U.S. - punctuated with abundant aid in various crises have destroyed local agriculture and left impoverished countries such as Haiti unable to feed themselves .
While those policies have been criticized for years in aid worker circles , world leaders focused on fixing Haiti are admitting for the first time that loosening trade barriers has only exacerbated hunger in Haiti and elsewhere .
They 're led by former U.S. President Bill Clinton - now U.N. special envoy to Haiti - who publicly apologized this month for championing policies that destroyed Haiti 's rice production .
Clinton in the mid-1990s encouraged the impoverished country to dramatically cut tariffs on imported U.S. rice .
" It may have been good for some of my farmers in Arkansas , but it has not worked .
It was a mistake , " Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 10 .
" I had to live everyday with the consequences of the loss of capacity to produce a rice crop in Haiti to feed those people because of what I did ; nobody else . "
Clinton and former President George W. Bush , who are spearheading U.S. fundraising for Haiti , arrive Monday in Port - au - Prince .
Then comes a key Haiti donors ' conference on March 31 at the United Nations in New York .
Those opportunities present the country with its best chance in decades to build long - term food production , and could provide a model for other developing countries struggling to feed themselves .
" A combination of food aid , but also cheap imports have ... resulted in a lack of investment in Haitian farming , and that has to be reversed , " U.N. humanitarian chief John Holmes told The Associated Press .
" That 's a global phenomenon , but Haiti 's a prime example .
I think this is where we should start . "
TENS of thousands of NSW workers face pay cuts of up to $ 370 a week under sweeping Rudd Government workplace reforms .
In a major election - year challenge to Labor , truck drivers , funeral workers , bar staff , aged care nurses and clerks are furious at award changes .
Union leaders claimed the Government had breached its promise that no worker would be worse off .
And the ACTU has warned " unscrupulous " bosses would exploit the new industrial framework to rip off workers and cut pay and conditions .
Nearly 50,000 NSW truck drivers stand to lose up to $ 200 weekly because they will come under a new national award scheme from July 1 .
They now plan to take their protest direct to Canberra with a 1000 - strong convoy organised for June .
While the Prime Minister and Workplace Relations Minister Julia Gillard promised no worker would be worse off under their industrial reforms , a Daily Telegraph investigation reveals this declaration to be another Rudd Government broken promise .
As the ACTU yesterday launched a new assault against Opposition Leader Tony Abbott warning he would bring back WorkChoices and individual contracts Labor 's reforms also carry serious consequences .
The loss of pay and conditions is a result of the Government 's plan to condense the numbers of national and state awards - from more than 2000 to 130 .
As secretary of the Funeral and Allied Industries Union of NSW , Aiden Nye went to the barricades to oust John Howard and his dreaded WorkChoices .
Now the 35 - year industry veteran is fighting to ensure his members are not short - changed .
" Mate , it 's terrible .
And we can only see it getting worse , " Mr Nye says .
" At least a couple of thousand " of funeral sector workers will be hit by award changes from July 1 , including embalmers , who the union boss said would be stripped of up $ 370 a week .
Ms Gillard defended the Award Modernisation and said workers could apply to Fair Work Australia to ensure their pay was not cut .
Vanessa McGrath has worked for the past eight years at Campbelltown RSL and will see her hourly rate of pay fall from $ 20 an hour to $ 17 an hour from July .
" It makes me very angry , " Ms McGrath said yesterday .

Wordle is a great site you can use to create word clouds , by simply inputting a ton of text and hitting create after which it will organize them and display the most frequent words , with the most frequent ones in larger font .
Since frequency lists are n't available for all languages on Wiktionary , Wordle is a good way to create your own .
Here 's how to best use it .
First , find a ton of text in the language you are studying .
The more the better , but it does n't have to be unbelievably extensive .
Keep in mind that when using another language you 're going to be talking about subjects you know about anyway ( i.e. if you are a rock climber then you 'll probably have an easy time talking to others about rock climbing and other outdoorsy subjects ) , and in fact choosing content that interests you might even end up with a better frequency list than those on Wiktionary , as they are sometimes biased towards literature and hard news , since that 's where most of the content usually comes from .
And if you just want to chat in the language then find forums and chat rooms to copy content from .
To make things easy , let 's just copy this huge page on the Norwegian Wikipedia on the history of the church in China , as well as the one on the Winter War ( Vinterkrigen ) in order to balance out words on China and the church with some other subjects .
Be sure to save it separately though , as a Wordpad / Notebook / Word - type of file , as you will be altering it later .
Okay , so let 's paste that into Wordle .
Be sure to change the option to remove frequent words , otherwise it will take out words like og ( and ) , er ( is / are ) and so on that you might not know yet .
Doing that gives us the following :
og
og
The default setting for Wordle is 150 words ( this can be changed ) , so there we have a fairly good representation of the 150 most frequent words in Norwegian .
Now comes the fun part .
Most of these words you will know even after a few days studying the language , so begin with the largest word and start taking them out one by one by using find and replace , replacing the words with nothing .
Be sure to use a space in between the words ( e.g.not ) because otherwise it will remove the text from inside other words as well , and ruin everything .
You 'll also need to replace the word with a space or the remaining words will stick together .
Okay , let 's take out og ( and ) , som ( which / as / that ) , av ( of ) , det ( that / it ) , i ( in ) , var ( was ) , for ( for ) , med ( with ) , and til ( to / till ) .
Now those words we removed are gone , and remaining words like de and ble have become the most common .
Let 's remove a lot more this time .
We 'll get rid of en ( a / an for common gender nouns , also one ) , hadde ( had ) , de ( they ) , å ( to , as ineat ) , at ( that , as in I said ) , ikke ( not ) , på ( on / in ) , også ( also ) , et ( a/ an for neuter gender nouns ) , om ( on / about ) , den ( the / it , used for common gender nouns ) , fra ( from ) , and ble ( became ) .
Now the word cloud looks like this .
Much better .
Now that we 've gotten rid of the most common words , the ones left over are a bit more similar in frequency to each other and thus their size has become a bit more normal too .
You can see that since we only took content from two articles certain words like China , Finland and Soviet Union are overrepresented , so when making your own it 's probably best to choose from at least ten different sources in order to avoid that .
And now , after removing the words you already know , just keep the image handy or print it out to carry with you , and begin the process of removing one word at a time as you become familiar with it .
In this way instead of just learning words willy - nilly you 'll be learning words you are most certain to encounter , and that will make texts in the language that much easier to understand that much sooner .
One other interesting note is that Wordle does n't turn words into their dictionary or uninflected forms as most frequently lists do ( e.g. oxen becomes ox and slew becomes slay ) , but this is actually better for the student as words are encountered in daily life in their inflected and conjugated forms , so using this means that you are able to confirm that you understand the words in use , not just as they appear in the dictionary .
Miami , Florida ( CNN ) --
Their stories were chilling : Students at a reform school recounted beatings and sexual assaults at the hands of school administrators and other employees who were supposed to be taking care of them .
But a state investigation into the claims -- which date back to the 1950s and 1960s -- found insufficient evidence to prosecute any former workers at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna , Florida .
Results of the investigation , which was conducted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement at the request of Gov. Charlie Crist , were released Thursday .
The FDLE investigated allegations made by a group of men who said they were beaten and sexually abused when they attended the school about five decades ago .
Read the FDLE 's final report
State Attorney Glenn
Hess told the FDLE he would not pursue any prosecutions in a letter dated February 25 .
" The primary obstacles to bringing criminal cases based on events alleged to have occurred more than 40 years ago are the Constitutional rights to a speedy trial and to due process , " Hess wrote .
" Florida 's statute placing time limitations on prosecutions must also be considered .
In a nutshell , citizens are protected from being prosecuted for crimes that occurred so long ago that preparing a defense would be difficult or impossible .
The claims provided here are an example , " he said .
The allegations against school workers were made by a group of men -- now in their 60s -- who call themselves " the white house boys " after a nondescript white concrete building on the school grounds where they say the beatings and torture were carried out , often with a thick leather strap .
One member of the group , Dick Colon , told CNN the outcome of the investigation shows " Florida is running with a scam and everybody 's behind it . "
" FDLE is whitewashing this thing like you would n't believe , " said Colon , who was interviewed by the FDLE in the investigation .
Colon said he was sent to the school for stealing cars , and went to the " white house " 11 times during his 30 months there , where he suffered unimaginable beatings .
He remembers them as if they happened yesterday , he said .
Colon said he was forced to lie face - down on a blood - soaked pillow that had small pieces of lip , tongue and skin from the previous boy 's beating .
He 'd clench the metal bar of the bed as the strap struck him .
" After that tick , you 'd go ' Aaaahh , ' and then you 'd grab that bar , and go ' Ooooohhhhhhh , ' and the spindles of the bed would bounce , and sometimes the bed would come off the ground , " Colon told CNN .
The FDLE said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from Dozier and more than 100 former students and their relatives .
But the agency acknowledged that most staff members who could have provided information have died .
The report said there were inconsistent accounts from the men about various incidents , and a forensics examination of the " white house " building found no evidence of any blood .
Most of the former students interviewed during the investigation agreed that a wooden paddle or leather strap was used for punishment , the report said , but there was disagreement about the number of spankings and the severity .
" There was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring , " the report said .
" With the passage of over 50 years , no tangible physical evidence was found to either support or refute the allegations of physical or sexual abuse , " it added .
Hess cited another example in his letter , in which a former student said he had been sexually assaulted in a " rape room , " but then admitted he was not sure he had been raped .
" Time has blunted even the accuser 's memory .
Due process demands that the accused be informed of the charge he is to answer with specificity .
These claims do not suffice , " Hess wrote .
Crist also asked the agency to look into 32 unidentified graves on the school grounds .
Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses , rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers .
But the FDLE investigation announced findings in 2009 that it had accounted for all the students .
" Enough information has been corroborated on who is buried there , " Mark Perez , chief of Investigations for the FDLE , said in 2009 .
" We went and identified all of the individuals who perished while in custody . "
Colon said he reacted to the beatings and other events he witnessed by burying the pain inside .
He also said another boy 's terror has left him wrestling with his own best and worst instincts .
He said he walked into the school 's laundry room one day and saw a black teenager inside a large tumble dryer that was running .
He wanted to save the boy , Colon said , and tried to talk himself into being brave .
" I said , ' Do it !
Do it !
Do it ! ' " he recalled , his eyes brimming with tears .
" And then I thought to myself , ' If you do it , they 're gonna put you in there .
You 're gonna be next . '
And I walked away . "
But the FDLE report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence .
" They have no evidence , they say , of any deaths ? "
Colon said angrily .
" When I told them I came out and saw this black boy in the dryer -- did I witness a death or a goddamn birthday party ? "
About 300 of the former reform school students sued former school administrators .
The lawsuit was recently dismissed .
" We 're attempting to move forward with a claims bill in the Florida state legislature to try and achieve justice for our clients , " said Gregory Hoag , one of the students ' attorneys .
One of the men named in the original lawsuit is Troy Tidwell , a former reform school administrator , who still lives near the school grounds in Marianna .
Tidwell refused to cooperate with the FDLE investigation , the agency 's report said , because his cooperation could result in a criminal prosecution .
Now in his 80s , Tidwell did give a videotaped deposition in the civil case last year .
He said the boys at the school who misbehaved were " spanked . "
" Never was a boy beat in my presence , " he said .
Tidwell 's attorney did not respond to CNN 's calls for comment .
Colon says the FDLE 's report about what happened at the school is wrong , and he wants to do his own investigation .
" We 're going to get some ground - penetrating radar , and we have guys who will go and find the bodies , " he said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators may dedicate spectrum to free wireless Internet service for some Americans to increase affordable broadband service nationwide , the Federal Communications Commission said on Tuesday .
The FCC provided few details about how it would carry out such a plan and who would qualify , but will make a recommendation under the National Broadband Plan set for release next week .
The agency will determine details later .
One way of making broadband more affordable is to “ consider use of spectrum for a free or a very low cost wireless broadband service , ” the FCC said in a statement .
The FCC statement was released during a Digital Inclusion Summit aimed at connecting one - third of Americans without home broadband service .
The FCC also said there would also be a recommendation in the broadband blueprint to launch a Digital Literacy Corps of volunteers who would provide training to communities with low rates of adoption .
( CNN ) --
The Mexican military has arrested four more people connected to the killings of 15 people at a January house party in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , bringing the total to seven suspects arrested and one killed , according to documents from the Mexican attorney general 's office obtained by CNN .
Last Sunday the Mexican military , in connection with federal police , arrested Heriberto Martinez , a self - proclaimed member of the Aztecas , a Juarez street gang that acts as the Juarez cartel 's enforcers in the city .
State prosecutors say Martinez committed at least four killings and acted as a lookout during the house party massacre in Villas de Salvarcar , a southern suburb of Juarez , in the early morning hours of January 31 .
The house party slayings of 15 people , most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime , has sparked outrage across the country .
The slayings are thought by officials to be the result of bad intelligence by the cartel and by the gang that carried out the killings .
Another one of the four arrested recently was Luis Alberto Camacho Ramos , alias " El Shoker " or " El Flaco , " who according to documents obtained by CNN confessed to participating in the house party killings .
Ramos , along with admitted drug cartel member Jesus Bustos Renteria , was arrested in the beginning of March , according to the documents .
The documents obtained Saturday , forwarded exclusively to CNN by someone close to the investigation , show that at least one of the four men recently arrested -- Alfredo Arias , alias " Arnold " -- was signaled out during testimony by Aldo Favio Hernandez Lozano , alias " El 18 . "
Lozano was a municipal police officer arrested last month who state prosecutors say was a hit man in the January killings .
During testimony , Lozano said it was Arias who originally called him to order the house party hit .
Arias also supplied the weapons for the killings , Lozano said during testimony .
Arias had been sought in connection with a different killing .
Six people , including 26 - year - old U.S. Air Force Airman David Booher , died in a November 2009 shooting carried out at a strip club in Juarez , according to Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz .
In a press release last week by the Chihuahua State Attorney General 's Office , Arias was identified as the gunman in the strip - club shooting through surveillance video taken at the club .
Still photos included in the documents obtained by CNN show a man who resembles Arias , wearing a hat and hooded sweatshirt , removing a gun from his waist band and opening fire shortly after entering the club .
Arias was caught on March 16 , while driving his son in the colony of Plutarco Elias Calles .
In his possession , according to officials , were dozens of rounds of ammunition and at least 3 guns , including an assault rifle commonly known in Mexico as " un cuerno de chivo " or " goat 's horn " because of the gun 's banana shaped clip .
It is the weapon of choice for drug cartel members in Juarez .
According to the press release , Arias was also the apparent leader of the drug cell " Los Linces , " and it was that cell that ordered the killing on January 31 in southern Juarez .
Another man identified as the mastermind behind the killings -- Adrian Ramirez Armendariz , alias " El Rama " -- was killed by the Mexican military days after the house party killings .
Arias " was at one time in U.S. custody , but was later deported to Juarez , " Reyes said .
" It really underscores the fact that many of the criminals we have in Juarez were illegal aliens in the U.S. that have been deported from the U.S. into Juarez . "
Reyes said in recent years as many as 100,000 Mexican nationals living illegally in the United States have been deported to Juarez , just across the border from El Paso , Texas .
" We did a study of the killings during an isolated period recently and cross-referenced to the date we have of deportation .
We found that 10 percent of those killed in previous months from the time we made this study actually had been deported within the last two years from the U.S. to Juarez . "
CNN could not immediately authenticate whether or not Arias was at one time in U.S. custody .
On Sunday , Reyes told CNN he was looking forward to meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she visits Mexico this week .
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also is scheduled to visit Mexico this week .
The announcement of the arrests comes on the same weekend a funeral was held in El Paso for two of the three people associated with the U.S. consulate in Juarez who were killed last week after they left a social gathering .
Reyes said last week that authorities believe those slayings were carried out by the Barrio Azteca drug gang .
No motive has been revealed , and no arrests have been made .
About 200 U.S. federal , state and local authorities interviewed more than 100 Barrio Azteca members and associates in El Paso and southern New Mexico on Thursday , the U.S. Justice Department said .
Municipal bonds are where a lot of the political kickbacks and corrupt deals are typically hidden , so I can't say I 'm surprised .
In fact , it 's sort of funny that the governments dealing with these guys apparently thought they could trust them , considering how crooked the business is .
Lie down with dogs , rise up with fleas , as the nuns used to say :
March 26 ( Bloomberg ) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and UBS AG were among more than a dozen Wall Street firms involved in a conspiracy to pay below - market interest rates to U.S. state and local governments on investments , according to documents filed in a U.S. Justice Department criminal antitrust case .
A government list of previously unidentified “ co-conspirators ” contains more than two dozen bankers at firms also including Bank of America Corp. , Bear Stearns Cos. , Societe Generale , two of General Electric Co. ’s financial businesses and Salomon Smith Barney , the former unit of Citigroup Inc. , according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on March 24 .
Gee , look how many were firms that were already taking money from us on the front end .
They wanted the back end , too ?
The papers were filed by attorneys for a former employee of CDR Financial Products Inc. , an advisory firm indicted in October .
The attorneys , as part of their legal filing , identified the roster as being provided by the government .
The document is labeled “ list of co-conspirators . ”
None of the firms or individuals named on the list has been charged with wrongdoing .
The court records mark the first time these companies have been identified as co-conspirators .
They provide the broadest look yet at alleged collusion in the $ 2.8 trillion municipal securities market that the government says delivered profits to Wall Street at taxpayers ’ expense .
Excuse me while I rush to my fainting couch .
I 'm a little dizzy from the shock .
“ If the government is saying they are co-conspirators , the government believes they have sufficient evidence that they can show they were part of the conspiracy , ” said Richard Donovan , a partner at New York - based law firm Kelley Drye & Warren LLP and co-chair of its antitrust practice .
Donovan is n’t involved in the case .
The government ’s case centers on investments known as guaranteed investment contracts that cities , states and school districts buy with the money they receive through municipal bond sales .
Some $ 400 billion of municipal bonds are issued each year , and localities use the contracts to earn a return on some of the money until they need it for construction or other projects .
The Internal Revenue Service sometimes collects earnings on those investments and requires that they be awarded by competitive bidding to ensure that governments receive a fair return .
The government charges that CDR ran sham auctions that allowed the banks to pay below - market interest rates to local governments . [...]
Banks may choose to cooperate with prosecutors because in light of the government bailout funds they ’ve received “ a guilty plea would just be an absolute disaster for some of these companies , ” said Nathan Muyskens , a partner at Shook , Hardy & Bacon in Washington and former trial attorney with the Federal Trade Commission ’s Bureau of Competition .
“ There have been antitrust investigations where there have been companies involved that were just never indicted , ” he said in a phone interview .
Yes , this is what 's now known as " too big to jail . "
Why , they 're too big for just about anything !

France Miniature is a 5 - hectare outdoor park in the shape of France that contains about 160 outdoor 1/30 - scale models of major French monuments and landmarks .
Monuments are placed in the park to correlate approximately with their real - world locations in France .
Many of the models are animated , and all of the country ’s best known landmarks are represented ( the Eiffel Tower , Versailles , Lourdes… ) .
A system of model trains runs through the park , and animated boats ply the “ Atlantic Ocean ” and the “ Mediterranean Sea ” ( lagoons positioned appropriately around the perimeter of the park ) .
Visitors walk along paved paths to visit the various models .

The vote was broadcast on live television and ending after midnight Serbia 's parliament has passed a landmark resolution apologising for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre - Europe 's worst atrocity since World War II .
The motion , approved by a narrow majority , says Serbia should have done more to prevent the tragedy .
It stopped short of calling the Bosnian war killings a genocide .
The murder of nearly 8,000 Bosniaks ( Bosnian Muslims ) was carried out by Bosnian Serb forces - allies of then - Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic .
The massacre , in what was supposed to have been a UN safe haven , became a symbol for the atrocities of the Balkan wars .
Meanwhile , a Dutch court has rejected an attempt to hold the United Nations responsible for the killings .
Burden ' lifted '
The resolution - which the Serbian government sees as a crucial step in its attempts to join the European Union - was approved after almost 13 hours of heated negotiations in the Belgrade parliament .
AT THE SCENE Mark Lowen , BBC News , Belgrade
It was passed with a majority of just two - highlighting how divisive the Srebrenica massacre remains in Serbia almost 15 years on .
The governing Democratic Party believes this resolution will go some way towards rebuilding Serbia 's image as it strives for EU membership .
But for nationalists , the text reiterates what they see as an unfair demonisation of Serbs .
Survivors of Srebrenica say that real reconciliation can only be achieved if the fugitive general Ratko Mladic is finally apprehended .

The pro-Western governing coalition managed to pass the motion with a slim majority - 127 MPs voted in favour , out of a total of 250 .
Only 173 were present for the vote .
" The parliament of Serbia strongly condemns the crime committed against the Bosnian Muslim population of Srebrenica in July 1995 , " says the text .
It formally extends " condolences and an apology to the families of the victims because not everything was done to prevent the tragedy " .
The head of the governing coalition 's parliamentary group said during the debate that approval would help close a tragic chapter in Balkan history .
" Condemning the crime against the Bosniaks of Srebrenica , while paying respect to the innocent victims and offering condolences to their families , will lift the burden off future generations , " Nada Kolundzija was quoted as saying by Serbia 's B92 website .
But opposition deputies criticised the text , describing it as " shameful " for Serbia .
Some nationalist politicians voted against , while others abstained in protest .
Velimir Ilic , an opposition MP , said : " Why do you want to put a mark on the future generations that they will never wash away ? "
Serbian nationalists had argued that any resolution must also denounce crimes committed by Bosniaks and Croats during the 1992 - 95 war .
Several mass graves have been discovered near Srebrenica The BBC's Mark Lowen in Belgrade says the resolution comes after years of denial in Serbia that the Srebrenica massacre even took place .
The resolution has been criticised by Bosniaks and Muslims in Serbia because it does not describe the Srebrenica massacre as an act of genocide .
It has been recognised as such by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague .
Several Bosnian
Serbs have been convicted over their role in the massacre , when Bosniak men and boys were taken from their families and shot dead .
The town had been designated a UN " safe haven " under the protection of Dutch UN troops .
The Bosnian Serbs ' wartime leader , Radovan Karadzic , is currently on trial in The Hague .
The general accused of masterminding the killings , Ratko Mladic , is still on the run .
Lawyers for the victims ' relatives have tried to hold the Dutch government and the UN accountable for failing to stop the massacre .
But on Tuesday The Hague Appeals Court upheld a 2008 lower court ruling affirming UN immunity from prosecution , which it said was essential for it to be able to carry out its duties around the world .

BBC News , Hubei Province
When Chinese farmer Ding Guangyan married his fiancee last year , local officials quickly seized on the event 's propaganda value .
Mr Ding had only just arrived in the area after being forced to move with his family to make way for a massive engineering scheme .
In total about 330,000 people are relocating as part of the project , which will eventually see water transferred from the wet south to the dry north , where it is desperately needed .
It is the biggest mass migration in China since the Three Gorges Dam project , under which some 1.5 million people have been relocated .
Publicising Mr Ding 's marriage would show that the recently arrived migrants were already settling into their new lives - so the wedding made the local newspapers .
New homes
But the real story behind the family 's move in Hubei province is more complex ; the wedding was good news , but their move has been fraught with difficulties .
In pictures : A step into the unknown Mr Ding 's family have complaints about the new home , the lack of work and the corruption they claim has become associated with their migration .
The South - to - North Water Diversion Project is a multi-billion dollar national scheme aimed at solving northern China 's chronic water shortages .
A series of canals , pipes and pumping stations are being built along three routes in eastern , central and western China .
As part of the central route , Danjiangkou reservoir , which straddles the provinces of Henan and Hubei , is being expanded .
Tens of thousands of people are currently being moved from around the reservoir because their homes and land will soon be under water .
Ding Guangyan and his family - six people in all - are just one group of people affected by the scheme .
They were forced to move last August from the village of Guanmenyan , on the shores of the reservoir in Hubei , to a purpose - built complex near the city of Zaoyang , several hours drive away .
The government gave them compensation , which they used to buy a new house that was built for them , and gave them a small plot of land to farm .
We have n't received a penny .
I feel very sad about it
Ding Guangyu
The upheaval has not been without its good points , such as the wedding between 27 - year - old Mr Ding and his new wife , Liu Yaping , 22 .
They married just a few months after their first meeting - through an intermediary - in an event recorded by the Hubei Daily newspaper .
Yao Guangwen , in charge of Zaoyang 's bureau for migrants , told the newspaper : " This shows that migrants from Danjiangkou are beginning to really integrate , and are living in peace and working contentedly . "
Family divided
But what the state - controlled newspaper did not report was any of the family 's numerous concerns or difficulties , problems they readily told the BBC when we visited .
Officials seized on the wedding as a propaganda opportunity In Guanmenyan they earned a reasonable income growing oranges , but in their new home they have to grow wheat , which is not nearly as profitable .
Mr Ding and his elder brother , Ding Guangyu , may soon have to travel to one of China 's booming coastal cities to find work , splitting up the family .
They also claim that the local government in their former village has sold their old house and kept the money .
" We have n't received a penny .
I feel very sad about it , " said Ding Guangyu , who planned to head back to his former village to try to persuade local officials to hand over the cash .
But this family 's problems will not derail the overall project .
Back in Guanmenyan , in Junxian Township , other residents are preparing to pack up .
In total , more than a third of the village 's 3,000 - odd people are moving .
One of them is Liu Zhengyun , a farmer who has grown oranges in the area 's fertile hills for the best part of three decades .
Like many of those next on the list to move , he is not sure what kind of place the government is preparing for him and his eight other family members .
" No matter how good officials say the land is , I have n't seen it yet , so how can I judge ? " he said .
The compensation for their land and house is pretty good
Ming Tingsong
And uprooting a life will present Mr Liu with other difficulties : he is about to lose his friend , neighbour and chess partner , who is not moving with the next batch of migrants .
Local officials are trying to persuade Mr Liu and others to move by asking them to sacrifice their personal interests for the national good .
But money is also a factor , admitted Ming Tingsong , an official from Junxian 's propaganda department .
" Most of the migrants are willing to move .
Why ?
Because the compensation for their land and house is pretty good - and they 'll get more money after they move , " he said .
But whether they want to go or not , the farmers expecting to relocate have little chance to change their fate .
The water diversion project is already years behind schedule - the central route will not be ready until at least 2014 - but too much has been invested for it to be stopped now .
Directed at migrants , a slogan tied above Guanmenyan 's main street makes this clear .
It reads : " Whether you move earlier or later , you will all have to move . "

Imagine some ugly , underused street in your town , marked by drab buildings , wide streets , and forbidding expanses of parking lot .
If you have to go here at all , chances are you ’d prefer to drive .
Now imagine it remade into a place where you ’d actually want to walk or bike .
There would be broad sidewalks , trees , and streetfront buildings with ground - level windows .
There would be other people walking around too .
Picture this in your mind , if you can .
If you can ’t , digital artist Steve Price might be able to help .
Price builds
Flash animations that show what blighted urban landscapes would look like if they became healthier , safer , and more sustainable places .
Here ’s a rendering of Columbia Pike in Arlington , Va. , in five steps :
Price ’s Berkeley firm , Urban Architecture , builds “ photo - realistic visualizations ” like the ones above for developers , design firms , and local governments seeking approval for their ideas .
The Miami suburb of Kendall , for example , used Price ’s work to pass a walker - friendly master plan .
The work , done mostly with Photoshop , rests on the premise that seeing a proposed development can be more useful to people than receiving lots of information about it .
There are limits , says Price , to explaining a design proposal with things like dwelling - units per acre , setbacks , building heights , traffic volumes , and vehicle - miles traveled .
They might be perfectly good arguments , he says .
They ’re just not how people come to understand and support civic changes .
“ Everybody kind of nods and agrees and knits their brows as they listen to statistics and information about economic development , ” Price said of the public meetings he ’s attended .
“ Then they see the pictures , and that ’s when the smiles occur .
And the ‘ oohs ’ and ‘ ahs . ’
There are two hemispheres of the brain , and it ’s almost like two different people in everybody ’s head , and they respond to the world in very different ways . ”
Price got his start in this arena as a concerned citizen , arguing in the mid-1990s that two Bay Area Rapid Transit stations near his home did n’t need to be surrounded by parking lots .
His wife is Japanese , and he ’d seen much more walker - friendly train stations in Osaka .
He built illustrations based on those .
His previous fine arts work — painting and drawing figures in panoramic landscapes — influenced his approach .
“ I ’ve always been very interested in how visual communication affects people in a completely different way than verbal communication , ” he said .
“ And how profoundly people can be changed without them even being conscious of it , simply by seeing different models . ”
Price ’s projects fit within the realm of New Urbanism , a design philosophy that stresses public spaces , compact design , and smart use of energy and other resources .
He says he ’s worked with designers who “ gold - plate ” their proposals with fancy pavement , expensive streetlamps , and elaborate architecture — much of which does n’t survive in final plans .
But the essential elements , he finds , are wide sidewalks , street - front windows , buildings that are n’t hiding behind parking lots — and trees .
“ Street - side trees are big things , ” he said .
“ It ’s biophilia–people just love living green things in their environment .
And transparency on ground floors of shops , and awnings .
There are certain design standards that seem to be surefire ways of getting positive reactions from people .
It really does n’t require super expensive design work and architecture . ”
The illustrations tend to feature mature trees , which take years to grow , and blue skies , which are difficult for even the best urban planners to guarantee .
And , of course , the images are projections of the future .
Every step of planning , permitting , financing , and building brings potential changes .
No project built off Price ’s images has turned out exactly as he rendered it , he says , but “ generally the ultimate build - out followed the same design rules . ”
There is an element of uncertainty , as there is with any development proposal .
But allowing investors , planning officials , and neighbors to see a version of what the future could look like eliminates some fear of the unknown .
That ’s why Price ’s work holds promise for promoting human - scale communities and even fighting climate change .
Our fossil - fuel economy may be sputtering , but at least it ’s familiar , unlike some mysterious green - tech future .
And do we really want environmentalists — who have been nagging and scolding the public for decades — in charge of engineering resilient homes , vehicles , food systems , and workplaces ?
It can be just plain difficult for Americans to picture homes , neighborhoods , and towns that are sustainable and still pleasant to live in .
Visual depictions like Price ’s take some of the guesswork out of envisioning that future .
And helping people see what the future could be is a key step in recruiting them to help build it .
SAN FRANCISCO 
A handful of presumptive biographers have , over the years , tried to tell the remarkable story of Steven P. Jobs : the youthful visionary who , after being ousted from Apple , the company he helped to found , triumphantly returned to lead a new era of high - tech innovation .
But those efforts lacked one important ingredient : cooperation from Mr. Jobs himself .
Now Apple ’s chief executive is set to collaborate on an authorized biography , to be written by Walter Isaacson , the former managing editor of Time magazine , according to two people briefed on the project .
The book , which is in the early planning stages , would cover the entire life of Mr. Jobs , from his youth in the area now known as Silicon Valley through his years at Apple , these people said .
Mr. Jobs , who will turn 55 on Feb. 24 , has invited Mr. Isaacson to tour his childhood home , one person with knowledge of the discussion said .
Draft Senate Bill Includes 3 - Month Unemployment Benefits Extension
Created : February 09 , 2010 18:52 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
It ’s just an early version — or so the Democrats are saying — but Senate leaders appear to be that much closer to extending the filing deadline for unemployment insurance ( which expires Feb. 28 ) through the end of May .
The additional three months are half what the House passed in December , and an even further cry from the seven months included in the White House budget , not to mention the 10 months being advocated by a number of Senate Democrats .
Still , this would prevent roughly 1.2 million Americans from exhausting their benefits in March .
New Zealand is on a collision course with Australia over its change in position on whaling .
Both countries have attended an informal meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Florida , which aimed to set out an international deal on whaling .
New Zealand has said Australia will have to strike a compromise and abandon its push for a total ban on whaling .
Under an alternative deal , Japan , Norway and Iceland would be able to openly hunt whales , but there would be a reduction in the total catch over the next 10 years .
Paul Watson from the anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd says the New Zealand government has given in to extreme pressure from Japan .
But the New Zealand government says it is still pushing for a ban on whaling in the Southern Ocean .
New Zealand 's representative to the International Whaling Commission , Sir Geoffrey Palmer , says the focus is on reaching a diplomatic agreement .
Australia opposes the plan and its stance forced a stalemate at the commission 's weekend meeting .
Five Major Stock Market Myths Exposed !
I ’ve covered some of the market myths I ’m about to tell you about on occasion in the past .
And I ’ve wanted to consolidate them into a single article for quite some time now .
But my colleague and internationally - respected analyst Robert Precther beat me to the punch , in an article he recently published for his subscribers .
Fortunately , I know Bob well , and I ’m sure he wo n’t mind if I review the lessons he voices in his article with you , borrowing from his excellent research to help make the arguments .
As I ’ve often cited in the past , many of these market myths , if not all of them , are critical to your success as an investor .
So let ’s get right to what I consider are the top five market myths of all time !
Myth # 1 : Interest rates are the principal driver behind stock prices .
How many times have you heard that rising interest rates are bad for the stock market , and that declining rates are good for stocks ?
If you ’re like any average investor , you ’ve heard that theory literally hundreds , if not thousands , of times before .
Tune into any media show today , and I ’m sure you ’ll hear it at least once , if not more .
Most stock brokers , and the majority of analysts and newsletter editors , espouse the same causal relationship between interest rates and stock prices .
But the fact of the matter , the plain truth , is that there is no “ standard relationship ” between interest rates and stock prices .
Period .
Consider the last 10 years of market action …
From March 2000 to October 2002 , the Federal Funds rate declined from 5.85 % to 1.75 % , and the Nasdaq plunged 78 % .
Put simply , stocks and interest rates went down together !
From March 2003 to October 2007 , the Federal Funds rate rose from 1.25 % to 4.75 % … and the Dow exploded higher , launching from 7,992 to 13,930 — a 74.2 % gain !
In this case , stocks and interest rates went higher together !
Think those are oddball , freak occurrences ?
Think again …
From August 1929 to July 1932 , the Fed ’s discount rate fell from 6 % to 2.5 % , and the Dow industrials plunged a whopping 87 % .
In Japan , from December 1989 to March 2003 , the Bank of Japan ’s discount rate fell from 4.25 % all the way down to 0.10 % .
And Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Index ?
It plunged from nearly 40,000 in 1989 to 7,824 in March 2003 , a loss of 80 % .
The fact of the matter is that the relationship between interest rates and stock prices is exactly the opposite of what almost everyone , even the pros , preach :
That they are positively correlated , not negatively correlated .
Contrary to popular belief , there is no standard relationship between interest rates and stock prices .
A little uncommon wisdom teaches you why .
Just think about it for a moment …
When an economy is growing , the demand for money and credit is increasing .
Naturally , so is the cost of money .
And in a growing economy , stock prices should also do well .
So the two — interest rates and stock prices — should be rising together .
Conversely , when an economy is sliding , the cost of money is also falling , as demand for credit contracts .
Makes sense then that stock prices should also be weak , right along with the deflating cost of credit .
Very logical , right ?
But oh , how so very wrong almost all analysts and investors are when it comes to interest rates and stock prices !
Right now , for instance , almost everyone is telling you that if interest rates go up , that spells the death knell for stocks .
Maybe so , but also , maybe not .
I , for one , think that rising interest rates right now would be bullish for stocks .
Reason :
It would be symptomatic of demand coming back into the credit markets , of a heartbeat so to speak , and signs of life in the economy .
Ergo , that would be a bullish sign for stocks .
Next …
Myth # 2 : Rising oil and energy prices are bearish for stocks .
Just like the myth about interest rates , we ’ve all heard this one before , many times too .
The claim :
The increasing cost of energy is a tax on consumers and squeezes corporate profits as well .
Therefore , rising energy prices are bearish for stocks .
Makes sense , right ?
But consider this :
There is no consistent relationship between energy prices and stock prices .
Sometimes energy prices are rising along with stock prices , and sometimes they decline together .
The myth exists simply because the oil crisis of the 1970s still remains fresh in many investors ’ minds , and , for those who were too young at the time , because that ’s what ’s ( wrongly ) taught to them :
That rising oil and energy prices kill stock prices .
The relationship between energy prices and stock prices , if anything at all , historically tends to lean more towards a positive correlation .
Like we ’ve seen in the last year , for instance …
Since its low in March 2009 at 6,440 , the Dow is up more than 65 % .
Simultaneously , the price of oil rose from a low of $ 44.58 to today ’s $ 79.61 , a 78.5 % rise .
Strong demand for energy emanates from an economy that is either doing well , or , is recovering .
So should n’t that be a positive harbinger for stock prices ?
You bet it should .
Another market myth exposed !
Myth # 3 : A widening trade deficit is bad for an economy , and conversely , a narrowing trade deficit is good .
Personally , this is one of my all - time favorites .
And truth be told , I used to be guilty of misinterpreting this one as well .
The claim :
That a widening trade deficit is terrible for stock prices .
The argument goes like this : A country is importing more than it ’s exporting , hence , it ’s shipping more capital offshore than it ’s bringing onshore .
Therefore , domestic stock prices must go down .
Sounds reasonable , does n’t it ?
Appeals to the emotions , right ?
But history proves that it is entirely wrong , and nothing more than a myth .
Fact : From 1976 to 1998 , the U.S. trade deficit ballooned from $ 6.08 billion to $ 166.14 billion , and guess what ?
The Dow Jones Industrials went from 848.63 to 9,343.64 !
In truth , the relationship between the trade deficit or surplus and stock prices is exactly the opposite of what the pundits claim .
In other words , a rising trade deficit is related to rising stock prices , and a narrowing trade deficit with recessions and falling stock prices .
Want more proof ?
Consider what ’s happened to the trade deficit since the Dow peaked in July 2007 at 14,239 :
The trade deficit narrowed from a deficit of roughly $ 701 billion to $ 378 billion , or 46 % !
It ’s a myth that trade deficits are bearish for the stock market .
Myth # 4 : Corporate earnings drive stock prices .
Another great , giant myth , perhaps even the biggest of them all .
The argument :
That if a company ’s earnings are rising , the company must be growing , therefore , its coffers must be filling up with cash to pay dividends , or acquire new products or other companies , and good times are here to stay .
So the company ’s stock price must go up .
Conversely , if earnings are falling , stock prices must go down .
Well , have you ever seen a company announce better - than - expected earnings , and its share price gets clobbered ?
I ’m sure you have , probably oodles of times .
Conversely , you ’ve also seen plenty of companies announce lower - than - expected earnings , and their share prices move up .
The same thing can happen to the broad markets , taken as a whole .
For example , 1973 to 1975 :
The combined earnings of the S&P 500 companies rose strongly for six consecutive quarters , yet the S&P 500 Index fell more than 24 % .
And according to research conducted by analyst Paul Kedrosky , since 1960 , the average annual return on the S&P 500 was greatest when earnings were falling at a clip of 10 % or more …
While the smallest returns on the S&P 500 occurred when earnings were growing at up to 10 % per annum .
Bottom line : Rising corporate earnings does not guarantee rising stock prices , by any means .
Nor does falling corporate earnings guarantee falling stock prices !
It ’s wishful thinking to believe rising corporate earnings will lead to rising stock prices .
Myth # 5 : An economy ’s GDP drives stock prices .
Most investors and most analysts agree : Stock market prices as a whole , especially in terms of total market capitalization , should reflect a country ’s gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sum total of a country ’s overall economic output .
Logical , right ?
But consider the following : From the quarter ending June 30 , 1976 to the quarter ending March 31 , 1980 , GDP rose in 15 of 16 quarters .
Yet the Dow Industrials fell 22 % !
And from April 1 , 1980 to September 30 , 1980 , quarterly GDP contracted , yet the Dow Industrials rose almost 19 % !
Direct positive relationship between GDP and broad stock market prices ?
There is none .
Certainly none reliable enough to make investment timing decisions .
Bottom line to the above five major market myths ( and more to come in future columns ) ?
Actually , I have three bottom lines :
1 . Never assume anything when it comes to the markets …
2. Question everything , and most of all …
3 . Think independently , and exercise uncommon , not common , wisdom !
Stay tuned .
There are some major surprises dead ahead in the markets .
Best wishes ,
Larry

25 Mar 10 , 10:10 Interest rates are the principal driver behind stock prices
In normal times there is a relationship between relative movements in interest rates ( as measured by the relative change in gilt yields ) and equity returns .
This is because in stable times equity prices and govt bond prices tend to go up together .
However , in periods of stress ( i.e. unstable times ) , the relationship between equity returns and yields breaks down .
This can be attributed to a flight to safety effect .
Accounting for regime shifts on a monthly basis you will find this present .
( See www.ica2010.com paper in the consulting section , which highlights this fact ) .
You can use the probabilities of being in a particular state and the current level of interest rates to have a better guess around the risks of large losses .
While you are talking about the fed funds rate in the above , this of course has some impact on the government bond yield curve .
So it is worth considering given your examples are clearly sighting observations in the unstable regime .
Yet , recent advances in fat harvesting and transfer techniques , digital mammography , and the use of adipose derived adult stem and regenerative cells necessitate a re-examination of this longstanding bias against fat transfer breast augmentation
Todd K. Malan , M.D. , board certified cosmetic surgeon , has pioneered a revolutionary new procedure , the Natural Breast Augmentation , which employs the latest technologic advances in fat harvesting , adult stem cell transfers and breast splinting technology to provide women the option of enlarging their breasts using their own fat .
The technique results in breasts that look and feel smoother than conventional cosmetic surgery using implants .
Stem cells enable the fat to grow its own blood supply , thus becoming an integral part of the breast rather than a foreign lump .
Stem cells have the potential to change into any cells in the body ; they are found in most tissues , especially fat .
Autologous fat transfer for breast augmentation and reconstruction has remained a highly debated and controversial procedure following the introduction of these techniques in the U.S. in the late 1980's .
" Yet , recent advances in fat harvesting and transfer techniques , digital mammography , and the use of adipose derived adult stem and regenerative cells necessitate a re-examination of this longstanding bias against fat transfer breast augmentation , " says Malan .
With Natural Breast Augmentation , fat is harvested and collected with Body - Jet fat harvesting device utilizing saddlebags , love handles , lower abdomen , buttocks and thighs for sites of fat donation .
The procedure is unique in that we use the latest technologic advances in fat harvesting as well as adult stem cell transfers .
Cell - enhanced reconstruction uses adipose fat that is a rich source of stem and regenerative cells .
These stem cells are not the controversial embryonic stem cells .
This new procedure uses a special process to ensure that the transplanted cells will live and adapt to the transplantation site ( breasts ) .
After fat removal , the cells are transferred to the Stem Cell processing device which used to separate regenerative and stem cells from fat cells .
The regenerative and stem cells are then washed , concentrated , and enzyme activated .
The activated stem cell mixture is then combined with the fat cells and then injected into fat that is already present in the breast where it fills in and replaces tissue volume .
The injection of the fat along with the stem cells results in a permanent 250 cc to 500 cc overall breast size increase , allowing for a 1 or 2 bra cup size increase .
A pressure splint is then used after the procedure to ensure that the fat remains in place and assists in promoting regeneration of the transferred fat and stem cells .
There are several advantages to Natural Breast Augmentation .
Saline or silicone implants which are considered the standard for cosmetic breast augmentation and reconstruction show complication rates to be as high as 25 % with a re-operation rate of 100 % at 10 years .
Additionally , implants can obscure 15 - 50 % of normal breast tissue on screening mammography making early detection or follow - up of cancer difficult .
Fatty tissue does not exhibit reactive inflammation , rejection , or autoimmune disease .
Natural Breast Augmentation results in excellent cosmetic result including a natural feel to the breasts that is reproducible and permanent .
Unlike implants this procedure will not interfere with future mammograms .
The procedure , performed in conjunction with liposuction allows artistic body re-contouring to complement breast augmentation for a new total - body look .

For most people music is an enjoyable , although momentary , form of entertainment .
But for those who seriously practiced a musical instrument when they were young , perhaps when they played in a school orchestra or even a rock band , the musical experience can be something more .
Recent research shows that a strong correlation exists between musical training for children and certain other mental abilities .
The research was discussed at a session at a recent gathering of acoustics experts in Austin , Texas .
Laurel Trainor , director of the Institute for Music and the Mind at McMaster University in West Hamilton , Ontario , and colleagues compared preschool children who had taken music lessons with those who did not .
Those with some training showed larger brain responses on a number of sound recognition tests given to the children .
Her research indicated that musical training appears to modify the brain 's auditory cortex .
Can larger claims be made for the influence on the brain of musical training ?
Does training change thinking or cognition in general ?
Trainor again says yes .
Even a year or two of music training leads to enhanced levels of memory and attention when measured by the same type of tests that monitor electrical and magnetic impulses in the brai" We therefore hypothesize that musical training ( but not necessarily passive listening to music ) affects attention and memory , which provides a mechanism whereby musical training might lead to better learning across a number of domains , " Trainor said .
Trainor suggested that the reason for this is that the motor and listening skills needed to play an instrument in concert with other people appears to heavily involve attention , memory and the ability to inhibit actions .
Merely listening passively to music to Mozart -- or any other composer -- does not produce the same changes in attention and memory .
Harvard University researcher Gottfried Schlaug has also studied the cognitive effects of musical training .
Schlaug and his colleagues found a correlation between early - childhood training in music and enhanced motor and auditory skills as well as improvements in verbal ability and nonverbal reasoning .
The scientists also discovered that different instruments appear to cause a varying modification within the brain .
Changes in the brains of singers occur in slightly different locations than those seen for keyboard or string players .
The correlation between music training and language development is even more striking for dyslexic children .
Schlaug said .
Schlaug reports that tone - deaf individuals often have a reduced or absent arcuate fasciculus , a fiber tract connecting the frontal and temporal lobes in the brain .
Reduced or damaged arcuate fasciculus has been associated with various acquired language problems like aphasia and also dyslexia in children .
Still more evidence that formal music training strengthens auditory cortex responses came in a study performed by Antoine Shahin , now at Ohio State University in Columbus , Ohio .
Shahin believes that musical training gives an individual the acoustic responsiveness of a child some 2 - 3 years older .
In talking about the affect of music on the brain , he said the studies do not necessarily show that musical training leads to enhanced IQ or creativity .
Shahin said that when a person listens to sounds over and over , especially for something as harmonic or meaningful as music and speech , the appropriate neurons get reinforced in responding preferentially to those sounds compared to other sounds .
This neural behavior was examined in a study that looked at the degree of auditory cortex responsiveness to music and non-familiar sounds as a child ages .
Shahin 's main findings are that the changes triggered by listening to musical sound increases with age and the greatest increase occur between age 10 and 13 .
This most likely indicates this as being a sensitive period for music and speech acquisition .
Glenn Schellenberg from the University of Toronto directly addressed if musical ability makes a person smarter .
Such assessments concerning children are always difficult because of the influence of other factors , such as parental income and education .
Nevertheless , he found that passive listening to music seems to help a person perform certain cognitive tests , at least in the short run .
Actual music lessons for kids , however , leads to a longer lasting cognitive success .
The effects of musical training on cognition for adults , Schellenberg said , are harder to pin down .

The Politics of Media
If you believed what you saw on Tuesday ’s NBC evening news or what you read in the Washington Post ’s lead editorial on Wednesday , you would n’t have a clue that Republicans are engaged in a scorched - earth political strategy to destroy the Obama administration .
Email
Printer friendly Instead , you ’d think that everyday Americans are solidly behind the congressional Republicans in their unanimous opposition to health reform ( NBC ) and that President Barack Obama and the Democrats have done next to nothing to bridge the partisan divide ( the Post ) .
Let ’s start with NBC ’s biased coverage of Obama ’s signing into law the landmark health care reform .
The multi-part opening segment could have been scripted by the Republican National Committee .
“ Make no mistake , ” NBC anchor Brian Williams said , “ for millions of Americans who were not in the East Room [ of the White House ] today , it was the beginning of a fight against what they see as a government health - care behemoth that they have to now live by . ”
Then , after dismissing the White House signing ceremony as a political pep rally of “ giddy supporters ” – and after explaining none of the new law ’s features – NBC lovingly interviewed Republicans about their determination to roll back this government overreach .
NBC correspondent Kelly O’Donnell gave Sen. Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , his say without mentioning DeMint ’s foiled scheme to make health reform President Obama ’s “ Waterloo ” to “ break ” him .
Normally , that would seem like a natural question to ask , but NBC apparently did n’t want to cast the GOP ’s stalwart opposition to the new law as part of any partisan strategy .
NBC ’s reporting also featured comments from Sens. Mitch McConnell , John McCain and John Barrasso explaining their high - minded goals .
O’Donnell also checked out the flood of anti-reform calls coming into two GOP Senate offices .
( No mention was made of the views of Democrats , and there was the usual silence about criticism of the health - reform bill from the Left . )
O’Donnell ’s report was followed by a similarly uncritical look at anti-reform lawsuits from Republican state attorneys general .
Then , NBC did what is called a vox populi , the voice of the common man , except in this case it amounted to tracking down one couple living near Oklahoma City who recited more Republican talking points about the Democrats playing politics and ramming the law through .
NBC 's coverage included no one who either liked the new law or who felt it did n’t go far enough , even though polls show that most Americans either favor the new law or fault it for failing to include a single - payer system or some other form of “ public option . ”
Yes , I know , some MSNBC hosts have addressed those positions as part of the cable network ’s experiment of having a few liberal voices in the evening .
But not only does the NBC evening news reach a much wider audience than MSNBC , but NBC ’s other cable channel , the business - oriented CNBC , has beaten a steady drum against health reform , even predicting a stock market dive if the bill became law .
Instead on Monday and Tuesday , the U.S. stock markets surged , another case of CNBC ’s remarkable record of giving out ideological market advice that could cost its listeners money .
As Comedy Central ’s Jon Stewart joked last year , that if he ’d listened to CNBC ’s bullish advice before the 2008 crash , " I 'd have a million dollars today .
Provided I started with 100 million dollars . "
It may be coincidence but General Electric , which owns NBC and its sister networks , has been running a flurry of ads that amount to paeans to right - wing Republican President Ronald Reagan .
GE , where Reagan once served as the company ’s spokesman , is sponsoring next year ’s gala celebration of the centennial anniversary of Reagan ’s birth .
The WPost ’s Blindness
If you followed up watching NBC by turning to the Washington Post ’s editorial page on Wednesday morning , you ’d find a similar blindness to the Republican strategy of obstructionism .
Anyone who followed the debate on health care would know the Democrats made extraordinary efforts to bring Republicans onboard , including time - consuming negotiations within the Senate Finance Committee and Obama ’s political courtship of Olympia Snowe , R - Maine .
And , even though many of the GOP demands were met , including adding many Republican amendments and subtracting the “ public option , ” Snowe and the other Senate Republicans would n’t even allow an up - or - down vote , forcing the Democrats to line up their 60 - member caucus to shut down a filibuster on Christmas Eve .
However , that ’s not how the Post ’s editorialists saw matters .
“ The bill could have been improved with the inclusion of more Republican ideas – by giving consumers more ‘ skin in the game , ’ for example , to promote cost control , or by reforming the nation 's crapshoot of a malpractice system , ” the Post ’s lead editorial said on Wednesday .
“ Neither party has all the answers .
Most of the country agrees with us on this point , not with the apostles of ideological purity .
A plurality of Americans are independents .
They want pragmatic cooperation , and they want sensible ideas acknowledged regardless of which party promotes them .
“ Fundamental reform passed on party - line votes has less credibility with them and less chance of quickly weaving itself into the American social fabric . ”
Then , the Post added : “ We 're purposely not apportioning blame to one side or the other . ”
But what if one side is more to blame than the other ?
This “ both - sides - are - equally - at - fault ” notion of “ centrist ” journalism fails to recognize that sometimes the truth does n’t rest comfortably in the middle .
Nor do the Post ’s editorialists really believe that it does .
On many other issues , the Post has concluded that the truth lies close to the neoconservative pole , such as the Iraq War ( which the Post enthusiastically supported ) or the Middle East conflict ( where the Post almost always sides with Israel ) .
But the Post is n’t willing to acknowledge that the Republicans embraced a strategy from the start of the Obama administration to take the knees out from under the new President , a game plan very similar to what worked against President Bill Clinton in 1993 - 94 .
The slanted coverage at places like NBC and the Washington Post makes sense if you understand the mix of ideology and careerism that influences mainstream news judgments .
At high levels , the owners and top executives have their pet favorites , whether the Post ’s neoconservatism on foreign policy or GE ’s fondness for Reagan ’s anti-government ideology .
At working levels , reporters and editors know that their livelihoods are protected if they tack in those directions .
It ’s also important to avoid offending the Right , which has invested heavily in attack groups created to go after and " controversialize " wayward journalists .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Lost History . ]
Even if a working journalist realizes how corrupting this process is to the integrity of the news , he or she can personally justify going along under the rationale that it ’s up to someone else – politicians , other journalists or even citizens – to somehow straighten the mess out .
That ’s where independent journalism comes in .
Without strong news outlets willing to tell the truth on important topics , the U.S. democratic Republic has little hope of climbing out of the pit of political ignorance where many Americans find themselves mired .

For the past three months , a 23 - year - old Israeli journalist has been under a secret house arrest over charges that she leaked classified information suggesting that the Israel military violated a legal ruling on killings of militants in the West Bank .
An unusual gagging order preventing reporting of the case by the media in Israel will be challenged next month by Channel Ten TV and the newspaper Haaretz .
The charges against Anat Kam , which could carry a heavy prison sentence if she is convicted , are believed to accuse her of photocopying classified documents during her period of military service .
Although the charges are not thought to specify a particular media outlet or article , there has been speculation that they relate to an investigation by the journalist Uri Blau in Haaretz magazine in November 2008 .
That report suggested that one of two Islamic Jihad militants killed in Jenin in June 2007 had been targeted for assassination in apparent violation of a ruling issued six months earlier by Israel 's supreme court .
While not outlawing assassinations in the West Bank altogether , the ruling heavily restricted the circumstances in which they were permissible , effectively saying that they should not take place if arrest was possible .
Mr Blau 's article said that the assassination of one of the militants killed in Jenin , Ziad Malaisha , had been approved in advance by officers , provided his car did not contain " more than one identified passenger " .
At the time of the shootings the military said it had killed Malaisha and another militant after they opened fire at a joint army and border police patrol .
Ms Kam was arrested more than a year after Mr Blau 's report was published .
At the time of her arrest , she was working for the news service Walla , which until recently was owned by Haaretz .
Discussions between the defence and the prosecution are under way and likely to be completed next week after the Passover holiday .
A date for Ms Kam 's trial has reportedly been fixed for 14 April , with the legal challenge to the gag order scheduled two days earlier in Tel Aviv district court .
The Israeli military declined to comment on the case yesterday .
One of Ms Kam 's lawyers , Eitan Lehman , yesterday declined to discuss details of the case because of what he said was a warrant prohibiting publication .
He said that leaks about the case had come from " the other side and not from us " , including police sources .
He added : " We are doing our best to abide by the terms of the warrant and to obey the law . "
According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency ( JTA ) , a long - established US - based news service which serves the Jewish diaspora , the November 2008 report in Haaretz was approved by Israel 's military censor .
The news agency said that the charges against Ms Kam – which she denies – were under Israel 's espionage and treason laws .
JTA quoted Dov Alfon , editor - in - chief of Haaretz , as saying it was " absurd " to link Ms Kam 's arrest and the 2008 article .
JTA said Mr Alfon had implied that Mr Blau had obtained his information without Ms Kam 's help .
Mr Alfon was quoted as adding : " Haaretz asked the court to lift the gag order , not just in the public interest but also to allow us to defend ourselves from this absurd allegation .
More than a year passed between the publication and her arrest , a year in which Uri Blau published several other front - page articles criticising the army 's conduct . "

IMAX and NASA teamed up to create the Warner Brothers film Hubble 3D , which is ready to launch on the really big screen of your favorite IMAX or IMAX 3D theatre between March and August 2010 .
The NASA STS - 125 mission sent a team of hardy and well - skilled astronauts into orbit about the Earth , about 350 miles ( 565 kilometers ) above the planet 's surface , in order to make some delicate repairs and perform much - needed servicing to the ailing Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) .
The STS - 125 team onboard the space shuttle Atlantis included commander Scott D. Altman , pilot Gregory C. Johnson ; and mission specialists K. Megan McArthur , John M. Grunsfeld , Michael J. Massimino , Michael T. Good , and Andrew J. Feustel .
The May 2009 mission to Hubble involving IMAX is highlighted in the iTWire article ' Hubble repair mission to be on IMAX 3 - D .' The article mentions , Several IMAX 3 - D cameras went along on the mission so astronauts ( space cinematographers , one might say ) could film the sequence of events that now is allowing the Hubble Space Telescope to continue its mission to explore strange new worlds and to see what humans have not seen before out there in the Universe .
Page two continues with information on where to see the space film Hubble 3D .
Directed by Toni Myers , the Hubble 3D film was introduced to the general public at the South By Southwest Film Festival ( March 12 - 21 , 2010 ) in Austin , Texas , during the past weekend in March .
The 43 - minute long space documentary film will now go to forty IMAX and IMAX 3D theaters beginning on Friday , March 19 , and than to over 100 theater locations beginning in August 2010 .
The March 15 , 2010 Reuters article " ' Hubble 3D ' a thrilling Imax ride into space ' states , ' One watches in agonizing detail as the astronauts undertake the treacherous jobs of dealing with stuck or stripped bolts and intricate installations , all performed by space walkers with only their suits between them and instant death . '
And , ' In 3D , believe me , you are there .
But here are the money shots :
The telescope 's new Wide Field Camera and infrared eye can look at -- and shoot -- stars , gas and dust 2.5 million light years out .
Taking those photos and using advanced computer visualization , the film whisks viewers on scientifically realistic flights through time and space . '
Check out more about Hubble 3D at the IMAX website ' Change Your View of Our Universe . '
Be prepared for an irregular countdown ( 10 ... 9 ............ 8 .. 7 ......... 6 ... 5 ............ 4 and , well , you know the rest ! ) .
Page three provides some quotes from astronauts Altman and Massimino , and director Myers .
After seeing the film on Tuesday , March 9 , 2010 , at the movie 's world premiere from the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ( Washington , D.C. ) , U.S. astronaut Scott Altman , the commander of the STS - 125 shuttle mission , stated , [ Space.com : ' Smithsonian Rolls Out Red Carpet for Hubble 3D Premiere ' ]
And , U.S. director Toni Myers , who directed , produced , and edited the Hubble 3D film , also stated while attending the premiere , " I think any film that flies you to the edge of the observable universe is ... a new achievement . " [ Space.com ]
U.S. astronaut Michael J. Massimino , one of the spacewalkers on the STS - 125 Hubble mission , also commented on why this film is so important : " Probably the only frustrating thing about flying in space , or sad thing , is that you can't share everything that you see there with everybody .
This format gives us an excellent opportunity to share this experience with many people . " [ Space.com ]

Today , the city of Angkor in Cambodia lies in ruins .
But a thousand years ago , life there was very different .
Then , Angkor was the heart of the Khmer empire and the largest preindustrial city of its day .
It had a population of a million and an area that rivalled modern Los Angeles .
And the key to this vast urban sprawl was water .
Radar images of the city by the Greater Angkor Project ( GAP ) revealed that Angkor was carefully designed to collect , store and distribute water .
The “ Hydraulic City ” included miles of canals and dikes , irrigation channels for supplying crops , overflow channels to cope with a monsoon , massive storage areas ( the largest of which was 16 km ^ 2 in area ) , and even a river diverted into a reservoir .
Water was the city ’s most precious resource , allowing it to thrive in the most unlikely of locations - the middle of a tropical forest .
But water , or rather a lack of it , may have been part of Angkor ’s downfall .
Brendan Buckley from Columbia University has reconstructed the climate of Angkor over the last 750 years , encompassing the final centuries of the Khmer Empire .
The records show that Angkor was hit by two ferocious droughts in the mid-14 ^th and early - 15 ^th century , each lasting for a few decades .
Without a reliable source of water , the Hydraulic City ’s aquatic network dried up .
It may have been the coup de grace for a civilisation that was already in severe decline .
Many theories have been put forward for the downfall of Angkor , from war with the Siamese to erosion of the state religion .
All of these ideas have proved difficult to back up , despite a century of research .
Partly , that ’s because the area has n’t yielded much in the way of historical texts after the 13 ^th century .
But texts are n’t the only way of studying Angkor ’s history .
Buckley ’s reconstruction relies on a very different but more telling source of information – Fujian cypress trees .
The trees in question grow in Bidoup Nui Ba National Park in neighbouring Vietnam .
They ’re a while away from Angkor in Cambodia but their location is far less important than their age .
These trees have been growing for around a thousand years and they were around when Angkor was in its prime .
Throughout this time , the climate affected their speed of growth .
During years of plenty , they expanded in width far more quickly than during unfavourable drought years .
These trends are reflected in the size of their rings and Buckley sampled those by cutting cylindrical cores from the trees .
These samples could be very accurately carbon - dated and they provide an invaluable record of the climate in Southeast Asia over at least the past 759 years .
In Buckley ’s record , two droughts stood out in terms of their severity and length .
The first one in the mid-1300s was the most sustained period of drought in the region over the last eight centuries .
The second , while shorter , was often more severe , and included the driest year on record - 1403 .
The timings of these droughts coincided with periods when the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean was unusually high .
Buckley suggests that El Nino , a periodic warming of the Pacific , may have driven the two dry spells .
These disasters have been corroborated by other evidence .
Records from Chao Phraya in Thailand also referenced severe droughts in the 14 ^th century , and the dry spells may even have extended into Sri Lanka , India and China .
During this time , the climate also reversed dramatically , with intense monsoons following the two droughts .
These oscillating extremes of too little water following by far too much of it pounded the infrastructure of the Hydraulic City .
Today ’s ruins show signs of the failing structures that marked the city ’s end days .
Assaulted by sediment carried in floods , some canals suffered metres of erosion in a short space of time .
One , which linked the capital with a nearby lake , is now filled with coarse sand and gravel , which suggests that it was rapidly filled by a single flood .
That would have suddenly cut the city off from a major water source .
There are signs that the people of Angkor tried to cope with their fluctuating environment by modifying their network .
However , that ’s easier said than done with a criss - crossing infrastructure that spans a thousand square kilometres .
The complicated lattice of waterways would have struggled to adapt .
Of course , a changing environment was far from the only reason behind the fall of Angkor .
By the time the droughts kicked in , the city was already weakened by social , economic and political strife .
Buckley simply thinks that the climate simply sealed the city ’s demise .
In fact , others have suggested that some force may have pushed the local people to move from inland agriculture to maritime trade .
Buckley says that this transition coincides neatly with the aftermath of the first drought .

Dimitrios Biller , the former counsel for Toyota who has made a personal mission of revealing the automaker 's devious , alleged coverups , was asked by the Congress yesterday to turn over all documents relating to safety and litigation defects involved in his 2008 lawsuit .
Wall Street Journal : Mr. Biller 's attorney , Jeffrey F. Allen , based in Santa Monica , Calif. , said he received the subpoena and planned to turn over the documents to Congress .
Mr. Biller , through Mr. Allen , declined to comment .
Mr. Biller is suing Toyota under federal racketeering laws .
The lawsuit , which says Toyota agreed to a $ 3.7 million severance payment for Mr. Biller , alleges the auto maker and its executives have conspired to " unlawfully withhold and conceal evidence from plaintiffs and obstruct justice in lawsuits against Toyota throughout the United States . "
Biller was recently prevented from releasing the documents by a California arbitrator , which a spokesman for the plaintiff 's attorney has previously said did not contain a " shred of evidence . "
Biller has said that during 2003 - 2007 , when he was counsel for Toyota , he amassed evidence that the company was destroying evidence .
Toyota has consistently denied Biller 's accusations .
The subpoenaed documents are due by Feb. 23 .

Ordinarily , Felix Baumgartner would not need a lot of practice in the science of falling .
He has jumped off two of the tallest buildings in the world , as well as the statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro ( a 95 - foot leap for which he claimed a low - altitude record for parachuting ) .
He has sky - dived across the English Channel .
He once plunged into the black void of a 623 - foot - deep cave , which he formerly considered the most difficult jump of his career .
But now Fearless Felix , as his fans call him , has something more difficult on the agenda : jumping from a helium balloon in the stratosphere at least 120,000 feet above Earth .
Within about half a minute , he figures , he would be going 690 miles per hour and become the first skydiver to break the speed of sound .
After a free fall lasting five and a half minutes , his parachute would open and land him about 23 miles below the balloon .
At least , that ’s the plan , although no one really knows what the shock wave will do to his body as it exceeds the speed of sound .
The jump , expected sometime this year , would break one of the most venerable aerospace records .
For half a century , no one has surpassed ( one person died trying ) the altitude record set by Joe Kittinger as part of an Air Force program called Project Excelsior .
In 1960 , Mr. Kittinger , then a 32 - year - old Air Force pilot , jumped from a balloon 102,800 feet above the New Mexico desert .
Today , at 81 , Mr. Kittinger is a retired colonel and part of the Red Bull Stratos team working on Mr. Baumgartner ’s jump , which is being financed by the energy - drink company .

Chinese police shut down the country 's first gay pageant tonight , just one hour before the event was due to begin .
Participants hoped the contest would help challenge domestic stereotypes about homosexuality , classified as a mental illness until 2001 , and show the rest of the world that gay people could be accepted in China .
But officers arrived at a Beijing nightclub shortly before the Mr Gay China competition started and told organisers it was not properly licensed .
They are understood to have told the venue 's owners that it was " a sensitive issue " .
The event was to feature a swimwear round and talent section , but contestants would also have been judged on their ability to represent the gay community .
The winner was to take part in the Mr Gay Worldwide final in Norway next month .
" I'm about to cry , " said Xue Fei , one of the eight contestants .
" We really wanted to promote the sunny side of gay people . "
He said he believed the pageant had already achieved some of its aims because advance coverage had highlighted gay issues .
But he added : " It 's been a long time since China 's reform and opening policies began and I think it really should follow the steps of the international world .
" In China , the population of gay people is large , but many of them cannot live in the sunshine .
I really hope we can live with our heads held high and face the world happily . "
Another participant , Simon Wang , said he was " disappointed , but not surprised " .
He added : " I think maybe the reason it was cancelled was because they had too much publicity . "
The police officers who came to the venue were friendly and asked questions about homosexuality , said Ryan Dutcher , one of the organisers .
He added : " I 'm very disappointed because we worked hard for this event , but I do n't see it as a major step back .
" Anyone who 's been in China has seen how much the gay community has grown and how people – even the authorities – have become more accepting . "
The organisers had hoped the contest would be acceptable to officials because of other recent events .
Last year , activists in Beijing held a gay film festival for the first time ; previous attempts in 2001 and 2005 were shut down .
Shanghai saw the first gay pride festival on the mainland , although some events were cancelled , despite attempts to keep it low - key .
" I think this is a very stupid decision because showing the beauty of gay people to the world is a very positive thing , " said Wan Yanhai , a well - known gay rights activist , who arrived at the venue after hearing of the cancellation .
" It would have fostered a good international image of China and benefited not only gay people here , but also China as a whole , because it would have shown the image of a harmonious society with gay people living happily in China . "
Gay sex was decriminalised in 1997 , but Sara Davis , executive director of the US - based Asia Catalyst , which supports grassroots activists , said the authorities ' attitudes towards gay events were still very mixed .
" There are progressive elements which show recognising people as gay is not a threat to the government 's stability , but also very conservative elements who are threatened by this activity . "
From genetics to foods that mimic drugs , here are 8 reasons our waistlines are expanding .
Moderate exercise helps middle - aged women avoid putting on the pounds , but only if they are already a normal weight , a new study suggests .
Women who are overweight or obese do not appear to reap the same benefits in terms of weight - gain prevention , the researchers say .
Weight - loss programs can help people shed the pounds , but many people have trouble keeping it off .
The new results could help women figure out how much exercise is sufficient to keep from tipping the scales again .
" The weight creeps back on again , [ and ] people put on all the weight they 've lost , and sometimes more , " study author I - Min Lee of Brigham and Women 's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston , Mass .
In addition , the study lends insight to national recommendations on exercise .
For instance , the current U.S. federal guidelines say people should get 150 minutes of moderate - level activity per week to obtain health benefits and reduce the risk of chronic diseases .
But the guidelines say nothing about weight - gain prevention .
The Institute of Medicine , a non-governmental U.S. organization , recommends that people get an hour of moderate exercise a day , or 420 minutes per week to prevent obesity .
Such drastically different recommendations deserve clarification , Lee said .
Counting pounds
The study involved more than 34,000 women in the United States , and looked at how much weight they gained over a 13 - year period , from 1992 to 2007 .
The women were divided into three groups : those who engaged in less than 150 minutes of moderate - level physical activity per week ; those who performed 150 to 420 minutes of this type of activity per week ; and those who did more than 420 minutes per week , which comes out to one hour a day .
Moderate - level activities included things like brisk walking , gardening and leisurely bicycling .
On average , the women gained about 6 pounds ( 2.6 kilograms ) during the study period .
Those in the two lesser activity groups ( less than 150 minutes or between 150 and 420 minutes ) gained significantly more weight than those who exercised more than 420 minutes a week .
While more physical activity was associated with less weight gain , this finding only held true for " normal " weight women , those with body mass index ( BMI ) of 25 or less .
( BMI is calculated with a person 's height and weight and is considered an indicator of body fatness .
An adult with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight . )
" Among heavier women , there was no relationship between how much [ activity ] a women did and what weight she gained , " Lee said .
However , Lee notes that the physical activity levels included in the study were not very high , and higher levels might be more sufficient at preventing weight gain .
The results are published in the March 24 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
How much should I exercise ?
Here 's what recommendations from the new study might look like :
The results speak to middle aged - women ( average age 54 ) with a normal diet , since that 's who participated in the study .
Only about 13 percent of the women gained less than 5 pounds during the study and did not become overweight or obese .
On average , these women got about 420 minutes of exercise per week .
So if you 're normal weight and want to avoid weight gain as you age , you should get about an hour of moderate exercise per day , the researcher say .
The same recommendations might not apply to overweight and obese individuals , who in the study did not have the same benefits from physical activity as normal - weight individuals .
But that 's not to say heavier individuals should give up exercise , Lee said .
The group differences might come down to how much the individuals move around when they are n't exercising , Lee said .
" In addition to physical activity , it 's also the things that you do in your regular life that contribute to caloric expenditure , " Lee said .
" So it could be that the heavier people are also spontaneously moving less . "
Lee recommends that these individuals still get try to get 150 minutes of exercise per week , since this does have proven health benefits in terms of warding off chronic disease .
" Then if you 're willing to do more , either do more exercise or cut your calories , or a combination of both , " she said .
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health .

At the COCKwash
What 's the fastest way to get a dirty girl wet and horny ?
Give her a sponge and tell her to wash your car .
Nothing excites a horny bitch more than a long hose and the idea that she might just get naked right out in the open .
It 's like shooting fish in a barrel .
Just to prove a point , we gave Mocha - Titted sweetie , Soleil , a bucket full of suds and pointed her in the direction of this dirty car .
The abuse of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , Ripa , is by far the largest element in the revelation last August that 500,000 official requests to access phone and email records were made in 2008 – the equivalent of one in 78 adults coming under some form of surveillance by the authorities in the United Kingdom .
The issue here is about abuse and proportionality , not whether the law has been broken .
Two recent reports suggest that the surveillance of people for misdemeanours is unlikely to decline despite assurances from the government and Home Office that local authorities were being reined in .
A freedom of information request by the Lancashire Evening Post has found that applications made by Lancashire county council under Ripa laws targeted cleaners who failed to show up for work and a care assistant who claimed too much on travel expenses .
" A person in Chorley thought to be selling counterfeit goods via eBay , people pursuing false personal injury claims , and a retailer selling furniture not up to fire safety standards were among those investigated using powers granted under the act , " the paper reported .
In last year 's annual report , the surveillance commissioner , Sir Christopher Rose , raised concerns about direct surveillance such as the bugging of public places , taking photographs of suspects and the use of covert human intelligence such as informants and undercover agents .
Of course this has always been part of police investigation into serious crime , but it is frightening to see these tactics routinely deployed in trivial circumstances .
His fears came to mind when I read a quote in the LEP from Jim Potts , a trading standards officer , who said : " We have simply recorded that a member of staff has seen another member of staff do something at work , in the way that managers can and do every day . "
How easily that trips from Potts 's lips , but what of course he is unwittingly justifying is the informant society .
In Staffordshire a FoI request made of the police by the Express and Star newspaper found that terror laws were being used to monitor drug dealers , people suspected of sex crimes , burglars and thieves .
In 10 cases police tracked people suspected of minor public order offences .
Most people accept , I believe wrongly , that this is part of the modern world but Staffordshire police do not reveal the number of convictions gained by these activities – a vital omission if we are to assess proportionality and effectiveness , or indeed to make larger judgments as to whether terror laws have been allowed to undermine essential values in our society .

Wrap-up
There 's a reason Nintendo calls it the DSi XL , and it does n't have anything to do with your sweater size .
At 6.3 - inches long and 3.6 - inches wide , it 's both taller and wider ( closed and held upright ) than that 1989 Game Boy , and at two - thirds of a pound it 's heftier than either the original DS or PSP .
Less than an inch thin , the handheld is still slender enough to slip into your pocket -- assuming you wear cargo pants -- but the thought is daunting enough we do n't expect most to even try .
Of course , Nintendo is n't letting that heft go to waste -- every ounce contributes to the DSi XL 's phenomenal design .
Though practically every port , light and button from the original DSi is duplicated here in its entirety ( down to the power jack -- you can use the DSi charger ) , Nintendo has crammed in a pair of crisp , clear 4.2 - inch LCD screens with nearly double the original real estate , and further rounded the corner grips so they no longer dig into our palms during extended play .
It 's the comfiest DS we 've held , and the most durable -- the unit barely flexes even when twisted , and closed we felt completely comfortable sitting on the thing .
( Stress testing , anyone ? )
The only missteps are the two oh - so - dull colors available ( which , knowing Nintendo , will soon see remedy ) , and the glossy plastic fingerprint magnet Nintendo inexplicably affixed to the top of the unit -- which developed hundreds of smudges and miniature scratches well before review time .
Please do n't fix what ain't broke , Nintendo ; you got it right with the matte finish DSi .
Sadly , where it really counts -- actually playing games -- the XL has scarcely seen improvement .
The software 's exactly the same , warts and all ; we still had to wade through menus to set up WPA2 security , even as cartridge - based games forced us back to easily - cracked WEP for their WiFi .
The larger screens are a nice touch and do , as Nintendo claims , support wider viewing angles and make text easier on the eyes , but since they are the exact same 256 x 192 resolution , what Nintendo 's done is effectively up the size of each pixel .
In games that already looked pixelated ( especially 3D titles like Mario Kart ) the additional aliasing drove us to distraction , and even games with little motion were noticeably made up of tiny squares on occasion .
Buttons were similarly a mixed bag ; while we liked the additional give on the shoulder triggers , the XL 's clicky D - pad and face buttons are even slightly tighter than that of a new DSi , and gave us stiff thumbs after only a single 3 - lap race in Mario Kart .
The DSi XL is still not a system you 'll be playing in a sunny park , also -- a hair brighter than its predecessors , perhaps , but unplayable is unplayable , and as you 'll see in our gallery , the XL's a good bit dimmer than an iPhone .
Indoors , though , expect to play quite a while ; with a 3.7 v , 1050 mAh lithium - ion battery ( compared to the 840 mAh in the DSi ) we got a solid 5.5 hours of battery on max brightness -- ahead of Nintendo 's estimate of 5 -- which means you can reliably eke out double that duration with the backlight turned up halfway .
The one undeniable improvement in the DSi XL experience is audio quality .
We 're not sure what Nintendo's done to the unit 's speakers other than provide larger grills , but where previous DS units provided only a sizable sound bubble , the XL's two speakers can fill an entire living room with clean audio on max volume .
Believe it or not , it 's the first Nintendo portable where we 'd recommend against using headphones .
The Nintendo DSi XL is a solid handheld ; without a doubt , one of the most solid Nintendo 's ever offered .
But at $ 190 , we 're not sure exactly who the system is for .
If you 've already got a DSi ( or even a Lite ) it 's not a worthwhile upgrade ; for every point in its favor , there 's a trade - off .
We 'd recommend it as a fantastic first DS , if the stereoscopic 3DS was n't just around the corner .
For those looking for the latest and greatest , it 's an interesting choice , but though portable , it 's far too big a bulge in the pants pocket to show off without embarrassment .
In the end , the only ones we can think of are those who Nintendo marketing originally identified ; old folks and those with eyestrain who simply can't do without the larger screens .
Them -- and the younger version of ourselves .
When we were 15 , we crammed our shiny new Game Boy Advance into our overloaded school backpack -- but one day we dropped it , only to hear a sickening crunch .
If we could travel back in time and stick a sturdy DSi XL in there instead , we never would have had to cry over that cracked , inky black LCD screen .

When it needs to act fast , the FBI can do so .
When a YouTube video came to its attention on Friday in San Francisco , the FBI had a Philadelphia man in custody the next day .
A reminder to Internet nutjobs : your IP address can and will be used to hunt you down , so posting threatening rants to YouTube is only a good idea if you 're looking to get arrested .
The FBI 's affidavit gives us a window into how the investigation unfolded , and into just how quickly the Bureau can turn a YouTube link into a home address when necessary .
" I am here with my son , Messiah "
Last Friday , March 26 , the San Francisco office of the Bureau " received a copy of a video that had been removed from the Internet website YouTube .
The video included images of a white male , later identified as NORMAN LEBOON , making threats against United States Congressman Eric Cantor , 7th Congressional District - Virginia .
The video appeared to be homemade and was of good quality .
The face of the white male can clearly be seen . "
This video was clearly something special ; in it , Leboon railed against Cantor 's " cupcake evil wife " and called the Congressman " a liar ... a lucifer ... a pig ... an abomination . "
Pretty over - the - top , especially when Leboon went after Cantor 's kids and called them " Lucifer 's abominations , " then started talking about bullets that " will be placed in your heads . "
Leboon did not keep his threats to himself ; he has uploaded numerous videos to YouTube , including one that made threats against YouTube itself .
Sitting in his bathrobe in front of a webcam , Leboon recorded the piece called " YouTube employees will ALL lose there first born sons " and uploaded it on March 1 .
In it , he describes himself in a normal tone of voice : " I am the former god with the name of Zeus and Zion and Ra , and I am here , and I am here with my son , Messiah .
His name is Atom [ Adam ? ] , he is my first Atom [ Adam ? ] ever , and he is all twelve tribes of Israel . "
His words for YouTube were direct .
" You can not remove my videos , I have warned you before and you do not listen .
YouTube belongs to me , all of it belongs to me .
Every company , every building , every home , everything .
I created it .
It belongs to my son . "
For taking down his divine words , Leboon then told every YouTube employee that he or she would lose their firstborn son .
515 uploads are currently on Leboon 's account ; one is titled , " Remove the movie BABE the Pig or I will BURN . "
Leboon also addresses many of the world 's political and spiritual leaders in the rambling videos .
The Philadelphia connection
The next day , March 27 , the FBI sent an " Emergency Disclosure Request " by fax to Google , asking for the IP address of the uploader .
Google provided the most recent one , an IP address that had been used to access YouTube within the last week .
The FBI then took the address to Verizon and issued an " Emergency Situation Disclosure Request By Law Enforcement . "
Verizon turned over the subscriber information attached to the IP address during the time in question .
It traced to Benner Street in Philadelphia .
The FBI then ran an internal database search for this address , coming up with an active bench warrant against one Norman Leboon .
The warrant came from a state court and charged Leboon with " Terroristic Threats with intent to terrorize another , simple assault , and recklessly endangering another person . "
The FBI compared a Leboon arrest photo with the man in the YouTube videos and had a match .
That same day , March 27 , law enforcement descended on the Benner Street home , arrested Leboon , and took him down the local FBI office for questioning .
Leboon waived his Miranda rights and began speaking .
He told the agents that the video threats against Cantor had been made on his cell phone , then transferred to a home PC and uploaded to YouTube .
Leboon admitted that he had made more than 2,000 such videos .
Leboon also had some other interesting data for agents , telling them that he is the " son of the god of Enoch " and that " his father speaks through him . "
Leboon also reiterated his belief that Rep. Cantor is " pure evil , " " will be dead , " and that " Cantor 's family is suffering because of his father 's wrath . "
Leboon was charged with threatening to kill Cantor .

Un éminent érudit musulman d'origine pakistanaise , Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri , a condamné mardi les terroristes , considérés comme des ennemis de l'islam , dans une fatwa ( avis juridique donné par un spécialiste de loi islamique ) rendue publique à Londres .
Il souligne que les actes de terrorisme ne pouvaient avoir aucune justification au nom de l'islam , condamnant notamment les attentats d'Al - Qaida , dans cette fatwa de quelque six cents pages présentée au cours d'une conférence de presse à Londres , en présence notamment de députés et de représentants d'associations caritatives .
Les kamikazes " ne peuvent pas prétendre que leur suicide sont des actes commis par des martyrs qui deviendront des héros de l'oumma [ la communauté musulmane ] , non , ils deviendront des héros du feu de l'enfer " , a déclaré le Dr Tahir - ul - Qadri .
" Il n'y a aucune place pour le martyre , et leurs actes ne seront jamais , jamais , considérés comme le djihad [ ' guerre sainte ' ] " , a -t - il ajouté .
Cette fatwa " peut être considérée comme l'argumentaire théologique le plus complet contre le terrorisme islamiste à ce jour " , selon la fondation londonienne Quilliam , qui combat l'extrémisme musulman .
Si d'autres responsables musulmans avaient par le passé déjà condamné le terrorisme , M. Qadri , qui s'est exprimé en anglais et en arabe , a souligné que cette fatwa écartait complètement tout type d'excuse pour justifier la violence .
Il a souligné que l'islam était une religion de paix , appelant d'autres responsables religieux à rejoindre sa position .
Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri est à la tête du mouvement Minhaj - ul - Quran , une organisation de tradition soufie , qui combat l'extrémisme religieux dans des centres situés dans des dizaines de pays .

It was " the train from hell , " said one passenger .
Arriving almost 24 hours behind schedule , Amtrak 's California Zephyr arrived in Chicago with a trainload of passengers who described themselves as " tired , hungry and stinky . "
The train , which left Sacramento five days ago , was delayed by severe weather and numerous mishaps on route and pulled into Union Station more than 19 hours late .
One delay was caused by the train striking a pickup truck in Iowa .
But the biggest problem , the rail carrier says , was the weather .
" There is a pass in Nebraska between two hills , " spokesman Marc Magliari says , " where the snow drifts were more than two stories tall . "
Some passengers complained about a short supply of food and water on board , others criticized the crew for not keeping them informed .
Most say they will never take Amtrak again .
Amtrak says it will pay hotel rooms for passengers who need them .
It will also offer refunds on a case by case basis .
Because of the weather , the rail carrier is suspending service past Minneapolis today .
Trains between Chicago and Denver have also been suspended until tracks can be cleared .
In a similar incident , an Amtrak train bound from Denver arrived 23 hours late .
A third train which runs from San Antonio to Chicago derailed in St. Louis yesterday , temporarily stranding 176 passengers and a crew of nine .
A month after Germany surrendered in May 1945 , America ’s eyes turned to the Far East , where the bloodiest battle of the Pacific war was joined on the island of Okinawa .
Twelve thousand U.S. soldiers and Marines would die – twice as many dead in 82 days of fighting as have died in all the years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Within weeks of the battle ’s end came Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Three weeks later , Gen. MacArthur took the Japanese surrender on the battleship Missouri .
That was 65 years ago , as far away in time from today as the Marines ’ arrival at Da Nang was from Teddy Roosevelt ’s charge up San Juan Hill .
Yet the Marines are still on Okinawa .
But , in 2006 , the United States negotiated a $ 26 billion deal to move 8,000 to Guam and the other Marines from the Futenma air base in the south to the more isolated town of Nago on the northern tip .
Okinawans have long protested the crime , noise , and pollution at Futenma .
The problem arose last year when the Liberal Democratic Party that negotiated the deal was ousted and the Democratic Party of Japan elected on a promise to pursue a policy more balanced between Beijing and Washington .
The new prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , indicated his unease with the Futenma deal , and promised to review it and decide by May .
Voters in Nago just elected a mayor committed to keeping the new base out .
This weekend , thousands demonstrated in Tokyo against moving the Marine air station to Nago .
Some demanded removal of all U.S. forces from Japan .
After 65 years , they want us out .
And Prime Minister Hatoyama has been feeding the sentiment .
In January , he terminated Japan ’s eight - year mission refueling U.S. ships aiding in the Afghan war effort .
All of which raises a question .
If Tokyo does not want Marines on Okinawa , why stay ?
And if Japanese regard Marines as a public nuisance , rather than a protective force , why not remove the irritant and bring them home ?
Indeed , why are we still defending Japan ?
She is no longer the ruined nation of 1945 , but the second - largest economy on earth and among the most technologically advanced .
The Sino -Soviet bloc against which we defended her in the Cold War dissolved decades ago .
The Soviet Union no longer exists .
China is today a major trading partner of Japan .
Russia and India have long borders with China , but neither needs U.S. troops to defend them .
Should a clash come between China and Japan over the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea , why should that involve us ?
Comes the retort : American troops are in Japan to defend South Korea and Taiwan .
But South Korea has a population twice that of the North , an economy 40 times as large , access to the most advanced weapons in the U.S. arsenal , and a U.S. commitment to come to her defense by air and sea in any second Korean War .
And if there is a second Korean War , why should the 28,000 U.S. troops still in Korea , many on the DMZ , or Marines from Futenma have to fight and die ?
Is South Korea lacking for soldiers ?
Seoul , too , has been the site of anti-American demonstrations demanding we get out .
Why do we Americans seem more desperate to defend these countries than their people are to have us defend them ?
Is letting go of the world we grew up in so difficult ?
Consider Taiwan .
On his historic trip to Beijing in 1972 , Richard Nixon agreed Taiwan was part of China .
Jimmy Carter recognized Beijing as the sole legitimate government .
Ronald Reagan committed us to cut back arms sales to Taiwan .
Yet , last week , we announced a $ 6.4 billion weapons sale to an island we agree is a province of China .
Beijing , whose power is a product of the trade deficits we have run , is enraged that we are arming the lost province she is trying to bring back to the motherland .
Is it worth a clash with China to prevent Taiwan from assuming the same relationship to Beijing the British acceded to with Hong Kong ?
In tourism , trade , travel , and investment , Taiwan is herself deepening her relationship with the mainland .
Is it not time for us to cut the cord ?
With the exception of the Soviet Union , few nations in history have suffered such a relative decline in power and influence as the United States in the last decade .
We are tied down in two wars , are universally disliked , and are running back - to - back deficits of 10 percent of gross domestic product , as our debt is surging to 100 percent of GDP .
A strategic retreat from Eurasia to our own continent and country is inevitable .
Let it begin by graciously acceding to Japan ’s request we remove our Marines from Okinawa and politely inquiring if they wish us to withdraw U.S. forces from the Home Islands , as well .

Want to know what expenses your boss claimed last month ?
How much your colleague makes ?
What the co-worker down the hall is really working on ?
Forget about hacking their computers – you might want to hit the nearest photocopier instead .
Turns out the newfangled , multi- purpose copy machines in your office keep a wealth of copied data on a hard drive that anyone can hack .
In the age of everything digital , the photocopier is probably the one workplace item you never thought to worry about .
It 's just making a copy of a document , right ?
How risky could that be ?
Very risky , as it turns out .
You might want to press cancel on the copy machine right about now .
Victor Beitner , a security expert who reconfigures photocopy machines destined for resale in Toronto , says businesses are completely unaware of the potential information security breach when the office photocopier is replaced .
They think the copier is just headed for a junkyard but , in most cases , when the machine goes , so does sensitive data that have been stored on the copier 's hard drive for years .
" If I was the kind of person looking for certain information , this would be a gold mine , " said Beitner , founder of Cyber Security Canada , a security , privacy and threat management company .
" People have no clue of what the risks are . "
Of the dozens of multi-purpose copiers Beitner has cleaned out in the past two years , he has seen hundreds of scanned documents that would be considered confidential .
As a personal policy , he never reads them , but can easily tell where they are by the file names and sizes .
" In almost all the machines I have seen , the files , phone numbers , fax numbers and email addresses are left there as if it was still in the office , " said Beitner .
" There are files from insurance companies , medical facilities , pharmaceutical and regular office - type documents , " he said .
Even though high - volume photocopy machines with hard drives have been around for more than five years – most large offices today would have them , the kind that photocopy 35 to 60 pages a minute – people rarely think of them as computers , said University of Toronto computer science professor Graeme Hirst .
" Modern , large , office - type photocopiers are computers .
The whole system is controlled by a computer , it has a hard disk .
It scans images and they are stored on the disc , " said Hirst .
" They are also networked computers , and they have all the same security issues that a computer does , so all the same security issues arise , " he said .
Such as being targeted by hackers , said Beitner .
Any web - savvy , techno - whiz kid could easily access the hard drive , or send all scans to email or , if they have the password , retrieve copies of confidential documents by simply hooking their laptop up to the copier .
And , as a few Google searches will show you , you do n't even need to leave the comfort of your home .
The activity of photocopiers linked to an unsecure network can be seen and tracked online .
With a few clicks of a mouse , and no knowledge of how to hack , we could see the latest activity of a photocopier in Korea , which included copies of invoices and employee expenses .
" I am at the administrator level of the network , " said Hirst .
" If the password is changed , I can't get in and change any of the settings .
But sometimes , all the logins and passwords are easily found online . "
In Toronto , most rented photocopiers are picked up when the lease is almost over , usually anywhere from two to five years .
If the copiers are in good shape , they are often destined for auction , where they are bought to be resold .
Some end up with dealers , who ensure confidential information is erased .
Others can be found on Kijiji or Craigslist , and likely still have crucial data on them .
Some companies , like Rite Copy Service , tell their clients to remove the hard drives and purge them before they are picked up for resale .
Or they replace the hard drives .
But that costs extra time and money .
The cheaper thing to do , says Beitner , is to make the data inaccessible , clear the memory on the machine and change the pass codes through the machine panel .
It does n't completely wipe the hard drive , but renders it unusable to the average person .
" Ninety - nine per cent of the population can't get to it .
But it 's the one per cent , the guy who is going to come in the middle of the night , take the hard drive out and scrub all the data off it , " said Beitner .
" There is still that risk . "

It 's an issue that first came to light five years ago , and larger copy companies also came up with solutions , said Dr. Avner Levin , the director of the Privacy and Cyber Crime Institute at Ryerson University .
Companies like Xerox now have enhanced security measures that enable an office to remove the hard drive and do digital shredding .
Levin says this is really part of a larger issue – the lack of awareness about technology in the everyday work environment .
" People in general are n't very good about storing their data , but here is a case where they do n't even know their data is being stored , " he said .
" I think few people think about the consequences of the technology they are using . "
* ITC judge had found three Rambus patents were violated
* Nvidia Corp , Hewlett - Packard among respondents ( Adds comment from Nvidia , detail )
WASHINGTON , March 25 ( Reuters ) - The International Trade Commission ( ITC ) said on Thursday it would review a decision by one of its judges who said that three Rambus RMBS .
O chip patents had been violated .
The battle is a key one for graphics chip maker Nvidia NVDA.O , whose core business relies upon the sale of specialized graphics cards .
Rambus , which filed the lawsuit in 2008 , also named as respondents Hewlett - Packard Co HPQ.N , ASUSTek Computer , Micro-star International 2377 .
TW and Pine Technology Holdings 8013 .HK .
Other companies named in that lawsuit were MSI Computer Corp , BFG Technologies , Biostar Microtech Corp , Diablotek Inc , EVGA Corp , G.B.T Inc , Giga - byte Technology Co , Palit Multimedia Inc , Palit Microsystem and Sparkle Computer Corp .
Rambus has filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco charging that Nvidia infringed 17 patents .
The ITC said in a statement on Thursday that the full commission would review the decision , announced in January , of one of its judges .
That judge had found that three Rambus patents were infringed , paving the way for infringing chips to be banned from importation into the United States .
Rambus , based in Los Altos , California , said it would continue the patent fight .
“ We look forward to supplementing our arguments regarding the issues the commission has decided to review , ” Rambus spokeswoman Linda Ashmore said in a statement .
Nvidia said that it had expected the review .
“ The ITC ’s action to review the initial determination was fully anticipated , given the significant patent issues that were raised by Nvidia , ” the company said in a statement “ We are very pleased the primary focus of the review is on the Barth patents , which were previously found to be valid and infringed . ”
The three Barth patents -- the nickname given the three remaining patents in the ITC case -- were issued to Rambus engineer Richard Barth for technology that controls and manages the flow of computer data to and from a chip ’s memory .
Two of these three patents have been affirmed as valid by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .
[ ID :nN04192068 ]
Rambus has filed lawsuits against a long list of technology companies in the past decade , saying they infringed patents held by the memory chip designer .
The commission is a popular venue for patent litigation because it can bar the imports of products made with infringing technology into the United States .
The case stands before the International Trade Commission .
The case number is 337-661 .
( Reporting by Diane Bartz and Ian Sherr ; Editing by Gary Hill )
Arthur Firstenberg , who says he is hypersensitive to certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation , saw the house at the end of a narrow lane as a refuge from physical and neurological symptoms that have plagued him for three decades .
“ It ’s been difficult because of my electromagnetic sensitivities , ” he said .
“ I had a lot of difficulty finding a house that I could be comfortable in . ”
So in September 2008 , he bought the home on Barela Street , a few blocks from the newly redeveloped downtown rail yard here .
But last October , when a friend of his rented a house on the next block that backed up to Firstenberg ’s property , the familiar waves of nausea , vertigo , body aches , dizziness , heart arrhythmia and insomnia returned -- all , he says , because she was using an iPhone , a laptop computer , a wireless router and dimmer switches .
Firstenberg , 59 , wanted Raphaela Monribot to limit her use of the devices .
“ I asked her to work with me , ” he said .
“ Basically , she refused . ”
So he sued Monribot in state district court , seeking $ 530,000 in damages and an injunction to force her to turn off the electronics .
“ Being the target of this lawsuit has affected me very adversely , ” Monribot said Friday in response to e-mailed questions .
“ I feel as if my life and liberty are under attack for no valid reason , and it has forced me to have to defend my very basic human rights . ”
Firstenberg ’s claim has occasioned plenty of only - in - Santa - Fe eye- rolling .
This is , after all , a town as known for its abundance of New Age healers , anti-nuclear activists and wealthy , turquoise - wearing expatriates as it is for spectacular sunsets and centuries - old adobe architecture .
“ It makes me miss living in Santa Fe more than I have in a long time , ” one former resident wrote on a local newspaper blog .
“ When my brother sent me this link I wanted to cry from laughing so hard .
I wonder if Blu - Ray players send him into convulsions ?
Would Bluetooth give him nosebleeds ? ”
Not everyone was laughing .
Nearly 400 people signed an online petition that Firstenberg helped organize against plans to add Wi-Fi antennas around town .
The City Council postponed the project last month .
Dr. Erica Elliott , who treated Firstenberg and testified at a hearing on a preliminary injunction , said she signed the wireless petition because she ’s convinced electromagnetic hypersensitivity is a real disorder that may affect the nervous system .
Mainstream scientists object to the notion that microwaves and radio waves emitted by consumer electronics could cause the reported health problems .
Bob Park , a University of Maryland physics professor who has published a book on the subject , says that although such radiation can heat tissue , it lacks the energy to knock loose electrons and alter human DNA or otherwise cause the reported symptoms .
“ It ’s totally implausible , ” Park said .
The varied complaints , he said , are likely psychological in origin .
District Judge Sarah Singleton is expected to rule soon on a defense motion to dismiss the case , as well as the preliminary injunction sought by Firstenberg .
She already dismissed a claim involving Monribot ’s iPhone because federal law prevents state courts from taking up cellphone issues .
On Friday , Monribot declined to step outside her home -- barely 30 feet from Firstenberg ’s house -- but agreed in a phone call to answer questions via e-mail .
She keeps in touch , she said , with relatives in the U.S. , Asia , Europe and the Middle East .
“ Because my family members live in different time zones , I have always made myself available to them at all hours , ” she said .
“ We communicate often through Skype , Gmail chat , video and audio sessions . ”
Firstenberg knew this when he mentioned to her that the Casados Street house was for rent , but after Monribot moved in , he and a friend insisted that she turn off her Wi-Fi router and other equipment .
She tried to comply , but felt harassed .
“ I decided to bring it all to an end , stop trying to accommodate a neighbor and attempted to start concentrating on my own life again , ” she wrote .
Firstenberg said he was staying with friends and occasionally sleeping in his car .
He finds the attention surrounding the lawsuit embarrassing , he said .
“ I ’m not after publicity , ” he said .
“ I just want to live .
I want my home . ”

Master of Two Worlds
Nomadicus Jessicus :
This is dog Latin for “ I just put all my LA possessions in storage . ” �
Let ” �s do that obnoxious thing that audiences tolerate wherein I show you the present , and now we go back in time to show you how we got here .
Subtitle : “ Thirty days earlier . ” �
I know , I know usually it is “ one day ago ” � or whatever but come on I am not practiced in this type of playschool script trick .
THIRTY DAYS EARLIER ” �
That would put me at Comic - Con San Diego ” �
It ” �s strange how you become something to someone and , if you don” �t do something drastic about matters like shaving your head or robbing a bank , you remain that way to them forever .
Or how you know that different people view you in different ways , whether it is an individual or a group of people .
The way you were in high school , for instance .
Or , here ” �s one : I always think of Navy as viewing me as this little scrawny teenager , because that ” �s who I was when we first met during our Cambridge studies .
Maybe it ” �s because physically I am small compared to him , or because I ” �m younger and was very green when we first met , or because in England he was like a big brother or that , in my mind , he will always be better traveled than me and worldly in separate ways because he is a SEAL .
I don” �t know if this viewpoint is true , we haven ” �t discussed anything so dreadfully self - analytical , but this is always how I have viewed our dynamic .
I worked as a lifeguard on the beach for four days this week .
While we were picking up our assignments in the morning , the director scheduled me out for deep water .
One of the staff guards , Gidget , generously offered to let me , “ Get back into things by taking shallow water , if it ” �s more comfortable for you . ” �
Before I could decline her offer the director established , “ No , she ” �s one of our strongest swimmers . ” �
Allow me to point out that this is not true , nor has it ever been true .
I am one of the most comfortable of the staff in the ocean , especially among the girls .
That is true .
And I got caught in some big water a few times and managed somehow to swim a few kids back in and straggle back onto the beach without dying , so there ” �s that .
My small - ish stature probably makes 8 - 10 foot waves and such look more menacing as opposed to one of the guys who are 6 ” �3 .
I ” �m a good athlete to boot .
But I have never been one of the strongest swimmers , not even during that first summer wherein I worked there part time , which is what allows me to list as a sub .
I ” �m good enough , sure , and have had formal swim training all my life of course , and the certification necessary , but I wasn ” �t on swim team or things like that , or water polo and whatever else all these dudes did constantly growing up .
When I got caught in that rip I realized my breath control had weakened .
It ” �s a couple years later so hey guess what I ” �m not even as good as I was then , and even then I scolded myself for not having been better .
Alas , I remain one of the strongest swimmers in his mind :
That is the role I play in his world .
Anyway Gidget didn ” �t like that too much .
I flashed her an apologetic look and took my shift in deep water .
Then I taught a bodysurfing clinic .
Completed a shift from the beach in the afternoon , drove home and barely made it through a shower before passing out for three hours .
Sometimes it ” �s the opposite and we lose the perception of our best qualities despite still having said abilities .
I ” �m sure my sister thought I was cooler when I could take her to New York City for dinner just to celebrate our good grades and had the support of a studio company , prior to facing up to the realities of the entertainment vertical and taking the Independent route .
I.e. : The route of most resistance and least pay .
I 'm wildly more enlightened and rad now , although regrettably unable to express my affection for my friends and family with lavish dinners .
Sometimes you have to lose a little face in order to maintain your ethics and purpose long term .
The last time I was in Virginia , I flipped through my Cambridge files and found a photo of Navy and I from the end - of - term feast .
I look the same -- I always look the same !-- but he looks different .
I think it ” �s that he had a goatee then , which I did not remember as I don ” �t see that as suiting his current personality .
There I am , scrawny teenager and him this Navy guy finishing up his master ” �s degree .
My Cambridge friends have always seen me as a different person from the one my hometown friends see .
Most of my going to LA and England was due to the training and opportunities in those places that a professional artist and performer cannot access elsewhere .
A small part , however , had to do with a need to shake off that hometown social typecasting so that I could explore my talents without the social restrictions of others .
I was an athlete , a sister , a daughter , a girlfriend , a student , a lot of fun , but a dramatic stage actor ?
A multimedia professional ?
Published author ?
Screenwriter ?
I was working professionally and it did n't seem to register with my posse .
Through moving , traveling , publishing this site and my work in Los Angeles , my friends have become reacquainted with me , who I was when I got here .
Who I was becoming .
Who I am now .
They got to know what had changed while I was in England and LA and matched that to the parts of me they knew so well which hadn ” �t changed .
And Cambridge did change me hugely : The shift in my perception ” �
I came back : evolved .
Los Angeles has done as well , but in different ways and via many negative lessons .
Day to day we go on with it : Typecasting folks .
We can ” �t help it , or can we ?
People are both fixed and fluid .
To require of someone that they stay the same is to suffocate their growth or expect they die on the spot so that we may always remember them as they are right now .
Here 's the part where I cite THE BREAKFAST CLUB :
“ Saturday , March 24,1984 .
Shermer High School , Shermer , Illinois , 60062 .
Dear Mr. Vernon ,
We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong .
What we did was wrong , but we think you 're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are .
What do you care ?
You see us as you want to see us :
In the simplest terms , in the most convenient definitions .
You see us as a brain , an athlete , a basket case , a princess and a criminal .
Correct ?
That 's the way we saw each other at 7:00 this morning .
We were brainwashed . ” �
Detention ?!
Whatever your “ it ” � may be , whether it ” �s related to the above idea , or something else :
It ” �s one thing to know and recognize it , it ” �s another to do something about it : to master it .
When I saw Navy 30 days ago in July , I was inspired .
Now that he ” �s back in San Diego , when he ships out for six months or more - ish ( yes , we are still at war ) , he chucks his stuff into storage .
When Brad and I crashed with him overnight for the Con , he was subletting a great place right behind the Padres ” � stadium , fully furnished , for three months .
This made a lot of sense to me .
While in London a few weeks prior , I stayed in Kensington with a friend & Wingman who is also renting a flat fully furnished .
Everything he needs is literally right outside his front door on his block : two groceries , post office , tube , drug store ” � even a Starbucks .
He doesn ” �t have a car .
I got an incredible lot of work accomplished by not having to drive or plan driving or deal with LA time .
It jarred me right out of my Hollywood coma : I had ” � time .
I had time to go to Kensington Palace and take reference photos of statues and fabric all day long .
I had time to write .
This lifestyle made a lot of sense to me .
Basically , you get more done in all major cities , except Los Angeles , which I find unacceptable .
In other cities people are out and about , and you can meet them .
You may not even have to own or maintain a car .
Yes , this is Stonehenge
LA does not make sense to me .
No one is out and about here : you can not meet them .
Time is wasted here , everyday looks the same , soon blending into a five - year fog of traffic , smog and hours spent trying to coordinate driving plans in order to meet up with friends you only see twice a year all while suffering under the tyranny and slow movement of the studio system .
If not for all of the in - town production resources and stellar crew , I would label LA one of the worst places to do film and media business .
I will now lean in close , lower my voice and tell you a secret that apparently is not obvious :
Those production resources can be built up in other places .
New Zealand , Northern California , Texas , New York City ” � .
Oh , if you work professionally in film , you will always be required to check in with LA .
I find this reality acceptable :
There are things I like about Los Angeles .
I like my friends in Los Angeles .
I reserve the right to visit or live in or partially live in the universe of Los Angeles .
But it doesn ” �t have to own me .
And certainly other places are more interesting to the filmmaker and audience , and allow for a different kind of agility in business and production .
I tossed my possessions into temporary storage .
I consider myself shipping out , like Navy .
It ” �s the perfect , smart choice , really , and doesn ” �t feel like a huge deal or unnatural to me at all .
Which is why I was surprised when , in two different , recent press interviews about ARTEMIS ETERNAL , the journalists interviewing me treated the idea so ” � heavily .
For example :
“ You are leaving Los Angeles soon , is that true ? ” �
I paused because , was it just me or did that question sound like an accusation ?
“ You are leaving Los Angeles soon , IS THAT TRUE ? ” �
Let me be clear that I am not the mayor of Los Angeles , so beyond losing the cache of living in Hollywood ( which has nothing to do with accomplishing film , I ” �ve learned ) I am not really sure why this warrants an investigative , accusative sort of , “ IS THAT TRUE ? ” �
Here is what I need : I need the freedom to go lifeguard on the beach for four days because I feel like it without fearing that somehow this is interpreted as whatever kind of failure or departure to commitment in my film career .
I usually put in as a substitute at the beginning of summer .
If they call me and I ” �m available , I go in .
Since I mostly deal with kids there , it ” �s a nice relief from some of the people I deal with on a daily basis .
If I went to the beach for four days on vacation it would be fine for perceptions , but because I go there to make sure no one drowns and I get paid ” �?
Oh the pay sucks compared with production , make no mistake : I do it because I want to and hey earning some money for hard , physical work feels good .
I suppose it would have more cache if I weren ” �t getting paid .
But guess what there ” �s no such thing as a volunteer lifeguard and hell I deserve and need that pay .
Anyway it was like getting a paid vacation !
I just adore the ocean is all .
And I hadn ” �t seen it all summer .
The beach is essentially a different universe and I reserve the right to visit different universes as much as I like .
This makes me a better person and therefore a better writer , director and performer .
And being around that many kids is , quite frankly , hilarious and good for the soul .
I can ” �t Twitter while I ” �m working there ( another benefit ? ) but if I could have , then you would have been treated to some amazing OHs .
In what has recently become a popular piece of web writing , Neil Gaiman used the “ paint your house ” � example to explain that creatives need time to live .
I don” �t want to paint my house .
Ever .
I want to go work on the beach for four days .
It gives me access to gear and training and a purpose for being there .
I miss being constantly active in team sports .
I like the people ; they don” �t work in movies or marketing or title themselves using words like " Executive " and " SEO " .
Well except for when I end up in a conversation with Christian Slater or Pam Anderson or someone who obviously works in movies , but I assure you we are talking about skim boarding and water conditions and nothing to do with things published in faux - news entertainment magazines .
No , I ” �m not going to paint my house or even my room , but maybe sometimes I want to go get paid to do a physical job that puts me up against the elements if only in a minor regard .
I also want to position my production in the way to best serve the film .
That might mean chucking my stuff in storage for a while .
But I won ” �t stop there :
You know what else I need ?
For journalists to quit with the being egregiously judgmental and / or basing their editorial evaluations on the multi-billion dollar mythology the studio system has crafted .
“ You ” �re leaving LA soon , IS THAT TRUE ? ” �
“ Yes , for a season .
Or whatever is required . ” �
( closing his notebook ) “ Mmmhmm . ” �
Oh , I see your Rita Skeeter + Dolores Umbridge , and I find it contrary to what art and film is at its best .
Challenge and confront me on my work and ideas as you like .
In fact I encourage you to be that caliber of journalist ( for a change ) , but I suggest that passively aggressively judging my answers as though an unrelated fact is going to make or break a story about the film is ridiculous .
It also proves a premise of our project that I never want to be right about , and that ” �s the entertainment press is almost hopelessly hypnotized by the studio system and all its thin , flashy tricks .
If a reporter is a part of the panem et circenses , they are probably going to be resistant against publishing an article about the artist , production , community and movement that is blatantly challenging the panem et circenses model .
Faux - rebellion is embraced and elevated .
A true challenge ?
That particular interview remains unpublished .
Sorry , I can't hear you , I 'm on a horse scouting locations so that I can make something while you rebroadcast studio movie releases all day long for profit .
I clarified the strategy involved and that ARTEMIS will mostly be lensed out east .
I ” �m also getting ready to head to Portland to kickoff work on the intensive ARTEMIS ETERNAL web experience redesign .
In addition , the concept artist that I plan to work with , well it turns out he lives in the Midwest and will be on location in Europe , so we will not be working locally from Los Angeles .
Sorry , I can't hear you .
Look what I found while you were changing your Twitter bio to read
" Social Media Expert "
Since I am ARTEMIS ETERNAL , the project and I are increasingly inseparable , and since you , reader , are involved in ARTEMIS ETERNAL , I figure you might be curious about the particular strategies of my whereabouts .
I will of course be here in Los Angeles for a month when we prep and shoot CRIMSON and for anything else requiring for me to be here before that point .
Post - production will most likely be in Los Angeles as well , at which time I would consider myself moved back , most likely .
It ” �s not difficult for me to come back as a local when I need and I can sublet if I need a longer spell .
In short I ” �m multi - basing a little and it doesn ” �t concern me in the slightest as I will be saving heaps of money / overhead from chucking my stuff in storage and unloading my flat .
I will guest and quest and work all over the place with one mission still at the forefront of all my action : ARTEMIS .
This will be good : Neither Wingmen nor ARTEMIS ETERNAL are tied to LA .
We ” �re larger than that , now , and in this way the world , our world , is a small world .
It ” �s what planes are for .
And guess how valuable this flexibility is ?
Wicked valuable .
So back off , Mr. Rita Skeeter - Umbridge guy .
Also there is no reason for you to ask me the same question twice in one interview .
“ IS THAT TRUE ? ” �
Dear entertainment professionals , give up your attachments to LA .
This is the reason all movies look the same , and most of you are out of work .
And , if you ” �re in work , you probably aren ” �t on a project with much of a soul and , at the same time , are n't being paid what you should be paid .
Over educated and underemployed :
Why are you here ?
Why are you perpetuating this worldview ?
Sorry , I can't hear you .
I 'm too busy reenacting The Lion King " Circle of Life " on this rock .
Multi - basing or technomading or living out of a suitcase ” � that ” �s what I want my production story to be .
That 's where I want my story to be :
In the field .
It ” �s nothing I ” �ve been relegated to : I am actively pursuing my life in this way and sculpting my productions to be not here but OUT THERE .
YES , THAT IS TRUE .
OUT THERE !
Out there where life happens .
I do have a center to my universe and that ” �s my family home out east .
I do hold that there is a center for the film universe and that is LA .
For all of my time in Los Angeles I have considered myself somewhat bi-coastal .
Although , if you told me I ” �d be living this way when I was a teen I ” �d have replied with sarcasm , noting that this idea is counter - intuitive to everything I am .
I was afraid then .
I didn ” �t have Wingmen or a college degree or world experience or mastery in multiple crafts and I hadn ” �t yet read this story .
If being the master of multiple worlds is a weakness , then how do you reporters define strength ?
Mastering multiple worlds is only the result of every major hero monomyth journey , is all .
Embrace the wisdom : I object to being subjected to your limited view of what film and a filmmaker should be .
I ” �m pretty sure there are other locations aside from Los Angeles or sound stages just like there are other places to hang out other than your shoebox apartment or exoskeleton of a car jammed in traffic on a freeway .
It ” �s strange to turn a corner , to suddenly notice that evolution and triumph , and then to have someone else judge your step forward , the chess move that makes the most sense , as a step back .
Los Angeles is currently one of the worst cities for economic stability , recession recovery and unemployment .
Perhaps it is a wise filmmaker who seeks to , for a spell , operate with increased freedom out of the top , most - stable metropolitan areas .
Here is my advice , and challenge , to directors of film :
Get to LA
And then GET THE HELL OUT OF LA .
Come back whenever you feel like it or find it necessary , because once you know this world exists and can be survived , you can do film anywhere .
Including Los Angeles .
Master of two worlds .
Owner of a well - earned master key .
You win .
Now if the wimps are done with the judging , permit me , along with The WINGMEN , to continue unlocking some doors .
I 've got a flight to catch .

The original manuscript of Albert Einstein 's famous theory of relativity is going on display in its entirety for the first time , almost 100 years after it was written .
Einstein 's groundbreaking theory helped explain a raft of scientific questions , from black holes to the big bang .
The former Nobel prize winner donated the manuscript to Israel 's Hebrew University in 1925 .
Now , Israel 's Academy of Sciences and Humanities is putting it on show , in time for the 131st anniversary of Einstein 's birth .
Organisers say the significance of his writings and diagrams will not be lost even on casual viewers .
It will be presented in the context of the theory 's legacy , with displays on space exploration , satellites and GPS technology .
Straightening out the corners – you know , the hard edges in our lives .
We all get ‘em ; some do yoga , some get religion .
Me , I ride .
That ’s what helps me to straighten the corners , round out the edges .
“ When you straighten out the corners , you get a circle .
The circle is a symbol of life : there is no beginning and there is no end . ”
I read that once in a motorcycle book .
“ You straighten out the corners so you can see other people ’s points of view , and you can understand a little more about them …. ‘ cause we ’re all Brothers and Sisters in this world . ”
Biker philosophy at its finest .
I ’ve been having a hard time lately trying to soften the hard edges in my life .
My ol’ man , Moses Dick , died this January .
Nine days later , a pal of mine died as well .
And a month later , my uncle passed away suddenly .
Straightening out these corners has not been easy .
Sometimes I laugh at these curve balls thrown down from Heaven as I swing my earthly aluminum bat , but most times I cry .
But one thing remains certain : I need to draw inspiration and hope from the lives these men lived .
They are a part of my history and I plan to pass it on down .
This is the 40th anniversary of the Great Postal Strike of 1970 .
Some of you reading this may have been participants in that eight days that changed the National Association of Letter Carriers ( NALC ) .
I want your stories to never be forgotten .
Your courage and sacrifice has allowed me and my wife to do all the things that I ’ve written about over the last eight years : namely travel the country via motorcycle to all 50 states and meet letter carriers all along the way .
This has been a great honor and a humbling privilege .
I know I am a result of two great parents , but also my economic privileges have been forged by the dedication and perseverance of those letter carriers who came before me .
And not just the letter carriers ; determined unionists and social activists have been laying my groundwork for many decades .
I have been involved in the Michigan Labor History Society for a couple of years now .
I like going to the meetings because they call me “ young man . ”
It ’s quite a shame , actually , to be the youngest on the program committee at 50 years old .
This group is responsible for the great monument , “ Transcending , ” located in Hart Plaza , in downtown Detroit .
To be in the midst of this group while they are discussing labor history is , to me , like a hummingbird sucking up sweet nectar .
I believe more of us , those who labor for a living , need to understand our roots .
We take way too many of our good working conditions and benefits for granted .
I am not a big fan of sitting in a classroom chair ( just ask my Mom ) , so my idea of teaching is to do a Detroit labor history field trip .
Detroit is a UAW ( United Auto Workers ) town , but also a very historical town for NALC history as well .
Let me grab a beer as I take you on a tour .
First stop : the Fort Street Bridge at Miller Road .
This bridge , at the border of Dearborn and Detroit , crosses the Rouge River .
Looking north , the ominous stacks of the Ford Rouge steel plant billow black clouds of stinky smoke .
Tugboats hug the shore , waiting to steer barges to the Detroit River , and the Morton salt mines lie underneath the southeast side of the bridge .
The historic marker on the bridge reads :
On March 7 , 1932 in the midst of the Depression , unemployed auto workers , their families and union organizers braved the bitter cold temperatures and gathered at this bridge , intent on marching to the Ford Rouge plant and presenting a list of demands to Henry Ford .
Some 3,000 “ hunger marchers ” paraded down Miller Road .
At the city limit Dearborn police blocked their path and hurled tear gas ; the marchers responded with rocks and frozen mud .
Near Gate # 3 the demonstrators were bombarded with water from fire hoses and a barrage of bullets .
In the end , five marchers were killed , 19 wounded by gunfire , and numerous others by stones , bricks and clubs .
Newspapers alleged that the marchers were Communists but they were in fact people of all political , racial and ethnic backgrounds .
Dave Moore , the last survivor of the Ford Hunger March , just died October 26 , 2009 .
He was 97 years old and a union activist until his death .
These are his words about that event :
“ When you drive down Miller Road , your tires run over the blood of our martyrs .
And when you walk along the street , the soles of your shoes are walking where the blood ran in 1932 .
We need to tell our young people the story of how people sacrificed their lives to build a movement . ”
Next stop : the Miller Road overpass leading to the main entrance of the Rouge plant .
This was the catwalk workers used to go from the parking lot to the plant .
On May 26 , 1937 , Walter Reuther and three union associates began to pass out leaflets to workers on the overpass during shift change .
Ford was the last auto company to allow the UAW to organize its factories , and was not at all happy about union organizers giving leaflets to his workers .
Twenty - five cars filled with men in sunglasses arrived at the site and warned everyone , including newsmen and the Ladies Auxiliary Brigade , to get out of the area .
Reuther and his partners were attacked brutally on that overpass by those thugs while Dearborn police did nothing to stop the violence .
Women were beaten , as well , with one police officer pleading , “ Stop beating her .
You ’ll kill her … ”
One union organizer was pushed off the bridge and fell 30 feet .
Another was beaten so badly , he spent months in the hospital with a broken back .
I saw the actual photos of the Ford Hunger March and the Battle of the Overpass victims as they lay in pools of blood .
The images are horrific .
Next stop : Transcending , the Labor Legacy Project .
This is the majestic steel circle reaching into the heavens in the forefront of Hart Plaza .
Just across from the Joe Louis fist , this is labor ’s gift to the city of Detroit .
Our Letter Carriers Branch was one of the first contributors to the building of this project .
If you have not done so , please visit this 63 - foot - tall glorious monument .
It is an inspiring sculpture with a spiraling granite walkway through an artist ’s vision of labor history .
Look for our Branch 3126 tribute plaque on the memorial wall .
Last stop ; the Walter Reuther Library at Wayne State University .
This is the resting place of all NALC official archives .
It is also where the UAW places all of its archival history , as well as many other unions .
Until June of this year there is a grand special exhibit of NALC history at the library .
A group of us recently perused this fine display of letter carriers in action over the last 200 years and found it quite outstanding .
There is quite a bit of 1970 strike history as part of this display .
I highly recommend a family trip to the Reuther Library .
Your kids need to know about labor history .
Maybe they will even
Twitter their friends about how much fun they ’re havin ’ in a library !
So let ’s connect the dots .
I ’ve been accused of being a ramblin ’ idiot so let ’s sharpen our pencils and put them to paper .

I see the connection between all these things .
It ’s just working folks trying to fight for dignity and respect .
It ’s plain and simple to me .
I am glad that I wrote this article .
It ’s helped me to straighten out the corners of my mind .
Now I understand why the Labor Legacy Project is a circle .
But look closely ; there is a gap at its apex .
There ’s still a lot of work to be done .
The future is unwritten .
The arc of history bends towards justice .

P.S. This article was inspired by a proud , retired UAW member , Robert “ Moses ” Dick , 1939 – 2010 .
Two of his favorite sayings were , “ Work Sucks ! ” and “ Thank God for the Union . ”
You are gone , but never forgotten .
Thanks ,
Pops !

The last days of this dreadful government are being accompanied by an attack on rights and privacy that seems unprecedented during Labour 's 13 - year rule .
The government is now drawing up plans to amend the Postal Services
Act to allow tax inspectors to intercept and open people 's mail before it is delivered .
Given the state 's ambitions to collect all communications data this is hardly surprising , but we must ask ourselves how many more rights are seized by government and its agencies before Britain becomes the GDR 's most obvious European imitator .
Currently postal workers have the right to intercept suspicious letters and packages and pass them to HM Revenue & Customs ( HMRC ) and then at an agreed moment the item is opened in front of the addressee .
The change in the law will mean that HMRC will be able to open whatever it likes without the addressee being present or being made aware of the interception .
As usual , the government and HMRC public relations people underplay the wide - ranging and dangerous nature of this proposal by insisting that the new measure is simply designed to deal with the problem of tobacco smuggling .
But the change , disclosed in a document published with the budget , means that HMRC will be able to trawl through private mail pretty much at will .
Quoted in the Daily Telegraph , Heather Taylor , a senior tax partner at Grant Thornton , said : " This seems like a very small and limited change , but it could be a very big step for increased powers HMRC .
Once new powers are in the hands of HMRC they tend to be extended . "
This is a very alarming development , and it is worth remembering who the HMRC employees work for and who is paying the bills for the enormous waste of money by government that , together with the attack on democratic rights , is one of the dominant features of the last 13 years .
They work for us , the taxpayers – British citizens who are now to be relegated to the units of control familiar to the East German authorities .
Years ago I found myself in a dismal room at the Stasi headquarters in the East German town of Leipzig and saw the piles of opened mail left by Stasi officers when the Berlin Wall came down .
There was a pulping machine , adapted from a piece of agricultural machinery , which had been hastily used to destroy the evidence of the massive programme of interception .
It was an impressive sight and to me a lasting symbol of the East German dictatorship .
It seems extraordinary that we are about to allow the exact same type of interception to be established in Britain with such little complaint .
How long will it be before we protest ?
Where is the political leadership needed to assert that these sorts of laws are unacceptable in a democracy ?
And for Pete 's sake , how does the government square the measure with the rights to privacy " guaranteed " by its own Human Rights Act ?
PAKISTANI President Asif Ali Zardari has a black goat slaughtered at his house almost every day to ward off " evil eyes " and protect him from " black magic " .
A spokesman for the President told the Dawn newspaper the goats were slaughtered as an act of Sadaqah - meaning " voluntary charity " in Islam whereby one gives out money or the meat of a slaughtered animal to the poor to win Allah 's blessing and stave off misfortune .
" It has been an old practice of Mr Zardari to offer Sadaqah .
He has been doing this for a long time , " the spokesman , Farhatullah Babar , told the paper .
Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country where many of the well - off offer Sadaqah .
Though Muslim , many people also follow certain superstitious practices .
Hundreds of goats had been sacrificed at Mr Zardari 's house since he was sworn in September 2008 , the Dawn newspaper reported .
It said Mr Zardari 's detractors would see in his " new - found religiosity " a sign of nervousness in the face of growing woes .
Mr Zardari , who rose to power after the assassination of his wife , former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , in late 2007 , has become increasingly unpopular and faces a range of problems from Islamist militancy to a stagnant economy and political rivalry .
A Supreme Court ruling last month throwing out an amnesty for Mr Zardari , several top aides and thousands of political activists and government figures triggered a political storm and expectation that he was on his way out .

Highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) is usually regarded as the fissile material most desirable to terrorists , given the relative ease with which it could be used to manufacture a simple nuclear explosive device .
For similar reasons , it ’s also worrisome from a state - level proliferation viewpoint .
Highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) is usually regarded as the fissile material most desirable to terrorists , given the relative ease with which it could be used to manufacture a simple nuclear explosive device .
For similar reasons , it ’s also worrisome from a state - level proliferation viewpoint .
But thanks in part to U.S. leadership , a diverse and increasing number of countries now recognize the risks associated with the civilian use , storage , and trade in HEU and have taken steps to reduce their reliance upon this dangerous material .
In fact , an international scientific consensus agrees that there is no technical reason to continue to use HEU in research reactors , in medical isotope production , or in other civilian applications .
What is clear is that without an international norm of some sort , phasing out the use of HEU in the civilian sector will prove to be quite difficult . ”
Nonetheless , political and economic obstacles continue to hamper efforts to achieve a global clean out of civilian HEU , despite the Obama administration ’s plans to sharply increase spending in pursuit of such an objective .
In fact , nearly 800 kilograms of HEU continue to be used annually in research reactors and to produce medical isotopes–enough for 40 Hiroshima - type bombs .
The obstacles vary from Russian fears that parting with such material will reduce the prestige of the country ’s research facilities to South African objections that calls for non-nuclear weapon states to part with their HEU is “ disarming the disarmed ” to Canadian concerns that converting domestic medical isotope production facilities to less dangerous low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) targets will cost too much .
A consistent theme is a sense of complacency about the danger posed by HEU stockpiles , with many developing countries in particular attaching little urgency to U.S. concerns about nuclear terrorism .
What is clear is that without an international norm of some sort , phasing out the use of HEU in the civilian sector will prove to be quite difficult .
To be sure , some steps forward have been taken in recent years .
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1887 , adopted unanimously last fall , calls upon all states to “ manage responsibly and minimize to the greatest extent that is technically and economically feasible the use of highly enriched uranium for civilian purposes , including by working to convert research reactors and radioisotope production processes to the use of low enriched uranium fuels and targets . ”
Unfortunately , this phrasing , although politically necessary to win support from countries such as France and Russia , does n’t attach much urgency to HEU elimination .
Moreover , although the HEU provision has n’t received much attention in and of itself , the resolution as a whole has been criticized by many developing countries as inappropriate “ legislating ” by the U.N. Security Council .
President Barack Obama ’s upcoming Nuclear Security Summit will likely endorse some form of HEU minimization , but almost certainly with a caveat regarding economic and technical feasibility .
The Obama administration should also use the occasion to encourage countries to sign a voluntary code of conduct in relation to HEU .
Such a code could be adopted by countries , nuclear operators , universities , and other stakeholders .
A potential code drafted by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and already supported by some governments would commit its adherents to :
Eliminating or converting installations from HEU to LEU as soon as technically feasible ;
Ending transfers of HEU except on an interim basis to facilities actively pursuing conversion to LEU ;
Maintaining security at levels concomitant with the risks ;
Undertaking activities that would help make conversion possible ; and
Developing and maintaining a strategy for the management and eventual elimination of HEU .
Taken together , adoption in the final summit communique of such a code and a commitment to HEU reduction ( and eventual elimination ) in the civilian sector represents a major step forward in reducing the danger of terrorists acquiring crude , but real , nuclear explosives .

A majority of senators sided with the Maid - Rite in Marshalltown to override concerns from state food - safety inspectors who question the restaurant ’s cooking methods .

The Colorado Avalanche have a healthy chunk of " big " games remaining on their calendar this year .
Tonight 's game is about as big as they get .
The Avalanche take on the division - leading Vancouver Canucks tonight at the Pepsi Center .
Due to tiebreakers , the Avalanche can't overtake the Canucks tonight , but they can pull even ( point - wise ) with a regulation win .
That may be easier said than done .
You know how the Avalanche have owned the Blues this year , to the tune of outscoring them 16 - 5 in 3 games against them ?
Well , the same bitch slap scenario exists with the Canucks ... except the Avalanche are the ones on the receiving end .
Vancouver has outscored the Avalanche 16 - 4 in the last 3 meetings , including a shutout by * gulp * Andrew Raycroft .
It 's time to end the cycle .
Vancouver is nearing the end of their epic 14 - game road trip .
And , like the Avs ' own lengthy trip at the start of the season , its been by no means the disaster the pundits thought it would be .
Vancouver is 7 - 5 - 0 so far and finish up with tonight 's game in Denver and the capper tomorrow in Phoenix .
After that , the Canucks play 10 of their final 15 games at home .
I know I 'm saying this in just about every preview now , but the Avalanche could really use two points tonight .
For the Avs , the Road Runner returns ; Kyle Cumiskey is expected to play tonight .
Meanwhile , Road Kill ( Ruslan Salei ) will not .
He 's out indefinitely with a torso injury .
Dustin has the recap tonight .
Go Avs !

Mr Hampton has photographed planes all over the world , his mother said
Two UK plane - spotters arrested in India have been charged with intercepting communications , the Foreign Office ( FCO ) has confirmed .
Stephen Hampton and Steven Ayres , from Bristol , charged under the Telegraph Act , are due in court on 23 February .
Under the act , persons unlawfully intercepting official messages could face a year in prison or a fine of 500 rupees ( £ 7 ) .
The pair were held at Delhi International Airport last Monday .
Railway workers Mr Hampton , from Keynsham , and Mr Ayres , from St George , sparked suspicion after asking a Delhi hotel for a room overlooking a runway .
They were carrying an air traffic control scanner , a laptop , binoculars and cameras .
An FCO spokeswoman said it could not speculate on the likely outcome of the trial but confirmed the men were receiving consular assistance .
' Primitive ' conditions
The pair are being held in a New Delhi immigration centre .
Mr Hampton 's mother Eileen Cock said he had travelled all over the world photographing aircraft .
Mr Ayres is a work colleague of Mr Hampton
His MP , Dan Norris , has phoned Mr Hampton and said he was getting anxious .
" It 's a fairly primitive existence .
" There 's just cold running water and fairly primitive loos and he 's crowded in with between 30 and 50 other people , none of whom speak English , so it 's not the greatest situation for him , " he said .
" It 's adding to his pressure knowing that people are speculating about his release when in fact he 's still there . "
Mr Norris added that , even though it was a minor offence , the judge could make an example of them and raise the fine as punishment .
The arrests happened during a security crackdown in the wake of a bomb blast in the Indian city of Pune , the country 's first such explosion in over a year .
When you buy wine , what are you paying for ?
The farming and maintenance of the vineyard , the picking of the grapes , all of the equipment and labor involved in turning the grapes into wine — but that 's not all .
After the wine is made , there 's packaging , shipping , and marketing too .
I 'd just as soon put my money in the liquid .
Glass bottles are expensive and heavy , costing significant energy and money to ship around the world .
Forgoing the bottle is cheaper for the winemaker and cheaper for the customer .
If you 're looking for better value in wine , you might want to consider looking inside the box .
Let 's do the math : take the Chateau de Bonhoste Bordeaux Blanc .
750 - mL bottles of it sell for $ 11.99 in our local store , but you can also purchase a five - liter box on sale for $ 33.99 .
Five liters is six 2/3 bottles of wine — which would cost you $ 79.93 individually ( if you could pay in fractions of a bottle ) or , really , $ 83.93 .
You 're saving almost $ 50 by forgoing the bottle , and getting the same wine for around $ 5 instead of $ 12 .
Serve it in a carafe if you 're embarrassed to pour straight from the spigot ; or show off the box to brag about what a good deal you found .
But Maggie , you say , what the heck am I going to do with five LITERS of wine ?
I can't possibly drink that much !
If you 're a restaurant owner or you 're having a party , you probably can use that much at once .
But that 's not the only reason to go with the box .
There 's beauty in the box .
Unlike a bottle , which goes bad after a few days even when you pump the air out , spray preservers in it , or dance around it waving your hands in the air , wine in a box lasts .
Inside the box , the wine bag collapses as you drink and the liquid does n't get exposed to oxygen .
We 've been told the shelf life after opening is around seven weeks , and so far , the wine we opened six weeks ago is still tasty .
You can have a half - glass with dinner , or put a cup or two in the stew you 're making , and not worry about what you 're going to do with the rest .
No more throwing out bad half - bottles .
The hitch ?
Not enough winemakers are putting good wine in boxes .
Just as you should n't hold the outdated assumption that all boxed wine is bad , you can't assume it 's good either .
There are a few that are OK — the company behind Red Truck just released a mini-barrel of Chardonnay that 's pretty drinkable , though it could use a little more acidity ; Washington Hills makes a boxed riesling that lovers of sweet , fruity wines will enjoy ; and Target 's Wine Cube Sauvignon Blanc could certainly be worse ( though we were n't fans of any of their red wines . )
Good boxed wines may be in the minority , but we did find a few we can recommend without hesitation .
Recommended Boxed White Wines
Würtz 2008 Riesling Trocken $ 20 to $ 28 for 3L ( find this wine ) Zippy and concentrated , with juicy green apple ( peel included ) , pineapple , and tart lemon notes .
There 's a hint of nuttiness and muskiness in this wine — some tasters were reminded of flat champagne and peach fuzz .
La Petite Frog Picpoul de Pinet $ 29 to $ 34 for 3L ( find this wine )
This drinkable , mellow Picpoul from Languedoc - Roussillon has a hint of pear on the nose .
It has mineral and strawberry notes , and a dry , slightly floral finish .
This likable wine would be nice with shrimp or crab .
Chateau de Bonhoste Bordeaux Blanc $ 33.99 for 5L ( find this wine )
This crisp blend of Muscadelle , Sauvignon Blanc , and Semillon has classic slate / mineral notes and a dry finish , along with fruity burst of kaffir lime and grapefruit .
With its bright acidity and fresh flavors , we 'd love to pair it with a green curry .
This was the favorite of several of our tasters , and the box offers a fantastic discount .
From the Tank White about $ 36 for 3L ( find this wine )
This mellow , full flavored white is made from 100 % Grenache Blanc .
It 's musky and dry , with flavors that reminded us of hard cider and Bosc pears .
It 's a little rustic — this is a natural wine , after all , with honey and nutmeg notes and flavors that reminded us of baked peach cobbler .
It would be excellent paired with sage and butternut squash pasta , roast chicken , or a Thanksgiving turkey .

Gulf News reports that Yuval Tal ( the CEO of Payoneer , the New York - based company that issued prepaid debit cards used by the Dubai assassins ) is alleged to have links to Mossad :
… a person who said he met Tal a couple of times but did not want to be named told Gulf News that “ there is no question in my mind that Yuval has contacts with [ Israel ’s spy agency ] Mossad ” .
He recalled a conversation Tal had with attendees of a Jewish charity event in New York , where he spoke of his connections with Mossad .
“ Yuval was entertaining a small group of people with tales of his IDF [ Israeli Defence Forces ] exploits …
Specifically , he was commending Israeli intelligence and how Mossad and [ Israel ’s internal security agency ]
Shin
Bet always gave him great information on his commando raids .
He said his ‘ colleagues ’ are tracking [ Hamas leaders Khaled ] Mesha’al and [ Esmail ]
Haniyeh ’s movements almost every day , ” he said .
Payoneer is held by three venture capital firms : Greylock Partners , Carmel Ventures , and Crossbar Capital .
Greylock , which has offices in the US , India and Herzliya , Israel , was established by Moshe Mor , a former military intelligence captain in the Israeli army .
Carmel Ventures is an Israeli venture capital fund based in Herzliya .
Crossbar Partners is run by Charlie Federman , who is also managing director of the BRM Group , a venture capital fund also in Herzliya that was founded by Nir and Eli Barkat , the former of whom is the mayor of occupied Jerusalem .

Germany is ranked among the top 20 countries in the world when it comes to fighting corruption at home and abroad , according to a report last November by Berlin - based corruption watchdog Transparency International .
But a report released on Tuesday by the United States Department of Justice said German automaker Daimler engaged in a " longstanding practice of paying bribes " to foreign officials in order to win government contracts between 1998 and 2008 .
Transparency director Christian Humborg said while Germany has not yet filed charges against Daimler , the bribes mentioned in the US report were also likely to violate German law .
Stuermer says he never directly saw bribes taking place
" We would hope that the German authorities are looking at the case at the same time , " he told Deutsche Welle .
" And the document that was published yesterday gives a lot of hints and clues for the German authorities to look deeper into . "
Uphill battle for German firms
Christoph Stuermer worked for Daimler from 1996 to 2002 , and is now an auto industry expert at the economic forecasting organization Global Insight .
He said that while he never saw any bribery taking place at Daimler , the company often had no diplomatic support from the German government abroad .
" I took part in a number of negotiations in Central Asian states , and the need and the requirement for political support and for greasing the political machinery was blatantly evident , " he said .
" Nothing would happen without the favor of the people in charge . "
Stuermer said companies based in many other countries , including the United States , have much more support from their governments when operating abroad .
But Germany has taken a neutral stance , leaving companies themselves to figure out how to expand in foreign markets .
" In a way it 's a bit of an uphill battle for German companies , " he said .
" Either they can not take part in the game and not defend their place in the global market , or they have to work their way around rules and regulations . "
Daimler manufactures the car brand Mercedes
International conventions
Humborg said Germany 's fight against global corruption took a big step forward in 1999 when it ratified an agreement by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development against bribery .
Before then , he said , businesses could often claim bribes to foreign officials as tax deductions .
Germany also signed the UN Convention against Corruption in 2003 , but parliament has yet to ratify it .
Such ratification would require a change in the laws prohibiting members of parliament from engaging in bribery .
" The German parliamentarians have to change a law that directly concerns themselves , " Humborg said .
" For many years we have been pressing the German parliament to take this step , and not to have this gap between saying ' we are against corruption , ' then on the other hand not ratifying this convention . "

Whoppers , Dairy Queen sundaes and the latest movies will soon disappear for U.S. military personnel serving in Afghanistan , according to a blog posting by Sgt. Maj .
Michael T. Hall discussing changes to morale , welfare and recreation facilities on U.S. bases there .
In an effort to put more focus on fighting the Taliban , the military is cutting back on " non-essentials " in Afghanistan , Hall announced on the International Security Assistance Force Afghanistan blog this week .
Hall is the command sergeant major for ISAF .
On large U.S. facilities such as the Kandahar and Bagram air bases , that includes closing restaurants such as Burger King , Dairy Queen , Orange Julius and Pizza Hut , dropping first - run movies from base theaters and cutting the amount of canned and bottled goods imported from the States , Hall writes .
“ This is a warzone – not an amusement park , ” he writes .
“ Supplying nonessential luxuries to big bases like Bagram and Kandahar makes it harder to get essential items to combat outposts and forward operating bases , where troops who are in the fight each day need resupplied with ammunition , food and water , ” Hall says in the blog posting .
Hall says eliminating the restaurants and other facilities will free up space to accommodate more than 35,000 U.S. and allied troops who will be arriving in Afghanistan in the coming months .
But troops should n’t feel neglected , Hall writes , as the military plans to increase fitness centers and Internet and telephone capabilities .
And they ’ll still be able to get a good cup of coffee as the Green Beans Coffee outlets at bases across the country will remain open , Hall writes .

and scientists working to restore the Everglades were stunned and delighted in June 2008 when Florida ’s governor Charlie Crist announced that the state had negotiated a deal to buy 75,000 hectares of farmland from United States Sugar .
The land , which sits between Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades national park , was drained and filled for farming in the early 20th century , partially blocking the natural flow of fresh water that is crucial to the unique wetland ecosystem .
At the time , Crist compared the deal to the creation of …
Bloggers send Nancy Pelosi 2,600 roses for her birthday
While some members of Congress have been targeted by health - care law opponents , at least one Democrat got a nice surprise from the public Friday .
Bloggers at the liberal website Daily Kos sent thousands of roses to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's office , to celebrate her birthday and her role in passing health - care legislation .
" Thanks to the community at Daily Kos , and others who joined in , Speaker Pelosi received thousands of roses this morning for her 70th birthday , " Pelosi 's staff wrote .
" She sent half of the roses to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and is distributing the other half to hill staff to thank them for all their hard work on the health reform legislation . "
They 've posted photographs of the flowers on Flickr .
Pelosi also posted a video thanking the gift - givers .
The wealthy countries repeatedly find new ways to screw Africa .
They ’re purchasing the fishing rights and denying locals the rights to fish the sea or selling more guns or owning profitable enterprises that ought to be owned locally .
In this case , buying fertile land and denying it to locals is sick .
The local governments are n’t much better for allowing it but the countries to the north appear to have forgotten about their disastrous colonial legacy .
This is another example of the new wave of colonialism that is blocking Africa from making progress .
Even worse , part of what is driving the effort is fuel .
How many more examples like this do we need to see before people stop using food growing land to generate fuel ?
Instead of encouraging this , it ’s time to tax the hell out of these plans that are taking food away from people .
The Observer :
Losing in the Stanley Cup playoffs can be a painful experience -- especially for the woman who claims the GM of the Anaheim Ducks smacked her with a chair after the team lost in Game 7 last year .
The woman -- Rachel Paris -- is suing the team , as well as their GM Bob Murray , claiming Murray went into a " fit of rage " after the Ducks lost to the Detroit Red Wings last year .
According to the lawsuit , filed Tuesday in Michigan , Murray " picked up a high back chair and struck [ Rachel ] thereby knocking [ Rachel ] to the ground . "
Rachel claims the Ducks are on the hook because " they had a duty to ensure that proper measures and protocols were in place to help curtail Bob Murray 's violent and aggressive nature . "
Rachel , who says she was working as a TV broadcast stage manager at the time , also claims she suffered " severe bodily injuries . "
She 's demanding more than $ 75,000 in damages .

AUSTIN , Texas — Bill Hicks , also known as “ the comedian ’s comedian ” or maybe every marketer ’s worst nightmare , took the stage here Friday night without really being there .
The Houston - born comedian died of pancreatic cancer in 1994 after gaining a fair amount of acceptance in his native country and finding the sobriety that fueled his most biting satire .
Like the Pixies , he gained his strongest following in the United Kingdom , home to director - producers Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas , whose film American : The Bill Hicks Story premiered in North America at SXSW to an enthusiastic audience including Hicks ’ brother and mother .
Those whose brains have been infected by the late , great stand - up ’s logical , satirical and spiritual brand of comedy may wonder why the world needs a Bill Hicks movie in 2010 , given that there ’s no new footage of the man and fans have already seen his routines .
Harlock and Thomas dodge that problem with fresh interviews and early scenes from Hicks ’ life that pair audio reconstructed from still photos set in motion in three dimensions , beginning with his childhood friendship with his first comedy partner and lifelong friend Dwight Slade .
The effect is reminiscent of the Dock Ellis LSD no -hitter video and others that reconstruct scenes using still photographs , animation and audio from an interview .
Is there a name for these things yet ?
Soundumentary ?
Interviewdeo ?
Hicks ’ jokes still sound fresh and drew big laughs all these years later , but fans have already seen many of them ( the “ positive LSD news story ” and the marketers routine both make appearances in the movie ) .
But the animations , interviews and sprinklings of new onstage footage make American : The Bill Hicks Story worthwhile to the initiated and uninitiated alike .
There ’s
Hicks toddling around in diapers ; there he is in a football uniform , as Slade , also on the team , describes his playing style ( indefatigable ) .
And there he is again , taking the stage as a 15 - year - old , performing to a comedy club full of adults .
Hicks later became frustrated with his native audience , comparing it upon his return from England as reacting like “ a dog that has just been shown a card trick . ”
Maybe so , but the trick still inspires awe , and Harlock and Thomas ’ “ soundumentary , ” “ interviewdeo , ” or whatever it ’s called does justice to the magician .

Feeding birds in winter is a most innocent human activity , but it can nonetheless have profound effects on the evolutionary future of a species , and those changes can be seen in the very near term .
That 's the conclusion of a report published online on December 3rd in Current Biology , a Cell Press publication , showing that what was once a single population of birds known as blackcaps has been split into two reproductively isolated groups in fewer than 30 generations , despite the fact that they continue to breed side by side in the very same forests .
The reproductive isolation between these populations , which live together for part of the year , is now stronger than that of other blackcaps that are always separated from one another by distances of 800 kilometers or more , the researchers said .
" Our study documents the profound impact of human activities on the evolutionary trajectories of species , " said Martin Schaefer of the University of Freiburg .
" It shows that we are influencing the fate not only of rare and endangered species , but also of the common ones that surround our daily lives . "
The split that the researchers observed followed the recent establishment of a migratory divide between southwest - and northwest - migrating blackcap ( Sylvia atricapilla ) populations in Central Europe after humans began offering food to them in the winter .
The two groups began to follow distinct migratory routes — wintering in Spain and the United Kingdom — and faced distinct selective pressures .
Under that pressure , the two groups have since become locally adapted ecotypes .
( Ecotypes represent the initial step of differentiation among populations of the same species , the researchers explained .
If ecotypes continue down that path , they can ultimately become separate species . )
" The new northwest migratory route is shorter , and those birds feed on food provided by humans instead of fruits as the birds that migrate southwest do , " Schaefer said .
" As a consequence , birds migrating northwest have rounder wings , which provide better maneuverability but make them less suited for long - distance migration . "
They also have longer , narrower bills that are less equipped for eating large fruits like olives during the winter .
Schaefer says it is n't clear whether the ecotypes will ever become separate species ; in fact , he doubts they will because the habits of humans will tend to change over time .
Even so , the findings do speak to the long - standing debate about whether geographic separation is necessary for speciation to occur .
In particular , it had been contentious whether selection could act strongly and consistently enough in sympatry to separate a united gene pool .
" In highly mobile organisms such as birds , the consensus is that sympatric speciation is extremely rare , mainly because it is difficult to envisage how gene pools could be kept separate until speciation has occurred , " Schaefer said .
" Our results now show that the initial steps of speciation can occur very quickly in a highly mobile , migratory bird , " because divergent selection during the overwintering phase leads to the evolution of reproductive isolation .
" This is a nice example of the speed of evolution , " he added .
" It is something that we can see with our own eyes if we only look closely enough .
It does n't have to take millions of years . "

IRVINE – Jim Kennedy pushes open the roll - up door of his storage unit and there , like a curtain rising on a stage , sits the pieces of his former life .
There are his golf clubs .
Stacked over there are boxes marked “ pots & pans , ” “ misc. papers , ” “ glassware . ”
In the center sits an HDTV , one of the first on the market from several years ago .
Along the left side of the unit is a ceiling - high cabinet containing Kennedy ’s 375 - bottle wine collection he spent a decade amassing .
The contents of Kennedy ’s home have been here at Mini U Storage since Jan. 17 , the day he moved from his Newport Beach condo after getting kicked out by a couple sheriff ’s deputies .
Kennedy , 46 , lost his six - figure corporate development job 19 months ago , he fell behind on his mortgage payments and his house went into foreclosure .
He filed for bankruptcy last August and it was finalized in January .
To the logical Kennedy , the story is simple .
“ I ’m not going to claim I was cheated out of my house , ” Kennedy says several times .
“ I did n’t pay my mortgage . ”
Now the former frequent flier from his days working in IT and finance is living off those rewards – airline loyalty programs and hotel points .
His clothes and everyday supplies packed into his leased BMW , the single Kennedy stays a few nights here , a few nights there , always running the numbers of how many points he will use and trying to stick to a self - imposed $ 5 - a - day food budget .
His life is up in the air .
“ I ’m on hold but time keeps going .
That part ’s frustrating , ” Kennedy said .
“ I should be in major - dollar earning years and I am losing major - dollar earning years , which I will not get back .
That part is frustrating and a little scary . ”
This week , Kennedy is at the Holiday Inn Express in San Clemente , where he converted his United Airlines miles .
He brought down the 7,000 - points a night cost to 5,000 by adding $ 100 for his four - night stay , so it costs him $ 25 a night .
But there ’s an added benefit because he can expand his food budget with the free breakfast .
It ’s also convenient , as he can drive up the 5 Freeway to get his mail at the Mailboxes Plus in Irvine – he has a post office box because he has no address .
It ’s here he gets his unemployment checks , which he and 147,000 other jobless people in Orange County are using for survival .
On Monday , Kennedy was running errands , stopping at the storage unit to grab a couple bottles of wine .
Then it was off to the Mailboxes Plus where he picked up two checks from the Employment Development Department , as the state agency had fallen behind on one of his payments , along with this month ’s issue of Golf World .
He bounced into the next - door laundry and peeled off his dry - clean - only golf shirt from the Four Seasons Resort & Club .
Next stop was the bank , where he deposited his checks , then a stop at the post office to mail his weekly claim for unemployment benefits .
“ I buy stamps in onesies and twosies because I hope I do n’t have to do this for onesie or twosie more weeks .
I know it sounds silly , but … , ” he said .
“ Maybe I should go the other direction and plan ahead and buy a whole 18 - book and then I ’ll get a job tomorrow . ”
After putting $ 15 worth of gas in his car , Kennedy drove over to the local Ralphs , where he found a Claim Jumper frozen meal on sale for $ 2 and he stocked up on a gallon of bottled water because it ’s cheaper than single servings .
Then it was back down the 5 Freeway to the Holiday Inn Express , which has the added amenity of a microwave for his frozen dinner of beef stew .
A half - eaten muffin from breakfast was stored in the refrigerator .
Kennedy ’s days are like this , short bursts of errands around his search for work .
Every day he visits the online job banks and tries to reach out to recruiters , but he finds himself one of several hundred folks who are all going for the same gig , and it ’s a difficult slog .
He ’s taken his story to Twitter in hopes of setting himself apart from all the other jobseekers .
He writes under a pseudonym , @HomelessThomOC .
“ Greetings !
I am Thomas and I have lost my house and am living out of my car .
I worked in Finance and IT but have n’t had a job in 18 months , ” was his first Tweet , posted on Feb. 16 .
Even though his life is on hold , Kennedy is hopeful .
Much like his counting of hotel points , he views his job search as a numbers game , and likens it to the sales philosophy of software giant Oracle .
“ Oracle believes if you make a hundred cold calls you will get 10 people who will take a meeting and 10 meetings will get you two senior executives in which one you will make a sale , ” Kennedy said .
“ For me it ’s the same thing .
The more resumes I send out , the more people I ’m getting in front of , and one of those will hopefully figure out , ‘ Hey this guy ’s pretty bright and he ’s got a pretty good background and we should pick him up and bring him in at least for an interview . ' ”
After a few nights in San Clemente this week , Kennedy will move down to a San Diego , where he will use some hotel points his ex-girlfriend gave him .
He counts his days in small wins – getting the made - up EDD check , for instance , or receiving a call from a recruiter .
He figures he ’ll have enough points to last a few more months and hopes he does n’t have to tell his 85 - year - old mother , who lives in Nevada , of his unemployed status .
And always the economics major , Kennedy tries to stay logical despite the disappointments , so he sticks to a simple equation .
“ I do n’t have a choice .
I gotta keep going because I ’m kind of running against time , ” he said .
“ I have to find a job before ‘ A ’ or I ’m going to run out of ‘ B . ’
I just gotta get to the finish line . ”

To understand the danger posed by Islam , one must first understand its Islam .
And I do n't mean its spiritual appeal , because Islam is not a particularly spiritual belief system .
It is not really much of a belief system at all , so much as it is a tool of social organization .
Because Islam is far less concerned with what people believe , than with what they do .
It is not so much of a religion , as a means of ordering behavior within a society along particular lines .
But let 's look beyond technical language like that , to see what the appeal of Islam is for the " Muslim World " .
Islam was born out of the Arab Middle East , but not just any part of it .
Not out of the parts of it heavily influenced by the Greek presence , such as Egypt or Syria , places whose histories of intellectual syncretism would have surprised no one by giving birth to a new religion .
Instead Islam came out of a more backward part of the region , and its appeal was certainly not philosophical or intellectual or spiritual , for it had nothing new to offer in any of these departments .
The contents of the Koran and the Hadiths are for the most part wholly unoriginal , a clumsy melding of regional myths and customs , with bits of Judaism and Christianity mortared into the whole mess to give it some sense of history and order .
Islam 's obsessive focus on Mohammed above all else , betrays the bankruptcy of a religion that had no other prophets that they had n't " borrowed " from pre-existing faiths , and after rolling them in , proclaimed that Mohammed was the absolutely last prophet , and no others need apply on pain of being beheaded .
But none of that is the point , because Islam 's purpose was not religious , it was social .
Islam may have had nothing new to offer religiously , but it had something very important to offer socially , unity .
And that one compelling idea dominates Muslim thinking to this day , and exemplifies Islam 's appeal to the Muslim world .
The Mecca and Medina both of Mohammed 's day and of the present day , was a world dominated by tribal clans and families .
There was no larger principle besides working for the benefit of your own family .
No trust was possible even between neighbors except premised on the threat of retaliation from one 's own kin .
To advance required family backing .
The clan was everything .
The individual was nothing .
Justice was meaningless .
Law was a means of settling disputes between families in order to avoid vendettas and conflict .
Mohammed 's Islam by contrast promised a supreme unity above tribe and clan .
The unity of the true believers .
This of course is a universally common promise made by cult leaders , and has a timeless appeal to the disenchanted looking for a higher principle and a new identity .
So Mohammed was certainly not the first or last " prophet " promising a new order for the believers in which the old social order would become meaningless , and they would be the ones to end up on top regardless of rank or birth .
That has always been actually a major recruiting tool , particularly for apocalyptic cults .
But Mohammed 's version had the largest wingspread , as a billion Muslims today still wait for the entire world to be transformed into a " perfectly just : Islamic society under Islamic law .
What Mohammed offered with Islam was a new identity for Arabs , as Muslims .
As tribes and clans they would always be divided and quarrelsome , but as Muslims they were supposed to form into a perfect unity through their submission to Allah , by way of old Mo himself .
And while the power of that appeal may often be lost on Westerners , one only need look at the average present day Arab nation , whose governments are familial , where the bureaucracy and military hierarchies are composed of the sons of families who have relationships with the families who run the entire system .
Beneath modern sounding titles such as President or Prime Minister , the old tribe and clan relations still dominate the region .
To rule one must have their support .
To get their support , one must trade favors .
And so under the aping of Western manners , titles , military uniforms and office buildings -- the Middle East of today is not so different from that of Mohammed 's time .
Except the Christians and Jews are mostly gone .
In their place is country after country full of Muslims , which are ruled by governments that are as nepotistic , corrupt and dysfunctional as you would expect from people who have no higher loyalty than to the clan .
And to that region , the Islamists come again with Mohammed 's old message , that they can overturn all that corruption and replace it with a higher identity , that of Islam .
The Islamists promise divine justice through Islamic law , corruption - free government as run by true believers and societies run by Islamic values that will no longer be playthings of the interests of the wealthy and the powerful .
And if you happen to be living in an overcrowded Middle Eastern slum like Cairo , run by a corrupt and brutal family and its associated lieutenants in a style virtually indistinguishable from the Mob , the appeal is an undeniably powerful one .
The Islamists of course can never deliver on their perfect " Islamic society " , because their own leadership is just as corrupted as the rest of the Middle East .
But by constantly holding out that promise of a perfect society and the brotherhood of all Muslims -- they capitalize on the existing discontent much as Mohammed himself did .
And if they ever succeed in taking over , the same sort of thugs that Mohammed himself employed and reward with the loot of his murdered victims , will suppress dissent far more ruthlessly than the previous authorities their " revolution " over threw -- as the Ayatollah 's Iran and the Taliban 's Afghanistan has aptly shown .
This then represents the problem with trying to apply democracy to the Muslim world .
Democracy on top of the clan system results only in representation for the clan leaders , which is perhaps a step forward , but not that much of one .
Since the clan leader is already the system and the clan is the process , democracy cannot displace him , just as democracy could not displace the DMV or the post office .
But it can and will elevate the Islamists , because it is a useful tool for those propounding Muslim unity , who are naturally the only point of unity in countries where there is no other unifying idea except xenophobia and intolerance for the smallest divergences from the norm .
While a few Arab and Muslim countries have experimented with nationalism , theirs is a recent and thin innovation with no real history behind it .
The borders of much of the Muslim world are the product of either European colonial mapmakers or , as in the case of Pakistan , enforced separations .
They may have flags and anthems , and their leaders may dress in suits or military uniforms borrowed from Westerners , but these are poor facades , and their own people know it .
Nasser 's Arab Socialism and Baathism were poor copies of European ideas implemented by professional elites and virtually meaningless to the ordinary Arab .
They did not bring unity , only more war .
( Islamism will of course do the same , something that the prolonged bout of Al Queda atrocities in Iraq and Jordan have communicated to a small percentage of the region 's inhabitants . )
But among all this violence and injustice , Islam continues to hold out the golden promise of a unified Ummah , on terms espoused by a cult leader on the primitive terms of a millennium and a half ago .
Because it represents magical thinking , it will always remain more appealing than real progress and reform .
While progress and reform take work , the magical solution of Sharia promises to make everything just and right as soon as it is imposed .
It is also why Muslims in the region will continue to see democracy as a means for imposing Islam , rather than as an end in and of itself .
Because simply injecting democracy into a region that lacks an understanding of a theory of government based on popular representation , turns into a tool for imposing the magical solution of Islam .
Turning to Western Muslims though , one might ask why they embrace Islamism even more aggressively than they do in their own home countries .
But the answer is rather obvious .
The multicultural societies they are asked to be part of are even more fractured and divided than at home , but without the relative structure of tribe and clan .
Studies have shown that in multicultural societies there is less trust between neighbors , which is an inevitable outcome of weakening the natural human bases for connections within a neighborhood or community .
Islamism is even more in demand in such a fractured system because it promises absolute unity , where now there is only a multitude of divisions .
The idea of Islam co-existing with a diversity of religions and beliefs is a bit of paradoxical stupidity .
Islam was created precisely to supplant a diversity of religions and beliefs by people who wanted to find unity through one supreme system .
The rise of Islamism in the West cannot be negated by multiculturalism -- ITS POPULARITY IS A REACTION TO MULTICULTURALISM .
The Muslim who finds himself having to deal with Christians , Jews , Sikhs and Hindus on a daily basis , who has to navigate a complex and often contradictory system of social rules and codes naturally longs for stability and simplicity , and he finds it in the most radical interpretations of Islam .
The Islamists have a simple set of rules for how Muslims and non-Muslims must behave , for how women must act and how men should act .
The Muslim professional in the West who must deal with clashing and contrasting obligations , who must try to understand what it is to be a Doctor and a Briton , who must choose between political parties and interact with people whose ideas repel him in a professional context will inevitably be drawn to Islam as the solution and the unifying principle in all these conflicts .
This great diverse society so beloved by the left is exactly what drives him to the mosque and to the bomb , in the name of simplifying all this mad cacophony until all the damned infidels bow their heads to the infinite justice and wisdom of Islam .
The final benefit of Islam of course is that it makes the Muslim in the West immediately superior to the Westerners .
The Muslim Doctor is not only immediately better than his Western colleagues for being a Muslim , but even the lowest doletaker is better than all the infidels .
And better than his Muslim brothers who have compromised their religion by becoming too British .
He finds a new solidarity and self - esteem by plotting to overthrow and conquer this nation of infidels .
And meanwhile back in Saudi Arabia or Iran , the same chaotic cluster of families and clans finances the Islamists , in order to keep their dangerous ideas away from their own throats while using them as a weapon against the West , watch and laugh .
Taj Gibson continues to be a force for the Bulls .
Gibson was drafted with the pick that was acquired from the Thunder for Thabo Sefolosha , and that ’s looking like a brilliant move now .
Last night Gibson blocked four shots and showed some impressive ball handling and quickness with this sick jam on Chris Kaman .
Harvard Law School professors Lawrence Lessig and Jack Goldsmith took to the op -ed page of the Washington Post today to slam the Obama administration 's approach to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) — and to threaten a lawsuit if ACTA is signed without Congressional oversight .
The US has positioned ACTA as an executive agreement rather than a treaty .
Such a move means that ACTA does n't need Senate approval , but it also means that the agreement should not alter US law , either .
If you want to change the law , you go to Congress .
Lessig and Goldmsith argue that ACTA , at least it its current leaked form , does involve " ideas and principles not reflected in US law . "
Example number one is a pretty poor choice , in our view ; the professors say that " ACTA could , for example , pressure Internet service providers — such as Comcast and Verizon — to kick users offline when they ( or their children ) have been accused of repeated copyright infringement because of content uploaded to sites such as YouTube . "
As we 've noted before , though , the language here comes from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act — already US law .
The leaked drafts show that ISPs need policies in place to deter repeat infringement ; a footnote suggests that " three strikes " Internet disconnections might be one appropriate way to do this , but would not be required .
The more fundamental complaint is that the president simply does n't have the power to negotiate executive agreements on IP law and communications policy .
" The administration has suggested that a sole executive agreement in this instance would not trample Congress 's prerogatives because the pact would not affect US domestic law , " write the professors .
" Binding the United States to international obligations of this sort without congressional approval would raise serious constitutional questions even if domestic law were not affected . "
They recommend that Congress stand up for its rights and insist on being consulted — something that ( now Vice President ) Joe Biden did to the Bush administration when he was a senator .
If ACTA is signed without such oversight , Lessig and Goldsmith say it will " be challenged in court . "
It appears that members of the right - wing Hutaree Militia were arrested in raids in Michigan last night .
Fox

The FBI refused to comment .
But you can enjoy some uncomfortable YouTube videos of disenfranchised white people running around with guns on the Hutaree MySpace page .
Here 's an example :

What ’s the point of having a Philosophy department in an American University ?
This story ( via Leiter ) concerns the requirement in Pennsylvania that any university department within the PASSHE system that graduates fewer than 30 majors over five years justify its existence .
A theater and dance department chair is quoted as follows :
“ This is an insult to many of our faculty who feel what they do is central to the life of the university , ” said Dr. Slavin , who also is vice president of the campus chapter of the faculty union , the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties .
“ Challenging them to justify their existence is really a slap in the face . ”
It is odd that in “ normal ” times it is just assumed that the departmental units can carry on without ever having to justify or even reflect very much on their existence or what they are supposed to be doing ?
It is entirely un-obvious why many departments should continue to exist ( and some of the most un - obvious graduate huge numbers of majors ) ; and one might have thought that it was a good idea even in normal times to review the justifications of their existence .
The fact that there is so little reflection on the missions of departments is down , in part , to a failure of management ; a failure that is just made starker by the demand that departments picked out by some arbitrary feature which , until this moment , they have been given no reason to think was a problem .
The issue made it to Leiter because several of the Philosophy departments in those institutions fall into the low - major category .
But is producing Philosophy majors the point of having a Philosophy department ?
In Our Underachieving Colleges ( CT review still on its way : DD to blame if I never get round to it ) Derek Bok claims that the standard assumptions within most departments in research universities is that the undergraduate curriculum is for attracting and then teaching majors , and , further , that our attention to the majors should be shaped by the aim of preparing them well for graduate school .
This means that the curriculum is designed for a tiny minority of the students who take classes , and even many of them , probably , would be better off doing something other than going to graduate school ( that ’s me , not Bok , saying the last bit ) .
I do n’t think of the curriculum , or the mission of my department in my institution , that way at all .
If I did I would campaign to remove our classes from the list of classes that meet breadth requirements and ask other majors not to require our classes .
In most places , including in my department ( even now , when we have a glut of majors , no doubt owing to the high quality instruction in my department and the newly found glamour in our field ) most of the enrollments in Philosophy courses ( as in most Humanities departments ) come from non-majors trying to fulfill breadth , general ed , or other - major - specific requirements .
If I were in the position of having to justify my own department ’s existence , and was unconstrained by the comments of my colleagues , I would focus on the service we do to students for whom the course they take from us is the only Philosophy course they take .
For many Business majors taking an ethics requirement , this is the only course in their upper years that they will write a paper , and for most it is one of very few courses in which retaining information will be less important than exercising higher order cognition , facing up to questions to which the answers are not known with certainty by anyone .
We serve ethics requirements for many majors , and what we do in those courses is NOT tell them what they ought to think about ethical issues , but introduce them to intellectual resources which , when used by people of good will , will help them to get closer to the truth concerning the hard ethical questions they will face as citizens , professionals , and in their personal lives .
Like most Philosophy departments we have an informal logic / critical reasoning course , which teaches students how to identify various kinds of fallacious reasoning , and targets instruction to contexts which the students are likely to find themselves in in the course of their lives .
We teach aesthetics , environmental ethics , and philosophy of religion , all of which courses attract students with other majors who want to think at a higher level of abstraction than their regular courses allow about what they are doing in their major .
Of course , all these courses also contain potential and actual majors .
Those people teaching the courses are not just teaching a mixed - ability group , but a mixed - interest group , in which students have a wide variety of levels of prior interest , and of other knowledge bases and interests .
Ideally we’d be attempting to provide every single student with the experience and resources which will be most valuable .
In practice , in large classes and deciding under uncertainty , we ca n’t do this ; we design our syllabuses and instruction with the aim of providing quite specific things to particular groups of students .
For myself , in the large lecture Contemporary Moral Issues course which is the course I teach most often , and which I have taught to many many more students than all my other courses put together , I have two main aims – one is to get the students thinking more carefully and in a richer way about moral issues that will affect their lives or about which they will be called to deliberate as citizens , by providing them with resources that our discipline has developed ; and to give some of the students a realistic insight into what moral philosophy is and why it might be interesting to them .
Both are , I hope , good for the majors , and I do try to ensure that students who either will major in , or are majoring in , Philosophy , will get a realistic sense of what one small corner of the discipline is like from my class — but that ’s a secondary , not a primary , goal .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I like having students who are thrilled about doing Philosophy , and the handful that I have helped on their way to graduate school have been among the students I have valued teaching most .
But so have students who became , or are becoming , social workers , nurses , teachers , and who took one of my classes simply to fulfill a requirement or on a whim or because some counselor strongly suggested it ( the most insulting — because the student fancied the counselor who suggested it ) .
When I think about justifying the existence of my department and what we should be doing , it is those students , and the value we can produce for them , that I think of first .

Sales of lazy foods such as peeled potatoes , chopped carrots and diced onions are on the rise .
But is there anything wrong with us taking a culinary shortcut ?
Think of the percentage of your life that is ebbing away as you peel a potato .
Get the potato out of the bag .
Trim off any sproutings .
Maybe turn on a tap .
Peel it .
It is perhaps no surprise that potato peeling was a classic punishment for those on jankers in the Army .
It 's not like chopping an onion requires any great skill , but people tell themselves they are too busy
Lesley Ball , home economist
To many , peeling potatoes is a boring way to spend a few minutes that you would rather spend reading a book , watching a film or with your family .
In the UK , there are people who really can't be bothered with the most basic of culinary chores .
Figures out this week from the price comparison website mysupermarket .
co.uk suggest there has been an increase over the past two years in the amount of money spent on a basket of " lazy food " products like grated cheese , sliced fruit and ready chopped vegetables .
Speak to a retailer like Waitrose , which has a varied range of " lazy food " and cooking " cheat " ingredients , and the picture is fleshed out .
The upmarket chain - which is rare in releasing very detailed sales data - has experienced a 40 % rise in sales of peeled potatoes compared with a year ago .
Diced onions are up 14 % .
Their butternut squash / sweet potato mix has seen a 29 % increase .
Across all prepared vegetables there has been a 17 % rise .
A few shortcuts ...
It is all part of a wider trend - albeit one that might have been disrupted by the recession - towards more convenience food , says Ronan Hegarty , news editor of The Grocer magazine .
" It is just a question of people wanting a lot more choice .
They are not being lazy but eating at different times , maybe looking for something easy to prepare at work .
" These are often more expensive alternatives , perhaps people are n't as affected by the recession as many would have predicted .
" Retailers like M&S Simply Food and Tesco Express have a high proportion of people on the move .
Convenience is definitely still on the rise . "
Lazy cooks
Some of the more extreme examples of " lazy food " might be seen to indicate a decline in culinary skills .
Despite having to peel potatoes , these men are happy
When in 1998 Delia Smith told viewers how to boil an egg , many pundits were incredulous , with chef Gary Rhodes accusing her of insulting people 's intelligence .
And yet last year , the pundits got another chance to throw up their hands in horror when pre-boiled eggs went on sale in supermarkets .
" Lazy food " conforms to one of the classic socioeconomic categories of modern times - the people who are cash - rich but time - poor .
But there are some people who rue the decline of chopping and peeling .
Lesley Ball , a Wiltshire - based home economist who teaches children about healthy eating and food provenance , says ready - prepared ingredients distort our perception of food and where it comes from .
" I work with children a lot and some of them think milk comes from a tiger or a chicken .
Some products , such as ready - prepared mango , melon or passionfruit are great for giving to children to introduce them to new tastes without having to buy a whole one , but they then do n't have a clue what a whole mango looks like .
" This happens even with something as simple as an orange .
They associate food not with something that 's grown , but with a shop . "
Lesley Ball explains how to squeeze a lemon with a fork
There is inevitably a certain disappointment that people do n't embrace the culinary process .
" I 'm amazed that things like ready - chopped carrots and onions are even on sale .
It 's not like chopping an onion requires any great skill , but people tell themselves they are too busy .
Whenever I work in supermarkets , I look at who buys these products and it 's typically professionals , young to middle - aged .
" These ready - prepared ingredients have produced lazy cooks - they think they do n't have the time to make real food .
But cooking is a bit of ritual , it 's a process to start from the beginning with ingredients you prepare yourself .
Preparation is an important part of cooking .
You get a feel for what you are making .
And food tastes better when it 's made from scratch . "
And she has a pet hate .
" Roast potatoes in the freezer .
It 's not difficult to make roast potatoes - you can just cut up potatoes and put them in the oven with olive oil . "
There 's a clear environmental issue with the rise of " lazy food " .
Diced onions come in a plastic bag .
An un -diced onion comes in its own natural packaging - onion skin .
Rosalind Rathouse , principal of London 's Cookery School , is n't surprised by the rise in sales of so - called lazy food - seeing it as a reflection of how people are distanced from the cultivation of what we eat .
Would you know what to do with a whole one ?
Many of those passing through her cookery classes have little idea about seasonality and sustainability of ingredients .
" You can see for busy people why they choose these foods .
It 's one - step before a ready - made sauce so in that sense it 's not as bad .
It 's a short - cut and I think not for people who truly love food , but just want to fill their stomachs . "
Has she ever bought chopped carrots ?
" Never .
I would n't ever buy pre-prepared carrots .
You want the freshest possible carrots you can have .
You do n't want it to have been through a machine and packed up in a plastic bag with gas to keep it fresh . "
But what about the nutritional side ?
Are ready prepared vegetables and fruit not as good for us as the untouched real thing ?
" One or two vitamins are very labile .
It means that they are very easily destroyed , " says Judy Buttriss , director general of the British Nutrition Foundation .
" If you cut something like cabbage or green pepper , those cut surfaces will gradually lose the vitamin . "
But the good news for the convenience fans is that this is n't every vitamin .
Ms Buttriss notes that vitamin C and folic acid can be partly lost with exposure to the air , but struggles to think of any others that we might lose from our green stuff .
And even in those cases , it 's better than nothing .
" If it 's causing them to eat more fruit and vegetables as a result it 's a good thing . "
The use of mild bleach to wash bagged salads has raised eyebrows in the past , but on the nutritional front at least it 's not easy to condemn prepared vegetables .
This is not the unhealthy end of convenience food .
That space belongs to your typical high - salt , high - fat ready meal .
This " lazy food " is most typically a cooking shortcut , not a pierce - film - and - microwave bit of cooking avoidance .
Spot quiz : Mango , pawpaw , other ?
And indeed it might be argued we all have a sliding scale between what we think is acceptable convenience and what we deem to be an unreasonably decadent expense .
Some people might laugh at the idea of a pre-boiled egg , but how many people insist on shelling their own peanuts ?
Peeled cloves of garlic may seem a little lax , but who currently wants their chickens with the heads still on and covered in feathers .
The whole idea of buying your food has an intrinsically " lazy " element .
You did n't kill it or grow it yourself .
The concept of the supermarket is a further slide into laziness .
It obviates the need to trawl round the butcher , the baker and greengrocer .
But there will always be occasions when " lazy food " goes too far and becomes an object of mockery .
" One thing I 've always balked at is a pre-sliced apple , " says Hegarty .
" Who is too scared to approach a full apple ? " Additional reporting by Megan Lane and Jonathan Duffy Send us your comments using the form below .
These products are essential for elderly people like my Mum , whose arthritis in her hands means she cannot use a vegetable peeler without it causing her considerable pain .

It would be interesting to see if the rise in the sale of pre-prepared vegetables is accompanied by any decrease in the sale of complete pre-prepared meals .
If pre-prepared vegetables is encouraging people to cook their own food rather than heat it up in a microwave then it is actually a step in the right direction .

You 're right , peeling a spud is a total waste of time .
Just scrub it clean and keep all the vitamins , and the taste , of the skin .
Candy Spillard , York , UK
You can always taste when it 's pre-prepared veg .
If you pre-peel , no matter how good the wrapping , the veg will dry out .
If you like good tasting food it needs to be fresh .
And the three minutes it takes to peel and slice a carrot is a fair sacrifice .
Olivia Holmes , Coventry I never buy these " lazy foods " .
However I can see that from the view of a single person , if you want roasted vegetables for example , you need to buy a lot of different , large vegetables and either use the same ingredients all week , or end up wasting a lot .
A bag of chopped mixed vegetables for this purpose seems fine to me , but a diced onion or peeled potato , really ?
Maybe for the elderly who struggle with their hands , but no - one else should need to resort to this .
I would say that it would be the inherent laziness that is taking over , not the convenience .
Will B I have never bought pre-cut veg and never plan to .
I also avoid pre-chopped meat as well .
All you need to do is learn some good knife skills and you can have all your veg for an evening meal chopped and ready in less time than it takes to make a cup of tea .
In fact , when I was at uni I used to be quite proud of the fact I could prepare , cook , eat and wash up a stir - fry in under 20 minutes .
Mark , Jersey I would no more buy ready chopped , sliced etc food than fly in the air , but I am a stay - at - home Mum and have the time to do it myself .
Others have n't got this luxury .
My children have been taught how to prepare food by me and they love it .
I hope it will stand them in good stead for later on in life when they need to look after themselves .
It 's also a lot cheaper to do it yourself and the more you do it the quicker you become at it .
Jenny Abou-zeid , Strathaven , Scotland I wonder what people actually do with all the time time they " save " with these products ?
Go to places where life is n't controlled by supermarkets and food multinationals and you will find food preparation is a great opportunity for families and friends to spend a little time together in a shared task .
It is relaxing , practical , often cross-generational and a great way of teaching kids about food .
The time is not wasted , it 's enjoyed .
Adam , Wales
I have to admit to being a fan of pre-sliced / chopped onion - far easier to open a packet and pop it in the pan , than peel & slice , and wipe away tears .
And as for pre sliced apple ... surely it 's better to pass a packet of pre-prepared fruit in a packet to a small child than a packet of crisps ?
Amanda , Winsford , Cheshire I prepared my own chicken from scratch for the first time the other weekend .
My boyfriend did the deed , I plucked and gutted it .
It was a delicious meal and I find you really appreciate food when you spend extra time preparing it .
Alex , Sussex Several years ago I took my daughter and her friend to our allotments .
As we left i dug up a couple of bunches of my prized organic carrots and offered one of them to my daughter 's friend .
With a look of absolute disgust the young girl said , " My mommy does n't get food from the dirt !
She goes to Tescos ! "
Still , at least she knew what a carrot was .
Doc Bob , Bristol I 've never understood the point of peeling potatoes , having been brought up being told that the skins had all the goodness in them ( although it was possible this was a rouse by my mother not to have to peel them herself ) .
Just give them a bit of a scrub under the tap .
I am always frustratingly amazed , though , at just how slowly my partner can chop an onion .
For him , the preparation part of cooking takes the longest , and a ready - chopped bag of something would genuinely save 10 or 20 minutes .
Luckily , he has an alternative in the shape of a willing sous chef .
Martha Hampson , London Spare a thought for those of us who are unable to prepare certain foods .
A close relative of mine has severe arthritis in both hands and is unable to grip a knife or peeler in order to prepare vegetables .
The rise of prepared foodstuffs in the supermarket means she is still able to make wholesome homemade dishes instead of having to resort to ready meals .
She is not the only person with this condition and I am sure a percentage of sales of prepared foods would be to people with a similar disability .
Elizabeth Campbell , Hereford I personally buy ready - prepared fruit salads or stir - fry stuff because if I buy all the ingredients needed to make my own , then I end up with five portions instead of one and throwing most of it away when it goes off two days later .
Charlotte , Birmingham
How is this different to tinned veg ?
Tinned peeled potatoes , processed peas , processed carrots , sweetcorn ... lazy food has been around for a while .
Now it just involves opening a packet rather than a tin .
Kate Jones , Lancaster , UK
My wife & I are both professionals who work long hours and will happily wash , peel & chop ( and that 's before we start on baking & making pasta ) as we spend our quality time together with our daughter in the kitchen teaching her about food and having conversations .
Sounds outlandish ?
Possibly not , as this is time well invested in our marriage and in raising a well - behaved child who has no issues with anything .
John , Bolton , UK
The writing was on the wall years ago when my local supermarket started selling oven - ready baked potatoes .

My first impression of Ben Westlund was , I admit , not a favorable one .
I found myself across the table from him in a Salem tavern , where he was holding court like some minor satrap .
I thought that this was a fellow who had a good chance of living up to Lord Acton 's dictum about absolute power .
But I was also impressed that he had chosen as his throne the Democrats ' watering hole .
Over the years I worked in the Legislature , I saw plenty of members go from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader .
Ben was one of the few who traveled that path in reverse .
We spent a lot of time together in the special sessions of 2001 and 2003 , when , as Ways and Means chairman , Ben struggled to balance the budget .
He 'd come into my office with an idea .
I 'd explain that the constitution did n't allow it .
He 'd want to know why , and I 'd tell him that the framers of Oregon 's constitution may have been farmers , but they were a savvy lot , and they knew that when times got tough legislators would try creative accounting -- practices they crafted the constitution to stop .
Ben did n't like the answer , but he kept coming back with idea after idea .
I grew to admire his creativity and his persistence .
I could tell that the cuts the Legislature was having to make were hurting Oregonians , and that in turn was hurting him .
Then came the speech he gave upon his return from treatment for cancer .
A speech so forceful , so honest , that you could hear the proverbial pin drop in a room full of folks who normally talk over each other .
From that day on , if not before , I knew Ben as someone who always put others ahead of himself .
One example : A friend told me that X - rays had suggested lung cancer .
I called Ben and asked if he would be a mentor to the friend .
Before I could get back to the friend with Ben 's unequivocal yes , Ben had called the friend and given his cell number and an invitation to call any time .
Ben was a call - any - time kind of person .
He would call you at any hour .
And you knew no hour was too early or too late for you to call him .
More than anything , Ben Westlund was a just plain good person .
There are n't enough people like that in the world .
Any now there is one fewer .
Gregory Chaimov is an attorney and Milwaukie city councilman .
Twice a day , seven days a week , from February to November for the past four years , two researchers have layered themselves with thermal underwear and outerwear , with fleece , flannel , double gloves , double socks , padded overalls and puffy red parkas , mummifying themselves until they look like twin Michelin Men .
Then they step outside , trading the warmth and modern conveniences of a science station ( foosball , fitness center , 24 - hour cafeteria ) for a minus - 100 - degree Fahrenheit featureless landscape , flatter than Kansas and one of the coldest places on the planet .
They trudge in darkness nearly a mile , across a plateau of snow and ice , until they discern , against the backdrop of more stars than any hands - in - pocket backyard observer has ever seen , the silhouette of the giant disk of the South Pole Telescope , where they join a global effort to solve possibly the greatest riddle in the universe : what most of it is made of .
Related Content The Doomed South Pole Voyage 's Remaining Photographs
For thousands of years our species has studied the night sky and wondered if anything else is out there .
Last year we celebrated the 400th anniversary of Galileo ’s answer : Yes .
Galileo trained a new instrument , the telescope , on the heavens and saw objects that no other person had ever seen : hundreds of stars , mountains on the Moon , satellites of Jupiter .
Since then we have found more than 400 planets around other stars , 100 billion stars in our galaxy , hundreds of billions of galaxies beyond our own , even the faint radiation that is the echo of the Big Bang .
Now scientists think that even this extravagant census of the universe might be as out - of - date as the five - planet cosmos that Galileo inherited from the ancients .
Astronomers have compiled evidence that what we ’ve always thought of as the actual universe — me , you , this magazine , planets , stars , galaxies , all the matter in space — represents a mere 4 percent of what ’s actually out there .
The rest they call , for want of a better word , dark : 23 percent is something they call dark matter , and 73 percent is something even more mysterious , which they call dark energy .
“ We have a complete inventory of the universe , ” Sean Carroll , a California Institute of Technology cosmologist , has said , “ and it makes no sense . ”
Scientists have some ideas about what dark matter might be —exotic and still hypothetical particles — but they have hardly a clue about dark energy .
In 2003 , the National Research Council listed “ What Is the Nature of Dark Energy ? ” as one of the most pressing scientific problems of the coming decades .
The head of the committee that wrote the report , University of Chicago cosmologist Michael S. Turner , goes further and ranks dark energy as “ the most profound mystery in all of science . ”
The effort to solve it has mobilized a generation of astronomers in a rethinking of physics and cosmology to rival and perhaps surpass the revolution Galileo inaugurated on an autumn evening in Padua .
They are coming to terms with a deep irony : it is sight itself that has blinded us to nearly the entire universe .
And the recognition of this blindness , in turn , has inspired us to ask , as if for the first time :
What is this cosmos we call home ?
Scientists reached a consensus in the 1970s that there was more to the universe than meets the eye .
In computer simulations of our galaxy , the Milky Way , theorists found that the center would not hold — based on what we can see of it , our galaxy does n’t have enough mass to keep everything in place .
As it rotates , it should disintegrate , shedding stars and gas in every direction .
Either a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way violates the laws of gravity , or the light emanating from it — from the vast glowing clouds of gas and the myriad stars — is an inaccurate indication of the galaxy ’s mass .
But what if some portion of a galaxy ’s mass did n’t radiate light ?
If spiral galaxies contained enough of such mystery mass , then they might well be obeying the laws of gravity .
Astronomers dubbed the invisible mass “ dark matter . ”
“ Nobody ever told us that all matter radiated , ” Vera Rubin , an astronomer whose observations of galaxy rotations provided evidence for dark matter , has said .
“ We just assumed that it did . ”
The effort to understand dark matter defined much of astronomy for the next two decades .
Astronomers may not know what dark matter is , but inferring its presence allowed them to pursue in a new way an eternal question :
What is the fate of the universe ?
They already knew that the universe is expanding .
In 1929 , the astronomer Edwin Hubble had discovered that distant galaxies were moving away from us and that the farther away they got , the faster they seemed to be receding .
This was a radical idea .
Instead of the stately , eternally unchanging still life that the universe once appeared to be , it was actually alive in time , like a movie .
Rewind the film of the expansion and the universe would eventually reach a state of infinite density and energy — what astronomers call the Big Bang .
But what if you hit fast - forward ?
How would the story end ?
The universe is full of matter , and matter attracts other matter through gravity .
Astronomers reasoned that the mutual attraction among all that matter must be slowing down the expansion of the universe .
But they did n’t know what the ultimate outcome would be .
Would the gravitational effect be so forceful that the universe would ultimately stretch a certain distance , stop and reverse itself , like a ball tossed into the air ?
Or would it be so slight that the universe would escape its grasp and never stop expanding , like a rocket leaving Earth ’s atmosphere ?
Or did we live in an exquisitely balanced universe , in which gravity ensures a Goldilocks rate of expansion neither too fast nor too slow — so the universe would eventually come to a virtual standstill ?
Assuming the existence of dark matter and that the law of gravitation is universal , two teams of astrophysicists — one led by Saul Perlmutter , at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , the other by Brian Schmidt , at Australian National University — set out to determine the future of the universe .
Throughout the 1990s the rival teams closely analyzed a number of exploding stars , or supernovas , using those unusually bright , short - lived distant objects to gauge the universe ’s growth .
They knew how bright the supernovas should appear at different points across the universe if the rate of expansion were uniform .
By comparing how much brighter the supernovas actually did appear , astronomers figured they could determine how much the expansion of the universe was slowing down .
But to the astronomers ’ surprise , when they looked as far as halfway across the universe , six or seven billion light - years away , they found that the supernovas were n’t brighter — and therefore nearer — than expected .
They were dimmer — that is , more distant .
The two teams both concluded that the expansion of the universe is n’t slowing down .
It ’s speeding up .
The implication of that discovery was momentous : it meant that the dominant force in the evolution of the universe is n’t gravity .
It is ... something else .
Both teams announced their findings in 1998 .
Turner gave the “ something ” a nickname : dark energy .
It stuck .
Since then , astronomers have pursued the mystery of dark energy to the ends of the Earth — literally .
“ The South Pole has the harshest environment on Earth , but also the most benign , ” says William Holzapfel , a University of California at Berkeley astrophysicist who was the on-site lead researcher at the South Pole Telescope ( SPT ) when I visited .
He was n’t referring to the weather , though in the week between Christmas and New Year ’s Day — early summer in the Southern Hemisphere — the Sun shone around the clock , the temperatures were barely in the minus single digits ( and one day even broke zero ) , and the wind was mostly calm .
Holzapfel made the walk from the National Science Foundation ’s Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station ( a snowball ’s throw from the traditional site of the pole itself , which is marked with , yes , a pole ) to the telescope wearing jeans and running shoes .
One afternoon the telescope ’s laboratory building got so warm the crew propped open a door .
But from an astronomer ’s perspective , not until the Sun goes down and stays down — March through September — does the South Pole get “ benign . ”
“ It ’s six months of uninterrupted data , ” says Holzapfel .
During the 24 - hour darkness of the austral autumn and winter , the telescope operates nonstop under impeccable conditions for astronomy .
The atmosphere is thin ( the pole is more than 9,300 feet above sea level , 9,000 of which are ice ) .
The atmosphere is also stable , due to the absence of the heating and cooling effects of a rising and setting Sun ; the pole has some of the calmest winds on Earth , and they almost always blow from the same direction .
Perhaps most important for the telescope , the air is exceptionally dry ; technically , Antarctica is a desert .
( Chapped hands can take weeks to heal , and perspiration is n’t really a hygiene issue , so the restriction to two showers a week to conserve water is n’t much of a problem .
As one pole veteran told me , “ The moment you go back through customs at Christchurch [ New Zealand ] , that ’s when you ’ll need a shower . ” )
The SPT detects microwaves , a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is particularly sensitive to water vapor .
Humid air can absorb microwaves and prevent them from reaching the telescope , and moisture emits its own radiation , which could be misread as cosmic signals .
To minimize these problems , astronomers who analyze microwaves and submillimeter waves have made the South Pole a second home .
Their instruments reside in the Dark Sector , a tight cluster of buildings where light and other sources of electromagnetic radiation are kept to a minimum .
( Nearby are the Quiet Sector , for seismology research , and the Clean Air Sector , for climate projects . )
Astronomers like to say that for more pristine observing conditions , they would have to go into outer space — an exponentially more expensive proposition , and one that NASA generally does n’t like to pursue unless the science can’t easily be done on Earth .
( A dark energy satellite has been on and off the drawing board since 1999 , and last year went “ back to square one , ” according to one NASA adviser . )
At least on Earth , if something goes wrong with an instrument , you do n’t need to commandeer a space shuttle to fix it .
The United States has maintained a year - round presence at the pole since 1956 , and by now the National Science Foundation ’s U.S. Antarctic Program has gotten life there down to , well , a science .
Until 2008 , the station was housed in a geodesic dome whose crown is still visible above the snow .
The new base station resembles a small cruise ship more than a remote outpost and sleeps more than 150 , all in private quarters .
Through the portholes that line the two floors , you can contemplate a horizon as hypnotically level as any ocean’s .
The new station rests on lifts that , as snow accumulates , allow it to be jacked up two full stories .
The snowfall in this ultra - arid region may be minimal , but that which blows in from the continent ’s edges can still make a mess , creating one of the more mundane tasks for the SPT ’s winter - over crew .
Once a week during the dark months , when the station population shrinks to around 50 , the two on - site SPT researchers have to climb into the telescope ’s 33 - foot - wide microwave dish and sweep it clean .
The telescope gathers data and sends it to the desktops of distant researchers .
The two “ winter - overs ” spend their days working on the data , too , analyzing it as if they were back home .
But when the telescope hits a glitch and an alarm on their laptops sounds , they have to figure out what the problem is — fast .
“ An hour of down time is thousands of dollars of lost observing time , ” says Keith Vanderlinde , one of 2008 ’s two winter - overs .
“ There are always little things .
A fan will break because it ’s so dry down there , all the lubrication goes away .
And then the computer will overheat and turn itself off , and suddenly we ’re down and we have no idea why . ”
At that point , the environment might not seem so “ benign ” after all .
No flights go to or from the South Pole from March to October ( a plane ’s engine oil would gelatinize ) , so if the winter - overs ca n’t fix whatever is broken , it stays broken — which has n’t yet happened .
More than most sciences , astronomy depends on the sense of sight ; before astronomers can reimagine the universe as a whole , they first have to figure out how to perceive the dark parts .
Knowing what dark matter is would help scientists think about how the structure of the universe forms .
Knowing what dark energy does would help scientists think about how that structure has evolved over time — and how it will continue to evolve .
Scientists have a couple of candidates for the composition of dark matter — hypothetical particles called neutralinos and axions .
For dark energy , however , the challenge is to figure out not what it is but what it ’s like .
In particular , astronomers want to know if dark energy changes over space and time , or whether it ’s constant .
One way to study it is to measure so - called baryon acoustic oscillations .
When the universe was still in its infancy , a mere 379,000 years old , it cooled sufficiently for baryons ( particles made from protons and neutrons ) to separate from photons ( packets of light ) .
This separation left behind an imprint — called the cosmic microwave background — that can still be detected today .
It includes sound waves ( “ acoustic oscillations ” ) that coursed through the infant universe .
The peaks of those oscillations represent regions that were slightly denser than the rest of the universe .
And because matter attracts matter through gravity , those regions grew even denser as the universe aged , coalescing first into galaxies and then into clusters of galaxies .
If astronomers compare the original cosmic microwave background oscillations with the distribution of galaxies at different stages of the universe ’s history , they can measure the rate of the universe ’s expansion .
Another approach to defining dark energy involves a method called gravitational lensing .
According to Albert Einstein ’s theory of general relativity , a beam of light traveling through space appears to bend because of the gravitational pull of matter .
( Actually , it ’s space itself that bends , and light just goes along for the ride . )
If two clusters of galaxies lie along a single line of sight , the foreground cluster will act as a lens that distorts light coming from the background cluster .
This distortion can tell astronomers the mass of the foreground cluster .
By sampling millions of galaxies in different parts of the universe , astronomers should be able to estimate the rate at which galaxies have clumped into clusters over time , and that rate in turn will tell them how fast the universe expanded at different points in its history .
The South Pole Telescope uses a third technique , called the Sunyaev - Zel ’ dovich effect , named for two Soviet physicists , which draws on the cosmic microwave background .
If a photon from the latter interacts with hot gas in a cluster , it experiences a slight increase in energy .
Detecting this energy allows astronomers to map those clusters and measure the influence of dark energy on their growth throughout the history of the universe .
That , at least , is the hope .
“ A lot of people in the community have developed what I think is a healthy skepticism .
They say , ‘ That ’s great , but show us the money , ’ ” says Holzapfel .
“ And I think within a year or two , we ’ll be in a position to be able to do that . ”
The SPT team focuses on galaxy clusters because they are the largest structures in the universe , often consisting of hundreds of galaxies — they are one million billion times the mass of the Sun .
As dark energy pushes the universe to expand , galaxy clusters will have a harder time growing .
They will become more distant from one another , and the universe will become colder and lonelier .
Galaxy clusters “ are sort of like canaries in a coal mine in terms of structure formation , ” Holzapfel says .
If the density of dark matter or the properties of dark energy were to change , the abundance of clusters “ would be the first thing to be altered . ”
The South Pole Telescope should be able to track galaxy clusters over time .
“ You can say , ‘ At so many billion years ago , how many clusters were there , and how many are there now ? ’ ” says Holzapfel .
“ And then compare them to your predictions . ”
Yet all these methods come with a caveat .
They assume that we sufficiently understand gravity , which is not only the force opposing dark energy but has been the very foundation of physics for the past four centuries .
Twenty times a second , a laser high in the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico aims a pulse of light at the Moon , 239,000 miles away .
The beam ’s target is one of three suitcase - size reflectors that Apollo astronauts planted on the lunar surface four decades ago .
Photons from the beam bounce off the mirror and return to New Mexico .
Total round - trip travel time : 2.5 seconds , more or less .
That “ more or less ” makes all the difference .
By timing the speed - of - light journey , researchers at the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser - ranging Operation ( APOLLO ) can measure the Earth - Moon distance moment to moment and map the Moon ’s orbit with exquisite precision .
As in the apocryphal story of Galileo dropping balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to test the universality of free fall , APOLLO treats the Earth and Moon like two balls dropping in the gravitational field of the Sun. Mario Livio , an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , calls it an “ absolutely incredible experiment . ”
If the orbit of the Moon exhibits even the slightest deviation from Einstein ’s predictions , scientists might have to rethink his equations — and perhaps even the existence of dark matter and dark energy .
“ So far , Einstein is holding , ” says one of APOLLO ’s lead observers , astronomer Russet McMillan , as her five - year project passes the halfway point .
Even if Einstein were n’t holding , researchers would first have to eliminate other possibilities , such as an error in the measure of the mass of the Earth , Moon or Sun , before conceding that general relativity requires a corrective .
Even so , astronomers know that they take gravity for granted at their own peril .
They have inferred the existence of dark matter due to its gravitational effects on galaxies , and the existence of dark energy due to its anti-gravitational effects on the expansion of the universe .
What if the assumption underlying these twin inferences — that we know how gravity works — is wrong ?
Can a theory of the universe even more outlandish than one positing dark matter and dark energy account for the evidence ?
To find out , scientists are testing gravity not only across the universe but across the tabletop .
Until recently , physicists had n’t measured gravity at extremely close ranges .
“ Astonishing , is n’t it ? ” says Eric Adelberger , the coordinator of several gravity experiments taking place in a laboratory at the University of Washington , Seattle .
“ But it would n’t be astonishing if you tried to do it ” — if you tried to test gravity at distances shorter than a millimeter .
Testing gravity is n’t simply a matter of putting two objects close to each other and measuring the attraction between them .
All sorts of other things may be exerting a gravitational influence .
“ There ’s metal here , ” Adelberger says , pointing to a nearby instrument .
“ There ’s a hillside over here ” — waving toward some point past the concrete wall that encircles the laboratory .
“ There ’s a lake over there . ”
There ’s also the groundwater level in the soil , which changes every time it rains .
Then there ’s the rotation of the Earth , the position of the Sun , the dark matter at the heart of our galaxy .
Over the past decade the Seattle team has measured the gravitational attraction between two objects at smaller and smaller distances , down to 56 microns ( or 1/500 of an inch ) , just to make sure that Einstein ’s equations for gravity hold true at the shortest distances , too .
So far , they do .
But even Einstein recognized that his theory of general relativity did n’t entirely explain the universe .
He spent the last 30 years of his life trying to reconcile his physics of the very big with the physics of the very small — quantum mechanics .
He failed .
Theorists have come up with all sorts of possibilities in an attempt to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics : parallel universes , colliding universes , bubble universes , universes with extra dimensions , universes that eternally reproduce , universes that bounce from Big Bang to Big Crunch to Big Bang .
Adam Riess , an astronomer who collaborated with Brian Schmidt on the discovery of dark energy , says he looks every day at an Internet site ( xxx.lanl.gov/archive /astro-ph ) where scientists post their analyses to see what new ideas are out there .
“ Most of them are pretty kooky , ” he says .
“ But it ’s possible that somebody will come out with a deep theory . ”
For all its advances , astronomy turns out to have been laboring under an incorrect , if reasonable , assumption : what you see is what you get .
Now astronomers have to adapt to the idea that the universe is not the stuff of us — in the grand scheme of things , our species and our planet and our galaxy and everything we have ever seen are , as theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss of Arizona State University has said , “ a bit of pollution . ”
Yet cosmologists tend not to be discouraged .
“ The really hard problems are great , ” says Michael Turner , “ because we know they ’ll require a crazy new idea . ”
As Andreas Albrecht , a cosmologist at the University of California at Davis , said at a recent conference on dark energy : “ If you put the timeline of the history of science before me and I could choose any time and field , this is where I ’d want to be . ”
Richard Panek wrote about Einstein for Smithsonian in 2005 .
His book on dark matter and dark energy will appear in 2011 .
Hamas 's Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in the Dubai hotel the day before his killing
The 11 people suspected of killing a Hamas commander in Dubai have been placed on international police organisation Interpol 's wanted list .
Interpol has posted the photographs and names it suspects were used fraudulently by the individuals .
Dubai 's police chief says he is 99 % sure Israeli secret service agents were involved in Mahmoud al - Mabhouh 's death , but Israel says there is no proof .
The UK has expressed " outrage " that six British passports were used .
Miliband vow Interpol has issued Red Notices for the suspects .
Although not an international arrest warrant , a Red Notice requests that the suspects be arrested pending extradition .
Interpol does not believe that we know the true identities of these wanted persons
Ronald K Noble ,
Interpol secretary general
Pictures of ' 11 Europeans ' Israel 's ' covert killing ' history No proof of Dubai hit - Israel Why was Hamas man in Dubai ?
Interpol said it believed the suspects had stolen the identities of real people and the names were used as aliases .
It said it was posting the photos and names " in order to limit the ability of accused murderers from travelling freely using the same false passports " .
Interpol secretary general Ronald K Noble said : " [ We do ] not believe that we know the true identities of these wanted persons . "
Mr Noble said he hoped the investigation process would " help to establish the innocence of the ordinary citizens and even of countries whose identities were stolen and fraudulently used " .
In response to the Interpol move , Dubai police chief Dahi Khalfan Tamim called for it to issue " a Red Notice against the head of Mossad " , the Israeli secret service .
Hamas killing Police in Dubai have released images of 27 people they believe are behind the killing of a senior Hamas commander .
The suspects are accused of using fake passports bearing their own pictures , but the names of innocent citizens .
Twelve of the passports used were British ( shown on previous slide ) .
The other 15 on the list are reported to have used stolen identities from Australian , French , Irish and German citizens .
The 27th suspect used the alias Joshua Aaron Krycer - a stolen Australian identity ( pictured left ) .
Police say the suspects used their fake documents to travel to Dubai in groups , flying from Zurich , Rome , Paris and Frankfurt .
One of the victims of the identity theft was British - Israeli Paul John Keeley ( pictured right ) .
The passport used by one of the suspected assassins bore his name , but featured a photograph of another man ( pictured left ) .
Palestinian militant Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was killed in his hotel room in Dubai on 20 January .
Police claim one of the suspects , pictured on the left , went to a hotel to put on a disguise .
He is seen leaving a toilet wearing a wig .
Surveillance cameras also recorded Mr Mabhouh , circled in red above , at the hotel 's reception before his death .
At the bottom of the image the head of one of the suspects can be seen .
As Mr Mabhouh leaves , the suspect follows .
Mr Mabhouh is trailed into the lift by a number of the suspects , including two pictured here in tennis gear .
Investigators believe he had been followed from Syria to Dubai where it is thought he wanted to buy weapons for Hamas .
When Mr Mabhouh leaves the lift , police say two of the suspects can be seen following him down the corridor .
He was later found dead in his room .
A post -mortem report said he had been electrocuted and suffocated .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT A number of Western nations , including the UK and France , have increased the pressure on Israel to provide any details it may have on the killing in a Dubai hotel on 20 January .
The passports suspected to have been used fraudulently comprised six British , three Irish , and one each from France and Germany .
Germany is the latest country to become involved , summoning the Israeli charge d'affaires for an explanation .
[ Ireland ] takes grave exception to the forgery and misuse of Irish passports
Micheal Martin ,
Irish Foreign Minister
Bumpy road for relations Reactions to the British connection Irish passports real numbers The UK and Irish Republic governments summoned their Israeli ambassadors to meetings on Thursday .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband vowed to " get to the bottom " of the case .
Israel 's ambassador to the UK , Ron Prosor , said he was " unable to add additional information " .
Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said there had been " frank " talks with Israel 's envoy .
Mr Martin said : " Regardless of who was responsible , [ Ireland ] takes grave exception to the forgery and misuse of Irish passports .
" The ambassador said he had no information on the matter . "
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Wednesday there was no evidence of Israeli involvement .
He added : " Israel never responds , never confirms and never denies . "

Reports have suggested Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was in Dubai to buy weapons for Hamas , the Palestinian Islamist movement .
Two Palestinian suspects are being questioned about the murder .
Police said the pair fled to Jordan after the killing , but were extradited back to Dubai on Sunday .
The BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Dubai says in terms of Israeli involvement there is only circumstantial evidence and the fact that Mossad has a history of assassinations .
He says that although none of the Dubai 11 are in custody , there are the two Palestinians and more evidence might be coming out of them .
The BBC's Katya Adler in Jerusalem says more details of the two have emerged .
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Suhri told the BBC the men were members of the Palestinian Authority 's security apparatus .
They were originally from Gaza , he said , but fled the Strip three years ago when Hamas took over the territory .

The University of Queensland will switch on to Earth Hour by switching off on Saturday , March 27 .
This is the third consecutive year the University has participated in the worldwide effort to reduce energy consumption .
Between 8.30 pm and 9.30 pm all non-essential lighting will be switched off at the St Lucia , Ipswich , Gatton and Herston campuses , as well as the Indooroopilly Mine , Customs House and the Moreton Bay Research Station .
Vice - Chancellor Professor Paul Greenfield said UQ was enthusiastic about being a part of the campaign , which last year resulted in considerable energy savings .
" In 2009 , UQ achieved a 6.5 percent energy reduction during Earth Hour , with an estimated total saving of 730 kilograms of carbon dioxide , " Professor Greenfield said .
" I would encourage staff and students to take measures to reduce their carbon footprint , not just during Earth Hour , but as a matter of course .
" Earth Hour is indicative of UQ's ongoing commitment to energy conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation . "
During the event , UQ's occupational health and safety guidelines will be observed , and emergency lighting and University security systems will operate normally .
This year Earth Hour also marks the launch of another UQ energy saving initiative .
As part of this initiative , from March 27 onward , security officers will switch off unnecessary lighting during their nightly checks of buildings at the St Lucia , Ipswich and Gatton campuses .
Head of Security Warren Collyer said the benefits of the program were two - fold .
" The hope is that this program results in considerable savings in power , which will have both an environmental and cost benefit , " Mr Collyer said .
" The extra security presence on campus at night will also increase safety of UQ students and staff here after hours . "
Mr Collyer said security officers would be switching off non-essential lights only , and would not interfere with lighting in areas where research was being conducted .
Anyone wishing to register to be involved in Earth Hour can find details at earthhour.org.au .

Two New York City police officers have been suspended without pay after video surfaced of them punching a suspect who was handcuffed and lying on the ground .
The video , obtained by the New York Daily News , shows officers John Cicero and William Green repeatedly hitting Johnathan Baez in the head .
Baez was one of eight men apprehended during an undercover drug sting gone awry in the Bronx on Jan .
5 .

“ This is not an isolated incident , ” Baez ’ lawyer , Jeffrey Emdin , said .
“ What sets this apart is that it was caught on tape . ”
Baez was initially charged with obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest , but the charges have been dropped , the New York Times reports .
It ’s not known yet if the two officers involved will be charged .
Two supervising officers who were on the scene and did not prevent the attack on Baez have been placed on desk duty .
Two other NYPD officers were injured during the Jan. 5 drug bust , when one of the officers opened fire on a charging pit bull .
The shrapnel from the bullet wounded two officers .
A friend of Baez , Louis Miranda , told the New York Post that he too was assaulted by officers , and that in his case the violence was “ even worse ” than what was caught on film .
Both Baez and Miranda plan to sue the police department .

Labels it a ‘ bailout ’ for the insurance industry
Facing razor - thin margins in the House , Democratic leaders are hoping to convert the sole liberal who opposes their health care bill , but it seems they have their work cut out because he is n’t budging .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) on Monday defended his opposition to the proposal in an appearance on MSNBC ’s Countdown With Keith Olbermann , citing as his central concern its lack of a robust public option to provide competition for insurance companies .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This bill represents a giveaway to the insurance industry , ” Kucinich said .
“ $ 70 billion dollars a year , and no guarantees of any control over premiums , forcing people to buy private insurance , five consecutive years of double - digit premium increases . ”
The proposal the White House and Democrats are coalescing around comprises subsidies for lower - income individuals and a mandate that they purchase insurance .
It also bans insurers from dropping sick people from their plans or denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions .
An ardent proponent of a single - payer or Medicare - for - all system , Kucinich reiterated his view that the current template offers private insurers “ a version of a bailout ” and predicted they ’ll continue “ socking it to consumers . ”
“ I told the president twice in two different meetings that I could n’t support the bill if it did n’t have a robust public option and at least if it did n’t have something that was going to protect consumers from these rampant premium increases , ” he added .
The Congressional Budget Office projected that the Senate bill , upon which the current version is closely based , will by 2019 extend coverage to roughly 31 million legal American residents while reducing the deficit by $ 132 billion .
ADVERTISEMENT
Democrats and progressives consider Kucinich one of the more likely Congressmen to flip his “ no ” vote , as he favors a progressive health care overhaul and agrees with the broad principles behind the reform effort .
He voted against the narrowly - approved House legislation in November , which contained a public option but one that was weaker than progressives advocated for .
The likely elimination of the provision altogether seems to make Kucinich ’s vote all the more elusive .
The Ohio congressman left no doubt that he plans to oppose the bill again , even if he were to cast the swing - vote .
“ If that sounded like a no , you ’re correct , ” he told guest host Lawrence O’Donnell , declaring the effort was like “ building on sand . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Many Democrats and progressives insist that failing to pass health care reform would be politically disastrous for the party in the November midterm elections .
The congressman told Raw Story in January that Democrats “ lost the initiative the minute that our party jumped into bed with the insurance companies . ”
He alleged that the proposals on the table would further escalate income inequality in the United States .

Presenting Perl Website
Today , 1st March ( though this post was written late on the 28th February ) , Shadowcat Systems , in the guise of Matt S. trout and Mark Keating are launching a new community resource site called Presenting Perl .
So what is it ?
Well basically ...
The presenting Perl website is a resource location for talks and presentations on , or about , the Perl language .
The site will initially have videos from conferences and workshops but it is our aim to provide a single location for all Perl audio / visual resources and material .
Coming soon will be the ability for the authors of the videos to add html links and materials of their own to other resources , such as slides , supporting documents on the net .
Or to embed those items in the page their video or presentation is displayed upon .
Future iterations of the site will , we hope , incorporate other multimedia properties as we develop them .
The site is built and maintained by Shadowcat Systems Limited , but we will accept offers to support , promote , and build the project from interested parties .
Presenting Perl is powered by Idiot Box which is built using the Web : : Simple framework created by Matt S. Trout for ' light web applications ' development .
All of the material will have a licence on the page it is on .
The general site licence is a " Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works 3.0 Unported Licence " , other material provided by authors may have their own restrictions and conditions .
If you wish to use any of the material at another location then please contact the site owners to confirm usage , also so we can promote and link your usage .
Well okay then ...
I know that all sounded very dry and stuffy but I was writing this as a serious piece that I could ameliorate to different contexts , then I realised that what I wrote could n't be fused into different styles without still sounding stuffy so I left it and will hope you 'll forgive me for sounding so drab and making a fun thing sound so restrictive .
If anyone has any video or resources they want to start adding to the site then please contact me and we 'll work on incorporating that .
If you have some time and want to help work on aspects of the sites code , design , look , feel , message and purpose , well you know where we are ; ) .
I will keep you all updated to the changes and new features as and when we release them .
If anyone has feedback ( and until we have a commenting system ) please do n't hesitate to email me at : m.keating [ at ] shadowcat.co.uk , if your comments are useful , fun , or just plain interest to me , or if I think will be useful to others , then I will add them to the end of this post , let me know how you would like to be named ( anon , nick etc . ) .

Now that Internet Explorer 9 has been let out its cage , we all know a great deal more about Microsoft ’s position towards the video codec situation with the HTML5 video tag .
Microsoft has chosen for H264 , a codec it already includes in Windows by default anyway .
This means that apart from Firefox and Opera , every other major browser will support H264 .
Some are seeing this as a reason for Mozilla to give in to their ideals and include support for H264 as well – I say : Mozilla , stick to your ideals .
The last people you should be listening to in matters like this are web developers .
University Of Texas Claims Trademark Over ' Texas ' ; Wants Useful iPhone App Blocked
from the oh - come - on dept
A free download , the app retains the searchable directory but also lists menus from different cafeterias across campus , tallies students ' dining - card and Bevo Bucks balances , delivers class schedules , shows campus maps , and more .
On Feb. 1 , the Mutual team learned that UT had raised another objection to its latest app , specifically to the use of the word " Texas " in the name .
" As this name is confusingly similar to the Texas [ trademark ] , UT objects to such use , " reads a notice sent to the Apple app store by attorney Wendy Larson .
UT 's board of regents began trademarking university properties back in 1981 .
A list of protected trademarks appears on the university Office of Trade mark Licensing Web page ; alongside more specific trademarks such as Bevo and Lady Longhorns is , simply , Texas .

Trademark law , when used properly , serves an important purpose in making sure that consumers are not made worse off by being tricked into buying lower quality products and services under the belief that they 're actually coming from someone else who is trusted .
But in the age of the " ownership culture , " where too many people have tried to twist trademark law away from its true origins to make it appear to be a quasi - " property right , " you get too many cases of people using trademark law to actually make consumers worse off .
Take for example this story , sent in by iamtheky about how the University of Texas is trying to stop some former students from making an incredibly useful iPhone app for UT students , called iTexas , by claiming it infringes on their trademark on The makers of the app , Mutual Mobile , have made a bunch of successful iPhone apps , but UT got upset last year when the company introduced the UT Directory , which put a much more useful interface on ( you guessed it ) the UT staff and student directories .
After the University complained , the company felt that perhaps the use of the school 's colors made it look like an " official " app , so they agreed to fix that part .
When the company launched iTexas , it made sure that it did n't have the school 's color scheme or do anything to make it appear as the official app .
But it did make the app a lot more useful :
This sounds like a great and rather useful app .
Exactly the sort of thing that the University should be encouraging , not just because it would help some alumni succeed , but also because UT students would likely find the app quite useful .
But , that 's not the way UT officials think , apparently : Lesson learned : do n't try to make life better for UT students without first paying the University .

According to an aide familiar with the proposal , the bill includes a mandate for federal agencies to prepare emergency response plans in the event of a massive , nationwide cyberattack .
The president would then have the ability to initiate those network contingency plans to ensure key federal or private services did not go offline during a cyberattack of unprecedented scope , the aide said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ultimately , the legislation is chiefly the brainchild of Sens . ( D - W.Va. ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee , respectively .
Both lawmakers have long clamored for a federal cybersecurity bill , charging that current measures — including the legislation passed by the House last year — are too piecemeal to protect the country 's Web infrastructure .
Their renewed focus arrives on the heels of two , high - profile cyberattacks last month : A strike on Google , believed to have originated in China , and a separate , more disjointed attack that affected thousands of businesses worldwide .
Rockefeller and Snowe 's forthcoming bill would establish a host of heretofore absent cybersecurity prevention and response measures , an aide close to the process said .
The bill will " significantly [ raise ] the profile of cybersecurity within the federal government , " while incentivizing private companies to do the same , according to the aide .
Additionally , it will " promote public awareness " of Internet security issues , while outlining key protections of Americans ' civil liberties on the Web , the aide continued .
Privacy groups are nonetheless likely to take some umbrage at Rockefeller and Snowe 's latest effort , an early draft of which leaked late last year .
When early reports predicted the cybersecurity measure would allow the president to " declare a cybersecurity emergency , " online privacy groups said they felt that would endow the White House with overly ambiguous and far - reaching powers to regulate the Internet .
The bill will still contain most of those powers , and a " vast majority " of its other components " remain unchanged , " an aide with knowledge of the legislation told The Hill .
But both the aide and a handful of tech insiders who support the bill have nonetheless tried to dampen skeptics ' concerns , reminding them the president already has vast — albeit lesser - known — powers to regulate the Internet during emergencies .
It is unclear when Rockefeller and Snowe will finish their legislation .
And the ongoing debate over healthcare reform , financial regulatory reform , jobs bills and education fixes could postpone action on the floor for many months .
Both lawmakers heavily emphasized the need for such a bill during a Senate Commerce Committee cybersecurity hearing on Wednesday .
" Too much is at stake for us to pretend that today ’s outdated cybersecurity policies are up to the task of protecting our nation and economic infrastructure , " Rockefeller said .
" We have to do better and that means it will take a level of coordination and sophistication to outmatch our adversaries and minimize this enormous threat . "
Claim : Video clip shows an elementary school stage production of Scarface .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , March 2010 ]
This is a kids school play with some very adult themes .
Is this for real ?
This is a kids school play with some very adult themes .
Is this for real ?
Origins :
This video clip purportedly showing school kids performing a stage version of Scarface , the 1983 Brian de Palma film starring Al Pacino as drug lord Tony Montana , raised hackles on the Internet in March 2010 among parents who were horrified that an elementary school would have children performing such inappropriate material full of adult themes , violence , and foul language ( even if those elements were somewhat muted in the version shown here ) .
However , according to various sources ( such as TMZ ) , this video did not originate as a taped record of an elementary school play ; the stage work was professionally produced and directed :
That hysterical ( or horrifying ) version of “ Scarface ” making the rounds with grade school kids playing all the parts and spewing the f-word … “ fudge ” — yeah , it ’s not an actual school play .
That hysterical ( or horrifying ) version of “ Scarface ” making the rounds with grade school kids playing all the parts and spewing the “ fudge ” it ’s not an actual school play .
Instead , it ’s the work of director Marc Klasfeld and Rockhard Films who did the videos for Lady Gaga ’s “ Pokerface ” and Adam Lambert ’s “ For Your Entertainment . ”
It was produced in L.A. within the last few weeks and the audience members were a mix of cast family members , colleagues and friends .
As for Lil ’ Tony and his co-stars , they were selected through a casting agent known for finding child actor look - alikes for adult stars .
And according to the Los Angeles Times :
The video was actually made [ in February 2010 ] with professional child actors in a rented theater in Koreatown and directed by Marc Klasfeld , a veteran music video director .
The video was actually made [ in February 2010 ] with professional child actors in a rented theater in Koreatown and directed by Marc Klasfeld , a veteran music video director .
With the quirky homage to “ Scarface , ” Klasfeld said “ we had a great cast , great kids and great parents … they enjoyed the process . ”
The director said it was amusing to watch the pockets of outrage as the purposely provocative video spread out across the Internet .
“ We definitely suspected that would happen , ” said Klasfeld , a father of two who says he wonders why the most vocal critics of the ironic video do n’t speak out more against the sexualization of young girls in American culture or the relentless violence on screens of all sorts .
“ Everyday when I wake up with my daughter and I turn on the television for her and we ’re constantly guarding her against all these unnecessary sexual [ messages ] bombarding her … so for us to see the reaction against this , well , that was a little shocking , ” Klasfeld said .
“ I found it all fascinating . ”

México arde por los cuatro costados .
El asesinato de una joven pareja estadounidense en Ciudad Juárez , ametrallada en presencia de su hija peque ña minutos después de entrar en territorio mexicano procedente de El Paso , se sumó a las decenas de muertes violentas registradas en todo el país , sobre todo en el Estado de Guerrero , donde la pugna de los carteles de la droga dejó sembrada de cadáveres la turística Acapulco .
El presidente Barack Obama , a través de un comunicado , expresó su indignación por los " brutales asesinatos " de la joven pareja y de un mexicano también vinculado al consulado de EE UU en Ciudad Juárez .
Obama ofreció su apoyo al presidente mexicano , Felipe Calderón , que hoy tiene previsto regresar a la ciudad fronteriza , donde miles de policías y soldados no logran frenar la matanza .
Obama condena los " brutales asesinatos " de dos estadounidenses
Los periódicos mexicanos no disponen de papel para contar tantas muertes .
Los del fin de semana tuvieron que recurrir a la fórmula más rápida para dar fe del horror que vivió , por ejemplo , el Estado de Guerrero y su ciudad más turística , Acapulco : " Madrugada del sábado .
A las 4.42 , a la altura del poblado de Tres Palos , se encuentran los cuerpos de cinco personas ejecutadas .
Dos de las víctimas están decapitadas .
A las 4.50 , a la altura del mirador de las Brisas del Marqués , en plena zona turística , son localizados dos cuerpos .
Estaban atados de manos , con huellas de tortura y habían sido decapitados .
A las 6.33 ... " .
Así hasta contabilizar 43 muertes en apenas dos días .
Pero , a las 14.30 de ese mismo sábado , la policía es avisada de que una camioneta blanca marca Toyota y con matrículas de Tejas acaba de ser ametrallada en Ciudad Juárez .
Sus dos ocupantes , una joven pareja estadounidense , han muerto en el acto .
En el asiento de atrás , una niña de siete meses llora .
Mientras una mujer policía acuna al bebé , sus compañeros identifican a las víctimas .
La mujer se llama Lesley Ann Enríquez Catton y es empleada del consulado de EE UU en Ciudad Juárez .
Su marido , Arthur H. Redelf , trabaja en la prisión de El Paso .
Unos minutos después , la policía recibe otro aviso .
Apenas a unas cuadras de allí , un hombre identificado como Jorge Alberto Salcido acaba de ser asesinado al volante de su vehículo .
Está casado con otra empleada de la Embajada .
Sus hijos , de cuatro y siete años , han resultado heridos en la emboscada .
Un portavoz de Obama no tarda en difundir un comunicado de condena .
La secretaria de Estado , Hillary Clinton , va más allá : " Haremos lo necesario para proteger a nuestra gente " .
El Departamento de Estado autoriza a los empleados de sus seis consulados del norte de México a que saquen a sus familias .
Hacía tiempo que el narcotráfico no se atrevía a atentar de forma tan directa contra sus vecinos del norte .
Hay que remontarse a 1985 , cuando un agente encubierto de la DEA llamado Enrique Camarena fue asesinado .
Pero la violencia desaforada ya no sólo es patrimonio de esa ciudad sin ley .
Los carteles se están disputando a tiro limpio Oaxaca , Veracruz , Tamaulipas y hasta en las calles del Distrito Federal están empezando a descubrirse cuerpos degollados .
La sensación de inseguridad se extiende y plazas que estaban en calma se han convertido estos días en escenario de una batalla campal entre el Ejército y los sicarios de los distintos carteles del narcotráfico que pelean entre sí .
Un ejemplo es Reynosa , la ciudad más poblada del norteño Estado de Tamaulipas .
Los muchachos tienen que acudir a la escuela escoltados por los militares y el secuestro de ocho periodistas ha provocado el enmudecimiento de toda la prensa local .
Los ciudadanos tienen que avisarse entre sí del lugar donde se están produciendo tiroteos y qué calle ha sido cortada por tal o cual banda de narcotraficantes .
Ante la falta de una explicación oficial , empiezan a aparecer informaciones periodísticas que hablan de una cacería generalizada contra sicarios del cartel de Los Zetas , auspiciada o al menos tolerada por las autoridades .
Por si fuera poco , la economía ha empezado a resentirse por el clima de inseguridad .
Las visitas de estadounidenses - en su mayoría empresarios - a México se han reducido ostensiblemente , en algunos casos hasta en un 60 % con relación al año anterior .
La explosión de violencia coincide además con la visita a Acapulco y a las playas del Caribe , principalmente , de los springbreakers , jóvenes norteamericanos que aprovechan su periodo vacacional para divertirse y tostarse al sol de México .
Ellos suponen en este momento el 70 % de la ocupación hotelera de Cancún , que empezaba a recuperarse del desastre provocado el año pasado por la epidemia de gripe .
Pero el Gobierno de Barack Obama acaba de emitir una nueva alerta en la que desaconseja a sus ciudadanos viajar a México .
El miedo a las balas del narco , temen los empresarios , puede resultar más devastador para el turismo que el miedo a la gripe .
UN body to look at meat and climate link
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News
Livestock 's Long Shadow calculated meat - related emissions from field to abattoir
UN specialists are to look again at the contribution of meat production to climate change , after claims that an earlier report exaggerated the link .
A 2006 report concluded meat production was responsible for 18 % of greenhouse gas emissions - more than transport .
The report has been cited by people campaigning for a more vegetable - based diet , including Sir Paul McCartney .
But a new analysis , presented at a major US science meeting , says the transport comparison was flawed .
Sir Paul was one of the figures launching a campaign late last year centred on the slogan " Less meat = less heat " .
I must say honestly that he has a point
Dr Pierre Gerber , FAO
The methane makers
But curbing meat production and consumption would be less beneficial for the climate than has been claimed , said Frank Mitloehner from the University of California at Davis ( UCD ) .
" Smarter animal farming , not less farming , will equal less heat , " he told delegates to the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) meeting in San Francisco .
" Producing less meat and milk will only mean more hunger in poor countries . "
Leading figures in the climate change establishment , such as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) chairman Rajendra Pachauri and Lord ( Nicholas ) Stern , have also quoted the 18 % figure as a reason why people should consider eating less meat .
Apples and pears
The 2006 report - Livestock 's Long Shadow , published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) - reached the figure by totting up all greenhouse - gas emissions associated with meat production from farm to table , including fertiliser production , land clearance , methane emissions from the animals ' digestion , and vehicle use on farms .
But Dr Mitloehner pointed out that the authors had not calculated transport emissions in the same way , instead just using the IPCC 's figure , which only included fossil fuel burning .
Land in the Amazon Basin is routinely cleared for cattle ranching " This lopsided ' analysis ' is a classical apples - and - oranges analogy that truly confused the issue , " he said .
One of the authors of Livestock 's Long Shadow , FAO livestock policy officer Pierre Gerber , told BBC News he accepted Dr Mitloehner 's criticism .
" I must say honestly that he has a point - we factored in everything for meat emissions , and we did n't do the same thing with transport , we just used the figure from the IPCC , " he said .
" But on the rest of the report , I do n't think it was really challenged . "
FAO is now working on a much more comprehensive analysis of emissions from food production , he said .
It should be complete by the end of the year , and should allow comparisons between diets , including meat and those that are exclusively vegetarian .
Different pies Organisations use different methods for apportioning emissions between sectors of the economy .
In an attempt to capture everything associated with meat production , the FAO team included contributions , for example , from transport and deforestation .
By comparison , the IPCC 's methodology collects all emissions from deforestation into a separate pool , whether the trees are removed for farming or for some other reason ; and does the same thing for transport .
This is one of the reasons why the 18 % figure appears remarkably high to some observers .
The majority of the meat - related emissions come from land clearance and from methane emissions associated with the animals ' digestion .
Other academics have also argued that meat is a necessary source of protein in some societies with small food resources , and that in the drylands of East Africa or around the Arctic where crop plants cannot survive , a meat - based diet is the only option .
Dr Mitloehner contends that in developed societies such as the US - where transport emissions account for about 26 % of the national total , compared with 3 % for pig - and cattle - rearing - meat is the wrong target in efforts to reduce carbon emissions .

Iraqis were furious when charges against the guards were thrown out Iraq has ordered 250 former and current staff of US security firm Blackwater to leave within a week , a minister says .
Interior Minister Jawad al - Bolani told the Associated Press news agency that all " concerned parties " were notified of the order three days ago .
It comes after a US judge last December threw out manslaughter charges against five Blackwater guards over the 2007 killing of 17 Iraqis in Baghdad .
The incident stoked anti-American sentiment in Iraq .
The activities of foreign security firms in Iraq have been curbed since then .
US Vice - President Joe Biden has said the US government will appeal against the court ruling .
Mishandled evidence " We want to turn the page .
It was a painful experience , and we would like to go forward , " Mr Bolani said .
Seventeen Iraqis were killed in the shooting in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square in September 2007 .
Iraq maintains the Blackwater guards fired without provocation .
Blackwater said the firing followed an ambush on one of its convoys .
The US had rejected attempts for a trial in Iraq but charges in the US were thrown out when a judge ruled in December that the guards ' constitutional rights had been violated and that the justice department had mishandled evidence .
Last month , Mr Biden said during a visit to Iraq that the dismissal of the Blackwater charges was just that and " not an acquittal " .
Expressing " personal regret " over the incident , he said the US justice department would file its appeal against the court 's decision next week .
In 2007 , Blackwater - now known as Xe Services - was the largest of the US State Department 's private security contractors working in Iraq .

“ We ’ve got to look at the risk of a more populist American public and the U.S. Congress deciding that China is the reason our economy is n’t growing enough , ” the American official said .
Image The Dalai Lama 's visit to the White House on Thursday angered China on a territorial issue that it considers sacrosanct .

Economists say the renminbi is undervalued by 25 to 40 percent , a wider gap than at any other time since 2005 , when , under pressure from the Bush administration , China decided to allow the renminbi to float in a narrow band against the dollar and other currencies .
The renminbi appreciated 21 percent , but has not moved at all since July 2008 .
This month , Ma Zhaoxu , a Foreign Ministry spokesman , rejected an unusually public call by Mr. Obama for China to revalue its currency , saying that “ the value of the renminbi is getting to a reasonable and balanced level . ”
The problem for the Americans is that job creation is also a priority for the Chinese government , because the legitimacy of the Communist Party is based largely on economic growth .
A year ago , when the global recession resulted in a severe slump in exports , Chinese officials said 20 million migrant workers lost their jobs .
The export industry in China is only now starting to recover , and the low value of the renminbi is crucial for Chinese companies selling goods abroad .
“ With economic and trade issues , we ’re in for a very difficult year , ” said Kenneth G. Lieberthal , a scholar at the Brookings Institution who worked on China policy in the Clinton administration .
“ I see Chinese protectionism growing on the ground as well as on the U.S. side , with midterm elections coming up . ”
But some economists say China is likely to let the renminbi rise by about 5 percent to help stave off inflation , a growing concern among Chinese policy makers .
Historically , high inflation has stirred unrest in China .
Economists say the Obama administration and European allies can press China to revalue the renminbi by threatening to impose more tariffs on manufactured goods .
Last fall , the American government imposed tariffs on Chinese tires and steel pipes .
European officials have privately said that China ’s increasingly unyielding stance on issues like human rights has made it politically easy for European governments to toughen up on tariffs .

BRATISLAVA , SLOVAKIA —
If nationalists in Slovakia have their way , schoolchildren will soon be forced , each Monday at 8 a.m. , to listen to the national anthem blaring out from loudspeakers across this small Central European nation .
As part of a patriotism bill that some school principals have derided as Pyongyang - on - the - Danube , state schools will also be required to hang the Slovak flag in every classroom , along with the text of that national anthem and the national symbols — three hills and a double cross signifying the Christian heritage .
The preamble to the Slovak Constitution , “ We the Slovak nation , ” is to be prominently displayed in public institutions — another assertion of Slovak primacy that ethnic minorities complain is directed at excluding them .
School officials who disobey would risk being dismissed .
“ During Communist times , we would use the public address system to announce Lenin ’s birthday , and this type of politics and ideological propaganda have no place in the classroom , ” said Norbert Kyndl , director of a large state school in Bratislava , who said that he would have to crank up a vintage public address system and spend € 1,500 , or $ 2,000 , on flags and a coat of arms .
“ This is Slovakia — not North Korea . ”
WASHINGTON — Shots of the Indianapolis skyline scheduled to air during the 2010 Final Four will be extremely depressing and will momentarily infuse viewers with a sense of overwhelming bleakness , the U.S. populace reported this week .
" When they come back from commercials I 'll have to look at these uninspired , cold - looking buildings .
There are those two really tall ones that kind of look dead , like nothing 's really going on inside of them , " said Andover , MD resident Nathan Kowalski , adding that during the Colts ' 2009 Super Bowl run , aerial shots of the metropolis put him in such a deep malaise that he had to stop watching the NFL playoffs .
" I bet they 'll show night shots of the skyline , too .
Which will look just as dead , because who wants to be caught in Indianapolis at night when everything is closed and there 's nothing to do ?
I hope they just show the New York City skyline and cut to the game . "
At a press conference Thursday , Indianapolis mayor Greg Ballard seemed to be on the verge of defending his city , but ultimately sighed and agreed with the rest of the country .

Guide to Python introspection
How to spy on your Python objects
What is introspection ?
In everyday life , introspection is the act of self - examination .
Introspection refers to the examination of one 's own thoughts , feelings , motivations , and actions .
The great philosopher Socrates spent much of his life in self - examination , encouraging his fellow Athenians to do the same .
He even claimed that , for him , " the unexamined life is not worth living . "
( See Related topics for links to more about Socrates . )
In computer programming , introspection refers to the ability to examine something to determine what it is , what it knows , and what it is capable of doing .
Introspection gives programmers a great deal of flexibility and control .
Once you 've worked with a programming language that supports introspection , you may similarly feel that " the unexamined object is not worth instantiating . "
This article introduces the introspection capabilities of the Python programming language .
Python 's support for introspection runs deep and wide throughout the language .
In fact , it would be hard to imagine Python without its introspection features .
By the end of this article you should be very comfortable poking inside the hearts and souls of your own Python objects .
We 'll begin our exploration of Python introspection in the most general way possible , before diving into more advanced techniques .
Some might even argue that the features we begin with do n't deserve to be called " introspective . "
We 'll have to agree that whether they fall under the umbrella of introspection or not is open to debate .
For the purposes of this article , our only concern is finding the answers to interesting questions .
So let 's begin our inquiry , using Python interactively .
When we start Python from the command line , we enter the Python shell , where we can enter Python code and get an immediate response from the Python interpreter .
( The commands listed in this article will execute properly using Python 2.2.2 .
You may get different results or errors if using an earlier version .
You can download the latest version from the Python Web site [ see Related topics ] . )
Listing 1 . Starting the Python interpreter in interactive mode
$ python Python 2.2.2 ( #1 , Oct 28 2002 , 17:22:19 ) [ GCC 3.2 ( Mandrake Linux 9.0 3.2 - 1mdk ) ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>>
Once you have Python running and are looking at the Python prompt ( >>> ) , you may be wondering what words will be recognized by Python .
Most programming languages have reserved words , or keywords , that have special meaning in that language , and Python is no exception .
You may also have noticed that Python suggested we type help to get more information .
Perhaps we can ask Python for some help about keywords .
Python 's online help utility
Let 's start by typing help , as suggested , and see if it gives us any clues about keywords :
Listing 2 . Asking Python for help
>>> help Type help ( ) for interactive help , or help ( object ) for help about object .
Since we do n't know what object might contain keywords , let 's try help ( ) without specifying any particular object :
Listing 3 . Starting the help utility
>>> help () Welcome to Python 2.2 !
This is the online help utility .
If this is your first time using Python , you should definitely check out the tutorial on the Internet at http://www.python.org/doc/tut/.
Enter the name of any module , keyword , or topic to get help on writing Python programs and using Python modules .
To quit this help utility and return to the interpreter , just type " quit " .
To get a list of available modules , keywords , or topics , type " modules " , " keywords " , or " topics " .
Each module also comes with a one - line summary of what it does ; to list the modules whose summaries contain a given word such as " spam " , type " modules spam " .
help >
We seem to be getting closer , now .
Let 's enter keywords at the help prompt :
Listing 4 .
Asking for help with keywords
help > keywords
Here is a list of the Python keywords .
Enter any keyword to get more help .
and elif global or assert else if pass break except import print class exec in raise continue finally is return def for lambda try del from not while help > quit
You are now leaving help and returning to the Python interpreter .
If you want to ask for help on a particular object directly from the interpreter , you can type " help ( object ) " .
Executing " help ( ' string ' ) " has the same effect as typing a particular string at the help > prompt . >>>
When we typed help ( ) , we were greeted with a message and some instructions , followed by the help prompt .
At the prompt , we entered keywords and were shown a list of Python keywords .
Having gotten the answer to our question , we then quit the help utility , saw a brief farewell message , and were returned to the Python prompt .
As you can see from this example , Python 's online help utility displays information on a variety of topics , or for a particular object .
The help utility is quite useful , and does make use of Python 's introspection capabilities .
But simply using help does n't reveal how help gets its information .
And since the purpose of this article is to reveal all of Python 's introspection secrets , we need to quickly go beyond the help utility .
Before we leave help , let 's use it to get a list of available modules .
Modules are simply text files containing Python code whose names end in .py .
If we type help ( ' modules ' ) at the Python prompt , or enter modules at the help prompt , we 'll see a long list of available modules , similar to the partial list shown below .
Try it yourself to see what modules are available on your system , and to see why Python is considered to come with " batteries included . "
Listing 5 . Partial listing of available modules
>>> help ( ' modules ' )
Please wait a moment while I gather a list of all available modules ...
BaseHTTPServer cgitb marshal sndhdr Bastion chunk math socket CDROM cmath md5 sre CGIHTTPServer cmd mhlib sre_compile Canvas code mimetools sre_constants <...> bisect macpath signal xreadlines cPickle macurl2 path site xxsubtype cStringIO mailbox slgc ( package ) zipfile calendar mailcap smtpd cgi markupbase smtplib Enter any module name to get more help .
Or , type " modules spam " to search for modules whose descriptions contain the word " spam " . >>>
The sys module
One module that provides insightful information about Python itself is the sys module .
You make use of a module by importing the module and referencing its contents ( such as variables , functions , and classes ) using dot (. ) notation .
The sys module contains a variety of variables and functions that reveal interesting details about the current Python interpreter .
Let 's take a look at some of them .
Again , we 're going to run Python interactively and enter commands at the Python command prompt .
The first thing we 'll do is import the sys module .
Then we 'll enter the sys.
executable variable , which contains the path to the Python interpreter :
Listing 6 . Importing the sys module
$ python Python 2.2.2 ( #1 , Oct 28 2002 , 17:22:19 ) [ GCC 3.2 ( Mandrake Linux 9.0 3.2 - 1mdk ) ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>> import sys >>> sys.executable '/usr/local/bin/python '
When we enter a line of code that consists of nothing more than the name of an object , Python responds by displaying a representation of the object , which , for simple objects , tends to be the value of the object .
In this case , since the displayed value is enclosed in quotes , we get a clue that sys.
executable is probably a string object .
We 'll look at other , more precise , ways to determine an object 's type later , but simply typing the name of an object at the Python prompt is a quick and easy form of introspection .
Let 's look at some other useful attributes of the sys module .
The platform variable tells us which operating system we are on :
The sys.platform attribute
>>> sys.platform ' linux2 '
The current Python version is available as a string , and as a tuple ( a tuple contains a sequence of objects ) :
Listing 8 . The sys.version and sys.version_info attributes
>>> sys.version ' 2.2.2 ( #1 , Oct 28 2002 , 17:22:19 )
[ GCC 3.2 ( Mandrake Linux 9.0 3.2 - 1mdk ) ] ' >>> sys.version_info ( 2 , 2 , 2 , ' final ' , 0 )
The maxint variable reflects the highest available integer value :
The sys. maxint attribute
>>> sys.maxint 2147483647
The argv variable is a list containing command line arguments , if any were specified .
The first item , argv[ 0 ] , is the path of the script that was run .
When we run Python interactively this value is an empty string :
Listing 10 .
The sys.argv attribute
>>> sys.argv [ ' ' ]
When we run another Python shell , such as PyCrust ( see Related topics for a link to more information on PyCrust ) , we see something like this :
Listing 11 .
The sys.argv attribute using PyCrust
>>> sys.argv[ 0 ] '/home/pobrien /Code/PyCrust/PyCrustApp.py'
The path variable is the module search path , the list of directories in which Python will look for modules during imports .
The empty string , '' , in the first position refers to the current directory :
Listing 12 .
The sys.path attribute
>>> sys.path ['' , '/home/pobrien / Code ' , '/usr/local/lib/python2.2 ' , '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/plat-linux2 ' , '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/lib-tk ' , '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/lib-dynload ' , '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages ']
The modules variable is a dictionary that maps module names to module objects for all the currently loaded modules .
As you can see , Python loads certain modules by default :
Listing 13 .
The sys.modules attribute
>>> sys.modules {' stat ' : < module ' stat ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/stat.pyc' > , ' __future__ ' : < module ' __future__ ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/__future__.pyc ' > , ' copy_reg ' : < module ' copy_reg ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/copy_reg.pyc' > , ' posixpath ' : < module ' posixpath ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/posixpath.pyc ' > , ' UserDict ' : < module ' UserDict ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/UserDict.pyc' > , ' signal ' : < module ' signal ' ( built - in ) > , ' site ' : < module ' site ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/site.pyc ' > , ' __builtin__ ' : < module ' __builtin__ ' ( built - in ) > , ' sys ' : < module ' sys ' ( built - in ) > , ' posix ' : < module ' posix ' ( built - in ) > , ' types ' : < module ' types ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/types.pyc' > , ' __main__ ' : < module ' __main__ ' ( built - in ) > , ' exceptions ' : < module ' exceptions ' ( built - in ) > , ' os ' : < module ' os ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/os.pyc' > , ' os.path ' : < module ' posixpath ' from ' /usr/local/lib/python2.2/posixpath.pyc'>}
The keyword module
Let 's return to our question about Python keywords .
Even though help showed us a list of keywords , it turns out that some of help 's information is hardcoded .
The list of keywords happens to be hardcoded , which is n't very introspective after all .
Let 's see if we can get this information directly from one of the modules in Python 's standard library .
If we type help ( ' modules keywords ' ) at the Python prompt we see the following :
Listing 14 .
Asking for help on modules with keywords
>>> help ( ' modules keywords ' )
Here is a list of matching modules .
Enter any module name to get more help .
keyword - Keywords ( from " graminit.c " )
So it appears as though the keyword module might contain keywords .
By opening the keyword .py file in a text editor we can see that Python does make its list of keywords explicitly available as the kwlist attribute of the keyword module .
We also see in the keyword module comments that this module is automatically generated based on the source code of Python itself , guaranteeing that its list of keywords is accurate and complete :
Listing 15 .
The keyword module 's keyword list
>>> import keyword >>> keyword.kwlist [ ' and ' , ' assert ' , ' break ' , ' class ' , ' continue ' , ' def ' , ' del ' , ' elif ' , ' else ' , ' except ' , ' exec ' , ' finally ' , ' for ' , ' from ' , ' global ' , ' if ' , ' import ' , ' in ' , ' is ' , ' lambda ' , ' not ' , ' or ' , ' pass ' , ' print ' , ' raise ' , ' return ' , ' try ' , ' while ' , ' yield ' ]
The dir ( ) function
While it 's relatively easy to find and import a module , it is n't as easy to remember what each module contains .
And you do n't always want to have to look at the source code to find out .
Fortunately , Python provides a way to examine the contents of modules ( and other objects ) using the built - in dir ( ) function .
The dir ( ) function is probably the most well - known of all of Python 's introspection mechanisms .
It returns a sorted list of attribute names for any object passed to it .
If no object is specified , dir ( ) returns the names in the current scope .
Let 's apply dir ( ) to our keyword module and see what it reveals :
Listing 16 .
The keyword module 's attributes
>>> dir( keyword ) [ ' __all__ ' , ' __builtins__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __file__ ' , ' __name__ ' , ' iskeyword ' , ' keyword ' , ' kwdict ' , ' kwlist ' , ' main ' ]
And how about the sys module we looked at earlier ?
Listing 17 .
The sys module 's attributes
>>> dir(sys ) [ ' __displayhook__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __excepthook__ ' , ' __name__ ' , ' __stderr__ ' , ' __stdin__ ' , ' __stdout__ ' , ' _getframe ' , ' argv' , ' builtin_module_names ' , ' byteorder ' , ' copyright ' , ' displayhook ' , ' exc_info ' , ' exc_type ' , ' excepthook ' , ' exec_prefix ' , ' executable ' , ' exit ' , ' getdefaultencoding ' , ' getdlopenflags ' , ' getrecursionlimit ' , ' getrefcount ' , ' hexversion ' , ' last_traceback ' , ' last_type ' , ' last_value ' , ' maxint ' , ' maxunicode ' , ' modules ' , ' path ' , ' platform ' , ' prefix ' , ' ps1 ' , ' ps2 ' , ' setcheckinterval ' , ' setdlopenflags ' , ' setprofile ' , ' setrecursionlimit ' , ' settrace ' , ' stderr ' , ' stdin ' , ' stdout ' , ' version ' , ' version_info ' , ' warnoptions ' ]
Without any argument , dir ( ) returns names in the current scope .
Notice how keyword and sys appear in the list , since we imported them earlier .
Importing a module adds the module 's name to the current scope :
Listing 18 .
Names in the current scope
>>> dir ( ) [ ' __builtins__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __name__ ' , ' keyword ' , 'sys ' ]
We mentioned that the dir ( ) function was a built - in function , which means that we do n't have to import a module in order to use the function .
Python recognizes built - in functions without our having to do anything .
And now we see this name , __builtins__ , returned by a call to dir ( ) .
Perhaps there is a connection here .
Let 's enter the name __builtins__ at the Python prompt and see if Python tells us anything interesting about it :
Listing 19 .
What is __builtins__ ?
>>> __builtins__ < module ' __builtin__ ' ( built - in ) >
So __builtins__ appears to be a name in the current scope that 's bound to the module object named __builtin__ .
( Since modules are not simple objects with single values , Python displays information about the module inside angle brackets instead . )
Note that if you look for a __builtin__.py file on disk you 'll come up empty - handed .
This particular module object is created out of thin air by the Python interpreter , because it contains items that are always available to the interpreter .
And while there is no physical file to look at , we can still apply our dir ( ) function to this object to see all the built - in functions , error objects , and a few miscellaneous attributes that it contains :
Listing 20 .
The __builtins__ module 's attributes
>>> dir( __builtins__ ) [ ' ArithmeticError ' , ' AssertionError ' , ' AttributeError ' , ' DeprecationWarning ' , ' EOFError ' , ' Ellipsis ' , ' EnvironmentError ' , ' Exception ' , ' False ' , ' FloatingPointError ' , ' IOError ' , ' ImportError ' , ' IndentationError ' , ' IndexError ' , ' KeyError ' , ' KeyboardInterrupt ' , ' LookupError ' , ' MemoryError ' , ' NameError ' , ' None ' , ' NotImplemented ' , ' NotImplementedError ' , ' OSError ' , ' OverflowError ' , ' OverflowWarning ' , ' ReferenceError ' , ' RuntimeError ' , ' RuntimeWarning ' , ' StandardError ' , ' StopIteration ' , ' SyntaxError ' , ' SyntaxWarning ' , ' SystemError ' , ' SystemExit ' , ' TabError ' , ' True ' , ' TypeError ' , ' UnboundLocalError ' , ' UnicodeError ' , ' UserWarning ' , ' ValueError ' , ' Warning ' , ' ZeroDivisionError ' , '_' , ' __debug__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __import__ ' , ' __name__ ' , ' abs ' , ' apply ' , ' bool ' , ' buffer ' , ' callable ' , ' chr ' , ' classmethod ' , ' cmp ' , ' coerce ' , ' compile ' , ' complex ' , ' copyright ' , ' credits ' , ' delattr ' , ' dict ' , ' dir ' , ' divmod ' , ' eval ' , ' execfile ' , ' exit ' , ' file ' , ' filter ' , ' float ' , ' getattr ' , ' globals ' , ' hasattr ' , ' hash ' , ' help ' , ' hex ' , ' id ' , ' input ' , ' int ' , ' intern ' , ' isinstance ' , ' issubclass ' , ' iter ' , ' len ' , ' license ' , ' list ' , ' locals ' , ' long ' , ' map ' , ' max ' , ' min ' , ' object ' , ' oct ' , ' open ' , ' ord ' , ' pow ' , ' property ' , ' quit ' , ' range ' , ' raw_input ' , ' reduce ' , ' reload ' , ' repr ' , ' round ' , ' setattr ' , ' slice ' , ' staticmethod ' , ' str ' , ' super ' , ' tuple ' , ' type ' , ' unichr ' , ' unicode ' , ' vars ' , ' xrange ' , ' zip ' ]
The dir ( ) function works on all object types , including strings , integers , lists , tuples , dictionaries , functions , custom classes , class instances , and class methods .
Let 's apply dir ( ) to a string object and see what Python returns .
As you can see , even a simple Python string has a number of attributes :
Listing 21 .
String attributes
>>> dir ( ' this is a string ' ) [ ' __add__ ' , ' __class__ ' , ' __contains__ ' , ' __delattr__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __eq__ ' , ' __ge__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __getitem__ ' , ' __getslice__ ' , ' __gt__ ' , ' __hash__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __le__ ' , ' __len__ ' , ' __lt__ ' , ' __mul__ ' , ' __ne__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __rmul__ ' , ' __setattr__ ' , ' __str__ ' , ' capitalize ' , ' center ' , ' count ' , ' decode ' , ' encode ' , ' endswith ' , ' expandtabs ' , ' find ' , ' index ' , ' isalnum ' , ' isalpha ' , ' isdigit ' , ' islower ' , ' isspace ' , ' istitle ' , ' isupper ' , ' join ' , ' ljust ' , ' lower ' , ' lstrip ' , ' replace ' , ' rfind ' , ' rindex ' , ' rjust ' , ' rstrip ' , ' split ' , ' splitlines ' , ' startswith ' , ' strip ' , ' swapcase ' , ' title ' , ' translate ' , ' upper ' , ' zfill ' ]
Try the following examples yourself to see what they return .
Note that the # character marks the start of a comment .
Everything from the start of the comment to the end of the line is ignored by Python :
Listing 22 . Using dir( ) on other objects
dir ( 42 ) # Integer ( and the meaning of life ) dir ( [ ] ) #
List ( an empty list , actually ) dir ( ( ) ) # Tuple ( also empty ) dir ( {} ) # Dictionary ( ditto ) dir ( dir ) # Function ( functions are also objects )
To illustrate the dynamic nature of Python 's introspection capabilities , let 's look at some examples using dir ( ) on a custom class and some class instances .
We 're going to define our own class interactively , create some instances of the class , add a unique attribute to only one of the instances , and see if Python can keep all of this straight .
Here are the results :
Listing 23 . Using dir ( ) on custom classes , class instances , and attributes
>>> class Person ( object ) : ... " " " Person class . " " " ... def __init__ ( self , name , age ) : ... self .name = name ... self.age = age ... def intro( self ) : ... " " " Return an introduction . " " " ... return " Hello , my name is %s and I'm % s. " % ( self.name , self.age ) ... >>> bob = Person ( " Robert " , 35 ) # Create a Person instance >>> joe = Person ( " Joseph " , 17 ) # Create another >>> joe.sport = " football " # Assign a new attribute to one instance >>> dir( Person ) # Attributes of the Person class [ ' __class__ ' , ' __delattr__ ' , ' __dict__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __hash__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __module__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __setattr__ ' , ' __str__ ' , ' __weakref__ ' , ' intro ' ] >>> dir ( bob ) # Attributes of bob [ ' __class__ ' , ' __delattr__ ' , ' __dict__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __hash__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __module__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __setattr__ ' , ' __str__ ' , ' __weakref__ ' , ' age ' , ' intro ' , ' name ' ] >>> dir( joe ) #
Note that joe has an additional attribute [ ' __class__ ' , ' __delattr__ ' , ' __dict__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __hash__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __module__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __setattr__ ' , ' __str__ ' , ' __weakref__ ' , ' age ' , ' intro ' , ' name ' , ' sport ' ] >>> bob.intro( ) # Calling bob 's intro method " Hello , my name is Robert and I 'm 35 . " >>> dir( bob.intro ) # Attributes of the intro method [ ' __call__ ' , ' __class__ ' , ' __cmp__ ' , ' __delattr__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __get__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __hash__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __setattr__ ' , ' __str__ ' , ' im_class ' , ' im_func ' , ' im_self ' ]
Documentation strings
One attribute you may have noticed in a lot of our dir ( ) examples is the __doc__ attribute .
This attribute is a string containing the comments that describe an object .
Python calls this a documentation string , or docstring , and here is how it works .
If the first statement of a module , class , method , or function definition is a string , then that string gets associated with the object as its __doc__ attribute .
For example , take a look at the docstring for the __builtins__ object .
We 'll use Python 's print statement to make the output easier to read , since docstrings often contain embedded newlines (
) :
Listing 24 .
Module docstring
>>> print __builtins__.__doc__
# Module docstring Built - in functions , exceptions , and other objects .
Noteworthy : None is the `nil ' object ; Ellipsis represents `...' in slices .
Once again , Python even maintains docstrings on classes and methods that are defined interactively in the Python shell .
Let 's look at the docstrings for our Person class and its intro method :
Listing 25 .
Class and method docstrings
>>> Person.__doc__ # Class docstring ' Person class . ' >>>
Person.intro.__doc__
# Class method docstring ' Return an introduction . '
Because docstrings provide such valuable information , many Python development environments have ways of automatically displaying the docstrings for objects .
Let 's look at one more docstring , for the dir ( ) function :
Listing 26 .
Function docstring
>>> print dir .__doc__ # Function docstring dir ( [ object ] ) -> list of strings
Return an alphabetized list of names comprising ( some of ) the attributes of the given object , and of attributes reachable from it :
No argument : the names in the current scope .
Module object : the module attributes .
Type or class object : its attributes , and recursively the attributes of its bases .
Otherwise : its attributes , its class 's attributes , and recursively the attributes of its class 's base classes .
Interrogating Python objects
We 've mentioned the word " object " several times , but have n't really defined it .
An object in a programming environment is much like an object in the real world .
A real object has a certain shape , size , weight , and other characteristics .
And a real object is able to respond to its environment , interact with other objects , or perform a task .
Computer objects attempt to model the objects that surround us in the real world , including abstract objects like documents and schedules and business processes .
Like real - world objects , several computer objects may share common characteristics while maintaining their own minor variations .
Think of the books you see in a bookstore .
Each physical copy of a book might have a smudge , or a few torn pages , or a unique identification number .
And while each book is a unique object , every book with the same title is merely an instance of an original template , and retains most of the characteristics of the original .
The same is true about object - oriented classes and class instances .
For example , every Python string is endowed with the attributes we saw revealed by the dir ( ) function .
And in a previous example , we defined our own Person class , which acted as a template for creating individual Person instances , each having its own name and age values , while sharing the ability to introduce itself .
That 's object - orientation .
In computer terms , then , objects are things that have an identity and a value , are of a certain type , possess certain characteristics , and behave in a certain way .
And objects inherit many of their attributes from one or more parent classes .
Other than keywords and special symbols ( like operators , such as + , - , * , ** , / , % , < , > , etc. ) everything in Python is an object .
And Python comes with a rich set of object types : strings , integers , floats , lists , tuples , dictionaries , functions , classes , class instances , modules , files , etc .
When you have an arbitrary object , perhaps one that was passed as an argument to a function , you may want to know a few things about that object .
In this section we 're going to show you how to get Python objects to answer questions such as :
What is your name ?
What kind of object are you ?
What do you know ?
What can you do ?
Who are your parents ?
Name
Not all objects have names , but for those that do , the name is stored in their __name__ attribute .
Note that the name is derived from the object , not the variable that references the object .
The following example highlights that distinction :
Listing 27 .
What 's in a name ?
$ python Python 2.2.2 ( #1 , Oct 28 2002 , 17:22:19 ) [ GCC 3.2 ( Mandrake Linux 9.0 3.2 - 1mdk ) ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>> dir () #
The dir ( ) function [ ' __builtins__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __name__ ' ] >>> directory = dir # Create a new variable >>> directory ( ) #
Works just like the original object [ ' __builtins__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __name__ ' , ' directory ' ] >>> dir.__name__ #
What 's your name ?
' dir ' >>> directory.__name__ #
My name is the same ' dir ' >>>
__name__ #
And now for something completely different ' __main__ '
Modules have names , and the Python interpreter itself is considered the top - level , or main , module .
When you run Python interactively the local __name__ variable is assigned a value of ' __main__ ' .
Likewise , when you execute a Python module from the command line , rather than importing it into another module , its __name__ attribute is assigned a value of ' __main__ ' , rather than the actual name of the module .
In this way , modules can look at their own __name__ value to determine for themselves how they are being used , whether as support for another program or as the main application executed from the command line .
Thus , the following idiom is quite common in Python modules :
Listing 28 .
Testing for execution or import
if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : #
Do something appropriate here , like calling a # main ( ) function defined elsewhere in this module .
main ( ) else : # Do nothing .
This module has been imported by another # module that wants to make use of the functions , # classes and other useful bits it has defined .
Type
The type ( ) function helps us determine whether an object is a string or an integer or some other kind of object .
It does this by returning a type object , which can be compared to the types defined in the types module :
Listing 29 .
Am I your type ?
>>> import types >>> print types.__doc__
Define names for all type symbols known in the standard interpreter .
Types that are part of optional modules ( e.g. array ) are not listed .
>>> dir( types ) [ ' BufferType ' , ' BuiltinFunctionType ' , ' BuiltinMethodType ' , ' ClassType ' , ' CodeType ' , ' ComplexType ' , ' DictProxyType ' , ' DictType ' , ' DictionaryType ' , ' EllipsisType ' , ' FileType ' , ' FloatType ' , ' FrameType ' , ' FunctionType ' , ' GeneratorType ' , ' InstanceType ' , ' IntType ' , ' LambdaType ' , ' ListType ' , ' LongType ' , ' MethodType ' , ' ModuleType ' , ' NoneType ' , ' ObjectType ' , ' SliceType ' , ' StringType ' , ' StringTypes ' , ' TracebackType ' , ' TupleType ' , ' TypeType ' , ' UnboundMethodType ' , ' UnicodeType ' , ' XRangeType ' , ' __builtins__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __file__ ' , ' __name__ ' ] >>> s = ' a sample string ' >>> type(s ) < type ' str ' > >>> if type(s ) is types .
StringType : print " s is a string " ... s is a string >>> type ( 42 ) < type ' int '> >>> type ( [ ] ) < type ' list ' > >>> type ( {} ) < type ' dict ' > >>> type(dir ) < type ' builtin_function_or_method '>
Identity
We said earlier that every object has an identity , a type , and a value .
What 's important to note is that more than one variable may refer to the exact same object , and , likewise , variables may refer to objects that look alike ( having the same type and value ) , but have separate and distinct identities .
This notion of object identity is particularly important when making changes to objects , such as appending an item to a list , as in the example below where the blist and clist variables both reference the same list object .
As you can see in the example , the id ( ) function returns the unique identifier for any given object :
Listing 30 .
The Bourne ...
>>> print id.__doc__ id ( object ) -> integer Return the identity of an object .
This is guaranteed to be unique among simultaneously existing objects .
( Hint : it 's the object 's memory address . ) >>> alist = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> blist = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> clist = blist >>> clist [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> blist [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> alist [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> id( alist ) 145381412 >>> id ( blist ) 140406428 >>> id( clist ) 140406428 >>> alist is blist # Returns 1 if True , 0 if False 0 >>> blist is clist # Ditto 1 >>> clist.append(4 ) #
Add an item to the end of the list >>> clist [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] >>> blist #
Same , because they both point to the same object [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] >>> alist #
This one only looked the same initially [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
Attributes
We 've seen that objects have attributes , and that the dir ( ) function will return a list of these attributes .
Sometimes , however , we simply want to test for the existence of one or more attributes .
And if an object has the attribute in question , we often want to retrieve that attribute .
These tasks are handled by the hasattr ( ) and getattr ( ) functions , as illustrated in this example :
Listing 31 .
Have an attribute ; get an attribute
>>> print hasattr.__doc__
hasattr ( object , name ) ->
Boolean Return whether the object has an attribute with the given name .
( This is done by calling getattr ( object , name ) and catching exceptions . ) >>> print getattr.__doc__ getattr ( object , name [ , default ] ) -> value
Get a named attribute from an object ; getattr( x , 'y ' ) is equivalent to x.y .
When a default argument is given , it is returned when the attribute does n't exist ; without it , an exception is raised in that case .
>>> hasattr( id , ' __doc__ ' ) 1 >>> print getattr ( id , ' __doc__ ' ) id ( object ) -> integer Return the identity of an object .
This is guaranteed to be unique among simultaneously existing objects .
( Hint : it 's the object 's memory address . )
Callables
Objects that represent potential behavior ( functions and methods ) can be invoked , or called .
We can test an object 's callability with the callable ( ) function :
Listing 32 .
Can you do something for me ?
>>> print callable.__doc__ callable ( object ) ->
Boolean Return whether the object is callable ( i.e. , some kind of function ) .
Note that classes are callable , as are instances with a __call__ ( ) method . >>> callable ( 'a string ') 0 >>> callable ( dir ) 1
Instances
While the type ( ) function gave us the type of an object , we can also test an object to determine if it is an instance of a particular type , or custom class , using the isinstance ( ) function :
Listing 33 .
Are you one of those ?
>>> print isinstance .__doc__ isinstance ( object , class - or - type - or - tuple ) ->
Boolean Return whether an object is an instance of a class or of a subclass thereof .
With a type as second argument , return whether that is the object 's type .
The form using a tuple , isinstance( x , ( A , B , ... ) ) , is a shortcut for isinstance ( x , A ) or isinstance ( x , B ) or ... ( etc. ) . >>> isinstance ( 42 , str) 0 >>> isinstance ( 'a string ' , int ) 0 >>> isinstance ( 42 , int ) 1 >>> isinstance ( 'a string ' , str ) 1
Subclasses
We mentioned earlier that instances of a custom class inherit their attributes from the class .
At the class level , a class may be defined in terms of another class , and will likewise inherit attributes in a hierarchical fashion .
Python even supports multiple inheritance , meaning an individual class can be defined in terms of , and inherit from , more than one parent class .
The issubclass ( ) function allows us to find out if one class inherits from another :
Listing 34 .
Are you my mother ?
>>> print issubclass.__doc__ issubclass(C , B ) ->
Boolean Return whether class C is a subclass ( i.e. , a derived class ) of class B. >>> class SuperHero( Person ) : # SuperHero inherits from Person ... ... def intro( self ) : # but with a new SuperHero intro ... " " " Return an introduction . " " " ... return " Hello , I'm SuperHero %s and I'm % s. " % ( self.name , self.age ) ... >>> issubclass ( SuperHero , Person ) 1 >>> issubclass ( Person , SuperHero ) 0 >>>
Interrogation time
Let 's wrap things up by putting together several of the introspection techniques we 've covered in the last section .
To do so , we 're going to define our own function , interrogate ( ) , which prints a variety of information about any object passed to it .
Here is the code , followed by several examples of its use :
Listing 35 .
Nobody expects it
>>> def interrogate ( item ) : ... " " " Print useful information about item . " " " ... if hasattr ( item , ' __name__ ' ) : ... print " NAME : " , item.__name__ ... if hasattr ( item , ' __class__ ' ) : ... print " CLASS : " , item.__class__.__name__
... print " ID : " , id ( item ) ... print " TYPE : " , type ( item ) ... print " VALUE : " , repr ( item ) ... print " CALLABLE : " , ... if callable ( item ) : ... print " Yes " ... else : ... print " No " ... if hasattr ( item , ' __doc__ ' ) : ... doc = getattr ( item , ' __doc__ ' ) ... doc = doc.strip () # Remove leading / trailing whitespace .
... firstline = doc.split('
' ) [ 0 ] ... print " DOC : " , firstline ... >>> interrogate ( 'a string ')
# String object CLASS : str ID : 141462040 TYPE : < type ' str '>
VALUE : ' a string ' CALLABLE : No DOC : str( object ) -> string >>> interrogate ( 42 ) # Integer object CLASS : int ID : 135447416 TYPE : < type ' int '>
VALUE : 42 CALLABLE : No DOC : int ( x [ , base ] ) -> integer >>> interrogate ( interrogate ) # User - defined function object NAME : interrogate CLASS : function ID : 141444892 TYPE : < type ' function '>
VALUE : < function interrogate at 0x86e471c > CALLABLE : Yes DOC : Print useful information about item .
As you can see in the last example , our interrogate ( ) function even works on itself .
You can't get much more introspective than that .
Conclusion
Who knew that introspection could be so simple , and so rewarding ?
And yet , I must end here with a caution : do not mistake the results of introspection for wisdom .
The experienced Python programmer knows that there is always more they do not know , and are therefore not wise at all .
The act of programming produces more questions than answers .
The only thing good about Python , as we have seen here today , is that it does answer one 's questions .
As for me , do not feel a need to compensate me for helping you understand these things that Python has to offer .
Programming in Python is its own reward .
All I ask from my fellow Pythonians is free meals at the public expense .

Preaching to the Choir
By Mike Kaulbars
“ I do not want to rise above the working class , I want to rise with them ”
Eugene Debs
In the Many are One I make the case that progressives are not dealing with many issues , but rather one single issue that manifests itself in multiple ways .
This fact is no mere intellectual curiosity , but rather has implications for organizing and how we approach bringing about the change that we work for .
We tend to use the term “ preaching to the choir ” as though it were a waste of time because the audience in question is already “ on side . ”
In fact every faith group puts considerable effort into preaching to the ‘ converted ’ because ‘ converted ’ is a broad category that spans everyone from the life committed hard core to the tentative recent recruit .
Everyone can do better , and faith communities understand that ongoing support is critical to making that happen .
The same is true within issue groups , and most invest some time and energy in newsletters , websites , etc to educate people about the issue .
An often overlooked fact is that these passive media can only ‘ preach to the converted ’ because anyone who is not already on side is not going spend time on them anymore than I will check out monster truck racing websites .
The only way to reach the ‘ unconverted ’ in any meaningful way is through active means , talking to them directly one on one with their permission .
In this regard the most influential people in our lives are our friends .
In terms of actual behaviours and ideas our friends influence us far more than family , co-workers , or any other group .
For all of us our most valuable resource to access the unconverted is our ‘ congregation ’ , IE the members , volunteers and supporters of our organization .
While we tend to supply them with educational material of one form or another , we tend not to think of them as active agents of education in turn .
Further , we do n’t tend to think very deeply about who they might educate and how .
We all tend to have friends that are like us to an extent , and in that regard we can assume that most of our supporters have a circle of friends that are more progressive than the average person .
Progressive , but not necessarily on side when it comes to our particular issue .
These people are predisposed to being supporters and accessible through our current supporters ; how many of us take advantage of that fact ?
Now we may take it as a given that our supporters already share their passion with their friends , and that to the extent that it is possible they have ‘ converted ’ some of them .
I would like to suggest that we are n’t as effective in this regard because we consistently frame our message in terms of why our issue is important to us , rarely why it might be important to someone else .
By this I mean doing more education with respect to the linkages between the issues , particularly using a proactive tone that encourages and supports our supporters to understand those linkages .
Of course in bringing our message to fellow progressives it is necessary to fully understand how the issues are linked and how we can support each other .
The agenda must not be to attempt to co-opt anyone else ’s issue , but rather to create a mutually supportive , unified political movement .
For example , articles on gender and climate change must not simply be meant to get those who care about women to also care about climate change , but also as far as possible , to make climate activists into feminists as well .
The same is true across the full spectrum of the issues .
The more clearly our own supporters understand how intimately linked our issues are , and how we cannot make real progress on any one issue if the others do not advance as well , the more effective they will be in advancing our issue with their friends .
This is critical because , paradoxically , we can not be self - serving unless we are selfless .
The climate activist who really understands labour , peace , and race issues , and how they affect and are affected by climate change , will be credible to people concerned with those issues .
Someone seeking to co-opt will be dismissed for what they are .
We can only create such effective activists by being sincere and wholehearted in our commitment to fully integrating those other issues into our own agendas .
This is not a call to lose focus , but rather to gain depth .
It is not necessary that a group working on climate change have large sections of their web site devoted to every other progressive issue .
However , it is necessary to do more than have the odd token article on ‘ Environment and _____ . ”
Further , it is necessary that it be from the perspective of those concerned with the other issue , and that there be a clear expectation that those who support the one need to support the other as well if they wish to be truly effective .
The work is not so much that of creating links as taking off blinders .
Since war , poverty , and all of the forms of injustice and oppression contribute to environmental degradation , no one can be a truly effective environmental activist until they have understood that and made the appropriate changes in their ideas and behaviour .
Equally , since environmental degradation is a significant cause of war , poverty , and injustice , no one can be a truly effective activist for any of those causes until they have done likewise with respect to environmental issues .
As with any political work , it starts with the personal .
If you do not really understand the way your issue is linked to some other progressive issue , at least take the time to ask one of your friends to explain their issue to you fully .
Let them talk until you get it .
Then turn around and explain it to your friends in turn .
Your passion for whatever your issue is will not diminish because you have gained a deeper understanding .
Rather your clarity about how to move forward will improve .
So by all means preach to the choir ; they are the ones singing our song and the better they are the more effective we will be .

Indians are being urged to hand over a note worth zero rupees when asked for a bribe , in a bid to stamp out corruption among officials .
Last year , international corruption watchdog Transparency International said almost 4 million Indian families had to bribe officials for access to basic services .
Vijay Anand , from the lobby group 5th Pillar , says they began distributing the worthless note because of a lack of practical solutions for tackling corruption .
" The topic of corruption have never been on the surface , " he said .
" Everybody was practising it , paying bribes , getting their jobs done .
We thought that the fundamental reason was there was lack of alternatives - there was no practical solutions , no alternatives .
" So we thought we should come up with something .
One of our volunteers came up with the idea of the zero - rupee note and we then launched it on a wide scale . "
The note , similar to a real 50 - rupee note , carries 5th Pillar 's email address and phone number .
At the moment the zero - rupee notes are mainly found in Tamil Nadu , the most southern state in India , but there are plans to distribute the protest note in majors cities including Mumbai , Delhi and Bangalore .
Mr Anand says the notes have been well received by the public and often shaming officials into getting business done efficiently .
" The public who have received these notes have been more than enthusiastic and willing to use them and the officials who receive them get a sense of shock and fear because no - one has ever confronted them by saying no to bribery , " he said .
" An old lady who was waiting for land titles , she was [ asked ] for a bribe of 7,000 rupees , " he said .
" She came to our office and got a zero rupee note and then went to department and handed this note over .
She got the job done in 30 minutes - the same job she waited a year - a - half for . "
Last year India 's standing in Transparency International 's corruption index fell from 72nd to 85th in a list of 180 countries .
Transparency International India executive director Anupama Jha says while the note is an interesting way of tackling corruption , it is only a small step in fighting bribes .
" This is a small step in the right direction but much more needs to be done , " she said .
The admission by Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair that the United States intelligence community is authorized to assassinate Americans working with terrorists overseas has raised serious questions of constitutionality .
“ It ’s troubling , Keith , because it ’s not on the books , ” constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley told MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann on Thursday .

“ This is something that President Bush developed , ” Turley explained .
“ We actually saw the Bush administration kill an American citizen named Kamal Derwish in 2002 with a Predator strike . …
The Obama administration , once again , seems to be morphing into the Bush administration . ”
According to investigative reporter Seymour Hersh , the American officials who directed the strike that killed Derwish in 2002 were not aware that he was in the targeted car .
In contrast , the attempt to take out al Qaeda operative Anwar al Awlaki last December with a cruise missile directly targeted the America - born cleric .
“ The problem is that there ’s a term for this , ” Turley went on .
“ It ’s called assassination .
You ’re taking out someone , a US citizen , who ’s had no chance to prove that they ’re innocent .
… US citizens are entitled to trials . ”
“ It does n’t say you ca n’t kill a US citizen who ’s engaged in a terrorist act , ” Turley cautioned .
“ But to use this term of ‘ involved ’ in an organization raises some very troubling legal and constitutional issues . ”

It is already known that blueberries are rich in antioxidants and vitamins .
New research from the Lund University Faculty of Engineering in Sweden shows that blueberry fibre are important and can alleviate and protect against intestinal inflammations , such as ulcerative colitis .
The protective effect is even better if the blueberries are eaten together with probiotics .
The project originated as an attempt to see whether various types of dietary fibre and health - promoting bacteria , so - called probiotic bacteria such as lactobacillus and bifidobacteria , can help alleviate and prevent the risk of ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer .
“ But new knowledge of this field is also of interest to those who do n’t believe they run the risk of developing any intestinal diseases .
In recent years the research world has been realizing that our health is governed to a great extent by what happens in our large intestine , ” explain Camilla Bränning , a PhD in Applied Nutrition and Ĺsa Hľkansson , a doctoral candidate in Food Hygiene at the Division of Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry .
The researchers tested various types of diets of blueberry husks , rye bran and oat bran with or without a mixture of probiotic bacteria .
The results showed that the protective effect of blueberries was reinforced if they were eaten together with probiotics .
“ The probiotics proved to have a protective effect on the liver , an organ that is often negatively impacted by intestinal inflammations , ” explains Ĺsa Hľkansson .
Blueberries are rich in polyphenols , which have an antimicrobial and antioxidative effect .
The combination of blueberries and probiotics reduced inflammation - inducing bacteria in the intestine at the same time as the number of health - promoting lactobacilla increased .
Ĺsa Hľkansson and Camilla Bränning also noted that if blueberries are eaten together with probiotics , the content of butyric acid and propionic acid increased in the blood , two substances that are formed when fibre are broken down and that have previously been known to be important energy sources for intestinal cells .
In recent years they have also been shown to favourably impact the immune defence .
It seems as if the absorption of these components is facilitated by the presence of probiotics .
“ What surprised us was that such a large share of the butyric acid not only was taken up by the intestinal cells but was also transported onward to the blood .
Previously it was thought that the intestinal cells used all of the butyric acid , but this is not at all the case , ” says Camilla Bränning , who recently defended her dissertation on the subject .
“ A further explanation for the extremely positive effect of blueberries may be that the blueberry fibre are not degraded to such a high degree in the large intestine .
This means that inflammation - inducing substances do not come into contact with the mucous lining of the intestine but are embedded in the fibre instead .
Then these substances are transported out of body together with the faeces , ” explains Camilla Bränning .
The researchers also found that rye bran was broken down in the large intestine , in the same place that ulcerative colitis and large - intestine cancer often occur , and that the rye bran provided a rich supply of butyric acid and propionic acid .
On the other hand , the fibre in oat bran were degraded earlier in the large intestine .
The most striking result , however , was that blueberries themselves had such a favourable effect compared with both rye bran and oat bran .
Some 15 - 20 percent of all Swedes suffer from stomach pains , diarrhoea , or constipation , complaints resulting from intestinal disorders and more undefined intestinal problems .
The disease ulcerative colitis is one of the inflammatory intestinal diseases included under the general name IBD , inflammatory bowel diseases .
It can lead to colorectal cancer and afflicts about 1,000 Swedes per year .

Strain Name : So Gouda
Grade : B
Type : Hybrid – Indica Dominant
Looks :
A very light green airy bud with very few hairs .
The hairs that it does have are light brown .
There is a pretty good crystal cover that definitely stands out .
Smell :
When I first opened the container to this strain I noticed a very strong bleach odor that I have never encountered with a strain before .
The scent soon calms down to a kind of skunky bleach smell .
Taste :
To me the smell would have been indicative to a great taste but that was not the case .
The taste was very mild almost non existent after the green on top of the bowl was gone .
What was there was a kush like taste and somewhat sour .
Effects :
The high was very very calm , it was a light body buzz that kept you relaxed and pain free .
The high was too light for me which is the main reason for the grade ( plus the bland taste ) .

The BBC's Security Correspondent Gordon Corera gains unprecedented access to Britain 's ultra secret listening station where super computers monitor the world 's communications traffic and Britain 's global eavesdropping and electronic surveillance operations are conducted .
The layers of secrecy which have surrounded GCHQ's work are peeled away - what exactly does it do and who is it listening to ?
The programme explores the wide area covered by signals intelligence - from looking for terrorists planning attacks against the United Kingdom to supporting military operations of the type underway in Afghanistan .
A team from the Counter terrorism section describes what it is like to listen in on terrorists ' conversations and the constant battle to predict where the next attack will come from : " I do n't think you would be human if you did n't go home at night and could n't switch off and thought ' Oh my God .
What happens if . . .?' "
What about the ethics of eavesdropping and how does their work compare to the way it is portrayed on television in series like ' Spooks ' ?
Code - breakers talk about their work , attempting to find a chink in the armour of a carefully encrypted message sent by a terrorist or a foreign government .
" It just feels amazing really , " when there is a breakthrough , says one .
" I mean you feel like you 've won " .
The programme looks at the technological challenges posed by the internet and the threat of cyber warfare , which has led to the establishment of a new cyber operations centre at Cheltenham .
It also explores the scientific and mathematical breakthroughs which have been achieved at GCHQ , including the discovery of public key encryption , used when we shop on the internet .
There 's a tour of the building 's four great computer halls , containing racks and racks of IT equipment and covering around ten thousand square metres .
" I could actually fit Wembley football pitch into three of the halls quite comfortably , ' says the man in charge of making sure that the equipment does n't crash .
Gordon Corera challenges the director Iain Lobban .
There has been considerable speculation about whether the government is planning huge databases at GCHQ to keep track of all communications and internet traffic .
Do they really spy on us ?
And how accountable are they ?

Different ways of telling time
( i ) last minute of play
Four - faced , the clock sees everywhere .
Dead centre over the ice , it hangs from chains .
The players glance up , exchange a word , a sideward
look - less than a minute to go .
They know time 's rough
and tumble .
Space and time , that 's where they live ,
arcs and angles , a quick move to open ice .
Their flashy physics .
Spectacles shift and glitter behind the glass .
Maybe someone they know but they never look
at the crowd .
They 're at the bench to hear the plan -
" Boys , you get a bounce here , things can happen fast . "
Left out on the ice - they might as well be
on the moon - both goalies eye the clock ,
one 's for zero , the other likes infinity ,
but things can change .
Get going clock .
Slow down slow down .
No one in the building likes time 's pace .
( ii ) you could drift out here forever
Jesus , here we go .
Seventh game , and seconds left to overtime .
Talk 's over at the glass , the captains
waved away .
The referee holds four fingers up
and folds his arms , four seconds he wants put back
on the clock .
Son of a bitch , an old defender
sags against the boards .
Still , imagine the power ,
to kick time 's arse like that .
( iii ) sudden death
The light begins to fade .
The cat wants out .
The hours to game - time leak away .
A hint of green pushes into the woods on the long par five
behind the house .
I watch the cat sharpen up on a favourite stump .
She yawns and stretches out to twice her length , then leisurely ,
she makes her way toward the trees .
Driving into the city , the traffic 's heavy ,
creeping along in a cloud of exhaust .
Stop and go .
The radio low .
Country songs , warning about the snow
coming down from Canada .
Clutch in clutch out and drift in dreams

same old jokes about my liniment , Jesus ,
Ukey , lose that shit why do n't you ?
Roll their eyes and tiptoe by .
Check the clock and tape my own stick ,
thank you , heel to toe , no wrinkles , tape the ankles .
Time to go out and get loose , guys in twos and threes
at home on ice , tucking pucks lazily under the crossbar .
Same old talk , someone you got to slow down ,
a glance where he 's talking it up
with his own guys .
Here 's the house where I live , I can't say no .
Howe and Lindsay 's eyes on me .
Pronovost , tough
as a bag of batteries , slaps my pads .
I see myself as I pass
in the glass , pick up that look from the other side , a nice pair
of knees that edge apart as I go by .
I get a whiff of ice
and something in me starts alive .
I take
a few shots , catch and flick , feeling
quick , clank behind me ,
lucky too .
Then back inside and bedlam now .

flapping but I do n’t hear .
Holy Mary , do n’t let me
fall on my face tonight .
I try to loosen a pad , my shaking
hand so bad Jesus Jesus .

knowing he needs to settle me down .

I ’m dying inside , ca n’t keep still now everybody wants to go ,
the clatter , the chatter , rockers , talkers .

some raunchy song when we were young , scare
the bejesus out of everyone .
" Nice neighbourhood like this , "
they ’d say .
" Who let the bloody DPs in ? "
Tommy drums
a rhythm on my leg – I watch his moving hand
distracted by the veins and lines that make the hand
a miracle , an acrobat , a thief .

I brace for the roar at the end of the tunnel .
" Give me a hand here , Tommy , tuck that in , that – look ,
that bloody strap . "
Then bang the door and Jesus here we go ,
someone shouts those words I love and dread , I hear
them all my life – Let the goalie go first .
( v ) carpe diem
They yammer at the press in towels
and the present tense - " So I see Goldie sneaking in
and what I think , I think . . . "
I flick the water from a blade .
The living
moment 's where they ply their trade , you get your chance
you make it count .
They like where time gets in your face
and open ice where you can really fly , or close - in battle
when the sticks get high , the action hot and heavy
as a leg draws up the sheet and slowly
opens out , my living Christ .
They swing behind the net ,
glancing up to find a gap , an open man , they like the crowd
up on their feet , the bodies piling on , the heft
and taste of women overhead .
" So I see Goldie sneaking in , I 'm thinking , man ,
if I can just draw Lumley to that post then slip it back
to him , but holy jumpin ' do n't let this one get away .
You get your chance , you better make it count .
I guess I just get lucky , Fred . "
I wipe the other blade and smile .
Seems a neighbourhood I know from long ago .
( vi ) big river
Stirring in the dark from ache to ache , crabbing
after scraps of sleep .
Outside , the muffled quiet says the snow
has come .
I love the city softly locked .
Let it snow forever .
I watch her shoulder 's gentle rise and fall ,
like she 's floating on the water .
Her back 's a miracle , so long and smooth
and brown , and there the jut of hip in envied sleep .
I trace a nail along her spine .
Where has she been to get
so brown ?
What was she saying as I fell asleep ? -
The smell
of smoke from open fires , barking dogs and swimming out
into the harbour in the dark .
Drifting off , I 'd felt her
fingers trace their path from scar to scar .
This was Watson ,
this one here , Henri Richard , and here 's the night Pit Martin
cracked your mask and blackened both your eyes , this one
you can hardly see , your brother on the rink
behind your house . . .
How good was that tonight .
The guys
were bouncing off the walls .
Jack was grabbing
everyone - he knew we had it in us all the time .
His buddies
from the press were happy too , no trouble getting anyone
to talk tonight .
You hear the racket in the shower ,
" What a smack , that little head fake shit . . . "
" Just a sucker punch , hey everybody
knows the guy . . . "
I do n't need her clock to know the time .
I shift the arm again , but can't shake something
someone said last night - " Hey , that kid out there
in Edmonton , that gaping hole between his legs ,
but man he 's got the corners covered .
Ukey Ukey watch your ass . "
I crab a little closer to her back .
God , how bad I need this heat .

There was a moment during Tony Blair 's appearance before the Iraq inquiry – it came in the stretch when his limp inquisitors were fumbling an attempt to pin him down on the legality of the war – that the former prime minister gave them a knowing smirk and remarked : " I was a lawyer myself .
I wrote many opinions . "
As if we really needed any reminding .
He occupied Number 10 for 10 years and 55 days .
Tony Blair did not sit at the pinnacle of power for a double - digit stretch without having a first - class capacity to master any brief , however dodgy , mount any argument , however specious , slide past any question , however difficult , parry any critique , however piercing , and defend any case , however indefensible .
The Iraq inquiry puts his historical legacy in the dock .
So he had hired the slickest lawyer he could find .
That would be himself .
He was also one of the greatest actor - managers to sit in Downing Street .
When he first sat down before the panel , clutching his lever arch file of supporting documents like a comfort blanket , he seemed to be suffering a touch of stage fright about the prospect of returning to the theatre of British politics for the first time in nearly three years .
His face looked taut and he opened a bottle of water with a shaky hand .
Yet he was soon at ease , relaxing into the performance , almost beginning to enjoy this enforced comeback , remembering all his old lines about Iraq and delivering a few fresh ones about Iran which he had scripted to command the attention of that night 's news bulletins and the next morning 's front pages .
He had come with a plan , which he executed successfully , to divert an inquiry into what he did in 2003 into a lecture about world affairs and the demands of leadership in 2010 .
It was a six - hour reminder that he was – and remains – the consummate political performer of his era .
That was one of the reasons he managed to persuade the rest of a Labour government , against all its natural instincts , to follow him into a hugely contentious war alongside a very right - wing American president .
He also won a hat trick of elections , securing the third victory even when the war had gone horribly wrong and its prospectus was exposed as bogus .
So Sir John Chilcot 's panel would have to be very good indeed to lay a glove on a man who has already ducked and weaved his way through seven years of questions – by previous inquiries , in Parliament , by the press , on television and radio and in his own head .
Very good indeed Chilcot and co are not .
I did not expect this to be Tony Blair " on trial " , but I had hoped that his inquisitors would display a bit more cutting edge than a month - old lettuce .
Time and again , they approached an interesting subject area , stumbled around like people in the dark trying to find the light switch and then abandoned the quest without leaving themselves or anyone watching much the wiser about the most divisive war in the last century of our history .
Some say they are so feeble because four knights and a dame are establishment worthies who are temperamentally incapable of speaking truth to power – or even asking power some awkward questions .
That , I think , is a little unfair .
The former civil servant , ex-ambassador , quango queen and two historians are clearly troubled by some of the evidence .
Sir Roderic Lyne , once our man in Moscow , has a nice line in dry incredulity .
No , the real problem with this panel is that they are simply not up to it .
They are incapable of constructing a line of questioning with enough forensic focus to pin down the truth .
This is a disability especially obvious when they are dealing with such an accomplished operator as Tony Blair , a man with years of experience of evading far more artful and rigorous inquisitors than these .
I have seen trainee television researchers come up with better constructed interviews than the interrogation of the former prime minister .
This is a crying shame .
We already know a lot about why Britain joined the war and what went so grievously wrong after the fall of Saddam , but I do n't agree with those who contend that we know so much that further inquiry is unnecessary .
Essential details are still in dispute and crucial events remain swirled in murk .
The supposed task of the Iraq inquiry is " to identify lessons that can be learnt " .
That can't be done until we know precisely what those lessons are .
I am not coming at this as someone who ever expected a " Gotcha ! " moment .
There was never a chance that the former prime minister was going to break down in a blubbering confession to atrocious errors before handing himself over to the protesters outside who had mocked up a jail for him .
Nor do I think that the only useful commentary on him is to yell " war criminal " .
I appreciate the dilemma he faced once he knew that George W Bush was intent on toppling Saddam Hussein .
I think he was utterly sincere in his fear of the atrocities that might be perpetrated as the result of a conjunction between rogue states , terrorists and weapons of mass destruction .
I understand why he felt that it was a strategic imperative to stay in lock step with the United States and have never doubted that he had a genuine revulsion of Saddam Hussein .
It was the combination of those two impulses that made him not a poodle to the White House but an enthusiastic collaborator in the project to remove the Iraqi dictator .
I am instinctively a liberal interventionist who thought that Tony Blair played a creditable role when British forces saved Sierra Leone from sadistic thugs and did so again when Slobodan Milosevic was stopped from ethnic cleansing in Kosovo .
One of the many tragedies of the Iraq war is that it will be hugely more difficult for any future British leader to persuade his country that there are times when it is not just right but an obligation to intervene when tyrannical states threaten their neighbours or their own people .
As any historian of this government or journalist of this era should be , I was green with envy that Sir John and his panel were granted such an invaluable opportunity to tease out some truths from Tony Blair .
By the end , I was closer to being red with rage that they had squandered nearly all of their six hours .
At each stage of the chronology and on every issue of contention , the key questions were pursued lamely or not at all .
We heard Tony Blair deny that he " signed in blood " with George W Bush at the Crawford summit in Easter 2002 .
Yet we already know , from memos leaked long ago , that both his ambassador in Washington and his senior adviser on foreign policy explicitly told the Americans a year before the war that Tony Blair backed " regime change " .
We further know , thanks to a declassified document released by Downing Street on Friday evening which the panel had already seen , that Tony Blair was offering support to remove Saddam " when the circumstances were right " even before 9/11 .
The inquiry failed to grasp the opportunity to find out precisely what he signed up to during the many private hours he spent with George Bush at his Prairie Chapel Ranch in Texas .
As a result , they never identified the moment – an absolutely crucial question – when he concluded that he would join the war .
The invasion was launched on a misleading prospectus constructed from intelligence which was flaky when it was not simply fake .
We heard the former prime minister lightly dismiss this by saying that the infamously wrong dossier about WMD had " assumed a vastly exaggerated importance later " .
Yet it was Mr Blair – as the panel did not remind him – who invested that document with such importance by recalling Parliament for an emergency session so that he could fanfare the dossier to MPs and the nation .
He had been told by his own officials that the intelligence was " sporadic and patchy " and yet he represented it to the Commons as " detailed and authoritative " .
Asked why he had not asked essential questions about the nature of the so - called intelligence , he was allowed to escape with the insouciant shrug : " I did n't focus on it a great deal . "
It is very hard to reconcile that with his contention that he was nevertheless convinced that it demonstrated a threat from Iraq that was " beyond doubt " .
When it came to what he said to the attorney - general about the legality of the war , he fell back on Bill Clinton 's favourite device of not being able to recall " any specific conversations " .
The panel never roused themselves to try to prod his memory into a better account .
He was " shocked and angry " by the abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib .
His inquisitors did n't trouble to probe the extent of his government 's knowledge of and potential complicity with the torture and other appalling acts perpetrated in the name of the alliance .
There was no credible explanation for why the postwar planning was so calamitously inadequate .
Nor for why , when Iraq began to descend into murderous mayhem , he was incapable of getting George Bush to do anything about it .
Some illuminating answers about that would come from American witnesses – I 've talked to several of them – and one of the weaknesses of this inquiry is that it has not taken evidence from the other side of the Atlantic .
His most startling admission came towards the end and it tumbled out almost inadvertently .
Tony Blair had not , he confessed , realised that al - Qaida would see the allied presence in Iraq as an opportunity to wage jihad against American and British troops .
Nor had he foreseen that Iran would seize the chance to foment trouble for the allies .
That was a remarkable confession of failure to anticipate what ought to have been utterly predictable .
When it came to Iraq , Tony Blair was a combination of passionate conviction and cavalier disregard for detail .
It was that fatal marriage which explains so much of what went so wrong .
What did we really learn ?
We learnt that the former prime minister still thinks it was right to get rid of Saddam , is sorry about the odd mistake and would nevertheless do it all over again , given the chance .
This leaves us , as a country , in a deeply unsatisfactory place about the Iraq war .
There is no " closure " for those bereaved by the conflict and any expression of sympathy for them was astonishingly lacking from Tony Blair even when the chairman invited him to express any regrets .
The country as a whole is still denied a full account of the conflict that cost so much in both blood and treasure .
For the government , there is no drawing of a political line under the war .
It haunts them still , not an outcome to be desired by Gordon Brown when he is weeks away from a general election at which he needs every Labour voter he can get .
It is not a positive result even for Tony Blair .
I guess he can look upon his testimony as a chance to road - test the defiant passages planned for the self - justificatory chapters of his memoirs .
His friends say he feels comfortable with his performance and has no regrets about being so unapologetic because contrition would have handed ammunition to his enemies .
Yet there is a difference between getting away with it and settling the account .
The very fluency of his performance , the practised ease with which he ran rings round a bunch of wet inquisitors who never once penetrated his defences , leaves a bad taste in the mouth and a continuing hunger to get at the whole truth .
This was certainly not Judgment Day .
Tony Blair once said that he expected to have to answer to his Maker .
Assuming they ever meet , perhaps he is right .
Perhaps it is now beyond any earthly power to get a final reckoning from him for Iraq .

READ THE REST
We return now to helmets since they are , beyond a doubt , the most often touted measure to increase motorcycle safety .
In the next two entries , we will examine one state ’s data over the same ten - year period we looked at in terms of crashing .
What we will find illustrates many of the problems with motorcycle safety :
Louisiana is a unique case when it comes to motorcycle safety :
Like almost all other states , a universal helmet law was passed in the 1960s ( 1968 , to be exact ) and then modified it in 1976 to only apply to those under 18 .
Then legislators passed a universal helmet law again in 1982 .
Seventeen years later , the law was modified once again to require only those under 18 or those without coverage of at least $ 10,000 in medical insurance to wear a helmet and was in effect in August of 1999 .
Five years later , in 2004 , the universal helmet law was reinstated .
During the same time frame that we examined crashes in terms of three kinds of crashes ( fatalities , injuries and property - only crashes ) , then , Louisiana did n’t have a universal helmet law and then did have one .
It is , then , a good state to see the effects of helmet and non-helmet use and the effect of a helmet law in terms of fatalities and injuries .
In this entry we look only at fatalities .
Louisiana in comparison to national picture
As in the rest of the USA , motorcycle fatalities increased from 40 in 1998 to 87 in 2006 or 117.5 percent .
In 2008 fatalities were 77 or 92.5 percent and then to 92 in 2009 .
Overall , then Louisiana ’s fatality toll rose 130 percent in eleven years .
This is over the national percentage over the same time span .
As in the rest of the USA , motorcycle registrations were increasing in Louisiana during these years — though there are no publicly reliable statistics to document the increase — not even for NHTSA .[ i ]
While the researchers who prepared the report on the effect of the helmet law repeal dismissed the importance of increasing registrations on crash rates , others would strongly disagree .
As we ’ve seen in other states we ’ve examined , registrations did not increase unilaterally in every state nor from year to year .
The missing data , then , leaves a huge gap — if motorcycle safety is a puzzle , then this is information we need to solve it .
Observed helmet use over the ten years
In the years when the universal helmet law was in effect , between 87-100 percent of riders wore them .
In the years without mandated helmet use , usage dropped immediately to 52 percent then rose to about 60 percent , dropped to 48 percent rose again to about 60 percent and stayed there until the universal helmet law was reinstated when observed helmet use appears to be 98-99 % .
Unsurprisingly , when helmet use dropped unhelmeted fatalities went up [ ii ] and helmeted fatalities went down .
And , unsurprisingly , when the mandate was reinstated , helmeted fatalities went up .[ iii ]
Studies were done , papers and reports were written to document the effect of the helmet law repeal — and then the reinstatement .
Including NHTSA who released a report , “ Evaluation of the Reinstatement of the Motorcycle Helmet Law in Louisiana ” .
And the stats were astonishing — unhelmeted fatalities increased by 40 % the first year and 42 % the second year after the repeal and dropped 64 % the year after the universal helmet law was repealed .
It seems to prove the case — and is religiously held by helmet proponents : helmets save lives .
And , as helmet - proponents would expect , helmeted fatalities were under - represented compared to observed helmet - use :
And unhelmeted injuries were over - represented to non-use :
The helmet story seems to be justified .
However , if we look without preconceptions more closely at the actual numbers , that ’s not the full story — and by not telling the full story , motorcycle safety researchers have not served riders well .
The data in the following chart Data taken from the Louisiana State University Traffic Safety Research Group traffic safety data reports .
UnHelmet Fatalities Year - to - Year ChangeUnH Estimated Non-Helmet Use Total F Fatality Increase from prior year Observed Helmet Use Year - to - Year Change HEL Helmet Fatalities 1999 15 3 % 40 14.2 % 97 % 25 2000 21 40 % 48 % 50 25 % 52 % 16 % 29 2001 36 42 % 41 % 53 6 % 59 % - 41 % 17 2002 41 14 % 58 % 58 9.4 % 42 % 0 % 17 2003 55 34 % 40 % 77 32.7 % 60 % 29 % 22 2004 36 - 34 % 40 % 68 - 11.6 % 60 % 45 % 32 2005 13 - 64 % 2 % 70 - 2.9 % 98 % 78 % 57 2006 8 - 38 % 2 % 87 24.2 % 98 % 38 % 79 2007 14 43 % 73 - 16 % - 25 % 59 2008 19 36 % 77 5.4 % - 1.7 % 58 2008 15 - 21 % 91 18.1 % 31 % 76 Totals 258 653 395
The NHTSA report does n’t note that once the law was reinstated ,
helmeted fatalities went up 45 % then 78 % then 38 % .
Iow , equally scary percentages are found on both sides of the Louisiana Experiment .
In fact , in 2004 — the year of reinstatement — unhelmeted fatalities dropped 23 — but helmeted fatalities rose 25 .
It ’s almost as if it was simply a trade - off : unhelmeted deaths became helmeted deaths .
This is the first indication that even though helmets save lives , their absence does n’t drive the increase in motorcycle deaths .
While it is true that unhelmeted fatalities increased every year , however helmeted fatalities also increased 8 out of the 10 years — and that included two years when helmet use was depressed .
This is the second indication that helmet use is disconnected from the rise or fall of fatalities in essential ways .
Ultimately this is the scariest thing of all : During these years , Louisiana ’s motorcyclist death toll soared and helmeted fatalities tripled while unhelmeted fatalities in 2008 returned to exactly what they were in 1999 .
The large point is this : the issue is n’t helmet effectiveness .
Focusing merely on helmet use or encouraging riders to wear them simply does n’t address why those fatal crashes are occurring more and more often .
In this way , the increases on the helmeted side of the equation are more troubling since the additional protection helmets offer were insufficient in preventing deadly injuries .
We ’ll return to this point in the next entry .
In reality , small numbers
But the focus on helmet use disguises something that is also essential to really understanding what ’s happening with riders : small numbers make for big — but misleading — percentages on both sides of the equation .
And in Louisiana , the numbers are sometimes very small :
2000 : Helmet use was 52 % .
Fatalities increased by 10 riders .
Unhelmeted fatalities up by 6 .
Helmeted fatalities up by 4 .
2001 : Helmet use : 59 % .
Death toll increased by 3 .
Unhelmeted fatalities went up by 15 .
Helmeted fatalities down by 12 .
2002 : Helmet use : 42 % fatalities .
Fatalities up by 5 .
Increase was solely accounted for by unhelmeted deaths .
2003 : Helmet use 60 % .
Fatalities up by 19 .
Unhelmeted fatalities up by 14 .
Helmeted fatalities up by 5 .
2004 : Helmet law use 60 % .
Fatalities down by 9 .
Unhelmeted fatalities down by 19 .
Helmeted fatalities up by 10 .
2005 : Helmet use was 98 %.[iv ]
Death toll increased by 2 .
Unhelmeted fatalities down by 23 .
Helmeted fatalities up by 25 .
2006 : Helmet use 98 % .
Fatalities increased by 17 .
Unhelmeted fatalities down by 5
Helmeted fatalities up by 22 .
2007 : Estimated helmet use 98 % .
Fatalities decreased by 14
Unhelmeted fatalities up by 6 .
Helmeted fatalities down by 20 .
2008 : Estimated helmet use 98 % .
Fatalities increased by 4 .
Unhelmeted fatalities down by 5 .
Helmeted fatalities up by 18 .
Small numbers yield large percentages — but skew the interpretation
There ’s several things to observe :
If fatalities can legitimately be expected as a function of the numbers , some kind of increase could be — and maybe should be —expected because motorcycle registrations were increasing .
But even as the pool of motorcyclists was growing fatalities increased by 5 or less in four of the ten years .
And 5 or less are surely small numbers — and yet they can loom large and appear to be more important than they perhaps are .
For example , a decrease of unhelmeted 5 deaths in 2005 — the year after the helmet law reinstatement — resulted in a decrease of 38 % and an increase in 5 helmeted deaths results in a 29 % increase .
Using percentages to make a point without including the numbers can lead to inaccurate analysis and , in this case , exaggerate the supposed effect of the reinstatement when the reality is that people who might have died without helmets died with them on .
A pattern of wild fluctuations
Louisiana ’s pattern is one of wild fluctuations where fatalities creep up or down by 5 or less or soar by 22 one year and plunge the next by 20 then rise to 18 .
This pattern of dramatic year - to - year shifts is not seen in states with large numbers of fatalities where they produce smaller percentages of increase .
Such wild swings raise the possibility that crashes have much more to do with random factors or at least factors that are not considered and therefore not accounted for than any crash causation study to date has considered .
While Louisiana ’s motorcycle registrations are shrouded in mystery for some inexplicable reason , the state does provide data on injuries as well as fatalities — and that ’s where we follow the helmet story next .

In 1973 , four long years before the novel was published , Philip K . Dick sent an initial outline of A Scanner Darkly to his agent Scott Meredith , along with the covering letter seen below .
Dick was clearly enthused and his fervour was understandable as this new work drew heavily on his own experiences whilst a heavy amphetamine user .
In fact , this was – according to the author himself – the first novel he had written whilst ‘ clean ’ .

Dear Scott :
Here is the outline for my proposed new novel .
A SCANNER DARKLY , which I told you about .
It ’s a good long outline , running well over sixty pages .
I guess you ca n’t sell it to any publisher until I write a bunch of sample chapters , but anyhow this is what I ’ll be working on for quite some time .
If you ’d like to show it –for example to Doubleday– that would of course be fine with me .
Otherwise , hang onto this outline while I continue from my carbon .
Let me know what you think of it , and meanwhile I ’ll keep you posted as to how I ’m coming with the novel itself .
Cordially ,

Zen and the Art of Web Performance
The Zen Wall
We moved into a teardown 2 BR / 1BA house in 1993 .
After two years of infrastructure repairs ( heating , plumbing , electrical , doors , windows ) we started work on the yard .
One of the jobs that I enjoyed most was building a dry stone retaining wall in the front yard .
Here are the before and after pictures :
before
after
During this multi- month project my neighbor , Les Kaye , came by to survey the progress .
Les is the Zen monk at the Kannon Do Zen Meditation Center and author of Zen at Work .
He made a comment about my rock wall that I ’ve always remembered – “ very Zen- like ” .
I ’m not a Zen student , but I have read a few Zen books ( Les’ Zen at Work , Tao Te Ching by Lao Tsu , the Tao of Leadership by John Heider , and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig ) .
I think Les ’ comment had to do with the way I was building the wall .
I was n’t using any tools , and did n’t have any drawings or plans .
I had never built a dry stone wall before .
I read a few articles on dry stone construction , got advice from the folks where I bought the stone , and then just started .
I had a sense of where the wall should go in the yard , and where the steps should go in the wall .
I laid the base , and then worked up from there .
I would try a few stones for a given spot until I found the right one .
I could recognize if a stone worked , and if it did n’t .
Sometimes I ’d have to backtrack a bit to undo some bad stones and start over where the good stones left off .
In the end , the wall turned out great .
It ’s now covered with moss , overhung by rosemary , and filled with lizards that come out to sunbathe in the summer .
Les ’ comment that my rock wall project was Zen - like had to do with this marriage of an artistic sense of what was right with the technical process of building a wall .
The separation of art and technology , and the need to rejoin them , is a major theme in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance that ’s been on my mind lately .
Art & Technology
The way I approached this rock wall project seems a bit ill - conceived .
You certainly would n’t run a software development project this way .
A well - planned project would make use of good tools .
It would have a detailed plan .
It would include people that had experience , at least in a consulting role .
And it would have regular milestones that could be objectively measured and quantified .
But these ( technical , mechanical , objective ) process parts are n’t sufficient to ensure success .
A sense of craftsmanship is also needed .
I ’ve had the experience where I ’ve hired a home contractor who had all the right tools and experience , and was equipped with an agreed upon plan , but at the end of the job I was n’t satisfied with the outcome .
The end result did n’t fit .
It was out of proportion – something we could n’t have noticed looking at the plans .
Or it did n’t fit the flow of the people living in the house – the light switches were placed in an awkward location in a counter intuitive order , or the door swung out too far and blocked traffic .
I ’m not saying you should n’t have plans and tools , and metrics and experts .
And I ’m certainly not running down home contractors – many great contractors have worked on our house .
I ’m saying that the high quality results I ’ve experienced resulted when technical skills were combined with a sense of what was “ right ” in the work .
Robert Pirsig says it this way in describing a wall built in Korea :
[ The wall ] was beautiful , but not because of any masterful intellectual planning or any scientific supervision of the job , or any added expenditures to “ stylize ” it .
It was beautiful because the people who worked on it had a way of looking at things that made them do it right unselfconsciously .
They did n’t separate themselves from the work in such a way as to do it wrong . [… ]
In each case there ’s a beautiful way of doing it and an ugly way of doing it , and in arriving at the high - quality , beautiful way of doing it , both an ability to see what “ looks good ” and an ability to understand the underlying methods to arrive at that “ good ” are needed .

Beautiful Web Performance
My work on web performance has helped identify the “ underlying methods ” for arriving at a quality result in terms of a fast web site .
To make it easy to find out which methods to use , I created YSlow and encouraged the team that launched Page Speed .
But these tools do n’t preclude the need to understand the techniques behind web performance .
I was reminded of this today by an email I received through my web site .
The emailer said he had installed YSlow and saw what needed to be fixed , and asked for the step - by - step instructions on how to accomplish these changes .
Without any details of his web site , HTML & JavaScript frameworks , etc. it was impossible to generate step - by - step instructions .
But even if it was possible , if he had followed someone else ’s list of instructions he would be separated from the work and miss the experience of the “ beautiful way of doing it ” .
Optimizing a web site is n’t something that can be undertaken without understanding what you ’re changing and why .
Doing so inevitably introduces complexity , confusion , and loss of quality .
It would be better for him to develop that understanding , or if that ’s not possible to use a framework that incorporates performance best practices .
In addition to an understanding of the underlying methods , the ability to see what “ looks good ” is also needed , as Pirsig says .
When it comes to web performance , it ’s pretty easy to distinguish the good from the bad .
How does your site feel when you use it ?
How about when you use it from home or from a mobile device ?
WebPagetest.org helps by offering multiple ways to visualize the performance of your web site , and to compare that to other sites .
Over time , combining an understanding of the underlying methods for web performance with an ability to see what “ looks good ” leads to doing quality development “ unselfconsciously ” .
It becomes second nature , and permeates every site you build .
As I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance I was amazed at how well it spoke to the work I do , even more amazing given that it was published in 1974 .
The search for Quality is timeless .
I recommend you read ZMM , or read it again as the case may be .
Raising the level of quality in your work will benefit your users and your employer , but it ’ll benefit you most of all .

We 've been fact - checking claims about health care for more than a year now , and have noted several distortions that wo n't seem to die .
Here are five that surface again and again .
1 . It bans private insurance in favor of a government - run plan .
Opponents have repeatedly said the plan would force Americans off their current plans , even though most current plans would be allowed to continue .
Republican House Republican leader John Boehner said that " forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government - run plan ( is ) exactly what the Democrats ' plan would do . "
We rated that False .
2. Preventive care saves the whole health care system money .
People who favor the plan regularly imply that preventive care will lower its overall cost .
While early treatment can save individual patients money , research shows that the benefits do n't outweigh the costs of the additional screening procedures .
President Barack Obama said preventive care " saves money . "
We rated that False .
3. Millions of people will lose coverage .
Opponents of the plan have argued that millions of people would lose their health insurance .
But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that the proposal would result in insurance for 94 percent of the country .
Republican commentator Nancy Pfotenhauer said that " hundreds of millions of people ( will ) lose their current insurance coverage . "
We rated that Pants on Fire .
4 . The plan will lower health insurance premiums for most people .
A few people will see significant reductions in what they pay for health insurance if they qualify for low - income tax credits to buy their policies .
But the vast majority of Americans will see no decrease or a very slight decrease in premiums , according to projections .
Obama said , " The costs for families ( in the individual market ) for the same type of coverage that they 're currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent . "
We rated that Half True .
Obama 's statement is true only for those in the individual market who are buying comprehensive plans right now .
For people buying high - deductible , low - cost plans , the premiums will increase , because they 'll have to buy plans that offer more coverage .
5 . Bureaucrats will dictate treatment for patients , or tell you what insurance plan you have to buy .
The proposal does include new boards to make recommendations on evidence - based treatment .
But they wo n't consider any individual cases or deny procedures for specific patients .
The bill also sets minimum standards for insurance companies , creating a baseline for basic coverage .
People will still be able to pick the plan they prefer .
We received a chain e-mail that said , " The ' Health Choices Commissioner ' will decide health benefits for you .
You will have no choice .
None . "
We rated that Pants on Fire .
Get to know about the different types of casino gamers
When you walk into a casino , you will come across many different types of casino players .
You will also experience this when you are spending your time at an online casino .
Since you are going to interact with them while playing some of the games , it is important to have a basic overall understanding about their traits .
Along with that , you will be provided with the opportunity to get the most out of time that you are spending with the casino games as well .
Before we deep dive and take a look at the different types of casino players , it is worthy to take a look at the factors , which are in a position to keep the players coming back for more .
Some of the people lose all their money with casino games .
They know that playing casino is a kind of a trap .
Even with that understanding , they tend to come and spend more time with the casino games .
That ’s because they have become addicts of casino .
The casino games are highly addictive and it is important to make sure that you are aware of your limits at the time of spending time with them .
Otherwise , there is a high possibility for you to end up with the negative consequences created by them .
What are the different types of casino players ?
Now let ’s get back into the main topic , where we are going to discuss more about the different types of casino gamers .
When you are going through these different types of gamers , you will also figure out that there are many different gamer levels in casino as well .
It all depends on the way how they are playing money .
Players who use the lowest rates ( Chief fans )
The first type of gamers that you can find in casinos are the individuals who are using the lowest rates .
They can be considered as chief fans of the game .
This can be considered as the best type of players that you can discover in a casino .
They have lost all the money , but they are still shouting out loud at the bets that are put forwards by the other players .
In the meantime , they go ahead and congratulate the winners of the games warmly .
After doing that , they request for few chips , so that they can wish the winners with good luck .
These players prefer playing extended casino games in most of the instances .
In fact , you will often be able to see them playing poker .
The players are placing small bets .
While doing that , they are consuming a lot of free food and drinks as well .
The big casino players prefer to avoid these chief fans as much as possible , due to the annoyance created by them .
That ’s why the big players always prefer to get into the VIP room and go ahead with their games .
If you are visiting a casino , you are encouraged to refrain from dealing with these types of casino players .
That ’s mainly because they do n’t have a stable psyche .
They are heavily influenced by alcohol .
If you secure a big win , you will come across these players .
They will even wait for you on the streets , and they will not think twice before asking you to share the gifts that you have earned .
In case if you do n’t share the gifts , they act offended .
Experienced and professional players
The second type of casino players that you will come across are the experienced and professional players .
It is a common sight to see these players around the roulette tables .
They are placing their bets quickly and in a professional manner .
These players have the skill to handle the chips deftly .
They are also playing with the chips at an average rate .
In fact , they usually prefer to play one on one along with the casino dealer .
While doing that , they prefer to give a lot of tasks to the dealer .
The experienced and professional players have a clear understanding about the names of all series .
As a result , they find it as an easy task to proceed through the games in a smooth manner .
In most of the instances , they prefer to play short games .
Along with playing such short games , they are provided with the chance to show off the knowledge that they have got .
You cannot often find the experienced and professional players going into the VIP room .
They make the decision only if they cannot find any free tables .
That ’s mainly because they tend to feel more professional with the spectators surrounding them .
For most of the professional casino players , playing casino is the main source of income .
They interact with the staff members at the casino politely .
On top of everything , they are in a position to accept the losses that they go through politely .
Aggressive big players
Every casino has aggressive big players .
They show a lot of aggression when moving forward with the games that they play .
They have a different mindset when entering into the casino .
In fact , they believe that they are spending their money on the casino games and they believe that the casino should treat them accordingly .
The pit bosses often prefer to separate such aggressive big players from the average players .
Therefore , you will often be able to see how these aggressive big players are directed into the VIP room .
As a result of this , the other players will not be exposed to their rudeness .
These aggressive and big players do n’t think twice before they take certain actions while playing in the casino .
For example , you will be able to see those throwing chips or ashtrays against the waitresses and dealers .
In addition to that , you can find them spitting drinks and swearing against the other people at the casino .
In some of the instances , you will even be able to find these players spitting on the face of casino dealers .
These casino players are dealing with the delusions of grandeur .
They are extremely aggressive with their behavior .
For the amount of money that the aggressive big players lose in the casino games , they prefer to get elite delicacies and drinks .
They are people with high self - esteem .
The behavior shown by them is quite annoying to the employees who work at the casino as well .
Advanced novice players
Advanced novice players are mostly the individuals who are spending their second or third time in a casino .
They have experience with the activities that take place in the gaming hall .
However , they show a bit nervous behavior as well because they do n’t have direct experiences of what ’s taking place around them .
These advanced notice players are extremely polite .
Staff at the casino do n’t come across any issues when interacting them .
However , it is possible to see them asking a lot of questions about the rules .
They are not very familiar with the rules and they are living with the curiosity of understanding what is taking place around them at all times .
The advanced novice players in a casino usually prefer to spend their time along with blackjack or roulette games .
Since the players have already been to the casino , they have a basic overall understanding about the rules that they have to deal with .
In most of the instances , they must have won at the first time they came to the casino .
It has tempted them to come again and see if they can win a game in the second time as well .
However , they have just ended up with random victories because they did n’t play the games with a proper strategy at the very first instance .
They must have just placed the bets on numbers and the victory has come on their way .
In fact , they have been lucky at the very first instance .
They assume that they will be lucky on the next attempt as well .
That ’s why they have come again to the casino to spend their time .
They are also living with the impression that playing casino games is not that bad and they will be able to end up with excellent victories in most of the instances .
Novice players
Last but not least , we can find novice players who are spending their time in the casinos for the very first time .
It is quite easy to spot them as well .
That ’s because you can often find them wondering around with curiosity .
Since this is the first time that they have come into a casino , they are curious to know what ’s taking place all around them .
That ’s where they walk to every corner of the casino and see what ’s happening , before moving into the next stage of playing a game .
These novice players sometimes come up with a lot of luck as well .
They are n’t fully aware of the rules of casino games that they play .
As a result , they do n’t utilize a proper strategy to win the games as well .
However , you will be able to see them winning the games that are being played .
That ’s because luck is following them into the casino .
You will often be able to find these players placing silly and illogical bets .
However , these silly and illogical bets are in a position to provide them with the chance to end up with excellent victories at the end of the day .
They continue to win with that as well .
The casinos often prefer to hunt for the novice players .
That ’s because if a novice player ends up with a victory , he is likely to go ahead and join one of the groups and become a part of the casino .
That ’s the initial step of casino addiction .
The novice casino players are polite not only to the staff members , but also to the other people that they can find around them .
The novice players will go ahead and play any game that they come across interesting as well .
That ’s because they do n’t have an understanding about the gravity of the games .
In most of the instances , they tend to spend time with the slot machines as the rules are quite easy to understand .
Common things among all these types of players
Now you are aware of 5 different types of casino players that you will come across in a casino .
You will come across these types of players in any casino that you walk into .
When you take a look at the traits of them , you will also be able to discover some common traits among them .
For example , if a player selects a table and starts a game , he would get disconnected from the rest of the world .
Along with that , they tend to pay more attention towards the roulette table , dealer , cards , chips and the ball .
If you ever try to stop that kind of a player , you will be able to experience a lot of new things .
In fact , you will be able to see him behaving in an aggressive manner .
He will threaten you as well .
Desire for revenge is another common trait that you can find in all the above - mentioned casino players .
You will not be able to see this trait in the big players at the beginning , but they will eventually show that behavior as well .
In case if you see that a person is excited about an upcoming game , you can conclude that he is dealing with an addiction to casino .
On the other hand , people who show strong emotions throughout the games are having serious problems with their addictions .
Final Words
Before you walk into a casino , you need to have a clear understanding about these types of players .
You will also fall into one of these categories .
By having that understanding , you should take control over your emotions and act with the other players .
This can provide a variety of impressive benefits to you in the long run .
Americans and Canadians rejoice as coming from nowhere , and without announcement , ( even though we broke the news on it ) is the Google Nexus One with AT&T and Rogers network support .

No subsidies on this puppy , so you will have to cough up $ 500 and change to rock the latest Google has to offer .

There will be no open cast mining on Great Barrier Island or in the Coromandel , Prime Minister John Key assured Parliament today when he came under sustained attack over Government proposals to open up some of the conservation estate 's protected land .
Labour , the Greens and the Maori Party joined forces to question Mr Key and Energy Minister Gerry Brownlee , who yesterday announced the proposals to remove 7058 hectares from the protected status of schedule four of the Crown Minerals Act .
Opposition MPs focused on the impact mining would have on tourism , concerns which Mr Key rejected .
" New Zealand 's land mass is just under 27 million hectares and maybe , at most , 7000 ha might be taken out of schedule four , " he said .
" That 's unlikely to turn back the 747s heading for New Zealand ... and if it was going to have such a disastrous impact , can someone explain why we had a record number of tourists last year while there were 82 mines operating in the conservation estate -- with 74 of those permits granted by the Labour government , " he said . "
Mr Key acknowledged none of the 82 were in schedule four land , protected because of its high conservation value .
He parried questions by asking MPs whether they thought any of the 82 mines should be closed down .
Labour leader Phil Goff wanted to know whether mining in the Coromandel and on Great Barrier Island would be the " surgical incisions "
Mr Key had previously referred to , or like the huge open cast Martha Mine at Waihi , with its 40 million tonnes of tailings .
" I can rule out any open cast mining in those areas , " Mr Key said .
He had not previously given that assurance .
Maori Party MP
Te Ururoa Flavell asked Mr Brownlee whether Ngati Rehua would have a role in the discussions about the schedule four land on Great Barrier Island .
Mr Brownlee said he had already told the Maori Party 's co-leaders , Tariana Turia and Pita Sharples , that he would personally meet Ngati Rehua representatives .
" They will have a great deal of influence on the Government 's final decisions , " he said .
Opposition to the Government 's proposals , which are open for public discussion for the next six weeks , has been steadily mounting since the announcement was made .
In other developments today :
* Mr Key said he did n't have a problem with his Auckland Central MP Nikki Kaye opposing mining on Great Barrier Island .
Ms Kaye said the argument for allowing it " does n't stack up " and she was going to try to convince her caucus colleagues of that ;
* Auckland Mayor John
Banks continued his vehement protest against mining on the island , saying it would be turned into an arid moonscape and the proposal was " stupid " ;
* National 's Coromandel MP Sandra Goudie said she was satisfied the Government was balancing economic gains against environmental responsibility and putting out a discussion document was " exactly the right thing " ;
* National 's West Coast - Tasman MP
Chris Auchinvole welcomed the proposals , which include removing 3315 ha of protected land from the Inangahua sector of Paparoa National Park on the West Coast .
" On a purely local level , any opportunity for increased wealth being generated on the West Coast has to be welcomed , " he said ;
* Auckland Regional Council chairman Mike Lee said the proposal to open part of Great Barrier Island for mining was " just an outrage " because it was an area of national and international importance .
" Mining on Great Barrier is not allowed for in the Auckland District Plan ... let 's hope the Government re-thinks what it is proposing before it is too late , " he said ;
* Labour 's tourism spokesman Kelvin Davis said 185,000 people were employed in the tourism industry , while there was only a few thousand jobs in mining and 99 percent of the profits went to overseas mining companies .
" We pride ourselves on being 100 percent pure , but targeting our most treasured land for mining is 100 percent dumb . "

Tested : A Reboot for the Immune System
The ability to reprogram the immune system is one of the most sought - after goals in medicine .
Now researchers are closer than ever to pulling it off in patients with Type 1 diabetes , one of whom happens to be our correspondent
Bruce Dickinson's BBC 6 Music rock show is to be axed and Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie 's Radio 2 show cut to three nights a week in the latest changes to the two stations .
Dickinson , the lead singer of Iron Maiden , has presented a rock show on the digital station since it launched in 2002 .
It is the first 6 Music show to be axed since the BBC announced proposals to close the station at the end of next year .
Radcliffe and Maconie 's award - winning weeknight show , which has been running on Radio 2 since 2007 , will be cut from four to three nights a week .
Their Thursday night outing will be replaced with a new live music strand , In Concert , which previously aired on Radio 1 .
The Radcliffe and Maconie Show will switch to three nights a week from 12 April .
Dickinson's 6 Music show , which currently airs on a Friday evening , will finish at the end of April .
6 Music is one of two BBC digital stations , along with the Asian Network , which will be closed following BBC director general Mark Thompson 's strategy review last week .
Radio 2 is also undergoing a transformation , having been instructed by the BBC Trust to put more speech content and social action programming in its daytime schedule and to reverse a drop among its older listeners .
Breakfast show host Chris Evans has been the target of listeners ' ire since he replaced Sir Terry Wogan .
The first official Rajar figures for Evans 's new slot will not be released until May .
A BBC spokeswoman said : " The Radcliffe and Maconie show will be broadcast three nights a week to accommodate a new two - hour show , Radio 2 In Concert , on Thursday evenings .
The show – which will have Mark and Stuart among its presenters – extends the network 's commitment to live music and features a headline concert specially recorded for Radio 2 and a round up of the week 's live music offering across the network .
" 6 Music is currently reviewing the way it reflects the rock and heavy metal genres across the network and has decided to decommission the Friday Night Rock Show .
The network , however , remains committed to reflecting both genres throughout the schedule as part of its core music offering .
We would very much like to thank Bruce Dickinson for the hard work and commitment he has shown to 6 Music over the past eight years . "
Both the Radcliffe and Maconie Show and Dickinson's 6 Music show are made by the Manchester - based independent production company Smooth Operations , which is run by John Leonard .
Part of UBC Media , it also makes Radio 2's Mike Harding Folk Show and long - running comedy Count Arthur Strong 's Radio Show on BBC Radio 4 .
" I 'm hugely disappointed but we are looking forward to other opportunities when the BBC moves [ BBC Radio 5 Live ] to Salford , " said Leonard .
Radcliffe was named music broadcaster of the year at last year 's Sony Radio Academy Awards .

Yet recent months have seen Unite members in Fujitsu staging the first ever national strikes in IT , over jobs , pay and pensions .
A group of Unite members in Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) have won union recognition and , after a one - day strike , a 2.5 percent pay rise .
PCS members in HP also struck over pay and jobs .
Union organisation has now increased across IT .
Many organisations now outsource IT work .
Mergers mean services are dominated by a few multinationals , like BT , HP , Capita , IBM , Fujitsu , Cap Gemini , Accenture , CSC , Atos Origin and Steria .
As the industry has matured there are fewer products and services built specifically by one company or for just one customer .
Competition is based more on price than functionality .
Likewise , the job skills in the industry are increasingly standardised .
Many IT workers are periodically transferred between companies as part of outsourcing contracts - staff are bought and sold like equipment and orders .
Greater price competition leads to relentless cost - cutting drives and working staff harder for less pay and benefits .
Standardisation of skills is reducing workers ' ability to resist this individually .
As jobs become less individual , less creative , less rewarding and increasingly routine , supervision intensifies .
Clocking in and out of work was scrapped decades ago , but many now have to complete " timesheets " to account for what they 've been doing .
Failure to submit timesheets leads to disciplinary action .
Many mobile engineers have tracking devices fitted in their cars and call centre staff are often monitored by the second .
Pressure on productivity and cost often leads to bullying .
Most companies use individual performance appraisals , sometimes with " forced distribution " , where managers have to award the worst scores to fixed percentages of staff no matter how well they are really doing or whether problems are genuinely their fault .
Employers try to " manage out of the business " those who score badly , through so - called " performance improvement plans " , disciplinary measures and hounding people until they quit .
Many fear their jobs will be moved to lower - wage countries , so an increasing number work on customer sites which can't be offshored .
Many spend long periods working far from home , encouraging long working hours .
As part of the job cuts at Fujitsu , the company is trying to replace engineers who travel to work with self - employed workers engaged through agencies on far lower pay .
Agencies will be keen to hire redundant engineers .
This is similar to employment widely used in construction .
Many IT staff work on a series of projects , competing in internal job markets for their next assignment .
Employees have a continuity of employment between projects , offering some employment rights and a degree of job security .
If the use of agencies and self - employment spreads it would be disastrous .
These changes are giving staff a lot to be angry about .
Attacks on the pensions of long - serving staff are shattering the trust many placed in employers .
Industrial changes are giving IT workers a lot of potential power .
Few organisations can function without IT infrastructure - networks , databases , web sites , data storage , backups , support , etc .
Much of this infrastructure is provided by the main IT companies .
To turn potential power into real power requires two extra ingredients .
Firstly , you have to be conscious of your potential power - to understand that your employer and its customers depend on you .
Secondly , you need collective organisation to use that power .
Union membership and organisation are growing rapidly and IT workers are not weighed down by decades of union retreat and defeat .
The absence of a tradition of union organisation presents problems , but also means workers can try to adopt the most effective ways of organising .
There are now several examples where IT workers have organised successful collective action .
If we make these examples better known , and achieve some more , we can have strong unions and a decent place to work , rather than becoming the latest victims of the race to the bottom .

OLOMOUC , CZECH REPUBLIC — RADIM KRALIK and his wife , Barbora Kralikova , live in a modern concrete box on top of a 1943 grain silo , a stark contrast to the neo-Gothic spires that dominate this small city about 175 miles east of Prague .
The unconventional home was inspired 30 years ago , in Communist - era Czechoslovakia , by a photo that belonged to Mr. Kralik ’s father  an image of a traditional Bavarian house set on the roof of a high - rise .
“ I was struck by the idea of putting disparate elements together , old - fashioned and modern , a crowded apartment building topped by a single home with an amazing view , ” he said , but “ I tucked away the memory of this photo in my mind and forgot about it until I saw this abandoned agricultural site . ”
Mr. Kralik , 41 , the owner of an advertising production company , bought the derelict structure 11 years ago for 300,000 koruna  what was then about $ 10,000  for his business ; the side of the silo seemed like a good spot to put a billboard , he said .
“ Then I went to the top of it and thought this would be a great place to have a house . ”

Klassrooms and Programming libattica 0.1.2 » Hot new Klassroom – Get started with KDE development Since KDE Software Compilation 4.4 we have an updated , improved and easier to use Hot New Stuff framework .
So far only a few test candidates were ported to it , namely the wallpaper dialog , Parley , Plasma comic strips and Amarok when compiled with 4.4 .
Now it ’s time to change this .
In cooperation with our forums staff , I will start a small course to let someone else do the work for me 😉
Should you participate ?
This is a great chance to learn about some of KDE ’s infrastructure and how to get the source , build it and write some small patches .
You should know some C++ already , since that ’s too much to learn in the one or two weeks of the course .
Other than that you should have a distro that provides kdelibs 4.4.0 development packages ( if there is a kdelibs 4.4 available to you , chances are you ’re good to go ) .
Oh , and you should be interested in hacking on KDE software obviously 🙂

( NaturalNews )
A large multinational research effort overseen by the World Health Organization has concluded that heavy mobile phone use significantly increases the risk of brain and salivary gland tumors .
The Interphone studies surveyed 12,800 people in 13 countries between 2000 and 2004 .
Although the final findings have not yet been released , they have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal and will see print before the end of 2009 .
The conclusions are particularly surprising given that the industry - funded effort has been widely criticized for designing its studies to minimize the apparent risks of cell phone use .
The studies examined the relationship between cell phone use and the risk of three different types of brain tumor and one tumor of the salivary gland .
They concluded that " use of mobile phones for a period of 10 years or more " was associated with a " significantly increased risk " of the tumors .
Six of eight studies found up to a 39 percent increase in the risk of glioma , the most common type of brain tumor .
Gliomas can be either benign or malignant .
The risk of acoustic neurinoma , a benign tumor of the nerve between the brain and the ear , was found to increase up to 3.9 times in two of seven studies , but problems with participants ' memories interfered with these findings .
Another study found a 50 percent increase in the risk of salivary gland tumors .
Some researchers have suggested that the Interphone study probably understates the risks of cell phone use , due to flaws in its methodology .
The study has been criticized for including people who made as little as one call per week yet excluding children and young adults ( considered the most at - risk population ) , non-cellular cordless phones ( which also emit radiation ) , several kinds of tumors , and participants who either died before the study concluded or became too sick to answer questions .
Some of the Interphone studies found that short - term cell phone use decreased the risk of cancer , further suggesting research flaws .

Stuart Wray , from the Royal School of Signals , wrote a paper for the January 2010 edition of IEEE Software Magazine entitled " How Pair Programming Really Works " .
In the paper he first brings together the various pairing approaches ( journeyman - apprentice / driver - navigator ) and identifies a common way of working :
My own experience as a developer using pair programming is that it is n’t just a technique where one person programs and the other person watches .
Both programmers work closely together , chatting the whole time , jotting down reminders of things to do , and pointing out pieces of code on the screen .
( One of the clichés of pair programming is that if you ’re doing it right , your screen should be covered with greasy finger - marks by the end of the day . )
Programmers take turns at the keyboard , usually swapping over with a phrase like , " No , let me show you what I mean . "
Building on his description of effective pair programming ( and identifying that not all implementations of pair programming are effective ) he presents four mechanisms that make effective pair programming successful .
Mechanism 1 : Pair Programmers Chat
Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike recommended explaining problems aloud , even to a stuffed toy , a practice that John Sturdy called the rubber - plant effect .
Part of pair programming ’s effectiveness is presumably due to this effect being continually triggered : as one programmer gets stuck , the back - and - forth chat serves to unstick them in the same way as solo programmers talking about their problems out loud .
He discusses the increased benefits that chatting brings about where what he calls the " expert programmer theory " applies - where the members of the pair perceive each other as knowledgeable problems are solved more effectively :
So perhaps this is how expert programmer theory really works : an expert is more likely to ask a deep question , which prompts the novel inference from the stuck programmer .
It also seems possible that merely thinking that you ’re talking to an expert - or pretending - will help the stuck programmer produce the sort of deep questions that experts have asked them in the past .
Summing up the value of chatting he states :
This first mechanism would therefore lead us to predict that programmers who chat about their programs more should be more productive and that those who pose occasional deep questions for each other should be most productive of all .
Mechanism 2 : Pair Programmers Notice More Details
" You do n’t see your own mistakes " is a truism of software development ( and many other disciplines ) .
Wray links this to theories of change blindness and inattentional blindness .
What we notice depends on what we expect to see and what we unconsciously consider salient .
So , although successful pair programmers will concentrate mostly on the same things , they might notice different things .
So , two people programming together wo n’t have the same prior knowledge or categorization : one will presumably spot some things faster and the other different things faster .
Where their rate of working is limited by the rate they can find things by just looking , two heads must be better than one .
And in fact , one of the earliest observations that people make when they start to pair program is that the person who is n’t typing code always picks up typos quicker : : Oh , you ’ve left out the comma here . "
He goes on to warn about the phenomenon of pair fatigue :
When two programmers pair together , the things they notice and fail to notice become more similar .
Eventually , the benefit from two pairs of eyes becomes negligible .
Pair Fatigue is a driver for rotating pairs regularly :
Some pair programmers regard rotation as an optional part of the practice , and on a small team , or with few programmers willing to pair , there might be little alternative .
However , pair fatigue means they ’ll ultimately be much less productive .
Mechanism 3 : Fighting Poor Practices
Peer pressure not to slip into bad practices is a clearly identified benefit of effective pair programming .
He discusses the example of " code - and - fix " programming and links it to the addictive nature of slot machine gambling :
This is the special property of interactive programming that makes it difficult to do the right thing .
With code and fix , we tinker haphazardly with our programs , effectively putting a coin into the slot machine each time we run our code .
Slot machines are known as the most addictive form of gambling , and the similarly unpredictable rewards from code - and - fix programming mean that it could be equally addictive .
Pair programmers might be less susceptible to poor practices because they can promise to write code in a particular way and ensure that each other ’s promises are kept .
The prevalence of two - people working in jobs where human fallibility is a serious problem should lead us to seriously con¬sider that pair pressure might be the solution for us , too .
Mechanism 4 : Sharing and Judging Expertise
The productivity differences between individuals are vast , measured to be at least a factor of 10 .
This often means that estimates of difficulty and time are inaccurate .
This applies to both good and bad programmers - you can only determine someone ’s programming capabilities by working closely with them .
Most programmers work on problems on their own , so no one knows how good ( or bad ) they really are .
But with pair programming , people continually work together .
Because they keep swapping pairs , everyone on the team learns who ’s the most expert at particular things .
From this comparison , they also realize their own level of expertise .
We should therefore expect more accurate estimates of time and difficulty by a pair programming team than from a solo programming team .
From my experience , this does appear to be the case .

On Meet the Press , E.J. Dionne and Orrin Hatch continue their argument that started on the op - ed pages of the Washington Post .
More on that from Steve Benen :

Sen. Orrin Hatch 's ( R - Utah ) Washington
Post op - ed on Tuesday has generated quite a bit of criticism lately , and for good reason -- it was an embarrassing mess , filled with obvious and demonstrable falsehoods .
Transcript via NBC below the fold .
MR. GREGORY : All right .
So let 's get to this whole business of reconciliation , which budget reconciliation means you , you have a separate bill here that would only need a simple majority , that would just deal with some of the spending provisions of health care .
You two , Senator Hatch and E.J. Dionne , had some words about this on the pages of The Washington Post , and let me -- Senator Hatch , let me put a portion of what you wrote about reconciliation on the screen : " This use of reconciliation to jam through this legislation , against the will of the American people , would be unprecedented in scope .
And the havoc wrought would threaten our system of checks and balances , corrode the legislative process , degrade our system of government and damage the prospects of bipartisanship . "
E.J. , your response on the pages of the Post included this : " I 'm disappointed in Hatch , co-sponsor of two of my favorite bills in recent years .
One created the State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
The other , signed last year by Obama , broadly expanded service opportunities .
Hatch worked on both with his dear friend , the late Edward M. Kennedy , after whom the service bill was named .
" It was Kennedy , you 'll recall , who insisted that health care was a `fundamental right and not a privilege . '
That 's why it 's not just legitimate to use reconciliation to complete the work on health reform .
It would be immoral to do otherwise and thereby let a phony argument about process get in the way of health coverage for 30 million Americans . "
Discuss .
SEN .
HATCH : Well , Democrats -- this is not a fight between Republicans and Democrats in a real sense , it 's between Democrats and the people out there .
Fifty - eight percent of the people are against this bill and very few are for it .
The fact of the matter is they 're going to abuse the reconciliation rules .
And let me tell you , the reconciliation rules have never been used for such sweeping social legislation like this .
This is one - sixth of the American economy .
It 's sweeping in , in effect .
There -- and , and , and there have been three sweeping social bull - - not sweeping , but social bills that have been approved through reconciliation .
One was , of course , the , the welfare reform .
That had 78 positive votes , but -- huge bipartisan vote .
Another one was the SCHIP bill , my bill with Senator Kennedy .
That had 85 votes .
The third one was college tuition , and that had , I think , something like 78 votes .
The fact of the matter is , is that it has never been done before , it 's never been used before .
To do this is just very , very dangerous .
It 's going to cause an awful lot of problems .
And in the end , in the end , you 're going to -- and let 's , let 's look at one other thing .
The Senate bill was passed .
Now , E.J. seems to accept the fact that the House bill was passed , but they 're two different bills .
Now they 're going to take the Senate bill , they say .
But if they had the votes , it would already have been voted on .
They do n't have the votes .
So I suspect they 're going to manipulate the rules even further in ways that were never contemplated in order to get this dog through ...
MR. GREGORY : E.J ....
SEN . HATCH : ... this 2700 - page -- 2711 - page dog .
MR. DIONNE : Where to begin ?
First of all , I find it astonishing that so many Republicans who , when President Bush surged troops into Iraq against the polls , said , " This is a courageous act . "
And when President Obama tries to push a healthcare bill against the polls , " This is a terrible thing . "
This is not a consistent argument .
Several points .
First , the health bill that with -- President Obama will sign got 60 votes in the Senate , because that 's the bill the House would pass .
The only thing that 's being talked about here are amendments that would be passed through reconciliation dealing with money , which is in the tradition of reconciliation .
Second , Senator
Hatch keeps saying this is unprecedented in scope and that , you know ...
SEN .
HATCH : It is .
MR. DIONNE : ... you need bipartisan support .
There 's a big chart in New York Times today put together by Tom Mann of Brookings , Norm Ornstein , and their colleagues .
In the -- there are seven instances where reconciliation was used in cases where the bill got less -- fewer than 60 votes , five of those were done by Republican Senates .
And I did n't hear Senator Hatch complain about that .
Two of those involved President Bush 's tax cuts , which added $ 1.7 trillion to our deficit .
SEN .
HATCH : It never ...
MR. DIONNE : Now , if that is n't significant policy change , I do n't know what is .
SEN .
HATCH : And if ever ...
MR . DIONNE : And there was no complaint about that .
So is Senator Hatch saying it 's OK to use reconciliation to pass tax cuts for the wealthy , but it 's just terrible to use it if you 're going to extend healthcare coverage ?
I say let 's not talk about a phony process argument , let 's talk about the problems people have with health care .
If he wants to argue about health care ...
MR. GREGORY : All right .
Quick response , Senator , and then let me get the others in on this .
SEN .
HATCH : In every case except two they were -- they , they had bipartisan votes .
In two of them - - in 1993 , Clinton 's bill , yeah , they got a reconciliation bill on a purely partisan vote that Congress changed to Republicans .
The Republicans did the same thing in I think it was 2005 , got a bill through just on a totally partisan vote , and it changed to Democrats .
The fact of the matter is you can 't ...
MR . DIONNE : Are you talking about bipartisanship or you talking about reconciliation ?
SEN .
HATCH : You can 't -- no , wait , wait , wait .
You can 't ...
MR. DIONNE : These were reconciliation bills ...
SEN .
HATCH : That was reconciliation .
MR. DIONNE : ... that picked up one or two Democrats .
SEN .
HATCH : You cannot ignore the fact that we 're talking about the first time in history , sweeping social legislation will be passed , if they get their way , by a totally partisan vote .
One - sixth of the American economy .
If we do that , Katy bar the door , I got to tell you .
MR . DIONNE : If the Republican Party were not sitting there being obstructionist -- what Senator Hatch is saying is , if Republicans unite and say , " We wo n't vote for this , " and you need bipartisanship , he 's saying Democrats can't govern .
And if $ 1.7 trillion ...
SEN .
HATCH : Well , they can't .
MR. DIONNE : ... in tax cuts is n't significant , I do n't know what is .

Is there a licensed psycho- therapist in the NY area willing to go to Fox News Headquarters in Manhattan and stage an intervention for Glenn Beck ?
I really think he 's lost his mind .
It 's not even funny anymore ; this is a man whose brain has clearly snapped .
Reeling from his epic fail on getting Eric Massa to divulge details on the evils in the White House , Beck launched full on into his proof that the " Mao- lovers " in the White House are grasping for unprecedented power grabs due to the designation of protected lands in the west .
( Apparently caring about the environment is Stalinist .
Right , Jim DeMint ? )
And his proof that this is the White House Maoist / communist agenda ?
The " hidden " messages in that communist Woody Guthrie 's classic ( and 70 year old ) song " This Land Is Your Land " .
And somehow this land grab is because fish are more important than people and you 're too stupid to understand that you have no right to health care .
No , seriously :
Here 's the latest land grab and we only know this because of a memo that was leaked :
The Obama administration is pursuing 13 million acres through 11 states in the West in the name of " national monuments . "
Maybe we 'll get one of Chairman Mao ?
How about Stalin ?
He was good at controlling the lands , I hear .
And they are doing this without telling anyone .
It 's executive order .
They do n't care about what you think about it .
Here 's another one :
Do you like to fish ?
Well , enjoy it while you can because it looks like special interests once again are trumping common sense and the voice of the people .
A new report says it 's a move to appease environmental groups and , just like before , without the consent of the people and by executive order .
We told you he would do this .
Heck ,
The New York Times said he'd do it .
The report claims that Obama will " no longer listen to the public " as he tries to prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing on some of the nation 's oceans , coastal areas , Great Lakes and even some inland waters .
So , because a couple of environmentalists want to save the fish , people could lose rights .
Do you remember the song , " This Land Is Your Land " ?
Here are the last couple of verses :
As I went walking I saw a sign there
And on the sign it said " No Trespassing . "
But on the other side it did n't say nothing ,
That side was made for you and me .
In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people ,
By the relief office I seen my people ;
As they stood there hungry , I stood there asking
Is this land made for you and me ?
The song was originally written in 1940 , by the way , by Woody Guthrie — communist .
It 's a song about a progressive utopia land with no ownership of property .
Because some have it and some do n't .
And we all think of this as an American song .
The song goes to indoctrination , but that 's another story — land grabs are where we are at .
It 's grab all the rights you can .
Health care — the Soviets used to call it maintenance .
It sounds so tender , so loving that way , does n't it ?
I can almost picture the caring hospitals in the Soviet Union , where they perform " maintenance " on the human body .
It 's like a Jiffy Lube for people .
Thebackward spin of a number of black holes could create mysterious jets of plasmathat control the fate of galaxies , scientists now suggest .
Atthe heart of galaxies , astronomers have routinely detected what seem to besupermassive black holes millions to billions of times the mass of our sun .
Roughly a hundredth of these giants spew out jets of plasma that extend out inopposite directions .
Thesejets control how stars and other bodies form by injecting huge amounts ofenergy into the universe , playing a crucial role in the evolution of clustersof galaxies , the largeststructures in the universe .
However , it remains a mystery as to how thesejets form .
Toinvestigate the origin of these powerful jets , scientists compared severaldozen galaxies whose super - massive black holes spit jets to other galaxieswhose black holes do n't .
All these black holes featured accretion disks ? clumps of gas and dust whirling into the maws of these dark objects .
Scientistshave long known that blackholes spin .
Relyingon data collected by a Japanese space telescope dubbed Suzaku , researchersfound that jets might form right outside black holes that spin in the oppositedirection from their accretion disks .
Such retrograde spin could warpspace - time in a way that forces the innermost portions of accretion disksoutward , leading to " a piling of magnetic fields that provides the forceto fuel a jet , " said researcher Dan Evans at MIT ?s Kavli Institute forAstrophysics and Space Research .
Thescientists looked at light from the super - hot coronas of accretion disks , madeof plasma heated by magnetic fields that lies above and below the disks , sandwiching them .
These coronas generate copious amounts of X - rays that Suzakucan detect .
Afraction of light from the coronas reflects off the accretion disks , resultingin a distinct pattern called the Compton reflection hump .
The majority of acorona 's X - ray emissions should come from near the black hole , where matterfrom the accretion disk is falling into the black hole fastest and hottest .
Assuch , the Compton reflection hump should also be most prominent there .
However , jet- emitting black holes did n't have the Compton reflection hump .
This suggeststheir accretion disks had no inner regions near the black holes to reflectlight from the corona .
Thisgap in that black hole 's accretion disk could result from a backward whirl .
Supercomputermodels suggest that when galaxiescollide , the merging of super - massive black holes can give the resultinggiants a decent amount of spin , and depending on the dynamics of that merger ?
for instance , if galaxies of different sizes collide ? a retrograde black holecould result .
Spinningblack holes drag space - time around them , and a retrograde spin would push outthe orbit of the innermost portion of a black hole 's accretion disk .
" DavidGarofalo , a generalrelativity specialist in our collaboration , has a way to describethis , " Evans said .
" Picture trying to get as close to the edge of aceiling fan with a pencil in your hand without hitting the fan .
It 's mucheasier to get close if you 're co-rotating with the fan , moving the samedirection as it , as the fan creates a sucking effect .
If you 're moving in theopposite direction , counter - rotating with the spin of that fan , the air iseffectively pushed out at you , generating an opposing force , and you get muchfurther from that fan .
The same thing happens with spinning black holes , wherethe force you feel is roughly analogous to the wind . "
Inthe future , Evans said NASA 's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array ( NuSTAR ) , asatellite planned for launch in 2011 , may help astronomers solve this blackhole mystery , being 10 to 50 times more sensitive that current technology .
Thescientists detailed their findings in the Feb. 10 issue of the AstrophysicalJournal .
This weekend , Albert Gonzalez , the most prolific commercial hacker in history , is beginning a 20 - year jail sentence .
Thus comes to an end a saga of crime , greed , and deft keyboard work that brought him a life high on the hog with a supercar and condo , his lady friends some fancy jewellery , and much grief to the millions of people whose credit card details he plundered .
No one – least of all Gonzalez – knows how many card holders were affected , but the most cautious estimates put the total in the tens of millions .
Gonzalez , as these numbers suggest , was no acned amateur , hacking companies ' records for the thrill of it .
He was young – still only 28 – but so good at penetrating supposedly secure networks that at one time he was hired by US intelligence to trace other hackers .
His obsession with computers began in childhood : while still in a Florida high school he was questioned by the FBI after breaking into an Indian government website .
In 2003 , Gonzalez ( whose father came to the US from Cuba on a homemade raft in the 1970s ) was arrested for hacking .
He was not charged and agreed to become a government informant .
Yet even while he was performing this public service , he was penetrating the networks of major companies such as the clothing retailer TJ Maxx , supermarket 7 - Eleven and Barnes & Noble bookshop , and stealing credit card details .
Using the aliases " segvec " , " soupnazi " , and " j4 juar 17 " , he led a group of professional identity thieves in the US , Ukraine and Russia who made money by selling card data on the black market and taking " bundles of money " out of cash machines .
One of his team 's principal techniques was " wardriving " , in which he and two partners would cruise in a car past shops , and use a laptop to detect stores with vulnerable wireless internet signals .
The trio would then install " sniffer programmes " to hoover up details of the cards and their owners and sell them on .
By 2008 , Gonzalez had 40 million credit card details on his servers .
His share of the proceeds was an estimated $ 2.8 m ( £ 1.9 m ) , which he used to buy an apartment in Miami , a blue BMW , Rolex watches for his father and friends , a Tiffany ring for a girlfriend , and to stage a $ 75,000 birthday party .
At one time , court documents revealed , he was rather put out when his money - counter malfunctioned and he had to count out $ 340,000 in $ 20 notes by hand .
Such a chore .
His run came to an end in May 2008 , when police raided the room at the lavish National Hotel , Miami Beach , where Gonzalez and girlfriend were staying .
Among his possessions in Room 1508 were two computers , $ 22,000 in cash and a Glock 9 mm handgun .
Later , around $ 1.1 m was found buried in his parents ' Florida back garden .
He pleaded guilty in trials late last year and was sentenced at hearings on Thursday and Friday .
His two confederates – known as " Hacker 1 " and " Hacker2 " – remain at large .
Gonzalez 's defence team claimed that their client showed behaviour " consistent with Asperger 's syndrome , a form of autism " , but the courts in Florida and Boston still gave him two concurrent 20 - year terms , the stiffest sentence ever recorded for a hacker .
Their decision bodes ill for the British hacker Gary McKinnon , who is accused of penetrating Nasa computers , and whose extradition to the US will be judicially reviewed in May .

How inflatable spacecraft could be cheaper and safer than conventional metal craft
Gallery : Build your own space station
This 9 - metre - diameter ring is an inflatable space station built by tyre manufacturer Goodyear in 1961 .
Prototypes of the design were made but none were ever flown .
It was in theory big enough to house two people ( Image : NASA ) The Genesis 1 module was lifted into orbit on a retired Russian SS18 nuclear missile in 2006 .
It expanded to 3 metres in length by 2 metres in diameter , demonstrating that a craft could be inflated in orbit and maintain its shape through air pressure alone ( Image : Bigelow Aerospace )
Expandable spacecraft could be placed on the lunar surface ( Image : Bigelow Aerospace ) Advertisement
NASA is planning to investigate making inflatable space - station modules to make roomier , lighter , cheaper - to - launch spacecraft , it reveals in its budget proposal released on 22 February .
We look into the technologies involved .
What are the attractions of inflatable spacecraft ?
The weight of material that must be boosted to orbit is the major contributor to a space mission ’s cost , due to the expense of sending anything into Earth orbit .
Folded fabric packages that inflate , concertina style , to full size once in orbit offer more spacecraft volume for a given launch mass than a traditional metal - based unit .
Where did the idea come from ?
NASA engineers came up with the idea in the early 1960s , and tire manufacturer Goodyear was even commissioned to build prototypes , which initially looked much like giant rubber inner tubes ( see image , right ) .
The idea was developed up until the 1990s , when development of an inflatable living quarters unit for the nascent International Space Station ( ISS ) , called TransHab , was scrapped due to budget constraints .
The relevant NASA patents were then licensed to a commercial start up , Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas , Nevada .
See a video interview with a Bigelow engineer above .
How has Bigelow developed the idea ?
The firm ’s team of 100 space - flight and aerospace engineers has developed a whole family of what it calls “ expandable ” spacecraft and has even tested some uncrewed versions in orbit .
The small 3 - metre-long , 2 - metre - diameter Genesis I and Genesis II test craft were launched in 2006 and 2007 on decommissioned former Russian SS18 nuclear missiles .
Both expanded in orbit successfully and maintained pressure well enough to make a full size module habitable .
A 180 - cubic - metre version called Sundancer is now being assembled , with a 330 - cubic - metre version in planning .
How are the modules inflated ?
Bigelow modules are made from flexible , airtight fabric .
Once in orbit tanks of nitrogen and oxygen release a breathable mix inside , expanding the structure by 40 per cent as the gas inside pushes the skin outwards into the vacuum of space .
The structure ’s diameter expands but its length does not change .
Air pressure of just 1 atmosphere is needed to expand a module .
This is all that astronauts moving in will need to breathe .
What about punctures ?
Bigelow ’s craft are made from multiple layers of Vectran , a double - strength variant of Kevlar , the tough polymer used to make bulletproof vests .
This is coated with an outer layer of the conventional Micro Meteorite Orbital Debris ( MMOD ) shielding seen on most spacecraft – essentially metallic foil .
Bigelow Aerospace says that in tests , simulated micrometeoroids that completely punctured samples of ISS skin penetrated only halfway through the skin of an expandable .
“ It ’s absolutely not like a balloon that ’s going to pop .
It provides better than ISS - safety levels , ” insists the firm ’s operations director , Mike Gold .
“ If a leak were to occur , you would have 24 hours or more to identify and patch it before there was any impact on the module ’s structural integrity , ” says Gold .
Traditional metallic structures would not provide such time , he adds , because shattering around a puncture makes for more serious damage .
What is NASA ’s plan for inflatables ?
The agency is considering connecting a Bigelow expandable craft to the ISS to verify their safety by testing life support , radiation shielding , thermal control and communications capabilities .
How long before we can expect a crew to move into an inflatable space station module ?
That ’s the big unknown .
The US will not be able to be take astronauts into orbit on its own vehicles for some years once the space shuttle is retired this year .
If the US Congress agrees with NASA ’s proposal to cancel the troubled Constellation programme then the agency will be forced to invest more in its commercial crew development initiative , which aims to stimulate private firms to develop crewed spacecraft .
Bigelow is already working with Boeing to develop crew capsules for future launchers as part of that programme .
“ Everything depends on the availability of commercial crew transportation , ” says Gold .

A newly discovered gas - giant planet with a nearly circular orbit around its parent star is the first Jupiter - like planet outside our solar system — or " exoplanet " — that can be studied in detail , a new study says .
Located about 1,500 light - years from Earth in the constellation Serpens , the planet Corot - 9 b passes in front of its star every 95 days , as viewed from Earth .
Each of these " transits " lasts about eight hours .
When Corot - 9b is positioned between its star and Earth , some of the light from its star passes through the exoplanet 's atmosphere before continuing on to our planet .
By studying this filtered starlight , astronomers may be able to determine what molecules make up Corot - 9b 's atmosphere .
If that 's the case , Corot - 9b could become a " Rosetta stone " for exoplanet research , said study co-author Claire Moutou of the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseilles in France , referring to the artifact that helped decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics .
" We hope that when we can investigate this planet , it will have characteristics which are close to other giant gas planets outside our solar system , " Moutou said .
That 's because Corot - 9b 's physical properties are thought to be representative of many gas giant exoplanets in our galaxy .
So studying Corot - 9b in detail could shed light on worlds that do not transit , and thus are impossible for astronomers to research .
New Planet Similar to Jupiter and Saturn
The filtered - sunlight technique has been used to study the atmospheric compositions of other gas exoplanets with great success .
However , those planets orbit much closer to their stars than Corot - 9 b and are thus much hotter .
As a result , these " hot Jupiters " are not thought to be good analogs for low - and moderate - temperature gas giants , which astronomers think make up a large bulk of exoplanets .
( Get more facts about the universe . )
In contrast , the distance between Corot - 9 b and its star is about ten times greater than that of hot Jupiter systems .
Its surface temperature is estimated to be between - 4 degrees and 320 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 20 degrees and 160 degrees Celsius ) .
While no one has seen Corot - 9 b up close yet , Moutou imagines it looks very similar to the gas giants in our own solar system .
For instance , Corot - 9b is probably a gaseous , cloudy planet like Jupiter with lots of moons and rings like Saturn , she said .
Sadiq Khan made the expenses claims in 2005 and 2006 Transport Minister Sadiq Khan has paid back more than £ 2,500 he wrongly claimed in Commons expenses for greetings cards .
It follows a complaint from a local resident in Mr Khan 's Tooting constituency in south London .
Parliamentary standards commissioner John Lyon said the MP had accepted he should not have claimed for the expenses and agreed to return £ 2,551 .
The claims were for 18th birthday , Eid and Diwali cards , from 2005 and 2006 .
Details of Mr Lyon 's response were released by the Tory candidate for the Tooting seat , Mark Clarke .
In his letter to the complainant , released by Mr Clarke , Mr Lyon stated : " Mr Khan has readily accepted that he was in breach of the rules of the House in the claims he made for the 18th birthday and Eid and Diwali cards . "
' Accepted responsibility ' Mr Lyon added : " Given the passage of time , Mr Khan is not able to recall how these mistakes occurred .
He has pointed out that he was a new Member of Parliament at the time and that all of his staff were new .
" He has said that it is possible that neither he nor his staff checked the relevant rules or consulted the House authorities .
Mr Khan has accepted responsibility for these errors and has apologised . "
In his letter , Mr Lyon said Mr Khan had submitted one claim in December 2005 for £ 1,051.34 for 1,500 18th birthday cards , which was initially turned down by the House authorities .
The following month , however , it was paid following the presentation of a fresh invoice , " although the company sending the invoice did not identify it as being for greeting cards " .
Mr Lyon said that he would be reporting what happened to the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee and now regarded the matter as closed .

The Tea Party Goes After Ron Paul
Created : February 08 , 2010 12:50 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
His son Rand ’s campaign for Senate in Kentucky is going better than anyone could have expected — every Kentuckian I met at the National Tea Party Convention backed him — but Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) is drawing three primary opponents for his own re-election bid .
Ironically , all three are from the Tea Party movement , which , as reporter Tom Benning points out , would be hard to imagine without the energy stirred up by Paul ’s 2008 presidential bid .
Tea Party associations aside , many of the challengers ’ criticisms echo concerns of Paul ’s past opponents : that he is too focused on his national ambitions ; that his views are too extreme ; that he does n’t support the wars in Iraqand Afghanistan ; that he votes “ no ” on everything , including federal aid for his district after Hurricane Ike .
“ The word I keep hearing is ‘ ineffective , ’ ” said [ challenger John ] Gay , a school business administrator .
“ This district is not really being represented as it could be . ”
The criticism is , to say the least , ironic .
Almost nothing that Paul does cuts against the rhetoric of the Tea Party movement that is mentioned most in the press : responsible spending and adherence to the Constitution .
But some of it does cut against the priorities of national security conservatives and partisan Republicans .
There is one thing Paul does that might backfire .
While Paul votes against basically all spending bills , he notoriously gets earmark requests into those bills , so that local projects survive when other members vote those bills through .
That barely dinged Paul in 2008 , but it may become an issue now .
A Palestinian official said on Monday Israel has lifted a ban on shoes and clothes to the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip .
Adding more items to the products allowed into Gaza was apparently a result of U.S. pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , local analysts said .
Currently , crossing points between Gaza and Israel are closed until the end of this week due to the week - long Jewish Passover holidays .
When they reopen , Gaza merchants can import clothes and shoes , said Ra'd Fatouh , an official with the ministry of economy .
He told Xinhua that the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) and international relief organizations demanded Israel relax its sanctions that have been imposed on Gaza for nearly three years .
Generally , Israel lets little more than basic food and medical supplies into Gaza since Islamic Hamas movement seized control of the coastal enclave in June 2007 .
Fatouh said the Palestinians have sent a list of 33 items of products to Israel for exclusion from sanctions , " but the Israeli side is studying and estimating every item very slowly before accepting it . "
These items mainly include construction materials and household items .
Before the blockade took effect , an average of 400 truckloads of supplies used to get into Gaza on a daily basis .
Now , it rarely exceeds 80 trucks irregularly , according to the Palestinians .
The shoes and clothes will enter Gaza in six to 10 trucks everyday through Kerem Shalom crossing , one of the three commercial terminals between Gaza and Israel , Fatouh said .
Recently , a discord emerged between Israel and the United States over plans to expand Jewish settlements in disputed East Jerusalem .
Israeli prime minister Netanyahu , who was in Washington last week , reportedly pledged to make confidence - building measures with the Palestinians , including releasing prisoners and relaxing the closure on Gaza .
Meanwhile , Israeli army penetrated for a few hundreds of meters in southeast Gaza Strip and levelled fields to the east of Khan Younis town , witnesses said .
The Israeli force , made up of tanks and bulldozers , withdrew before noon , according to the witnesses .
The area had witnesses fierce fighting on Friday when Palestinian militants killed two Israeli soldiers in the worst clashes for Israel since the end of Gaza war in early 2009 .

A group of quilters in the chemistry department thought it would be a good idea to make a quilt of the periodic table .
It was to be group project and involve everyone , even those that could n't sew with the hopes that a sense of community would emerge .
The leaders of the project were Marcy Tracey ( Chemistry NMR Technician ) and Shirley Black ( Chemistry Lab Instructor ) .
They determined what fabrics to use and cut the required blocks for each element .
A simple method of cut and paste using a product known as Wonder Under was used for the letters and numbers and , in a lot of cases , for any pictures as well .
A standard set of numbers and letters were used by everyone to give the quilt some continuity ; other than that , there were no restrictions on what could be done with the block .
Some chose to do a piece of art while others wanted a design that reflected the use of the element .
This whole process took a lot longer than anyone anticipated , but eventually all of the blocks were collected .
There were still some missing so the steering committee went to work to complete any missing blocks .
Shirley Black took on the task of sewing the quilt together .
Some of the chemistry quilt steering committee members are pictured above .
From left - to - right : Lee Hanlan , Sophie Lavieri , Shirley Black , Marcy Tracey and Sharon Hope .
The almost completed quilt is on the floor .
Citibank ( NYSE : C ) and J.P. Morgan Chase ( NYSE : C ) , two of the nation ’s largest credit issuers , are largely sidestepping the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act passed by Congress last May by changing fee structures and adding new “ gotcha ’s ” to their credit card products .
One of the primary aims of the Credit Card Act was to reign in some of the high fees charged by Citibank , Chase , Bank of America and other credit card issuers .
Congress attempted to rein - in fees by requiring a 45 day notice to customers of fee and interest rate changes , preventing automatic over - the - limit approval of transactions , and adding caps to high - fee credit cards .
Banks are also now prevented from charging customers a fee to make payments over the phone .
The natural reaction from Chase and Citibank was to raise fees in other areas to make up for the lost revenue that they were regulated out of collecting .
Both companies are now charging many of their customers an annual fee to have a credit card account .
Chase is forcing some of their customers to choose between keeping their existing card and paying a $ 30.00 annual account fee or switching to a new card with a paltry rewards program .
Citibank started testing the waters with its customers last fall to see how much of an annual fee that the bank could charge customers without having a large percentage of them cancel their accounts .
Citibank appears to have been happy with the results of their trial annual - fees as the company has announced that many of its customers , even those with great credit , will be charged a new annual fee of $ 60.00 starting in April if they do not spend more than $ 2,400 a year on their cards .
Both companies have also raised their fees for balance transfers .
Before the most recent set of regulations from the Credit Card Act came into effect last week , the industry standard fee for a balance transfer was about 3 % .
Since then , both Chase and Citibank have increased the balance transfer fee to between 4 % and 5 % depending on the account that the customer has .
Congress ’s attempt to reform the credit card industry was well intended to help give customers a fairer playing field when dealing with credit card companies , but Citibank and Chase naturally took the path of least resistance by raising other fees to maintain their previous levels of revenue .
Molecular secrets of the “ iron - plated snail ”
Life is n’t easy for the “ scaly - foot gastropod ” .
This humble snail lives in hydrothermal vent fields two miles deep in the Indian ocean , and is surrounded by vicious predators .
For example , there ’s the “ cone snail ” , which stabs at its victims with a harpoon - style tooth as a precursor to injecting them with paralyzing venom .
Then there ’s the Brachyuran crab , which has been known to squeeze its prey for three days in an attempt to kill it .
Yowsa .
Ah , but the scaly - foot gastropod has its own tricks .
To fight back , it long ago evolved a particularly cool defense structure :
It takes the grains of iron sulfide floating in the water around it and incorporates it into the outer layer of its shell .
It it thus an “ iron - plated snail ” .
Oh yes way .
Scientists discovered Crysomallon squamiferum in 1999 , but they did n’t know a whole lot about the properties of its shell until this month , when a team led by MIT scientists decided to study it carefully .
The team did a pile of spectroscopic and microscopic measurements of the shell , poked at it with a nanoindentor , and built a computer model of its properties to simulate how well it would hold up under various predator attacks .
The upshot , as they write in their paper ( PDF here ) , is that the shell is “ unlike any other known natural or synthetic engineered armor . ”
Part of its ability to resist damage seems to be the way the shell deforms when it ’s struck :
It produces cracks that dissipate the force of the blow , and nanoparticles that injure whatever is attacking it :
Within the indent region , consolidation of the granular structure is observed within and around the indent .
Localized microfractures exhibit tortuous , branched , and noncontinuous pathways , as well as jagged crack fronts resulting from separation of granules , all of which are beneficial for energy dissipation and preventing catastrophic brittle fracture .
Such microfracture modes may serve as a sacrificial mechanism .
Upon indentation , inelastic deformation will be localized in the softer organic material between the granule interfaces , which allows for intergranular displacement and friction while simultaneously being compressed down into the softer ML .
Shear of iron sulfide nanoparticles against the indenter surface is expected , in particular since penetrating attacks take place off - angle rather than directly on top of the shell apex , and can be facilitated by intergranular displacements during yielding of the OL .
This provides a potential grinding abrasion and wear mechanism to deform and blunt the indenter ( since biological penetrating threats are in reality deformable as well ) that will continue throughout the entire indentation process .
Beyond awesome .
This is Darwinian evolution mixed with , like , Burning Man .
Being scientists of biomimicry , the authors surmise that if it were possible to reverse - engineer the entire shell — it ’s not just the outer iron layer that ’s cool ; there are also two inner layers with gooey nougat that are equally important in defending the snail — they could produce superstrong materials for military defense and “ load - bearing ” .
Fair enough .
But personally I ’m satisfied just to have more pure science that proves , yet again , the inexhaustible Weirdness Of The Briny Deep .
Iron snails , people !
Iron snails .

Larry Summers continues to refuse comment on his disastrous management of Harvard University ’s finances , according to a lengthy Bloomberg article out Friday ( aptly titled “ Harvard swaps are so toxic even Summers wo n’t explain ” ) .
The former Harvard president ’s failed bets on interest rates led to a historic liquidity crisis last fall that forced the school to take on an additional $ 2.5 billion in debt and implement campus - wide austerity measures .*
Kudos to the Bloomberg reporters for continuing to chase this story ( which carries national implications given Summers ’s role in the White House ) .
One aspect of the story that has yet to break : Harvard ’s leadership , including key members of its financial team , were severely conflicted by official roles with several of the university ’s counterparties on the swaps .
The Bloomberg story notes that Harvard ’s biggest counterparty on the swaps was JP Morgan , and mentions that the bank ’s CEO , Jamie Dimon , is a graduate of Harvard Business School .
New York Magazine has a light - hearted take on his treatment of Harvard , as debt collector and alum .
But both articles fail to mention that Dimon is also a trustee of Harvard Business School ( according to his March 2009 JP Morgan bio ) .
So Dimon held leadership positions in two institutions which were involved in a high - stakes negotiation that resulted in a massive payout for one of those institutions .
But Dimon ’s apparent conflict pales in comparison to the conflicts surrounding Goldman Sachs , another large counterparty to Harvard on Summers ’s failed swaps .
As a trustee of HBS , Dimon would n’t necessarily have his hands directly in Harvard ’s finances .
Goldman Sachs executives did , however .
No press outlet has yet reported an unsettling fact : Robert Kaplan , the interim head of Harvard Management Company from November 2007 to June 2008 , has been a senior director at Goldman Sachs since 2006 .
He continues to serve on the board of HMC , and was in this position of oversight when Harvard entered negotiations with its counterparties .
He is currently a professor at Harvard Business School , as well .
Kaplan replaced former HMC chief Mohamed El - Erian , who was reportedly “ having a heart attack ” over investment decisions made by Summers .
Furthermore , Harvard ’s first - ever executive vice president , Edward Forst , was Goldman ’s head of investment management before joining Harvard in September 2008 , just weeks before the crisis hit .
He was also an HMC board member .
Forst re-joined Goldman as a “ senior strategy executive ” after less than a year at Harvard , but continues to serve on the university ’s newly - formed financial management committee .
Forst played a prominent role in managing Harvard ’s response to the financial crisis , according to a Harvard Magazine article on his departure :
The announcement [ of Forst ’s departure ] comes after Forst had played an important role in leading Harvard ’s response to the international credit - market crisis and recession — for example , the planning that culminated in the University placing $ 2.5 billion in new debt offerings last December , to reduce liquidity risk and protect the institution ’s financial flexibility in straitened circumstances ; and directing efforts to consolidate operations and trim administrative expenses .
Did Forst and Kaplan recuse themselves from negotiations with Goldman Sachs ?
If not , they were negotiating on behalf of Harvard with a counterparty in which they likely had substantial financial stakes .
The potential conflicts of interest here are astounding .
Perhaps that ’s why these negotiations turned out so badly for Harvard .
The Bloomberg article reports that Dartmouth had similar swaps , but “ did n’t post collateral on their swaps because their investment banks agreed to waive the requirement to win the business , according to a person familiar with the contracts . ”
It seems Kaplan , Forst , et al saw no need to use this kind of bargaining chip against their lifelong employer .
Harvard also exited the swaps at exactly the wrong time — at the moment when it was most expensive to do so .
Meaning that the timing was perfect for JP Morgan , Goldman Sachs , and the other counterparties , which were in the midst of a historic financial crisis and desperately needed the cash .
Even Summers was potentially conflicted during his tenure as president .
He consulted for a hedge fund , Taconic Capital , from 2004 to 2006 , while he was serving as president and making aggressive , misguided investment decisions in that role .
Taconic is run by two former Goldman Sachs partners , Frank Brosens and Ken Brody .
Harvard Corporation member and former Goldman partner Robert Rubin is also an adviser to Taconic .
Summers ’s consulting relationship was mentioned in passing in a New York Times article .
Despite concerns from prominent Harvard alumni , the university has released no information on the nature of Summers ’s work for Taconic , or his compensation as a consultant there .
Did Harvard invest with Taconic ?
Was Summers abiding by the university ’s own conflict of interest policy ?
There are many unanswered questions here .
Other news organizations would do well to join Bloomberg in devoting significant resources to this story .
After all , there is big upside in being a counterparty to Harvard and Summers .
* Full disclosure : I went to college there .
Update :
My original post stated that Forst still serves on HMC ’s board ; he continues to serve on Harvard ’s newly - formed Financial Management Committee , but resigned HMC ’s board when he left the university .
The above post has been updated to reflect this correction .
UCI criminologist George Tita and colleagues use math models to explain urban crime and predict the efficacy of police intervention .
Photo : Steve Zylius
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Why are some neighborhoods plagued by break - ins while others nearby are relatively unscathed ?
Why do drug dealers hang out on that corner ?
And why is police intervention effective in some cases but not others ?
For answers , researchers turned to math .
Using a decade of data from the Los Angeles Police Department , UC Irvine criminologist George Tita and colleagues developed a mathematical model of how urban crime hot spots form and spread .
It reveals two distinct types of areas that respond differently to suppression tactics .
Illegal activity follows a discernible pattern , Tita says : “ Criminals forage for opportunities to commit crimes , much like bees search for pollen or butterflies for nectar .
Foraging patterns are predictable , whether you study human or insect behavior . ”
Among other variables , the model factors in the location of crime targets - such as homes , cars and people - and the chance of getting caught , based on police presence , environmental cues and information offenders may have gleaned from previous crimes .
Researchers identified two main kinds of hotspots : supercritical and subcritical .
The first are formed when small spikes in such crimes as residential burglary and auto theft build up , creating a local crime wave .
In the second , a large spike in crime - often drug - related - draws offenders to a central site .
Law enforcement efforts in the two types of hotspots have very different outcomes , the study found .
“ Stepped - up policing will stop crime in a subcritical area , but police involvement in a supercritical area will simply shift crime to surrounding neighborhoods , ” says Tita , associate professor of criminology , law & society .
Tita worked with UCLA associate professor of anthropology Jeffrey Brantingham along with Andrea Bertozzi and Martin Short of UCLA ’s mathematics department on the study , which was supported by the National Science Foundation .
The findings , published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , could help law enforcement agencies adopt more effective crime prevention strategies and tailor their approach to concentrated criminal activity .
The team , now investigating whether the model can be applied to crime worldwide , has received funding from the Office of Naval Research to see if it can shed light on insurgent groups in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Such collaboration among criminologists , anthropologists and mathematicians may be key to preventing illegal behavior , Tita says .
“ Crime is a function of a motivated offender , a suitable victim and the absence of governance , ” he says .
“ Criminals follow patterns just like everyone else in their daily lives . ”

An Austrian priest avoids mention of Pope Benedict XVI in his Masses .
A Philadelphia woman stops going to confession , saying she now sees priests as more flawed than herself .
British protesters call for the pontiff to resign .
As the faithful fill churches this Holy Week , many Roman Catholics around the world are finding their relationship to the church painfully tested by new revelations of clerical abuse and suggestions Benedict himself may have helped cover up cases in Germany and the U.S .
There are fears that for those whose commitment is already wavering , the scandal could be the final blow , and a growing chorus is clamoring for the church to embrace full transparency , take a hard line against pedophiles , and reconsider the rule of priestly celibacy .
" There 's too many victims , and too much lying from the church about what really happened , " said Martin Sherlock , a Catholic newspaper vendor in Dublin , Ireland .
Experts say the church is facing a crisis of historic proportions .
" This is the type of problem that arises really once in a century , I think , and it might even be more significant , " said Paul Collins , an Australian church historian and former priest .
Collins , 69 , said the abuse controversy was not mentioned by the priest in his own church near Canberra on Palm Sunday , but that the congregation discussed it afterward outside .
" People are outraged really , they 're furious with the complete failure of the church 's leadership and their view would be that we are led by incompetent people , " Collins said .
That view was echoed by many Catholics interviewed around the world by The Associated Press in recent days , although the pope also had defenders .
One of them was John Ryan , a retired glue factory worker , who said he was impressed by the letter Benedict wrote to the Irish faithful last week in which he chastised Irish bishops .
" I was talking to my parish priest last weekend , and we were reading the pope 's letter , and he told me :
This pope is the most intelligent pope we 've had in the last thousand years , " said Ryan , 66 , after a Mass in Dublin .
" I could n't disagree with that .
I do n't really think we could do better than with Benedict .
I know they 're supposed to be infallible , but I 'd say most Catholics today would accept that nobody 's perfect — not even the pope . "
In staunchly Catholic Poland , the homeland of the late Pope John Paul II and a place where churches are packed even on work days , the top church authority called the pope the target of an " unprecedented media attack . "
Allegations that Benedict concealed abuse " are totally groundless and it is hard to understand them in any other way than as a direct attack on the person and dignity of the pope , " Henryk Muszynski , the Primate of Poland and Archbishop of Gniezno , said Sunday .
But across the Atlantic , Jasmine Co said her faith in the church was badly shaken .
The 56 - year - old nurse , who recently moved to the U.S. from the Philippines , said she has stopped confessing her sins to priests , and is turning to God directly .
" I do n't believe in confession to the priest because I do n't know if that priest is more of a sinner than I am , " Co said after attending a Palm Sunday service in central Philadelphia .
On Sunday in London , about 50 protesters staged a demonstration calling on the pope to resign — something that has n't happened in 700 years .
The criticism is also coming from pulpits .
Udo Fischer , an Austrian priest known for his liberal views , avoids mentioning Benedict and other church leaders by name during his Masses — at least until he sees stronger signals of remorse from the Holy See .
" We always stress that this is the church of Jesus Christ — that of the Lord Jesus and not that of the Lord Pope , " Fischer said after a Palm Sunday service in his parish in Paudorf , a village near Vienna .
Parishioners young and old squeezed into pews in Fischer 's modern and airy church clutching bunches of pussy willows blessed by the priest .
Traditionally Catholic Austria , shaken by clergy abuse claims in past years and again in recent weeks , risks a drop in already dwindling support for the church if no concrete action is taken to prevent further abuse and cover-ups , says Regina Polak of the University of Vienna 's Institute for Practical Theology .
" The situation is very fragile right now , " Polak said .
" The potential for frustration is high . "
In Spain , a heavily Catholic country where secular lifestyles are eroding church attendance , a coalition of more than 100 liberal - minded lay and clergy - based groups called the Vatican 's handling of the scandal " irresponsible and insufficient , " saying it failed to " put itself firmly on the side of the victims . "
In Norway , Oslo's Bishop Bernt Eidsvig told Catholics in a letter last week that " the culture of silence that certain bishops advised is a betrayal . "
Perhaps most ominous is the threat to the pope 's own authority .
David Gibson , author of " The Rule of Benedict , " a biography of the pope , said the criticism focusing on Benedict puts the " the mystique of the papal office " in peril .
" And above all , it diminishes his credibility , his ability to convince people of his message , to have people listen to him .
It distances many Catholics , I think , even further from the institutional hierarchical church , " said Gibson .
Even as Easter Week began , anxiety was heard in many places , with people struggling to draw a line between the crimes of some priests and their own deep attachment to communities and the beliefs that sustain them .
" At this point in my life I would n't leave the church for somebody else 's sins , " said Linda Faust , 56 , after a Mass in Greendale , Wisconsin — the state where the late Rev. Lawrence Murphy was accused of molesting some 200 boys at a school for the deaf .
Benedict , at the time Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , is linked to a decision in the 1990s not to defrock Murphy .
Instead ,
Faust said that she and her husband pray for the child victims , the abusive priests and the archbishops who let them transfer to other parishes .
A key focus for those seeking church reform is celibacy — a tradition dating to Christianity 's early days but only made mandatory in the 11th century .
Both Collins in Australia and Bishop Geoffrey Siundu , a former Catholic priest in Kenya , said the rule should go .
Siundu now heads the Ecumenical Catholic Church of Christ in Kenya , said the celibacy rule has driven 30 other ex-priests to join his church .
Kathrin Radelmayer , 24 , attended Mass in Munich , where Ratzinger 's handling of a case when he was archbishop there has been questioned .
She said she was sticking with the church even though many of her friends and relatives are distancing themselves now .
" It is such a shock for the church , but the church has withstood a lot in its 2,000 years and I think that it will survive this as well , " Radelmayer said .
Marina Buendia , a 22 - year - old nurse from Madrid , went to St. Peter 's Square in Rome with a friend for the Pope 's Palm Sunday Mass .
She defended the church .
" The news of these cases has come to the Vatican far too late for the Vatican to be held responsible , " she said .
" I think that the Vatican has accepted the problem , which is a step in the right direction .
We are both very religious and feel a very strong personal bond with the pope , which would never be affected by such scandals .
As young Catholics , we feel welcome and included by the church . "
At a Mass in Minneapolis , Teresa Schweitzer , a 45 - year - old English teacher , said the handling of abuse cases compounds her disenchantment over other matters , including women denied leadership roles .
But she drew comfort from the many Catholic priests and activists she has seen helping the poor and pursuing social justice .
" I 've had a lot of disappointments over the years , and I 'm hanging by a thread , " Schweitzer said .
" I keep coming back for the community — the way we support each other in so many ways .
Do you give up on that ?
Or do you stay in it and fight for justice ?
I think that 's where a lot of us are at now . "

Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris drew criticism from a leading Muslim group today after saying in his annual State of the City address that the high desert town was “ growing a Christian community . ”
" We 're growing a Christian community , and do n't let anybody shy away from that , ” Parris told the audience of ministers gathered for his address .
“ I need [ Lancaster residents ] standing up and saying we 're a Christian community , and we 're proud of that , " the mayor said .
The Greater Los Angeles area office of the Council on American - Islamic Relations denounced the statement and said it plans to file a complaint about the mayor 's remarks with the civil rights division of the U.S. Justice Department .
“ Elected officials should not use their public positions to impose their religious beliefs on others , " said Hussam Ayloush , executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of CAIR .
The mayor , reached by telephone today , said his remarks did not intend to impose his faith on others , and he said he would make no apology .
“ This is just about very few people wanting to get their 15 minutes of fame , ” he said .
“ I guess they got it . ”

URSHAN
Singh 's parents are at St Kilda Rd police complex giving a statement to detectives in the wake of the toddler 's death that has shocked the nation and their native India .
The three - year - old boy 's mother , Harpreet Kaur Channa , and father Harjit Singh , left their house in Lalor about 2.40 pm .
They are currently giving statements to police investigating the mystery death of their son .
This morning , members of Gurshan 's extended family said nobody had been allowed to see or identify the body .
Gurshan
Singh wanted to walk with his dad to the local library - and had been screaming because he could n't go , Sim Kaur said .
When his mother later realised he was missing , it was first thought he'd managed to get out of the house and tried to follow his father .
Six hours later his body was found by a local council worker in long grass by the side of a road on a dead - end street , 30 km from where he was last seen at a relative 's home in Lalor , at 1.10 pm ( AEDT ) .
An autopsy of three - year - old Gurshan Singh has not determined the cause of death , with police pleading for witnesses to come forward , the Herald Sun reports .
Homicide detectives are leading the investigation , which is officially classified as suspicious .
The boy had been screaming because his father had gone to the library without him , says one of the family 's housemates , Sim Kaur .
" He stopped shouting and I thought , what happened ? ''
Ms Kaur , 24 , told reporters at the home in David St , Lalor .
She said his father had left for the library with another housemate .
The family would regularly go to the library - a quick one - minute walk - so they first thought the little boy had tried to follow the father , she said .
The boy 's mother , Harpreet Kaur Channa , who is studying in Melbourne after arriving in Australia six weeks ago , had been in the shower when the boy vanished .
When the family realised the boy was n't at the library , a cousin alerted police to his disappearance around 1.10 pm ( AEDT ) yesterday .
Victoria Police Detective Inspector Steve Clark said the body had no obvious signs of injuries and an autopsy had not revealed how he died .
" There has been an autopsy conducted and as I say a range of forensic testing needs to be carried out , " he said .
Det -Insp Clark refused to say whether any suspects had been identified , however he revealed Gurshan and his mother were not alone at the time of the disappearance .
" There were a couple of people at home at the time , " he said .
Det Insp Clark said police had " spoken to a range of witnesses overnight . "
As police work to find the boy 's killer , the Indian Consul - General and members of the local Indian community have gathered to offer support to the family of the murdered toddler .
The boy 's parents are now staying with a cousin in nearby Thomastown .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , Deputy Commissioner Sir Ken Jones and Premier John Brumby have all urged the public not to speculate on the case .
" I think it 's very important that no one jumps to conclusions , '' Mr Brumby said .
Sir Ken said the investigation could be damaged by such public speculation .
" It 's very important that those who may or may not become suspects - that we 're able to interview them without them having read speculative theories , '' he said .
Ferrari , famous for red blooded , roaring racing machines is beginning its evolution towards sustainable sports cars with the Ferrari 599 Hybrid pictured above and below .
The car uses a Formula 1 derived KERS ( kinetic energy recovery system ) , which in layman ’s terms means it collects power otherwise lost during braking and makes that same power available through a “ boost ” button when you most need in , namely , when you are coming out of the corner you just braked into .
The Ferrari uses a lithium - ion battery array positioned low on either side of the driveshaft and an electric rear transaxle ( pictured below ) to provide the KERS boost , imagine having a high performance electric NOS system installed that would save about 30 % or 17L per 100 kms of fuel consumption .
Now there are people who think it is heresy for a company like Ferrari to build gas / electric hybrid cars but these people are invaribaly idiots and are probably the descendants of the same crowd of people who refused to give up their horse and cart when the original automobile came along .
Electric motors are actually perfect for racing , there is no heavy gearbox , the motor provides 100 % of it ’s torque 100 % of the time and it is significantly lighter than a gasoline engine on a weight / horsepower scale .
The issue slowing adoption is battery life and until we see the breakthroughs in lithium - ion / lithium - titanate or some other as yet unknown technology we will see significantly more gas / electric hybrid high performance cars being released rather than pure electric sports cars like the Tesla Roadster and the Lightning GT .
I for one tip my hat to Ferrari and I ca n’t think of a single rev-head friend who would turn down the opportunity to have a little red electric “ boost ” button within thumbs reach on his steering wheel .

The Walt Disney Company and Cablevision announced they had agreed in principle to a new contract governing WABC about 15 minutes after the Academy Awards telecast started on Sunday night .
The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal .
But the news came too late for many viewers , who had already made alternative plans for watching the awards show .
Charles Schueler , Cablevision ’s executive vice president of communications , said in a statement :
“ We are happy to report that WABC Channel 7 has returned to Cablevision ’s 3 million New York area homes .
We are very grateful to our customers for their support and pleased to welcome ABC back . ”
Disney , in its statement , suggested that the central financial issue was being resolved to its satisfaction .
“ We ’ve made significant progress , and have reached an agreement in principle that recognizes the fair value of ABC7 , with deal points that we expect to finalize with Cablevision , ” the Disney statement said .
“ Given this movement , we ’re pleased to announce that ABC7 will return to Cablevision households while we work to complete our negotiations . ”
Bill Carter of The Times reports that the restoration of service came at 8:44 p.m. , well into ABC ’s coverage of Oscars , which was “ not until they had missed the entire opening of the broadcast , including the monologue from the hosts Alex Baldwin and Steve Martin , and the opening song featuring Neil Patrick Harris . ”
He noted :
“ The first thing that Cablevision customers in the New York area — who had been blocked from seeing anything on WABC television all day — were able to see was the introduction of Penelope Cruz giving out the first award of the evening for Best Supporting Actor .
Cablevision customers had been prevented from seeing both the Barbara Walters special that preceded the show and the red carpet introduction . ”
Cablevision and the Walt Disney Company traded barbs Sunday after WABC was removed from the company ’s cable television lineups , a consequence of a failed contract negotiation .
Many of the cable provider ’s three million customers are wondering whether they will be able to watch the Academy Awards telecast on Sunday night , and some have sought alternative ways to do so .
In an e-mail message to customers around 5:50 p.m. , Cablevision suggested that in lieu of ABC ’s broadcast , people could follow the red carpet arrivals via E ! , the Associated Press and the the Los Angeles Times .
“ We appreciate your patience and hope ABC allows our customers to view their programming in the very near future , ” the company wrote in the e-mail message .
It also said that its entire selection of on - demand movies would be available free through midnight on Sunday .
But that ’s no consolation prize for customers who had looked forward to the awards show , which is now a mere pawn in the fight over fees between Cablevision and Disney .
After negotiations seemingly collapsed last week , Disney pulled the WABC signal at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and replaced it with a message that directs would - be viewers to SaveABC7.com .
On Sunday afternoon , a back - and - forth emerged between the two companies , after WABC said that it had sent Cablevision a “ new proposal ” for a contract .
“ The ball is in their court , ” the station said .
A little over an hour later , Cablevision said it was willing to enter into binding arbitration with Disney “ in order to immediately return ABC to Cablevision customers . ”
But arbitration is not an option , a Disney executive briefed on the matter said .
The executive said that Fox similarly refused to enter into arbitration when it was proposed by Time Warner Cable in a feud over fees last December .
In a new statement shortly before 6 p.m. , WABC said “ instead of issuing statements about arbitration , it would be more constructive for Cablevision to deal with the offer that we have on the table . ”
It is possible that the two companies will still reach a deal before the Academy Awards show at 8 p.m. , although it is impossible to determine how likely that outcome is .
“ I would suspect it ’s going to get settled fairly quickly , possibly even today , because the last thing Cablevision needs is all these people calling and asking what is going on , ” Derek Baine , a veteran cable industry analyst for SNL Kagan , said Sunday afternoon .
Others were more pessimistic , given how much money is at stake .
If an agreement is reached , ABC has the power to restore its signal within minutes .
But barring a deal , Cablevision customers will have to find other ways to watch the Academy Awards .
For many people , the easiest way to watch is over - the - air using a digital antenna .
Some customers said they had called Cablevision ’s competitors to start the process of switching providers .
ABC has no plans to stream the Oscars on its Web site .
Even if ABC owned streaming rights –- which it does not –- the technology needed for such a feat could not be in place on time .
The show will not be live - streamed on Hulu either , a spokesman for the Web site said .
Background information :
Cablevision and Disney have been at loggerheads over how much WABC , the powerhouse local station in New York City , is worth .
ABC started by asking for up to $ 1 per subscriber per month for its local signal – people briefed on the matter say that was a negotiating maneuver and the target price is closer to 60 cents per subscriber — and Cablevision countered by offering an undisclosed fraction of that .
The companies could not come to an agreement , and the spat became public last week .
In recent days , negotiations largely have been at a standstill , according to a person involved who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private .
On Sunday morning , WABC pulled the plug .
Charles Schueler , Cablevision ’s executive vice president of communications , said in a statement five minutes after midnight Sunday , “ It is now painfully clear to millions of New York area households that Disney C.E.O.
Bob Iger will hold his own ABC viewers hostage in order to extract $ 40 million in new fees from Cablevision . ”
Mr. Schueler called on Mr. Iger to “ immediately return ABC to Cablevision customers while we continue to work to reach a fair agreement . ”
In a separate statement , Rebecca Campbell , WABC ’s president and general manager , said Cablevision had “ betrayed its subscribers . ”
“ Cablevision pocketed almost $ 8 billion last year , and now customers are n’t getting what they pay for … again , ” Ms. Campbell said .
“ It ’s time for Jim Dolan and the Dolan family dynasty to finally step up , be fair , and do what ’s right for our viewers . ”
The Federal Communications Commission said that it was “ monitoring the situation closely ” Sunday afternoon , and called for the companies to “ quickly reach a resolution for the benefit of viewers . ”
However , there is little the government can do to force the companies to negotiate .
Disney is under pressure to stand its ground : if it does n’t win concessions from Cablevision , it will be virtually impossible to push for so - called retransmission payments when ABC contracts come due with providers like Time Warner Cable .
Each side believes it has an upper hand .
Disney executives grew increasingly confident on Friday and Saturday as Cablevision competitors like Verizon moved aggressively to steal market share .
Verizon , for instance , has begun an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at disillusioned Cablevision customers , according to a person briefed on the matter .
Cablevision has insisted that its offers to ABC have been fair .
Retransmission demands are growing increasingly common , as outlined in this New York Times article last December .
The News Corporation sought a similar $ 1 amount for its Fox stations from Time Warner Cable last December .
The companies settled on an unspecified amount on New Year ’s Day thought to be near that amount –- effectively setting a market price for signal retransmission , Disney executives argue -– and averted an interruption for the stations .
The outright removal of a popular channel like ABC is rare , but not unprecedented .
In a separate case involving cable channel fees , Food Network and HGTV were removed from Cablevision systems for much of January , in an indication that Cablevision is willing to endure the loss of some channels .
* Ruling is the fourth against autism claims
* Court says mercury preservative did not cause autism ( Adds reaction )
WASHINGTON , March 12 ( Reuters ) - Vaccines that contain a mercury - based preservative called thimerosal cannot cause autism on their own , a special U.S. court ruled on Friday , dealing one more blow to parents seeking to blame vaccines for their children ’s illness .
The special U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that vaccines could not have caused the autism of an Oregon boy , William Mead , ending his family ’s quest for reimbursement .
“ The Meads believe that thimerosal - containing vaccines caused William ’s regressive autism .
As explained below , the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory , ” Special Master George Hastings , a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice , wrote in his ruling .
In February 2009 , the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children ’s autism , saying they had been “ misled by physicians who are guilty , in my view , of gross medical misjudgment ” .
The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , a no - fault system that has a $ 2.5 billion fund built up from a 75 - cent - per - dose tax on vaccines .
Instead of judges , three “ special masters ” heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners .
They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles , mumps and rubella , or MMR , plus a mercury - containing preservative called thimerosal , caused the children ’s symptoms .
MYSTERIOUS CONDITION
More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children .
The no - fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine - making business .
Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children .
The so - called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger ’s Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability , and there is no cure or good treatment .
The U.S. Institute of Medicine has reported several times that no link can be found between vaccines and autism .
Supporters of the scientific community welcomed the ruling .
“ It ’s time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism , ” said Alison Singer , president of the Autism Science Foundation .
“ There is not a bottomless pit of money with which to fund autism science .
We have to use our scarce resources wisely . ”
But advocates for the idea that vaccines are dangerous said they would not give up .
“ We hope that Congress will intervene in what is clearly a miscarriage of justice to vaccine - injured children , ” said Jim Moody of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety .
Autism Speaks , another advocacy group , said it would also not completely abandon the theory that vaccines might cause autism .
The organization said it would invest “ in research to determine whether subsets of individuals might be at increased risk for developing autism symptoms following vaccination . ”
But the group also said it was clear that if such a link did exist , it would be rare .
“ While we have great empathy for all parents of children with autism , it is important to keep in mind that , given the present state of the science , the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism , ” Autism Speaks said in a statement .

Dick Cheney is a sadist .
On Sunday , in an exclusive interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News ' " This Week , " Cheney proclaimed his love of torture , derided the Obama administration for outlawing the practice , and admitted that the Bush administration ordered Justice Department attorneys to fix the law around his policies .
" I was a big supporter of waterboarding , " Cheney told Karl , as if he were issuing a challenge to officials in the current administration , including President Barack Obama , who said flatly last year that waterboarding is torture , to take action against him .
" I was a big supporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques ... "
The former vice president 's declaration closely follows admissions he made in December 2008 , about a month before the Bush administration exited the White House , when he said he personally authorized the torture of 33 suspected terrorist detainees and approved the waterboarding of three so - called " high - value " prisoners .
" I signed off on it ; others did , as well , too , " Cheney said in an interview with the right - wing Washington Times about the waterboarding , a drowning technique where a person is strapped to a board , his face covered with a cloth and then water is poured over it .
It is a torture technique dating back at least to the Spanish Inquisition .
The US has long treated waterboarding as a war crime and has prosecuted Japanese soldiers for using it against US troops during World War II .
And Ronald Reagan 's Justice Department prosecuted a Texas sheriff and three deputies for using the practice to get confessions .
But Cheney 's admissions back then , as well as those he made on Sunday , went unchallenged by Karl and others in the mainstream media .
Indeed , the two major national newspapers -- The New York Times and The Washington Post -- characterized Cheney 's interview as a mere spat between the vice president and the Obama administration over the direction of the latter 's counterterrorism and national security policies .
The Times and Post did not report that Cheney 's comments about waterboarding and his enthusiastic support of torturing detainees amounted to an admission of war crimes given that the president has publicly stated that waterboarding is torture .
Ironically , in March 2003 , after Iraqi troops captured several U.S. soldiers and let them be interviewed on Iraqi TV , senior Bush administration officials expressed outrage over this violation of the Geneva Convention .
" If there is somebody captured , " President George W. Bush told reporters on March 23 , 2003 , " I expect those people to be treated humanely .
If not , the people who mistreat the prisoners will be treated as war criminals . "
Nor did the Times or Post report that the " enhanced interrogation techniques "
Cheney backed was , in numerous cases , administered to prisoners detained at Guantanamo and in detention centers in Iraq and Afghanistan who we would come to discover were innocent and simply in the wrong place at the wrong time .
The torture methods that Cheney helped implement as official policy was also directly responsible for the deaths of at least 100 detainees .
Renowned human rights attorney and Harper 's magazine contributor Scott Horton said , " Section 2340A of the federal criminal code makes it an offense to torture or to conspire to torture .
Violators are subject to jail terms or to death in appropriate cases , as where death results from the application of torture techniques . "
In addition to Obama , Attorney General Eric Holder said during his confirmation hearing last year that waterboarding is torture .
" Dick Cheney wants to be prosecuted .
And prosecutors should give him what he wants , " Horton wrote in a Harper 's dispatch Monday .
Karl also made no mention of the fact that the CIA 's own watchdog concluded in a report declassified last year that the torture of detainees Cheney signed off on did not result in any actionable intelligence nor did it thwart any imminent attacks on the United States .
To the contrary , torture led to bogus information , wrongful elevated threat warnings , and undermined the war - crimes charges against Mohammed al - Qahtani , the alleged " 20th hijacker " in the 9/11 attacks because the evidence against him was obtained through torture .
Karl also failed to call out Cheney on a statement the former vice president made during his interview in which he suggested the policy of torture was carried out only after the Bush administration told Justice Department attorneys it wanted the legal justification to subject suspected al - Qaeda prisoners to brutal interrogation methods .

Senate Republicans relented Sunday and said they would attend President Obama ’s bipartisan healthcare summit this week after all , but the chamber ’s GOP leader is far from resigned to the Democrats ’ idea of cooperation on the hot - button issue .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) said he and his members would n’t boycott the president ’s meeting set for Thursday and that he ’d come ready to participate “ in good faith . ”
But he said Democrats were still being “ arrogant ” in their refusal to throw out current legislation and start over from scratch on a bipartisan compromise , as Republicans have asked .
“ Apparently we ’re going to be there most of the day and have an opportunity to have a lot of discussion , ” McConnell said Sunday in an interview on Fox News .
“ But if they ’re going lay out the plan they want to pass four days in advance , then what are we discussing on Thursday ? ”
The decision expands the summit ’s attendance list beyond Democratic lawmakers , whom Obama has summoned to the presidential guest house for a bipartisan meeting with whichever Republican leaders will join them .
House Republicans have n’t said yet whether they ’ll go .
Whether the summit at Blair House actually offers the opportunity to break through the healthcare logjam , it certainly holds potential for public posturing about who is trying to fix the problem and who is stalling or worsening the situation .
The meeting will be broadcast live in its entirety on C - SPAN .
Laying the groundwork for the conversations , the Obama administration plans to post its plan for overhauling the healthcare system on the White House website Monday .
Over the weekend , Obama suggested that he was willing to move toward Republicans in a couple of areas , including a measure that allows people to buy insurance from a company in another state .
He said he might also be willing to support a plan giving small businesses the power to join together and offer healthcare at lower prices .
“ I do n’t want to see this meeting turn into political theater , with each side simply reciting talking points and trying to score political points , ” Obama said in his weekend radio address .
“ Instead , I ask members of both parties to seek common ground in an effort to solve a problem that ’s been with us for generations . ”
Like their Senate counterparts , House Republicans have raised concerns about the ground rules for the Blair House summit , in particular with the working document , but also with the guest list .
As the nation ’s governors met in Washington this weekend , House Republican Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio asked why they had n’t been invited to attend the summit .
“ Governors from both parties across America have been loud and clear : their cash - strapped states cannot afford the Democrats ’ massive , job - killing healthcare bills , ” Boehner said in a statement issued Friday .
“ If the White House intends to have an open and honest discussion of healthcare reform , the governors ’ voices deserve to be heard . ”
Asked if the Republicans would slow down the consideration of health reform , McConnell said there were “ a variety of different options available . ”
“ But I think the fundamental point I want to make is the arrogance of all of this , ” McConnell said .
“ You know , they are saying , “ Ignore the wishes of the American people .
We know more about this than you do .
And we ’re going to jam it down your throats no matter what . ”
“ That is why the public is so angry at this Congress and this administration over this issue , ” McConnell said .

Mattel Goes “ Beyond ” Stupid With New JLU
| By
I like so many fans of the Justice League toy line have not been able to find this elusive Batman Beyond 3 pack .
I ’ve been quite excited for it , but it never shipped to any of the Targets around me .
I just recently reported how I found the NEXT set of figures , but not this one , which would indicate that the packs just are n’t shipping .
Well Matty decided to clear up some rumors about why these packs are showing up elsewhere .
Hey JLU fans , I wanted to take a minute to answer a lot of fan questions about Target JLU packs showing up at discount stores .
In order to make sure Target had fresh case packs at the end of the year , some of the older case packs Target had not taken yet were released to discount stores ( which includes the Mattel Toy Store open to the public at 333 Continental Blvd , 90245 ) .
The good news for fans looking for the Cheetah and Batman Beyond packs is that some of these master cartons include these two packs .
( they also included Fire and Ice , Question and Captain Atom packs , so you can see why Target would not prefer these . )
If we sent them to Target , the Cheetah and Bat packs would be scooped up quick leaving the older packs on shelf to peg warm preventing any new case packs from making out – get it ?
Like we ’ve said , shipping toys to retail is not an exact science , but hopefully by releasing these case packs to discount stores it will at least get the product out there for fans to find !
And for those asking why we do not sell them on MattyCollector.com , again the answer is simple .
We could clearly sell the Cheetah pack but their is not much market for the older packs which also come in this master carton and the best place to move complete master cartons is at discount stores .
Hope this helps and happy toy hunting !
Matty
Christ I hate Mattel .
I really do .
Here ’s an update from Matty …
Now you might think that this is actually a good thing .
Mattel is trying to avoid peg warmers .
But as a frickin’ JLU collector I can tell you how baffled I ’ve been that I have n’t been able to find the Batman Beyond 3 pack .
Why ?
Because now the truth comes out .
Mattel did n’t ship this case pack to most Targets .
Which is why we ’re seeing that Target is skipping right over this case assortment .
Fair enough .
Let ’s just call that a mistake .
But LOOK AT THE CASE PACKOUT !
Why would Mattel bundle two new sets with THREE old sets that they admittedly said earlier this year that were clogging shelves .
They claimed that due to some of their factories closing that they had to keep shipping this old JLU product .
SO WHY WHEN YOU HAD NEW PRODUCT WOULD YOU BUNDLE IT WITH THE SAME OLD PRODUCT ?!
Please , someone give my any sort of rational response to this .
I ’m dying to know why Mattel would intentionally bundle figures that have clogged the pegs for 12 + months with new figures and then decide that they wo n’t repack those new figures in new case packs , but just ship them to discount chains ?
Mattel you are the stupid .

YOU ca n’t improve housing affordability just by building more homes , and population growth is not needed to fund baby boomer retirement .
Those two simple views , a politician and an academic said this week , could not be denied whatever the rhetoric of business and political leaders .
Kelvin Thompson , Federal Labor member for Wills in Victoria , will tell a population forum at Kawana tomorrow that building houses in response to the affordability crisis has never worked .
He said the only solution was to stabilise population to reduce demand by reducing immigration .
Professor Tor Hundloe , a University of Queensland economist who will speak tomorrow , said individual wealth , which only doubled in the 100 years to 1950 , tripled between then and 1998 and was growing at 3.3 % since .
He said it was utter nonsense to claim the country could not afford the social contract it had with its aged community unless there was population growth .
Mr Hundloe , who spent six years with the Productivity Commission , also attacked what he called the congestion cost of growth .
His research has shown that every business and trade that could had built an extra 15 to 20 % into the price of goods and services to cover time lost on the road .
“ We are still playing catch - up with infrastructure , ” he said .
“ There will be some wonderful road infrastructure in Brisbane but within five to 10 years it will be chock - a- block if we keep growing the way we are .
Everyone knows that will happen . ”
Mr Hundloe said the political attraction with growth was driven by big business demand for it .
Population growth fuelled a 13.6 % rise in Australian housing prices last year .
Reserve Bank assistant governor for economics Philip Lowe said if population growth remained strong , more of the economy would need to be devoted towards housing , presenting challenges for both labour and governments .
If that did n’t happen and growth continued , prices would rise at an even greater rate .
Mr Thompson said the country should commit to a stabilised population of 26 million by 2050 .
A big Australia , he said , would be a poorer one .
“ Bigger cities are not better places to live than smaller ones , ” he said .
The panel for tomorrow ’s Population Forum at Lake Kawana Community Centre from 2 pm to 4.30 pm also includes Mayor Bob Abbot , Redland councillor Deb Henry , author Mark O’Connor , OSCAR president Johanne Wright , Lavinia Wood from Communities for Responsible Planning and Dr Jane O’Sullivan from the University of Queensland .

Advertisement Hundreds of thousands of pro-government Iranians have been rallying to mark the 31st anniversary of Iran 's revolution .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used the rally to attack the West , and said Iran had produced its first stock of 20 % enriched uranium .
The opposition has been trying to stage counter - demonstrations , but faced a big security crackdown , and several of its leaders have reportedly been attacked .
The anniversary is the most important day in Iran 's political calendar .
The government has warned protesters will be dealt with .
Official events were held across Iran , but the main gathering was at Tehran 's Azadi Square .
State TV showed tens of thousands of people filling the streets .
Mr Ahmadinejad told the crowds Iran was now a " nuclear state " and would soon treble output of 20 % enriched uranium .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent , reporting from London
In the media battle , so far today has certainly been a victory for the Iranian government .
It 's not clear , though , whether today 's events will do anything to break the deadlock between government and opposition .
The opposition reports a security presence in Tehran perhaps unprecedented in recent years , with roads blocked , and layers of police and members of the Basij militia , all designed to prevent them gathering or getting near the official demonstration .
Those who have made it to central Tehran have been confronted with riot police , tear gas , possibly even gunfire .
It indicates that the authorities are still deeply nervous about their support , and the government could still be vulnerable if there are new problems with the economy , or if they attempt to round up the leaders of the opposition .
The battle for the future of Iran continues .
John Leyne on cyber wars
He added that Western countries were hampering genuine reform in Iran .
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says the anniversary could be the largest confrontation since the disputed election last June , and the government and opposition have chosen to make the day a huge trial of strength .
Our correspondent says the government is very nervous about the opposition demonstrations , but its own supporters have drawn a good crowd .
Meanwhile , reports from the micro-blogging site Twitter and pro-opposition websites said opposition Green Movement supporters were holding rallies , one of them in the city 's Saddeqiya Street .
The opposition is trying to bring more people into central Tehran but is being confronted by a large number of the government 's Basij militia , the reports say .
Security forces are armed with tear gas , live rounds - which they are firing into the air - and paint balls to mark protesters .
Witnesses say they have been loading opposition supporters onto buses .
The Green Movement promised more gatherings later in the day , but with internet access severely restricted it is unclear how many supporters it will be able to muster .
Amateur footage purportedly showing opposition protests has been appearing on the video - sharing website YouTube , including at least one rally in the Tehran underground .

Opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi had been intending to attend the Saddeqiya street rally , reports say , but he was beaten up by members of the Basij as he emerged from his car .
His son was arrested as he tried to intervene .
The reformist former President Mohammad Khatami was also reportedly attacked .
His brother , Mohammed Reza Khatami , and his wife , Zahra Eshraghi , the granddaughter of the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , were arrested but later released .
Other opposition sources said security forces had fired shots and tear gas at supporters of Mir Hossein Moussavi , Mr Ahmadinejad 's main rival in last June 's elections .

Advertisement Later unconfirmed reports said Mr Moussavi was prevented from joining a rally , and his wife Zahra Rahnavard - also a key opposition figure - was " beaten " .
Opposition protests have also been reported in the cities of Tabriz , Shiraz and Isfahan .
Anti-government websites urged marchers to display green emblems or clothes - the colour adopted by the opposition movement after the disputed election on 12 June last year .
' Ready for trouble '
Deadly clashes erupted after the poll , and have taken place sporadically since then .
Ahead of the commemorations , police chief Esmail Ahmadi Moghaddam said the Revolutionary Guards and Basij Islamic militia were ready for any trouble .
" We are fully prepared for holding a safe and glorious rally , " he told the semi-official Fars news agency , according to Reuters news agency .
" We are closely watching the activities of the sedition movement , and several people who were preparing to disrupt the 11 February rallies were arrested , " he said .
Our correspondent says the situation is now a stalemate , with the opposition showing it is still around and cannot be kept off the streets .
The government is not used to such protests and is infuriated by this , he adds , although opposition support appears not to be enough to overthrow the government .
There are reports of internet restrictions , with web giant Google saying its e-mail traffic in Iran had dropped sharply .
Google said users of its Gmail service had experienced difficulties following a newspaper report about official restrictions .
US state department spokesman Philip Crowley said it appeared Iran had " attempted a near total information blockade " to deal with anti-government protesters .

Utah has become the third state to adopt a law exempting guns and ammunition made , sold and used in the state from massive federal regulations under the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , and supporters say about 30 more states have some sort of plan for their own exemptions in the works .
Officials in Utah say they expect a lawsuit over their direct challenge to Washington if the federal government succeeds in its current case against Montana 's law .
Gary Marbut of the Montana Shooting Sports Association , who has spearheaded the Montana law , now describes himself as a sort of " godfather " to the national campaign .
He confirmed Montana , Tennessee and Utah have enacted such laws .
" Wyoming and South Dakota , they have passed legislation and it's on their governors ' desks , " he said .
" We learned today Oklahoma 's House has passed a plan over to the Senate .
Idaho 's House has just passed it along .
Alaska's has passed the House and is in the Senate Judiciary committee , " he said .

The move is about far more than just the regulation of handguns and shotguns , he said .

" It 's about states ' rights .
Firearms are the vehicle , but the subject is states ' rights and an overbearing federal government , " he said .
He said one of his sources of information for the Montana lawsuit compiled a list of states ' rights issues such as identification , sovereignty and gun licensing that was 20 pages long .
He confirmed an emerging consensus that the federal government 's role in making local decisions needs to be reined in .
" It is huge , " he said .
" We are glad the Firearms Freedom Act can be the point of the spear . "
There only are about a dozen states that have not at least taken up the issue for discussion .
He noted other subjects also have become issues , such as regulations dealing with the sale of alcohol and tobacco .
Originally introduced and passed in Montana , the FFA declares that any firearms made and retained in - state are beyond the authority of Congress under its constitutional power to regulate commerce among the states .

The Salt Lake Tribune reported yesterday the Utah plan was signed into law by Gov. Gary Herbert .

Get " Taking America Back , " Joseph Farah 's manifesto for sovereignty , self - reliance and moral renewal
" There are times when the state needs to push back against continued encroachment from the federal government .
Sending the message that we will stand up for a proper balance between the state and federal government is a good thing , " said Herbert in a statement .
The governor said he recognized the possibility of a lawsuit but said the cost can be minimized .
In any event , Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said any case probably would be delayed until Montana 's decision is rendered , the newspaper reported .
The Utah plan was sponsored by Sen. Margaret Dayton , R - Orem .
Dayton said , according to the Tribune , it " illustrates the universal yearning for freedom , and shows the people still feel the spark that inspired our ancestors at Lexington and Valley Forge .
My hope is that the march toward tyranny can be turned back with our votes . "
In Montana , officials filed suit against U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and others seeking a court order that the federal government stay out of the way of Montana 's management of its own firearms within state borders .
In a recent filing , the federal government demanded dismissal of the action , explaining it can regulate in - state commerce under the Constitution 's Commerce clause .
As WND reported , the action was filed by the Second Amendment Foundation and the Montana Shooting Sports Association in U.S. District Court in Missoula , Mont. , to validate the principles and terms of the Montana Firearms Freedom Act , which took effect Oct. 3 .
Marbut argues that the federal government was created by the states to serve the states and the people , and it is time for the states to begin drawing boundaries for the federal government and its agencies .
The government 's latest filing in the case demands its dismissal , citing a lacking of " standing " for the plaintiffs and the court 's lack of " jurisdiction , " as well as the Constitution 's Commerce Clause .
The government filing argues , " The Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit have repeatedly held that even purely intrastate activities , such as those the MFFA purports to exempt from federal law , do affect interstate commerce and thus are within Congress ' power to regulate .
As a result , even if plaintiffs had standing and jurisdiction existed , plaintiffs ' amended complaint fails to state a claim and must be dismissed . "
The Commerce Clause , however , can be interpreted to have been amended by the 10th Amendment , which is part of the Bill of Rights , adopted subsequent to the U.S. Constitution , Marbut explains .
His organization said , " The Commerce Clause was amended – by the 10th Amendment .
It is a bedrock principle of jurisprudence that for any conflict between provisions of a co-equal body of law , the most recently enacted must be given deference as the most recent expression of the enacting authority .
This principle is ancient .
Without this principle , laws could not be amended or repealed . "
For example , U.S. courts repeatedly affirmed slavery before it ultimately was rejected .
There 's no question that the components of the Bill of Rights have authority : Just look at the 1st Amendment , Marbut explained .
The federal government had written gun dealers in Montana as well as in Tennessee when it adopted its own version of the same law that warned against following the state laws .
The letters were distributed to holders of Federal Firearms Licenses .
In the Tennessee case , Carson W. Carroll , the assistant director of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , told dealers the Tennessee Firearms Freedom Act , adopted , " purports to exempt personal firearms , firearms accessories , and ammunition manufactured in the state , and which remain in the state , from most federal firearms laws and regulations . "
The exemption is not right , the federal agency letter contends .

You have another reason to be worried about your privacy on Facebook .
A new investigation reveals the company 's founder hacked into the personal profiles and email of both his personal rivals and journalists .
The origins of Facebook have been in dispute since the very week a 19 - year - old Mark Zuckerberg launched the site as a Harvard sophomore on February 4 , 2004 .
Then called " thefacebook.com , " the site was an instant hit .
Now , six years later , the site has become one of the biggest web sites in the world , visited by 400 million people a month .
The controversy surrounding Facebook began quickly .
A week after he launched the site in 2004 , Mark was accused by three Harvard seniors of having stolen the idea from them .
This allegation soon bloomed into a full - fledged lawsuit , as a competing company founded by the Harvard seniors sued Mark and Facebook for theft and fraud , starting a legal odyssey that continues to this day .
The primary dispute centered around whether Mark had entered into an " agreement " with the Harvard seniors , Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and a classmate named Divya Narendra , to develop a similar web site for them — and then , instead , stalled their project while taking their idea and building his own .
The litigation never went particularly well for the Winklevosses .
In 2007 , Massachusetts Judge Douglas P. Woodlock called their allegations " tissue thin . "
Referring to the agreement that Mark had allegedly breached , Woodlock also wrote , " Dorm room chit - chat does not make a contract . "
A year later , the end finally seemed in sight : a judge ruled against Facebook 's move to dismiss the case .
Shortly thereafter , the parties agreed to settle .
But then , a twist .
After Facebook announced the settlement , but before the settlement was finalized , lawyers for the Winklevosses suggested that the hard drive from Mark Zuckerberg 's computer at Harvard might contain evidence of Mark 's fraud .
Specifically , they suggested that the hard drive included some damning instant messages and emails .
The judge in the case refused to look at the hard drive and instead deferred to another judge who went on to approve the settlement .
But , naturally , the possibility that the hard drive contained additional evidence set inquiring minds wondering what those emails and IMs revealed .
Specifically , it set inquiring minds wondering again whether Mark had , in fact , stolen the Winklevoss 's idea , screwed them over , and then ridden off into the sunset with Facebook .
Unfortunately , since the contents of Mark 's hard drive had not been made public , no one had the answers .
But now we have some .
Over the past two years , we have interviewed more than a dozen sources familiar with aspects of this story — including people involved in the founding year of the company .
We have also reviewed what we believe to be some relevant IMs and emails from the period .
Much of this information has never before been made public .
None of it has been confirmed or authenticated by Mark or the company .
Based on the information we obtained , we have what we believe is a more complete picture of how Facebook was founded .
This account follows .
And what does this more complete story reveal ?
We 'll offer our own conclusions at the end .
But first , here 's the story :
" We can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night . "
In the fall of 2003 , Harvard seniors Cameron Winklevoss , Tyler Winklevoss , and Divya Narendra were on the lookout for a web developer who could bring to life an idea the three say Divya first had in 2002 : a social network for Harvard students and alumni .
The site was to be called HarvardConnections.com .
The three had been paying Victor Gao , another Harvard student , to do coding for the site , but at the beginning of the fall term Victor begged off the project .
Victor suggested his own replacement : Mark Zuckerberg , a Harvard sophomore from Dobbs Ferry , New York .
Back then , Mark was known at Harvard as the sophomore who had built Facemash , a " Hot Or Not " clone for Harvard .
Facemash had already made Mark a bit of a celebrity on campus , for two reasons .
The first is that Mark got in trouble for creating it .
The way the site worked was that it pulled photos of Harvard students off of Harvard 's Web sites .
It rearranged these photos so that when people visited Facemash.com they would see pictures of two Harvard students and be asked to vote on which was more attractive .
The site also maintained a list of Harvard students , ranked by attractiveness .
On Harvard 's politically correct campus , this upset people , and Mark was soon hauled in front of Harvard 's disciplinary board for students .
According to a November 19 , 2003 Harvard Crimson article , he was charged with breaching security , violating copyrights , and violating individual privacy .
Happily for Mark , the article reports that he was n't expelled .
The second reason everyone at Harvard knew about Facemash and Mark Zuckerberg was that Facemash had been an instant hit .
The same Harvard Crimson story reports that after two weeks , " the site had been visited by 450 people , who voted at least 22,000 times . "
That means the average visitor voted 48 times .
It was for this ability to build a wildly popular site that Victor Gao first recommended Mark to Cameron , Tyler , and Divya .
Sold on Mark , the Harvard Connection trio reached out to him .
Mark agreed to meet .
They first met in the early evening on November 30 in the dining hall of Harvard College 's Kirkland House .
Cameron , Tyler , and Divya brought up their idea for Harvard Connection , and described their plans to A ) build the site for Harvard students only , by requiring new users to register with Harvard .edu email addresses , and B ) expand Harvard Connection beyond Harvard to schools around the country .
Mark reportedly showed enthusiastic interest in the project .
Later that night , Mark wrote an email to the Winklevoss brothers and Divya : " I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it should n't take too long to implement , so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night . "
The next day , on December 1 , Mark sent another email to the HarvardConnections team .
Part of it read , " I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now .
I 'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional . "
These two emails sounded like the words of someone who was eager to be a part of the team and working away on the project .
A few days later , however , Mark 's emails to the HarvardConnection team started to change in tone .
Specifically , they went from someone who seemed to be hard at work building the product to someone who was so busy with schoolwork that he had no time to do any coding at all .
December 4 : " Sorry I was unreachable tonight .
I just got about three of your missed calls .
I was working on a problem set . "
December 10 : " The week has been pretty busy thus far , so I have n't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really , so I think it 's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss .
I 'm also really busy tomorrow so I do n't think I 'd be able to meet then anyway . "
A week later : " Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days .
I 've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I " m still not finished with . "
Finally , on January 8 :
Sorry it 's taken a while for me to get back to you .
I 'm completely swamped with work this week .
I have three programming projects and a final paper due by Monday , as well as a couple of problem sets due Friday .
I 'll be available to discuss the site again starting Tuesday .
I " m still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this to run …
Anyhow , we 'll talk about it once I get everything else done .
So what happened to change Mark 's tune about HarvardConnection ?
Was he so swamped with work that he was unable to finish the project ?
Or , as the HarvardConnection founders have alleged , was he stalling the development of HarvardConnection so that he could build a competing site and launch it first ?
Our investigation suggests the latter .
As a part of the lawsuit against Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg , the above emails from Mark have been public for years .
What has never been revealed publicly is what Mark was telling his friends , parents , and closest confidants at the same time .
Let 's start with a December 7th ( IM ) exchange Mark Zuckerberg had with his Harvard classmate and Facebook cofounder , Eduardo Saverin .
" They made a mistake haha .
They asked me to make it for them . "
Former PayPal CEO Peter
Thiel gets a lot of credit for being the first investor in Facebook , because he led the first formal Facebook round in September of 2004 with a $ 500,000 investment at a $ 5 million valuation .
But the real " first investor " claim to fame should actually belong to a Harvard classmate of Mark Zuckerberg 's named Eduardo Saverin .
To picture Eduardo , what you need to know is that he was the kid at Harvard who would wear a suit to class .
He liked to give people the impression that he was rich — and maybe somehow connected to the Brazilian mafia .
At one point , in an IM exchange , Mark told a friend that Eduardo — " head of the investment society " — was rich because " apparently insider trading is n't illegal in Brazil . "
Eduardo Saverin was n't directly involved with Facebook for long : During the summer of 2004 , when Mark moved to Palo Alto to work on Facebook full time , Eduardo took a high - paying internship at Lehman Brothers in New York .
While Mark was still at Harvard , however , Eduardo appears to have bankrolled Facebook 's earliest capital expenses , thus becoming its initial investor .
In January , however , Mark told a friend that " Eduardo is paying for my servers . "
Eventually , Eduardo would agree to invest $ 15,000 in a company that would , in April 2004 , be formed as Facebook LLC .
For his money , Eduardo would get 30 % of the company .
Eduardo was also involved in Facebook 's earliest days , as a confidant of Mark Zuckerberg .
In December , 2003 , a week after Mark 's first meeting with the HarvardConnection team , when he was telling the Winklevosses that he was too busy with schoolwork to work on or even think about HarvardConnection.com , Mark was telling Eduardo a different story .
On December 7 , 2003 , we believe Mark sent Eduardo the following IM :
Check this site out : www.harvardconnection.com and then go to harvardconnection.com/datehome.php .
Someone is already trying to make a dating site .
But they made a mistake haha .
They asked me to make it for them .
So I 'm like delaying it so it wo n't be ready until after the facebook thing comes out .
This IM suggests that , within a week of meeting with the Winklevosses for the first time , Mark had already decided to start his own , similar project — " the facebook thing . "
It also suggests that he had developed a strategy for dealing with his would - be competition : Delay developing it .
" I feel like the right thing to do is finish the facebook and wait until the last day before I 'm supposed to have their thing ready and then be like look yours is n't as good "
A few weeks after the initial meeting with the HarvardConnection team , after Mark sent the IM to Eduardo Saverin talking about developing " the facebook thing " and delaying his development of HarvardConnection , Mark met with the HarvardConnection folks , Cameron , Tyler , and Divya , for a second time .
This time , instead of meeting in the dining hall of Mark 's residential hall , Kirkland House , the four met in Mark 's dorm room .
Divya is said to have arrived late .
In Kirkland House , the dorm rooms are n't laid out in cinder - block - cube style : Mark 's room had a narrow hallway connecting it to his neighbor's .
As Cameron and Tyler sat down on a couch in Mark 's room , Cameron spotted something in the hallway .
On top of a bookshelf there was a white board .
It was the kind Web developers and product managers everywhere use to map out their ideas .
On it , Cameron read two words , " Harvard Connection . "
He got up to go look at it .
Immediately , Mark asked Cameron to stay out of the hallway .
Eventually Divya arrived and the four of them talked about plans for Harvard Connection .
One feature Mark brought up was designed to keep more popular and sought - after Harvard Connection users from being stalked and harassed by crowds of people .
In this second meeting , Mark still appeared to be actively engaged in developing Harvard Connection .
But he never showed the HarvardConnection folks any site prototypes or code .
And they did n't insist on seeing them .
During the weeks in which Mark was juggling the two projects in tandem , he also had a series of IM exchanges with a friend named Adam D'Angelo ( above ) .
Adam and Mark went to boarding school together at Phillips Exeter Academy .
There , the pair became friends and coding partners .
Together they built a program called Synapse , a music player that supposedly learned the listener 's taste and then adapted to it .
Then , in 2002 Mark went to Harvard and Adam went to Cal Tech .
But the pair stayed in close touch , especially through AOL instant messenger .
Eventually , Adam became Facebook 's CTO .
Harvard Yard at WinterThrough the Harvard Connection - Facebook saga and its aftermath , Mark kept Adam apprised of his plans and thoughts .
One purported IM exchange seems particularly relevant on the question of how Mark distinguished between the two projects — the " facebook thing " and " the dating site " — as well as how he was considering handling the latter :
Zuck :
So you know how I 'm making that dating site
Zuck : I wonder how similar that is to the Facebook thing
Zuck :
Because they 're probably going to be released around the same time
Zuck : Unless
I fuck the dating site people over and quit on them right before I told them I 'd have it done .
D'Angelo : haha
Zuck : Like I do n't think people would sign up for the facebook thing if they knew it was for dating
Zuck : and I think people are skeptical about joining dating things too .
Zuck :
But the guy doing the dating thing is going to promote it pretty well .
Zuck : I wonder what the ideal solution is .
Zuck : I think the Facebook thing by itself would draw many people , unless it were released at the same time as the dating thing .
Zuck :
In which case both things would cancel each other out and nothing would win .
Any ideas ?
Like is there a good way to consolidate the two .
D'Angelo :
We could make it into a whole network like a friendster .
haha .
Stanford has something like that internally
Zuck :
Well I was thinking of doing that for the facebook .
The only thing that 's different about theirs is that you like request dates with people or connections with the facebook you do n't do that via the system .
D'Angelo : Yeah
Zuck : I also hate the fact that I 'm doing it for other people haha .
Like I hate working under other people .
I feel like the right thing to do is finish the facebook and wait until the last day before I 'm supposed to have their thing ready and then be like " look yours is n't as good as this so if you want to join mine you can …otherwise I can help you with yours later . "
Or do you think that 's too dick ?
D'Angelo : I think you should just ditch them
Zuck :
The thing is they have a programmer who could finish their thing and they have money to pour into advertising and stuff .
Oh wait I have money too .
My friend who wants to sponsor this is head of the investment society .
Apparently insider trading is n't illegal in Brazil so he 's rich lol .
D'Angelo : lol
" I 'm going to fuck them . "
Eduardo Saverin and Adam D'Angelo were not the only people Mark discussed his Harvard Connection - Facebook situation with .
We believe he also had many IM exchanges about it with relatives and a close female Harvard friend .
In January 2004 , Mark met with the Winklevoss brothers and Divya Narendra for what would be the last time .
The meeting was on January 14 , 2004 , and it was held at the same place Mark met with the HarvardConnection team for the first time — in the dining hall of Mark 's residence , Kirkland House .
By this point , Mark 's site , thefacebook.com , was n't complete , but he was working hard on it .
He 'd arranged for Eduardo Saverin to pay for his servers .
He had already told Adam that " the right thing to do " was to not complete Harvard Connection and build The Facebook.com instead .
He had registered the domain name .
He therefore had a choice to make : Tell Cameron , Tyler and Divya that he wanted out of their project , or string them along until he was ready to launch thefacebook.com .
Mark sought advice on this decision from his confidants .
One friend told him , in so many words , you know me .
I do n't ever think anyone should do anything bad to anybody .
Mark and this friend also had the following IM exchange about how Mark planned to resolve the competing projects :
Friend :
So have you decided what you 're going to do about the websites ?
Zuck : Yeah , I 'm going to fuck them
Zuck : Probably in the year
Zuck : * ear
And so , it appears , he did .
( In a manner of speaking ) .
On January 14 , 2004 , Mark Zuckerberg met with Cameron , Tyler , and Divya for the last time .
During the meeting at Kirkland House , Mark expressed doubts about the viability of HarvardConnection.com .
He said he was very busy with personal projects and school work and that he would n't be able to work on the site for a while .
He blamed others for the site 's delays .
He did not say that he was working on his own project and that he was not planning to complete the HarvardConnection site .
After the meeting , Mark had another IM exchange with the friend above .
He told her , in effect , that he had wimped out .
He had n't been able to break the news to Cameron and Tyler , in part , he said , because he was " intimidated " by them .
He called them " poor bastards . "
So then what happened ?
Three days earlier , on January 11 , 2004 , Mark had registered the domain THEFACEBOOK .COM .
On February 4 , he opened the site to Harvard students .
On February 10 , Cameron Winklevoss sent Mark a letter accusing him of breaching their agreement and stealing their idea .
In late May , after going through two more developers , Cameron , Tyler and Divya launched HarvardConnection as ConnectU , a social network for 15 schools .
On June 10 , 2004 , a commencement speaker mentioned the amazing popularity of Mark 's site , thefacebook.com .
In the summer of 2004 , Mark moved to Palo Alto to work on Facebook full time and soon received a $ 500,000 investment from Peter Thiel .
In September 2004 , HarvardConnection , now called ConnectU , sued Mark Zuckerberg and the now - incorporated " Facebook " for allegedly breaching their agreement and stealing their idea .
In February 2008 , Facebook and ConnectU agreed to settle the lawsuit .
In June 2008 , ConnectU appealed the settlement in California 's ninth district , accusing Facebook of trading its stock without disclosing material information .
This appeal is on - going .
The $ 65 million question
When we described the specifics of this story to Facebook , the company had the following comment :
" We 're not going to debate the disgruntled litigants and anonymous sources who seek to rewrite Facebook 's early history or embarrass Mark Zuckerberg with dated allegations .
The unquestioned fact is that since leaving Harvard for Silicon Valley nearly six years ago , Mark has led Facebook 's growth from a college website to a global service playing an important role in the lives of over 400 million people . "
On the latter point , we agree .
What Mark Zuckerberg has accomplished with Facebook over the past six years has been nothing short of amazing .
So , having revisited the founding of Facebook with additional information , what do we conclude ?
First , we have seen no evidence of any formal contract between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevosses in which Mark agreed to develop Harvard Connection .
Second , any agreement the parties may have had — as well as most of the purported IMs and emails we have reviewed from the period — appear to have been at the level of , as Judge Ware described them , " dorm - room chit- chat . "
( Albeit interesting and entertaining chit-chat . )
Third , only a week after beginning development of Harvard Connection , which he referred to as " the dating site , " Mark had begun work on a separate project — " the facebook thing . "
Mark appears to have considered the products as competing for the attention of the same users , but he also appears to have regarded them as different in some key ways .
Fourth — and because of this foreseen competition —
Mark does appear to have intentionally strung along the Harvard Connection folks with the goal of making his project , thefacebook.com , have a more successful launch .
Bottom line , we have n't seen anything that makes us think that , whatever Mark did to the Harvard Connection folks , it was worth more than the $ 65 million they received in the lawsuit settlement .
In fact , this seems like a huge sum of money considering that the entire dispute took place over two months in 2004 and that , in the six years since , Mark has built Facebook into a massive global enterprise .
That said , in the course of our investigation , we also uncovered two additional anecdotes about Mark 's behavior in Facebook 's early days that are more troubling .
These episodes — an apparent hacking into the email accounts of Harvard Crimson editors using data obtained from Facebook logins , as well as a later hacking into ConnectU — are described in detail here .

The Lower Merion School District in Pennsylvania was recently sued after allegedly spying on a student using a school - owned laptop via the laptop 's built - in Web cam .
In this note to parents , sent Thursday night , which we obtained , the school says it was a security feature , and that it was only used " for the narrow purpose of locating a lost , stolen or missing laptop " and that the district " never activated the security feature for any other purpose or in any other manner whatsoever . "
If true , this sounds more reasonable , but it 's still a bit creepy .
The district has disabled the feature .
Here 's the note sent to parents last night :
Dear LMSD Parents / Guardians ,
Our history has been to go to great lengths to protect the privacy of our students ; whether it comes to student health , academic or other records .
In fact , many of you may remember the heated debate over whether to have security cameras monitor some of our food vending machines .
Privacy is a basic right in our society and a matter we take very seriously .
We believe that a good job can always be done better .
Recent publicity regarding the District ’s one - to - one high school laptop initiative , and questions about the security of student laptops prompted our administration to revisit security procedures .
Laptops are a frequent target for theft in schools and off school property .
District laptops do contain a security feature intended to track lost , stolen and missing laptops .
The security feature , which was disabled today , was installed to help locate a laptop in the event it was reported lost , missing or stolen so that the laptop could be returned to the student .
Upon a report of a suspected lost , stolen or missing laptop , the feature was activated by the District 's security and technology departments .
The security feature ’s capabilities were limited to taking a still image of the operator and the operator 's screen .
This feature was only used for the narrow purpose of locating a lost , stolen or missing laptop .
The District never activated the security feature for any other purpose or in any other manner whatsoever .
As a result of our preliminary review of security procedures today , I directed the following actions :
· Immediate disabling of the security - tracking program .
· A thorough review of the existing policies for student laptop use .
· A review of security procedures to help safeguard the protection of privacy ; including a review of the instances in which the security software was activated .
We want to ensure that any affected students and families are made aware of the outcome of laptop recovery investigations .
· A review of any other technology areas in which the intersection of privacy and security may come into play .
We are proud of the fact that we are a leader in providing laptops to every high school student as part of our instructional program .
But we need to be equally as proud of the safeguards we have in place to protect the privacy of the users , as well as to safeguard district - owned property while being used by students .
We regret if this situation has caused any concern or inconvenience among our students and families .
If you have any questions or concerns , please email us at info@lmsd.org .
Additional information has been posted on our website , www.lmsd.org.
Thank you for your time and attention .
Sincerely ,
Dr. Christopher W. McGinley
Superintendent of Schools
Lower Merion School District
The school district has posted this letter on its Web site here .
We live in an expanding universe .
Distant galaxies move away from us , and these galaxies see us moving away from them .
If we reverse time and trace back this expansion , it follows that the universe has evolved from a dense primeval / primordial state .
The big bang concept summarized in three sentences .
Sounds easy ?
History shows that the concept of a big bang is difficult to swallow .
That even holds for the brightest minds in the history of science .
For thousands of years , mankind has struggled with the basic question “ Does the universe have a beginning ? ”
In hindsight , the answer was up for grabs more than three centuries ago .
Missed opportunities
When Isaac Newton discovered the law of motion and gravity , he struggled with the fact that these laws render the universe unstable .
Celestial bodies behave no different than an apple close to earth .
Material bodies do not remain in a stable separated configuration just like an apple does not float above earth .
Inevitably , the earth and an apple will collapse together , and so will the celestial bodies that make up the universe .
Newton could have argued that his laws are time - reversible , and that a reversal of a collapse would yield an expanding universe that is fully compatible with his laws of physics .
He could even have concluded that three different models for a dynamical universe are possible : 1 ) a universe that expands forever ( the reversal of an apple hitting the earth like a meteor ) , 2 ) a universe that undergoes an expansion followed by a contraction ( the reversal of an apple thrown in the air with velocity below escape velocity ) , and 3 ) the in - between scenario in which the universe decelerates but never contracts ( the reversal of an apple falling to earth starting from a standstill at infinity ) .
More than two centuries later , another true giant in science had an even better chance to predict an expanding universe , but also blew it .
Even worse , when Albert Einstein discovered that his theory of gravity did not allow for a stable universe , he started tweaking his equations .
Even for a scientist as bold as Einstein , a big bang universe was a too far - fetched concept .
Accepting the big bang
Key is that both Newton and Einstein lacked direct observational evidence for a cosmic expansion .
Apparently , without such hard evidence it is virtually impossible to consider a cosmic expansion .
And even with such evidence , acceptance of a big bang cosmology is far from a done deal .
In 1929 Edwin Hubble made the discovery that distant galaxies move away from each other with velocities proportional to their distance .
Yet , it took many tens of years and the observation of a true relic of the big bang ( the cosmic microwave background ) in the 1960's , to get the big bang widely accepted as the standard cosmological model .
If the brightest minds have wrestled many years with the concept of an expanding universe , who can blame a lay person struggling to accept the big bang ?
To make things worse , the treatment of cosmic expansion in the popscience literature is confusing and often inconsistent or even misleading .
In his recent book ' From Eternity to Here ' , Sean Carroll makes the statement : “ [..] of all the confusing aspects of modern cosmology , probably none has been the subject of more misleading or simply untrue statements [..] than the big bang ” .
Five years ago , Scientific Ameri can ran an article with the title “ Misconceptions about the Big Bang ” .
The authors of this article , Lineweaver and Davis , state : “ Renowned physicists , authors of astronomy textbooks and prominent popularizers of science have made incorrect , misleading or easily misinterpreted statements about the expansion of the universe .
Because expansion is the basis of the big bang model , these misunderstandings are fundamental . ”
I agree with these sentiments .
In fact , I consider it a small miracle that so many people seem to accept a concept as ill - explained and miscommunicated as the big bang .
Visualizing the big bang
How do you visualize the big bang ?
If I ask you to draw the big bang , would you attempt to draw an explosion similar to this ?
As a representation of the big bang , this picture is severely flawed .
Imagining the big bang as an explosion originating at a specific location in space , represents a gross violation of the cosmological principle .
This principle states that t
he universe has no preferred location , nor a preferred direction .
You can think of the cosmological principle a
s nothing more than
the Copernican debunking of
driven to its ultimate consequence : from a cosmological perspective our place in the universe is not special , and neither is any other places .
Therefore the big bang did not happen at a particular place .
It happened everywhere .
The big bang represents
a temporal singularity rather than a singularity in space .
Can we create a visualization of the big bang that is understandable , yet honors the key physics ?
Key challenge for any big bang visualization is that in some way it needs to translate Einstein 's laws of general relativity , which dictate the cosmic expansion in terms of metrical spaces , into a more easily understandable kinematic description of galaxies flying apart .
People can grasp an explosion of galaxies flying apart , but struggle with abstract mathematical concept like a Robertson - Walker metric .
Let 's start with a uniform explosion in a one - dimensional space .
It looks like this :
You can think of the dots representing galaxies flying apart .
Each galaxy sees the others moving away , and galaxies at larger mutual distance move proportionally faster away from each other .
This is exactly the expansion observed by Hubble .
There is a problem though .
Galaxies that are further separated , recede from each other more rapidly , and beyond a certain distance , galaxies will fly apart faster than the speed of light .
To correct this , we need to bring some relativistic concepts into the picture .
First , we represent the one - dimensional galactic explosion in spacetime :
Spatial separation is indicated horizontally , and time runs vertically .
In this picture the slope of the galaxy trajectories represent their velocities ( as observed from the galaxy in te center of the picture ) .
To render this picture relativistically correct , we need to ' bend ' the trajectories such that the angle with the vertical ( time ) axis stays smaller than the angle corresponding to the speed of light .
This bending corresponds to the well - known relativistic time dilation : time runs more slowly for fast moving objects .
So we imagine that each of the galaxies carries a clock that started ticking at the moment of the big bang , and plot the positions of the galaxies when all galactic clocks show the same time .
We get the following picture :
Notice that the time indicated along the vertical axes is associated with the central galaxy in this picture .
From the perspective of this central galaxy , galaxies further away move faster and their clocks tick slower , and therefore they reach a given position only when the clock of the central galaxy indicates a much later time .
This causes the ' bending up ' of the line of galaxies .
By plotting all galaxies at synchronized proper ( cosmological ) times , we effectively have relativistically mixed space and time and created a curved space ( yellow band ) that stretches itself more straight with time :
Notice that in this picture the big bang ( cosmic time zero ) is represented by two straight lines : two opposing flashes of light filling whole space .
We are now ready to indicate the visible universe as seen from the galaxy central in the picture .
These are nothing more than the rays of light traveling from the past and ending at the central dot .
In a one - dimensional universe there are two such light rays , indicated by the green line segments in below figure .
To render this visualization more complete , the early opaque phase of the universe ( denoted in yellow ) is distinguished from the transparent phase .
The interface between the two represents the ' surface of last scatter ' .
This surface marks the visible depth of the universe .
It is visible as the cosmic microwave background , the afterglow of the big bang discovered in 1964 and mapped out by the COBE and WMAP satellites .
Again : the Cosmological Principle
Ok , so if you want to imagine the big bang as some sort of explosion , the correct picture is shown above .
It honors the theory of relativity , yet is a caricature of ' the real thing ' as only one space dimension is represented , and the effects of gravity are ignored .
Its qualitative features , however , are correct .
But wait a second .
What about the cosmological principle ?
Surely this principle is grossly violated : the galaxy in the center of the picture surely occupies a very special place in this one - dimensional universe .
Ptolemy would perhaps like this model , but Copernicus and Galilei certainly would n't .
Not too quick !
This is where the magic of Einstein 's theory of relativity comes into play .
In the above picture the central galaxy seems special , but that is only so because we have represented the universe from the perspective of this particular galaxy .
We can ' scroll ' through this one - dimensional universe and experience a universe that looks the same from each alternative perspective :
Clearly each galaxy occupies an equivalent position .
Our one - dimensional model universe obeys the cosmological principle in the most detailed way possible .
Each point in this universe is at the center of it .
It is just a matter of perspective .
Also obvious from this picture is that the ' scrolling ' can be continued indefinitely .
This universe is truly infinite .
However , from the perspective of each galaxy , the observable universe ( the green light rays emanated from the surface of light scatter and illuminating the galaxy ) is finite .
Note , however , that different galaxies have different observable universes associated with them .
There is much more to be said about this model universe .
But let me stop here , and ask you a concluding question : do you accept the big bang ?
Do you consider it a truth like you consider a non - flat earth a truth ?
We do n't know much about this picture of a heap of manure left in the vestibule of the Chase branch at 10th Street and Second Ave , but it 's a pretty awesome protest against shitty three - dollar ATM fees .
[ Description Without Place ]
Haiti is about the size of Maryland and a big chunk of the population lives in or near Port - Au - Prince , maybe a third of the total , depending on what you count as a suburb .
So the collapse of Port - Au - Prince is a big , big deal for the country as a whole .
It 's a dominant city for Haiti .
Plus Jacmel seems to be leveled .
From the reports I have seen , my tentative conclusion is that the country as a whole is currently below the subsistence level and will remain so for the foreseeable future .
Hundreds of thousands of people have died , the U.N. Mission has collapsed , the government is not working ( was it ever ? ) , and hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of people are living in the streets without reliable food or water supplies .
The hospitals and schools have collapsed .
The airport is shut down .
The port is very badly damaged .
The Haitian Penitentiary has collapsed and the inmates — tough guys most of them – are running free for the foreseeable future .
There is no viable police force or army .
In other words , it 's not just a matter of offering extra food aid for two or three years .
Very rapidly , President Obama needs to come to terms with the idea that the country of Haiti , as we knew it , probably does not exist any more .
In what sense does Haiti still have a government ?
How bad will it have to get before the U.N. or U.S. moves in and simply governs the place ?
How long will this governance last ?
What will happen to Haiti as a route for the drug trade , the dominant development in the country 's economy over the last fifteen years ?
What does the new structure of interest groups look like , say five years from now ?
Is there any scenario in which the survivors , twenty years from now , are better off , compared to the quake never having taken place ?
The Tor Project has been working very closely with Nathan Freitas and The Guardian Project to create an Android release .
This is an early beta release and is not yet suitable for high security needs .
The Android web browser is not protected by Torbutton and we have not yet developed an anonymous browser on the Android platform .
Please be cautious with this release , it 's probably pretty fragile and it 's certainly not ready for serious use .
We 've codenamed the Tor on Android project Orbot ; Orbot is a single Android package that provides a new Tor controller , Privoxy as our trusty little HTTP proxy , libevent , and Tor itself .
This Android package is using the C reference implementation of Tor. Orbot should be orders of magnitude safer than other Tor implementations on Android and it's our official release .
Everything you 'll need for using
Tor is in the package . :-)
We now have an Android webpage that discusses the Orbot Android package in some detail .
Orbot has some commonly used features such as support for bridges .
It also has advanced features such as per application Torification on modified devices ( commonly called ' rooted ' phones ) .
It has been tested on Android 1.5 , 1.6 , 2.0 , 2.1 and on non-standard customized builds of Android .
We think we 've ironed out most of the kinks but we 're looking for some community feedback from devices in the wild .
We 'd especially like to hear about the UI and what applications you commonly use with Tor .
When Orbot is successfully installed and running , it should provide a few standard interfaces to interface with the Tor network .
Privoxy listens on 127.0.0.1:8118 - it 's chained to the standard Tor SOCKS proxy on 127.0.0.1:9050 .
In addition , we have a DNSPort on port 5400 .
The DNSPort is most commonly used by the automagical per application Torification .
These ports may change in the future ; if they conflict with other common and popular applications , we 'd like to hear about it .
Our official builds are available from our website .
As per our usual style of package releases , we 're releasing the .apk package with gpg signatures .
If you 'd simply like the latest Android package , please visit this url :
http://www.torproject.org/dist/android/alpha-orbot-latest.apk
If you have the barcode scanner , you 'll be able to directly load the
latest package by scanning the following QR code :
We plan to release Orbot in the Google Market in the near future .
The
Orbot package you install from our website and the application in the
Market should be identical .
In addition to the GPG signature , the .apk
files contain a digital signature .
If you 're feeling reasonably
paranoid , it 's probably a fine idea to download the .apk from our
website , check the GPG signature , and then install the package on your
device manually .
If you 'd like to reproduce our builds from source , we 've documented the
build process in
our subversion repository .
If you 'd like to read more about Orbot , we suggest you check out the
source and start hacking around :

For the sake of its pandemic fund , the EU will probably opt for placating Hungary and Poland .
But a slide in democratic norms could be its undoing .
I was talking about Lisp macros with Kyle and we decided to write down the patterns of different macros we ’ve seen and what they allow you to do , with the intent of teaching others .
Interesting things you can do with macros :
resource management ( e.g. with - open - file )
behavior injection à la AOP ( e.g. memoization , debug printing )
alternate control - flow constructs
alternate looping constructs
alternate binding constructs ( e.g. destructuring - bind , cut )
lazy evaluation
DSLs
code generation
Things that macros actually give you that you ca n’t do otherwise :
programmatic binding
non-hygienic binding
controlled evaluation

JOLIET , IL — Citing an increase in " leg humpers and peter - gazing diddlers , " Joliet Corrections Center inmate Joseph J. Romans told reporters Monday that Cell Block D is not as cool as it used to be .
Romans in his cell on the now - lame Joliet Corrections Center Block D .

" When I first went down , D was straight , " said Romans , who is serving an eight - year sentence at Joliet for armed robbery .
" Minute I walked in , I knew it was a good stop .
I do n't know what happened . "
Romans said that 2001 , his first year in D Block , was his best year in prison .
" D used to have the toughest guys , pruno [ homemade alcohol ] , and pearl handles [ commercially manufactured cigarettes ] , and with my connections - man Willie G on block , we had Cadillac everything , " Romans said .
" I almost felt like I was in the world with my crew again .
Now , all we got left is a bunch of punk - ass june bugs with nothing coming .
I do n't even know what name half these young kids go by . "

New prisoners are often impressed by the severity of the facility , but Romans said it pales in comparison to that of the old Cell Block D .
" These bitches and dumb - ass crackheads come in all wide - eyed , losing their shit over how we got the corners worked , " Romans said .
" Well , what they do n't know is that the old D used to have the straightest crew in [ Joliet ] .
We were n't thugs .
We did our own time .
But if you crossed one of us , you got a pumpkin head .
Everyone knew that and gave us our respect . "

A pumpkin head is the injury that commonly results when a pillowcase is filled with heavy objects and used to beat an enemy 's face until badly bruised .
" Yeah , things have gone to hell , " Romans said .
" These fools will sodomize a guy with a pipe for no good reason .
Too young to know standards of conduct . "

According to Romans , Cell Block D's reputation has been hurt by a number of unsuccessful escape attempts by some of the newer inmates .
" See , if you rabbit and get away , you become a legend , " Romans said .
" If not , you get your ass beat by the hacks and put in the hole .
The guys in the old D would never pull the half - ass stunts they pull here now .
Well , ' Smokey ' Hudson tried to make a break a few years ago , but he was n't really solid with the D crew to begin with . "

Recent behavior by the newer members of Cell Block D has resulted in punishment for all the inmates , said Romans .
" The last few weeks , the D's been in lockdown for some ignorant stunt , " Romans said .
" Somebody tried to make pruno in a bag , tie it up , and put it in the toilet .
Shit , that 's the first place they gonna look . "

Continued Romans : " I 'm sick of taking heat for these kids .
From here on in , I 'm doing my own time .
When I get called up [ to the parole board ] , I 'm walking up packed , bo - bos tied .
D is dead . "
New inmate Nathan Gold has an entirely different attitude toward Cell Block D .
" The D is dope and everyone knows it , " said Gold , a convicted arsonist .
" Even the hogs know if you 're from D , you ai n't to be fucked with .
I can't imagine doing my bit in that punk - ass Cell Block A . "

Other inmates questioned Romans ' credibility .
Thirty - year inmate Jerome Hughes said his fellow prisoner is a " cell gangster , " someone who boasts in his cell but never amid the general prison population .
" Romans is a bitch , " Hughes said .
" If he did n't have Big Norman looking out for him , he would n't have lasted his first year .
Yeah , people get out of line , but Romans does n't do the correcting , tell you that much . "

Continued Hughes : " I do n't know why he 's knocking his gums .
Cell Block D's been a sandbox for 10 , 15 years .
Has n't been the same since Stabbin ' Jackie Kayne went on 10 - 10 furlough in ' 85 .
Yeah , ' 83 and ' 84 .
Those were the days . "

Dr David Clarke , author of The UFO Files and senior lecturer in journalism from Sheffield Hallam University said : '' In the 1950s the next big leap in technology was thought to be a round craft that took off vertically and it's intriguing to note that this is the same period when people began to report seeing ' flying saucers ' in the sky .
C++ and copy - on - write data structures
I generally like C++ and the way C++ feels , but there is one specific quirk which is caused by STL designers ’ choice of data structures which cannot be implemented with a copy - on - write ( aka COW ) semantic .
Curious about which quirk ?
Keep on reading !
COW might look like an implementation detail , but it can really change the way you design your APIs .
What is a COW ?
An object with COW semantic ( sometimes also called “ implicit sharing ” ) has an interesting property : whenever you copy it , it does not really do a “ deep copy ” but simply shares the underlying data between the original object and its copy , and increments a reference counter to track this .
Only at the moment that any of the copies is further modified ( written to ) , the deep copy is really performed .
Now , it is important to realize that the overhead imposed by the COW semantic is usually very tiny : the object just needs to bookkeep a counter at every copy , and check it before any modification .
The latter is even lighter than it sounds because the compiler can strip off many checks thanks to constant propagations .
But what are the advantages of using COW ?
The first and foremost advantage is the possibility to have a clean API with respect to return values .
Returning a COW
If you have programmed C++ long enough , you know that all C++ functions that should return a complex data structure ( anything which is larger than a small structure , like a container , a memory buffer , and so on ) will instead accept a reference or a pointer to an object that the caller must provide and that will be “ filled in ” as return value .
This is absolutely awful .
If you do n’t see it as awful , it ’s about time you take a break from C++ and switch to other languages for a while .
For instance :
std::vector nodes ; cur_node.children( nodes ) ; printf ( " Number of children : %u
" , nodes.size ( ) ) ;
The Node:: children ( ) function , in any other language , would have returned a vector of Nodes .
But idiomatic C++ says that you should not impose the overhead of doing an additional copy of the vector onto your user , and thus ask him to pass you the container to fill .
This is really unreadable because it breaks the common syntax of functions by intermixing return values to arguments .
Moreover , it imposes additional troubles to the API ; eg : what happens if you call Node : : children ( ) with a non-empty vector ?
Will the function just append its data to the vector ?
Or would it clear it at the beginning ?
Now , think of a world where std:: vector is a COW data structure .
All these problems suddenly disappear because returning the vector would not cause a copy anymore .
Bam , problem solved !
And when you have a clear API , where return values really are return values , you get all the benefits from it :
printf ( " Number of children : %u
" , cur_node.children ( ).size ( ) ) ;
Three lines merged into one .
No more temporary named variable .
And if Node happens to internally store its children as a vector , this code is even faster than the non-COW version , because there is no copy performed at all : you get the same speed as if children ( ) returned a reference to the internal vector , even though it does not .
COWs to the rescue
Other advantages of COW data structures :
You can nest COW data structures without overhead .
Think of vector < vector < int >> .
Without COW , whenever the outer data structure resizes , the inner data structures will all be reallocated and copied .
With COW , there is no copy at all : the internal data structures are basically moved over in constant time .
You can stop abusing const references everywhere .
In C++ , most functions will receive arguments by const references instead of simple values .
Again , this is to save the overhead of a copy , and again this is almost useless with COW data structures .
Const references are also nasty because they represent a first leak of const - correctness in your code ( I also hate the whole const - correctness in C++ , but this is for another day ; if you like it , you can still make your functions accept const values if you feel too ) .
Norwegian COWs
Nokia ’s
Qt has designed all objects and data structures with COW .
They even made them reentrant ( for multithreading purposes ) by using atomic reference counting through native CPU instructions .
Finally , they expose the guts of COW through a simple QShared Data template that you can use to reimplement your own COW objects .
I could not agree with Qt ’s designers more .
This is another example of how COW can positively influence API design :
QByteArray fileHash ( QString fn ) { QFile f( fn ) ; QCryptographicHash h( QCryptographicHash :: Sha1 ) ; while (! f.atEnd ( ) ) h.addData(f.read( 16*1024 ) ) ; return h.result ( ) ; }
See how I can simply pass the buffer returned by QFile : : read ( ) to addData ( ) without having to worry about memory copying .
Counting COWs
So , the next time you design an API which asks for a return value among the arguments , think of a C++ world where COW is everywhere .
And dream on .
New York ( CNN ) --
First it was trans fats .
Then it was high - calorie fast food .
Now , the New York City Health Department is tackling another diet enemy : salt .
The department unveiled an initiative Monday urging restaurants and food companies across the country to voluntarily reduce their products ' salt levels , city officials said .
" Salt is a huge problem in our diets , " said Dr. Sonia Angell , director of the Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control Program at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene .
" The majority of us consume too much salt , which increases blood pressure and puts us at risk for heart attack and stroke . "
New York has partnered with cities , states and national health organizations across the country with the goal of cutting the salt in packaged and restaurant foods gradually by 25 percent over five years .
Doing that would reduce the nation 's salt intake by 20 percent , Angell said .
The average American adult consumes about 3,400 to 3,500 milligram of sodium a day , while most people only need about 1,500 , she said .
The excess sodium does not come from salting food at the table or while cooking , but from pre-packaged food and restaurant meals , which Angell said amount to nearly 80 percent of the average person 's total sodium intake .
" Consumers can always add salt to food , but they can't take it out , " Dr. Thomas Farley , the city 's health commissioner , said in a written statement .
" If we can reduce the sodium levels in packaged and restaurant foods , we will give consumers more choice about the amount of salt they eat and reduce their risk of heart disease and stroke in the process . "
The only way to do this , according to Angell , is to get the food industry onboard .
During the past year , city officials have met with industry leaders , company representatives , restaurant owners and health experts to come up with a plan .
The result of their meetings is a list of proposed benchmarks for 61 categories of packaged foods and 25 classes of restaurant food to help companies and restaurants nationwide gradually reduce sodium .
Subway , one of the companies that advised the health department , says that it is ready to commit to reducing salt in all Subway locations across the country .
" We have been looking at ways to reduce sodium in all of our products , " said Kevin Kane , a spokesman for Subway .
" This seemed like an extension of what we were doing already . "
The company 's most popular product , the 6 - inch turkey sandwich , already meets the recommended sodium criteria for the five - year mark .
But Kane acknowledged that the chain needs to work on getting some of its other offerings to make the grade without affecting the sandwiches ' taste .
Finding that balance between low salt and good taste is not as easy as it sounds .
Campbell Soup Company , which has quadrupled the number of its lower - sodium products in the past five years , is not favorable about the initiative simply because of the quick turnaround .
" We feel really strongly that we share the same goal in reducing sodium , " said Campbell spokeswoman Julie Mandel Sloves .
" However , we think the targets and time frame recommended are quite aggressive . "
Sloves said that reducing the salt content can bring out different flavors in foods .
Campbell taste - tests all of its new products to ensure that consumers respond positively to any changes , she said , and this would be a challenge in the timeline provided .
While it may take some time to find the correct balance , Angell stressed that reducing salt in a food does not mean reducing flavor .
" If salt is reduced gradually , we wo n't notice a difference in our palate , " Angell said .
" Our palate will adjust and we 'll enjoy foods as much as we do now . "
The campaign against salt is the latest of several health initiatives by New York .
In 2006 the city required restaurants to phase out use of trans fats , a goal it said last year had been largely met .
The city has also campaigned against high - calorie fast foods and is urging people to choose low - calorie beverages .
Below the densely forested slopes of the Appalachian Mountains in southern West Virginia is a layer cake of thin coal seams .
To uncover this coal profitably , mining companies engineer large — sometimes very large — surface mines .
This time - series of images of a surface mine in Boone County , West Virginia , illustrates why this controversial mining method is also called “ mountaintop removal . ”
Based on data from Landsat 5 , 7 , and 8 , these natural - color images document the growth of the Hobet mine as it moves from ridge to ridge between 1984 to 2015 .
The natural landscape of the area is dark green forested mountains , creased by streams and indented by hollows .
The active mining areas appear off - white , while areas being reclaimed with vegetation appear light green .
A pipeline roughly bisects the images from north to south .
The town of Madison , lower right , lies along the banks of the Coal River .
In 1984 , the mining operation is limited to a relatively small area west of the Coal River .
The mine first expands along mountaintops to the southwest , tracing an oak - leaf - shaped outline around the hollows of Big Horse Creek and continuing in an unbroken line across the ridges to the southwest .
Between 1991 and 1992 , the mine moves north , and the impact of one of the most controversial aspects of mountaintop mining — rock and earth dams called valley fills — becomes evident .
The law requires coal operators to try to restore the land to its approximate original shape , but the rock debris generally can’t be securely piled as high or graded as steeply as the original mountaintop .
There is always too much rock left over , and coal companies dispose of it by building valley fills in hollows , gullies , and streams .
Between 1991 and 1992 , this leveling and filling in of the topography becomes noticeable as the mine expands northward across a stream valley called Stanley Fork ( image center ) .
The most dramatic valley fill that appears in the series , however , is what appears to be the near - complete filling of Connelly Branch from its source to its mouth at the Mud River between 1996 and 2000 .
Since 2004 , the mine has expanded from the Connelly Branch area to the mountaintops north of the Mud River .
Significant changes are apparent to the ridges and valleys feeding into Berry Branch by 2009 .
The images from 2013 and 2015 show some green - up of restored lands .
The images also show expanded operations in the southwest and northeast .
Over the 31 - year period , the disturbed area grew to more than 10,000 acres ( 15.6 square miles ) .
According to a report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , nearly 40 percent of the year - round and seasonal streams in the Mud River watershed upstream of and including Connelly Branch had been filled or approved for filling through 1998 .
In 2009 , the EPA intervened in the approval of a permit to further expand the Hobet mine into the Berry Branch area , and worked with mine operators to minimize the disturbance and to reduce the number and size of valley fills .
In 2010 , the EPA reported that Hobet 45 mine met the requirements of the Clean Water Act .
Generals ’
War
I missed a few subtle points in last week ’s piece on the escalating contention between Apple and Google .
The first is that what I ’m talking about is outright hostility , not just mere competition .
We ’re well past the point where there ’s any question whether Google and Apple are rivals , specifically in regard to Android - vs. - iPhone , and soon Chrome OS - vs. - iPad .
Of course they ’re competitors .
That ’s good , and a normal aspect of capitalism .
I ’m saying there ’s something else going on , something more vicious .
Outright hostility .
The difference between rival and enemy .
The other thing I neglected to mention , and I think it ’s important , is that this is all taking place at the executive and upper - management levels .
The engineers — at both companies — are neither prepared nor relishing this .
I have sources at both companies ( more at Apple than Google , unsurprisingly , but more at Google than just about any company other than Apple ) , almost all of whom are engineers and none are “ executives ” , and the word that keeps popping up regarding this situation is “ weird ” .
That there ’s a meeting at Apple where Google comes up , or vice versa , and the managers are talking about waging war — vicious , angry talk .
Outright hostility just does n’t feel right to the engineers at either company .
It is weird .
There are decided and very obvious cultural differences between the two companies .
Apple engineers tend to think Google makes ugly ( but effective , smart ) software , and they ’re suspicious of Google ’s “ we want all of your data ” strategy .
Google engineers see that Apple does n’t get the web — or at least the web as a software platform — and consider that quaint , and they ’re flat - out offended by Apple ’s autocratic control of the App Store .
But , on the whole , the engineers at each company like each other .
There are a lot of Apple engineers who use Google services and a lot of Google engineers who use Apple computers .
Neither company has cultivated an internal culture like , say , that of the Microsoft of old — an “ us against the world ” mindset , where you know when you sign up for the gig that the goal is n’t merely to succeed , but to destroy the competition .
This is a generals ’ war .
The rank - and - file at Apple and Google are n’t looking for battle , or even expecting it .
On the other hand , Google is not as monolithic a company as Apple .
Much attention has been drawn to Steve Jobs ’s comments regarding Google at an internal Apple “ town hall ” meeting a few days after the iPad introduction in January .
In particular , the second - hand paraphrasing reported by John C. Abell at Wired .
As Abell reported it , and as most other outlets have picked it up :
On Google :
We did not enter the search business , Jobs said .
They entered the phone business .
Make no mistake they want to kill the iPhone .
We wo n’t let them , he says .
After I linked to Abell ’s report at Wired , a source who was at the town hall meeting told me :
“ He actually said ‘ teams at Google want to kill us . ’
He never said it in a way that made it sound like the whole company did .
Mostly just the Android team . ”
After my piece last week , another source from Apple emailed me to reiterate that Jobs , at the Town Hall , was emphatic about there only being “ some teams ” at Google that want to kill the iPhone , not Google as a whole .
That , yes , Jobs sounded furious about it , but that it was clear that his anger was n’t directed at Google as a whole but rather Android in particular .
That alone could make for something ugly , though .
Sydney University has set up a specialised program to help people with Asperger 's syndrome - a form of autism spectrum disorder that affects communication skills and coordination - learn how to drive safely .
Like most young men in their early twenties , Daniel Hammond is keen for the independence that comes with a driving licence .
" I 'll be able to drive myself to my social activities , and it will help with getting a job and it'll just give me the confidence that I can drive somewhere without mum having to drive me there , " he said .
Like many learner drivers , his first teacher was his mum .
But those lessons did not go so well .
" It was a bit stressful because she knew a lot about me but I think she just did n't know how to teach me , " he said .
" In lane changing because you 've got to decide when to lane change and you 're moving a car at the same time and turning your head .
So there 's a lot of different movements at once . "
It is a common experience for people with Asperger 's syndrome who often experience increased anxiety .
Beth Cheal , an occupation therapist and the director of the University of Sydney 's driver rehabilitation unit , says it is difficult for people with Asperger 's syndrome to coordinate their movements while driving .
" It can be difficult for someone with Asperger 's for their arms to cross the middle of their body , their midline , " she said .
" So that means , for example , steering a steering wheel can be hard and it can be really hard to coordinate that .
" So if someone with Asperger 's goes out on the road and has a lot of difficulty in those areas , they can really lose confidence and give up . "
' Patience ' is the key
Ms Cheal is involved in a new program to help people with Asperger 's syndrome get their license .
The first step is a three - hour assessment in which applicants undergo tests for their eyesight , physical health and learning skills .
Then , the learner drivers have 25 one - hour lessons .
" Just drive around the car park for the first lesson because if you take someone like that out onto Parramatta Road , you 'll never get them back in a car , " she said .
Ms Cheal says many program participants start slowly and Daniel Hammond was no exception .
" When we saw Daniel he pretty much could only stay in one street and we had to focus a lot on just using the brake and accelerator and just very simple turning , " she said .
" Early on if you looked at him you would have thought ' here 's someone who 's really going to struggle with driving , will they ever get there ?'
" But with a few special techniques and a bit of patience , now he 's just a beautiful driver and just about to pass his RTA test . "
Dean McMillan is one of the programs driving instructors and has worked in rehabilitation services for 20 years .
" It 's more just being very patient , very consistent with what you 're teaching , keeping little , baby steps of teaching so you 're not being too complicated and throw in too much information , " he said .
Only about half the people taking driving tests pass the first time round .
The university 's chair of occupational therapy , Professor Anita Bundy , says this program is aiming at similar or better results .
" It 's very important for us to understand whether or not what we 're doing is effective , " she said .
" It 's stressful for everyone to get a licence and it's more stressful for people with Asperger 's and any sort of disability .
" But on top of that , we need to be really clear about what is effective and what is not effective and is what we 're doing more effective than sending someone to just a regular driving school ? "
Daniel Hammond will make his second attempt at getting a licence soon .
He says driving alone will give him a great sense of achievement .
" It will take time and persistence but after a while you 'll be able to become a good confidence driver and it'll be something you 'll be proud of , " he said .
He is hoping it will be second time lucky .
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia 
The United States fears that Iran is drifting toward a military dictatorship , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday , with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps seizing control of large swaths of Iran ’s political , military and economic establishment .
Mrs. Clinton encouraged Iran ’s religious and political leaders to rise up against the Revolutionary Guards , coming as close as any senior administration official has to inviting political upheaval in the country .
“ That is how we see it , ” Mrs. Clinton said at a televised town hall - style meeting of students at a university in Doha , Qatar .
“ We see that the government of Iran , the supreme leader , the president , the Parliament is being supplanted and that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship . ”
Her blunt comments carried particular resonance because of where they were delivered , in Qatar , a Persian Gulf emirate with close ties to Iran , and later in the day , in Saudi Arabia .
But they built on the administration ’s strategy of branding the Revolutionary Guards as an “ entitled class ” that is the principal culprit behind Iran ’s nuclear proliferation and political repression .

In a nutshell , he details how to set up a proxy using FoxyProxy with Firefox or an extension called Proxy Switchy ! with Chrome .
In each case , he sets up the extension in use with a proxy located in the U.K. to access the iPlayer .
Update : Some people reported problems with the proxy server the reader used in the screenshots .
Remember , if you 're having trouble , you should be able to simply turn the proxy off .
Most people having trouble appear to be using Chrome , so with Proxy Switchy , that means you 'd simply switch back to Direct Connection .
I have n't been able to recreate any of the problems reported by some readers , but as far as I can tell that should take care of the problem .
As detailed below , you can always go hunting for another proxy that will work .

All in all , it 's a good primer for using proxy extensions inside Firefox and Chrome , whether or not you want to access the BBC iPlayer .
The same basic steps , with a different proxy substituted depending on where you wanted to access content , should work almost anywhere , as the author points out :
If you want to access this to get in to Hulu or another site that only lets you in if you are in a certain geographical area you just need to search google for [ insert target country here ] proxies .
Then put the IP address and port number in the correct places .

Since the beginning of time , the naked female form has been depicted in paintings , drawings and engravings .
In 1839 , artists began to work with different creative mediums to depict the nude form .
But those were prudish times so this type of art was kept discreet for several years .
After the end of WWII and into the 1950s , the pinup girl phenomenon started to gain popularity when well - known film stars like Marilyn Monroe were photographed showing off their bare legs , short skirts , swimsuits and ( rarely ) naked breasts .
In 1953 , Playboy started gaining worldwide attention for their erotic photography and set the scene for male - market magazines .
Shortly after , in 1963 , Penthouse emerged and was the first to display female genitals , with models looking directly into the camera and enticing the viewer , something you ’ll come across often with the websites in this category .
Those publishers , along with Hustler , grew to become the most sought after mediums in which to enjoy erotic photography that emphasized the sensuality of the female form .
You can now subscribe to some of those magazines online , as well as other top photo sites , and enjoy a wealth of content featuring stripteases , lingerie , burlesque shows and glamour shots of babes posing seductively .

The following series of stories detail some of what happened in 2003 and 2004 after then Harvard - sophomore Mark Zuckerberg launched a site called the Facebook.com .
This site , of course , quickly grew into the dominant global site known as Facebook , which is now used by some 400 million people a month .
The stories are based on a long investigation into the origins of Facebook that included interviews with more than a dozen sources familiar with aspects of what happened , as well as what we believe to be relevant IMs and emails from the period .
Much of the information has never been reported .
The stories detail some troubling behavior by Facebook 's then 19 - year old founder and CEO , Mark Zuckerberg , including using members ' Facebook login information to break into members ' private email accounts and hacking into a competitor 's site and changing user profiles .
A source close to the company suggests that the fallout from this behavior has played a profound role in shaping Facebook 's current privacy policies and Mark 's current attitudes and conduct as a now 25 - year old CEO .
One can only hope so .

Polymer can reversibly take on a range of different shapes in response to changes in temperature
A US researcher has shown how a so - called shape memory polymer - a material which can take on a temporary shape and then return to its permanent shape in response to an external stimulus - has the unusual ability to ’ memorise ’ a whole range of different shapes and can be prompted to change formation in response to finely tuned temperature triggers .
The work opens up the prospect of developing new smart polymers that can adopt a range of shapes depending on a given trigger .
Shape memory polymers can be programmed to hold a particular temporary conformation which reverts to a different , permanent shape when heat is applied .
To do this the temporary shape is formed within a phase transition of the polymer - for example the glass transition where the molecules of the polymer change from a ’ frozen ’ glassy state to a more mobile ’ rubbery ’ state upon heating .
The vast majority of shape memory polymers can hold only one temporary shape within their memory because they have only one transition state .
Now , however , Tao Xie at the General Motors Research and Development Center in Michigan has shown that some polymers can be programmed to hold at least three temporary shapes , and possibly more , despite only having a single transition state .
Xie investigated the shape memory of the commercially available polymer Nafion - a perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer used as a membrane in fuel cells .
Nafion has a broad glass transition temperature , ranging from around 55 ? C to 130 ?C .
By heating and stretching a strip of the polymer above its glass transition temperature , it retains a permanent shape .
’ If you then cool it to say 90 ? C and apply a different force , such as bending , you can give it a temporary shape , ’ says Xie .
’ Cooling it further to 60 ?
C and applying another force you can give it another [ temporary ] shape , and cooling it to 20 ?
C you can programme a third shape . ’
This process acts to ’ programme ’ the material , Xie explains , with different shapes associated with specific temperatures .
’ All you need to do [ then ] is heat it up to 60 ?
C and it resumes the shape you locked into it at that temperature , at 90 ?
C it resumes another shape , and at 140 ?
C the permanent shape is recovered . ’
Because of the broad transition temperature range , many discrete shapes can be programmed into the polymer .
And within this range , says Xie , any temperature can be chosen - making the system highly tunable .
Nafion itself is however a poor candidate for bulk processing .
The hunt is now on , says Xie , for more processable polymers that have broad transition temperature ranges .
Andreas Lendlein , a shape memory polymer expert at the GKSS Research Centre in Teltow , Germany , says that Xie ’s discovery of the ’ favourable , versatile ’ shape - memory properties of Nafion was ’ surprising . ’

Advertisement An Icelandic volcano , dormant for 200 years , has erupted , ripping a 1 km - long fissure in a field of ice .
The volcano near Eyjafjallajoekull glacier began to erupt just after midnight , sending lava a hundred metres high .
Icelandic airspace has been closed , flights diverted and roads closed .
The eruption was about 120 km ( 75 miles ) east of the capital , Reykjavik .
About 500 people were moved from the area , a civil protection officer said .
" We estimate that no - one is in danger in the area , but we have started an evacuation plan and between 500 and 600 people are being evacuated , " Sigurgeir Gudmundsson of the Icelandic civil protections department told the Agence France - Presse news agency .
The area is sparsely populated , but the knock - on effects from the eruption have been considerable .
A state of emergency is in force in southern Iceland and transport connections have been severely disrupted , including the main east - west road .
" Ash has already begun to fall in Fljotshlid and people in the surrounding area have reported seeing bright lights emanating from the glacier , " RUV public radio said on its website .
" It was a bit scary , but still amazing to see , " Katrin Moller Eiriksdottir , who lives in Fljotshlid , told the BBC News website .
" The ash had started falling and we could n't leave the car . "
Three Icelandair flights , bound for Reykjavik from the United States , were ordered to return to Boston , RUV radio reported .
Domestic flights were suspended indefinitely , but some international flights were scheduled to depart on Sunday .
There had initially been fears that the volcano could cause flooding , as it causes ice to melt on the glacier above it , but that scenario appears to have been avoided .
However , it could cause more activity nearby , scientists say .
" This was a rather small and peaceful eruption but we are concerned that it could trigger an eruption at the nearby Katla volcano , a vicious volcano that could cause both local and global damage , " said Pall Einarsson , a geophysicist at the University of Iceland 's Institute of Earth Science , Associated Press news agency reported .
As the eruption is taking place in an area that is relatively ice free , there is little chance of a destructive glacier burst like the one that washed away part of the east - west highway four years ago , after an eruption under the vast Vattnajoekull glacier .
Iceland lies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , the highly volatile boundary between the Eurasian and North American continental plates , with quakes and eruptions .
The last volcanic eruption in the Eyjafjallajoekull area occurred in 1821 .

In January , on the first day of the Computer Science 106A : Program Methodology course at Stanford University , Eric Roberts , the professor , began with his customary admonition : Cheat , and you will be caught .
And , he added : Cheat , and your classmates will suffer .
More weight will be given to the final exam when calculating the final grade .
These are not idle threats in a department where it may be easy to cheat ( cut , paste some code , voila ! ) but it is just as easy to detect cheating .
( It is the computer science department , after all ) .
Jay de la Torre , a senior , was caught and has been suspended this quarter as part of his punishment .
Mr. de la Torre was taking the computer science class for a second time in his junior year when he cheated .
After he was disciplined , he resigned from his position as student body vice president in November , The Stanford Daily reported .
“ I was n’t even thinking of how it easy it would for me to be caught , ” he said .
Cases in which students borrow code in computer - science classes make up a disproportionate share of the honor - code violation situations heard by the university ’s judicial panel .
Last year , according to a new report , cheating incidents in computer science classes accounted for 22 percent of the total honor - code violations , The San Jose Mercury News reported .
Historically , the computer science department accounts for between 20 to 60 percent of all honor - code cases , even though the courses represent about 7 percent of student enrollment .
Most of the violations come from introductory classes like CS 106A .
About 1,000 students will have taken the course by the end of the year , with more than 75 percent of students passing through a computer science introductory course before the end of their time at Stanford .
“ There is a perception that cheating is going to be a lot harder to detect than they think it is going to be , ” said Professor Roberts , who wrote a paper in 2002 on the “ strategies of using technology in the teaching of ethics . ”
“ Programs are idiosyncratic as sentences and no two are alike , ” he said .
“ They are not even comparable if they are independently generated .
It ’s particularly easy to detect if they ’ve been copied . ”
Stanford ’s honor code was established in 1921 and states that students will not plagiarize , copy work or get outside help .
The computer science department currently employs a computerized watchdog , a software program that scans a student ’s code on homework assignments .
It compares the assignment not only with other students ’ work but also with assignments turned in from previous years .
Even with that deterrent , which most students are well aware of , Professor Roberts conceded that the nature of computer science assignments made it easier to cheat — some copying , pasting and added keystrokes could often be sufficient for those hoping to beat the system .
Perhaps the temptation to cheat is even stronger in computer science than other disciplines , said R. J. Walsh , a computer science major and a teaching assistant in the department .
“ CS is not like an English paper where you can just turn it in and there ’s not a way to say if it ’s a good paper or not , ” he said .
“ At 3 a.m , you can be looking a program and definitively say that it ’s not going to work . ”
The number of honor code violations have prompted Professor Roberts to implement a new system .
Describing this method as a “ collective incentive ” for students to maintain academic standards , the professor said he will add 5 percent for every honor - code violation in his class to the weight of the final exam , which is currently 15 percent of the class grade .
In other words , if one person cheats , the whole class will face more pressure on the final exam , because it will make up a greater portion of a person ’s grade .
Whether the scorn of fellow students is a bigger deterrent to cheating than being personally disciplined by the university remains to be seen .
Mr. de la Torre said that in retrospect , cheating was n’t worth it .
“ It did n’t allow me to show what I was capable of , ” he said .
“ It caused me to question myself as a person . ”
The study did not indicate whether honor - code violators in computer science courses tended to be computer science majors or other students taking the courses to fulfill general education requirements .
But in an interview , Jack Dubie , a junior majoring in computer science , said that students taking introductory courses might be more vulnerable to the temptation .
He said :
Republican congressman - turned - Libertarian Bob Barr got a chorus of jeers at the CPAC conference Friday when he declared that waterboarding is torture .
Debating the issue of whether terrorist suspects should be read Miranda rights and should have access to civilian courts , Barr argued that politicians are being allowed “ to have their cake and eat it too ” by choosing whether to place defendants in civilian courts or military tribunals .
Barr said the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 provided the framework for how to deal with terrorist suspects , and said government officials should stick to that law .

“ Either we believe , as lawyers , as lawmakers and as citizens , that there is value in laws , that laws that are passed have meaning and have a purpose , or we dont , ” Barr said .
“ But I do n’t think that we should go down the path of allowing our leaders to have their cake and eat it too .
There ’s nothing magical about military tribunals , they do n’t have necessarily better lawyers than in the civilian sector .
I think I have more faith in our US attorneys , who are non-political , than my colleagues on the other side of this debate do , ” Barr continued .
“ We can try them , we should try them .
That is precisely what out law provides for .
And the first time we ’re faced with a situation we say , ‘ Oh , we want to have them to go to the military , let them torture them for a while . ’
It ’s not advanced interrogation techniques .
Waterboarding is torture . ”
That comment was met with a smattering of applause and gasps among the audience at the conservative conference , but the applause was quickly drowned out by loud jeers .
By comparison , earlier in the debate , US House Rep. Dan Lundgren ( R - CA ) got an enthusiastic round of applause when he declared , “ I support enhanced interrogation . ”

There ’s some fascinating new research about “ CO2 domes , ” invisible clouds of carbon pollution that hover above urban areas .
Bradford Plumer at The New Republic does a great job setting the context :
Does it matter where carbon dioxide is emitted ?
From a climate perspective , at least , the standard answer has always been , “ Not really . ”
Carbon dioxide mixes pretty evenly and uniformly throughout the atmosphere , so that the heat - trapping gases coming out of a factory in China have the same effect on global temperatures , pound for pound , as the greenhouse gases emitted by , say , cars in Delaware .
( This is in contrast to a number of other air pollutants , whose effects are often localized — sulfur dioxide only causes acid rain in discrete areas . )
The new finding :
But a new study just published in Environmental Science and Technology by Stanford ’s Mark Jacobson adds a slight twist to this standard view .
Older research has found that local “ domes ” of high CO2 levels can often form over cities .
What Jacobson found was that these domes can have a serious local impact :
Among other things , they worsen the effects of localized air pollutants like ozone and particulates , which cause respiratory diseases and the like .
As a result , Jacobson estimates that local CO2 emissions cause anywhere from 300 to 1,000 premature deaths in the United States each year .
And presumably the problem ’s much worse in developing countries .
Mark Jacobson , professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Atmosphere / Energy Program at Stanford , has been vocal about the need for a complete clean - energy transformation .
This week , with the political world consumed by health care , his work offers a reminder that carbon pollution is a serious health problem .
It makes traditional air pollution — such as particulates and ozone — more harmful , so it poses particular threats to the places with the worst air pollution — cities .
Here ’s a map of CO2 released from fossil fuels ( with red and yellow marking the biggest pollution points ) , compiled from 2002 data by the Vulcan Project at Purdue University .
It ’s a map of emissions , which is n’t quite the same as airborne concentrations , but it gives a sense of where pollution happens :
Map courtesy of Purdue University Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
Jacobson ’s urban - dome research presents two implications worth teasing out :
Trouble for cap - and - trade ?
The new evidence adds a wrinkle to cap - and - trade plans by suggesting that it matters where pollution happens .
Cap - and - trade rests on the assumption that a ton of carbon has the same impact regardless of where it ’s emitted , so it does n’t matter if a factory in Nashville and a power plant in Phoenix trade emission permits .
It only matters where emissions can be reduced most cheaply .
But , says Jacobson , “ This study contradicts that assumption . ”
Stanford ’s press release on the research plays up the contradiction ; “ Urban CO2 domes increase deaths , poke hole in cap - and - trade proposal , ” blares the headline .
If the research proves correct , it does n’t argue against cap - and - trade so much as highlight the need for a multi-pronged approach to CO2 regulation .
The Clean Air Act can set plant - by - plant performance standards while a declining cap covers the broader economy .
( That ’s the approach taken by the Kerry / Boxer Clean Energy Jobs & American Power Act . )
So the study should n’t be used to entirely discount the idea of cap - and - trade plans–but that does n’t mean it wo n’t be .
Urban vs. rural .
Jacobson ’s research also pits the interests of rural and urban communities against each other .
Cities could stand to suffer more under climate change , but the senators representing large urban areas already have proportionately less power to push through legislation that would curb CO2 pollution .
California , with its 37 million residents and numerous polluted urban areas , has two senators who want to enact climate legislation ; Wyoming , with 540,000 residents and vast expanses of rural land , has two senators who oppose climate legislation .
Urban and rural areas have already been at odds over climate policy — and that was before we had any evidence that cities might really get the short end of the stick .
The “ domes ” research provides more fodder for the fight .
It underscores the essential unfairness of the effects of carbon pollution , and raises the question of just how much Wyoming should have to say about the health of Californians .
SEOUL , South Korea — Henry Kissinger , the former United States secretary of state , was hospitalized here because of stomach pains on Saturday .
But his condition has quickly improved , said a spokesman for Yonsei University ’s Severance Hospital in Seoul .
“ There is nothing serious about his condition , ” Lee Seong - man , the hospital spokesman , said during a telephone interview .
“ His condition is continuing to improve , and in a case like this , we expect him to leave hospital tomorrow . ”
Mr. Kissinger , 86 , was brought to the hospital on Saturday morning for abdominal pains , Mr. Lee said .
The spokesman said that he had no further details on Mr. Kissinger ’s condition .
Mr. Kissinger arrived in Seoul on Wednesday and the next day delivered a speech at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies , a private think tank .
On Friday , he met South Korea President Lee Myung - bak and was reportedly scheduled to leave Seoul on Saturday .
# 29 : THD by Ian Miller
THD , by Ian Miller .
Copyright Ian Miller .
This analysis copyright 2010 by Scott M. McDaniel
The Image
Last week I told how Ian Miller pointed me to Albrecht Dürer .
He had a table at the first Illuxcon and had some of his fantastic ink drawings on display .
It was great to be able to get up close to see just what was going on , because unlike most comics inking you could n’t really see the individual lines until you got up close .
For example , I remember looking at Castles for quite a while .
I ’d like to thank him for providing a high resolution version of THD for the analysis .
I first saw it on his web site , and he was kind enough to send a version I could use to take detail images .
THD is an ink drawing , but then he colored it , I ’m guessing with watercolor .
I ’ll go into the color choices and linework , but I ’ll also touch on the composition , concept , and ways he guides our eyes through the picture .
The Composition
Before diving into the linework and detail images , let ’s look at the design of the image .
Great execution in any medium does n’t matter if the picture itself does n’t work .
The first thing to do is pull the color out and look at the arrangement of lights and darks .
The first thing I looked at in the image was the face of the… thing … underground .
Often what we look at first is the area of highest contrast , but there are two reasons I saw the face before the tree above it .
First , as people we ’re primed to see faces , and our eyes go to them before most other things .
Second , I saw it on Miller ’s web site on the artwork page .
It ’s the middle thumbnail in the second row .
Because I ’d already seen that part of the picture , once I clicked through I was primed to look for and recognize that part it .
More of the picture is dark than light .
The exception is the sky around the tree that ’s above ground .
There ’s still plenty of variation , but that tree is the thing with the clearest silhouette .
In the version below I started at the tree since it ’s the object of highest contrast .
To show how values ( brightness ) guide us around the picture , I ’ve plotted the course that my eyes take from there .
In this version , I ’ve simplified the greyscale version down even further .
We see only black , white , and mid-level grey .
Even broken down that much we clearly see what ’s going on .
Starting at the tree ( 1 ) , we follow its course down and right , along the ground .
As we get to the right side of the picture , a closer tree ( 2 ) frames the image and guides our eye down .
The tree ’s root system sets up the first loop , in the middle of which resides the face in the roots ( 3 ) .
As we spin out of that loop we enter another one created by the root systems and rock formations ( 4 ) of the ground .
The center of this loop is empty save for the claw that probably (? ) belongs to the creature we just looked at .
Coming out of that loop , the downward slope of the ground takes us over to the lower left part of the picture , where another framing tree ( 5 ) brings us back up above ground .
Finally the denuded canopy brings us back to where we began .
The other aspect of THD ’s design I ’ll touch on is the golden section grid .
I think most artists use the golden section concept unconsciously .
Some , like Terry Moore use it explicitly .
I could see an argument either way for THD .
Several elements line up perfectly with the grid , but others do n’t .
We can see that the horizon lies exactly on the upper golden section .
Then there ’s the left side of the tree above ground – that lines up with the left golden section .
The big guy underground is ambiguous , though .
The face itself does n’t lie on any of the grid lines , though it ’s close to the lower line .
Neither is there anything in particular at the grid ’s intersection points .
My guess , then , is that Miller ’s years of design experience led to him creating this naturally .
That is , without actually overlaying the grid or figuring out the exact measurements needed .
Still , I ’d only bet the price of a cup of coffee on that .
The Lines
Let ’s shift gears .
We ’ve been looking at THD as a whole .
Now let ’s zoom way in to see how Miller is getting these values and defining his forms .
I ’ll go ahead and get this out of the way now : yes , there ’s an insane amount of detail work .
How can he possibly do that ?
Wo n’t he go blind ?
For example , let ’s look at the roots / tentacles around the creature ’s face :
Yes , he drew each tentacle .
Then , he hatched each one with simple C’s .
The spacing and thickness of those lines establish value , while their curve defines the form and turns them from flat wiggles into tubes .
Or look at the rock formation to our left of the critter .
Miller uses cross hatching and line direction to establish form and shading there .
While I ’m not completely sure , I think that Miller probably did most of this drawing in ink first and only then went back to add color .
To get an idea of what that might have looked like , I tried to remove the color and leave the black parts of the drawing in this next detail .
It shows the claw that probably belongs to that face .
Here is the color version , followed by the black and white simulation of the ink - only image .
The second detail here is a reasonable approximation of what Miller ’s inkwork looked like to me in person .
I ’ll come back to color more later .
Here , I think it ’s interesting that Miller uses a contour line around the claws but does n’t use them around the roots and rocks right next to it .
That helps the claws stand out – we should notice them before we notice some random roots .
Not even the toes behind the claws have them .
Miller is sparing with contour lines .
Why , then , can we clearly see the change in planes on the rock surface next to the claws ?
He gives each facet its own hatching direction .
Sometimes we see a slight curve to the lines that define form .
Other times the lines are straight .
For darker values he cross hatches in 2 or 3 directions .
Line thickness also comes into play – the lines on the left side of the claws are thicker than the same lines on the top side .
Here is an example of a face on the right - most tree .
This is another example of lines following the form of an object .
The lines around the mouth , for example , remind me of Doré ’s linework .
The forehead has an interesting mix of curved lines that suggest the form and straight horizontal lines that do n’t .
Something else to notice here is that Miller did n’t do all of the hatching work in black .
The grooves on the right side have lines that are green , as does the face ’s cheek .
These lines are lower contrast than black lines would be , so they help define form while reducing the impression of shade and darkness .
Now let ’s look at something I did n’t notice until I saw the larger version of the picture .
These people stand at the foot of the upper tree .
It dwarfs them .
Completely .
Suddenly the tree and creature beneath it take on a completely different scale .
Miller just uses silhouette to suggest them , but they still have a lifelike gesture ( posture ) .
Like the last detail image , we can see green hatching here as well .
It also shows a good example of how Miller handles the finer parts of the tree branches .
Finally , here is a close up of the creature in the lower left corner of the picture .
See if you can pick out the lines that suggest the creatures form .
How about the straight hatching lines that contribute to shading but not form ?
The Colors
We ’ve looked at the colored hatching lines above , but what about the larger role of color ?
A quick look shows that greens and blues dominate .
What ’s your impression of how Miller uses brightness and saturation ?
Did you notice the small bits of red that show up in the creatures ’ eyes ?
Those trace amounts of red as an accent color complete a triad on the color wheel .
I sampled the picture down to 32 colors and plotted them on the color wheel below .
You can get a sense of the brightness by each dot .
The dots closer in to the center are less saturated , tending toward grey .
The ones toward the outside are more saturated , vibrant .
It ’s easy to see the trend on the wheel from blue to green .
For the most part the saturation is at the 50 % mark or below .
I find that interesting because I look at the picture and find it to be pretty saturated .
More of the colors are dark than light , also .
By putting lines around the dots we can see the triad that Miller used .
While I doubt that he sat down and thought , “ I ’m going to use a triad today ! ” that ’s the color scheme that he ended up with .
My guess is that he instinctively knew that a deep red was the right accent color to use with the green and blue scheme of the picture .
Yellow , while bright , would n’t have balanced the blue and green nearly as well .
It would also produce a much narrower triangle on the color wheel .
The Elements
To wrap up we ’ll go through Lee Moyer ’s Elements of a Successful Illustration .
Focus :
It ’s a landscape , and the focus is on the tree above ground and the creature with the root / tentacle system underground .
Composition and Design :
There is a clear path for our eyes through the painting .
Some elements of it line up exactly with the golden sections , while others do n’t .
Palette : Blues and greens , with the accent color ( red ) balancing the two of them on the color wheel .
It ’s got moderate saturation and wide range of light and dark values .
Value : Miller controls value mostly through his hatching and lines .
Mass :
Often the hatching lines indicate the volume of the objects .
Miller uses thickness , spacing , direction , and color of the lines to get subtle effects .
Texture :
The detailed linework gives us a consistent texture throughout the work .
Even when reduced to the point where we ca n’t see individual lines they combine to produce a distinctive look .
Symbolism : I ’m not really sure .
Since I do n’t know the original context I can only guess .
It ’s got enigmatic symbols , how ’s that ?
Micro / Macro : Miller is certainly one for the detail work .
This micro / macro concept is about knowing which details to leave out and which ones to include .
For now I ’ll just mention the pair of people at the base of the tree .
I mentioned that above .
There are also two more people in the lower section , who I did n’t show .
This one small thing makes us re-evaluate the scale of the entire picture .
Ornament :
It ’s easy to get lost in the finely rendered plants and rocks and trees .
Narrative : I do n’t see a specific story in this one picture , but there is certainly a mood of foreboding .
Dark things move beneath the bright surface world .
Juxtaposition : Speaking of dark things and bright surfaces , that juxtaposition of light and dark parts is what this picture is all about .
Stylization : Miller ’s style is distinctive for both his fine and precise linework as well as a certain viewpoint .
See his artwork page for more examples of what I mean , but it should hardly surprise you to know that he has done many covers and illustrations for Lovecraft stories .
Character :
The creatures we see in this painting seem more like forces than specific individuals .
It ’s the landscape itself that has the character .
Tension :
When and how will the darkness underneath come into the open ?
How will it affect the tree above and the people ’s world ?
Line : Miller ’s lines provide texture , values , and form .
The one thing Miller does n’t use them for extensively is outline .
Research / Reference : I do n’t know , but my guess is that Miller did not use much reference for this .
He knows his plants ( real and imagined ) as well as his geology .
Vignette :
The real silhouette for us to see is the central tree .
As a landscape , vignette is not a major part of the painting .
Perspective :
There is no need for vanishing points and formal perspective here , but Miller does use atmospheric perspective .
There is a structure of some sort in the far distance .
Also , Miller uses fewer black lines on the central tree .
It ’s further from our viewpoint than the creatures in the foreground .
He still hatches the tree to define form , it ’s just that more of the lines are green rather than black .
The reduced contrast pushes the tree further into the distance .

The uneasy truce between Google and China broke down yesterday when the company announced it would no longer censor search results on its domestic search engine , Google.cn .
So far everyone seems fixated on the decision - making in the Googleplex headquarters , but ultimately this episode tells us more about Beijing than it does about Google .
Within minutes of the announcement , mainland users were calling up page listings on Tibet , Falun Gong and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre that had been hidden for ...

Napa Valley Spotlight in California
Located just an hour from San Francisco , this northern California oasis crawls with happy oenophiles hopping from one winery to the next , especially during harvest season .
A meal aboard the vintage Napa Valley Wine Train is a must , but there ’s more to the area than vineyards and tastings .
With a towering skyline , romantic sunsets , and Waikiki Beach , Honolulu plays host to jet - setting high rollers , down - home surfers , and winter - weary families alike .
Hit the beach first , then reward yourself for carting around all that snorkel and scuba gear with Honolulu ’s favorite dessert , a shave ice .
Once sufficiently waterlogged , take in a luau before heading back to the mainland .

Jaime Escalante , the East Los Angeles math teacher whose story inspired the 1988 movie Stand and Deliver starring an Oscar - nominated Edward James Olmos , died at his son ’s Reno , Nevada , home Tuesday after a lengthy battle with bladder cancer .
He was 79 .
From his classroom at Garfield High School , the real - life hero completely transformed the school ’s math curriculum and pushed his struggling students to master advanced math and science courses .
At one point , Garfield had the fifth - highest number of advanced placement calculus students in the country .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Escalante left the school in 1991 and taught in Sacramento before retiring to his native Bolivia in 2001 .
He is survived by his wife , two sons and six grandchildren – and a countless number of successful students .
Nora Gonzalez , who attended Garfield from 1982 to 1985 – and took Algebra 2 , Trig , Math Analysis and Calculus from Escalante – told PEOPLE earlier this month : “ It makes such a difference to have had a teacher who is as dedicated and giving to his students as Mr. Esclanate was .
This man stayed late working with his students ,
He worked with us through recesses and lunches and weekends .
He was there for us , for every one of us who was willing to work .
“ There were no limits to how giving he was to his students , and he could always explain things in a way that we could understand what he was talking about . ”
Gonzalez , who today is a school principal , also said , : “ His passion for teaching was inspiring to me .
The only reason that I went into teaching was because of this man .
He treated each of us like we were his own children .
I would feel selfish sometimes , like he spent more time with us than he did his own children .
It is because of him that I am who I am today . ”

Rio de Janeiro , Brazil Naked samba dancing at the street carnival !
It 's carnival time in Brazil , and around a million people are enjoying the naked samba dancing in Rio de Janeiro at the world - famous street party .
The victims both died from a bacteria infection called listeriosis after eating the cheese .
Six people were killed in Austria itself .
A company called Prolactal produced the cheese in the town of Hartberg .
The source of the bacteria was found by searching through the shopping lists of those who had been taken ill .
The listeriosis cases increased in October 2009 and the cheese was identified as the cause at the beginning of January , Ulrich Herzog from the Austrian Ministry for Health told TV channel ORF .
A big German food chain reacted immediately by removing the product from the shelves .
A different cheese made by the same company was also recalled as a precaution .
What are the results of the listeriosis ?
The bacteria found in the cheese can cause a serious disease .
The infection mostly remains unidentified in healthy people , sometimes appearing as a light flu .
But a serious case of disease can lead to blood poisoning , brain swelling and ultimately death .
Those most at risk are pregnant women , the sick , children and , above all , weak older people .
Deaths are most likely amongst the elderly .
It remains unclear whether the dangerous infections will lead to more deaths – in extreme cases the disease can take 70 days to develop .
The Austrian Ministry of Health has reported that the listeria bacteria results in the deaths of 30 per cent of the people who contract it .
According to the Austrian press agency APA , the company unbelievably had known about the positive samples since autumn 2009 .
They had already come across the bacteria last year in the Prolactal lab , a senior source claimed .
Furthermore , in addition to the listeria contamination , the hygienic conditions of the firm were partly “ slipshod ” , the source added .
Staff reportedly had to sample products which were already out of date to determine their edibility .
But the company has denied this accusation and said that their workers were not test subjects .
The public prosecutor 's office in Graz is already looking into the matter , ORF reported .
Spokesman Manfred Kammerer said an investigation was automatically triggered due to the media reports because of the possibility that a criminal act was committed .

Concluding this week ’s theme of iconoclasm and “ outside the Buddha - box ” insight , I offer this essay by one of my favorite dharma teachers , Thanissaro Bhikkhu .
The provocative title says it all : Freedom from Buddha Nature .
What ?
A Buddhist teacher who says that there is no innate , inherent Buddha nature ?
Is n’t that a cornerstone of Buddhist teaching ?
No , actually , this concept of a Buddha nature is not universal in Buddhism .
The term is not even found in the Pali canon , the earliest teachings attributed to the Buddha .
Nor is the idea of an inherent Buddha nature part of the Theravadan understanding of what the Buddha taught as the way to Awakening .
From the Theravadan viewpoint , there are problems with the metaphysical assumption of a Buddha nature :
If you assume a Buddha nature , you not only risk complacency but you also entangle yourself in metaphysical thorn patches :
If something with an awakened nature can suffer , what good is it ?
How could something innately awakened become defiled ?
If your original Buddha nature became deluded , what ’s to prevent it from becoming deluded after it ’s re-awakened ?
I ’ve read dozens of incredibly erudite Buddhist philosophical tracts trying to answer these inevitable questions from the standpoint of an innate Buddha nature .
Maybe you have too .
But the point of this post is not to get into a philosophical debate !
My own personal view on the subject is utterly pragmatic — is a view or concept skillful , or not ?
Does a view help bring about an end of suffering , or not ?
I am always open to whatever appears in practice — including whatever shows itself to be unfabricated and permanent .
My heart teacher , Thich Nhat Hanh , uses the view of a Buddha nature very skillfully and takes the idea as a “ given ” of his tradition .
On the other side of the issue , if your tradition and personal practice includes the view of that there is an inherent or innate Buddha nature , does this mean non-belief in an innate Buddha nature is not as “ advanced ” or a “ lesser ” teaching or way ?
Does it mean this non-belief in a Buddha nature is , ispo facto , wrong ?
Well , does a dog have Buddha nature ?
This is a favorite koan of the Zen practitioners .
When you can answer that koan , you can know if the Theravadan view on Buddha nature is right , wrong , right and wrong , or neither right nor wrong !
Seriously , folks , “ Ca n’t we all … just … get along ? ”
Ca n’t all Buddhist agree that a cornerstone of the Buddha ’s teaching is what is skillful ?
If you find the concept of a Buddha nature skillful in your practice , then who is to say this is “ wrong ? ”
Likewise , if someone else finds the concept of a Buddha nature a hindrance , then maybe we might want to see why someone thinks that , given their obvious dedication to dharma practice .
So , defenses down , minds open , let ’s have a listen to what this teacher has learned from his own skillful practice of the dharma .
What is there to lose , except our own unexamined preconceptions ?
Freedom from Buddha Nature
by Thanissaro Bhikkhu
“ What is the mind ?
The mind is n’t ‘ is ’ anything . ” — Ajaan Chah
“ The mind is neither good nor evil , but it ’s what knows good and knows
evil .
It ’s what does good and does evil .
And it ’s what lets go of good and lets go of evil . ” — Ajaan Lee
A brahman once asked the Buddha , “ Will all the world reach release [ Awakening ] , or half the world , or a third ? ”
But the Buddha did n’t answer .
Ven. Ananda , concerned that the brahman might misconstrue the Buddha ’s silence , took the man aside and gave him an analogy : Imagine a fortress with a single gate .
A wise gatekeeper would walk around the fortress and not see an opening in the wall big enough for even a cat to slip through .
Because he ’s wise , he would realize that his knowledge did n’t tell him how many people would come into the fortress , but it did tell him that whoever came into the fortress would have to come in through the gate .
In the same way , the Buddha did n’t focus on how many people would reach Awakening but he did know that anyone who reached Awakening would have to follow the path he had found : abandoning the five hindrances , establishing the four frames of reference , and developing the seven factors for Awakening .
What ’s striking about the Buddha ’s knowledge is the implied “ if ” :
If people want to gain Awakening they will have to follow this path , but the choice as to whether they want Awakening is theirs .
The Buddha ’s knowledge of the future did n’t mean that the future was preordained , for people are free to choose .
They can take up a particular course of action and stick with it , or not , as they see fit .
Freedom of choice — foundation of the Buddha ’s teaching
The Buddha thus based all his teaching on freedom of choice .
As he said , if everything were predetermined by things already established in the past , there would be no point in teaching a path to Awakening .
The number of people who would reach Awakening would already have been determined a long time ago , and they would have no need for a path or a teacher .
Those preordained to awaken would get there inevitably as a result of a long - past action or an essential nature already built into the mind .
Those preordained not to awaken would n’t stand a chance .
But these things are not preordained .
No one is doomed never to awaken , but — until you ’ve had your first sight of the deathless at stream - entry — neither is Awakening assured .
It ’s contingent on intentional actions chosen in each present moment .
And even after stream - entry , you ’re constantly faced with choices that will speed up final Awakening or slow it down .
Nibbãna , of course , is independent and unconditioned ; but the act of awakening to nibbãna depends on a path of practice that has to be willed .
It happens only if you choose to give rise to its causes .
This , as the Buddha noted , involves determining to do four things : not to neglect discernment , to preserve truth , to develop relinquishment , and to train for peace .
Assumptions about the Mind
To stick with these four determinations , the mind has to make some assumptions about itself : its power to do the necessary work and to receive the anticipated benefits .
But one of the central features of the Buddha ’s strategy as a teacher was that even though his primary focus was on the mind , he nowhere stated any assumptions about what the mind is .
As he said , if you define yourself , you limit yourself .
So instead he focused his assumptions on what the mind can do .
To begin with , the mind can change quickly .
Normally a master of the apt simile , even the Buddha had to admit that he could find no adequate analogy for how quickly the mind can change .
We might say that it can change in the twinkling of an eye , but it ’s actually faster than that .
And it ’s capable of all sorts of things .
Neither inherently good nor inherently bad , it can do a huge variety of good and bad actions .
As the Buddha said , the mind is more variegated than the animal kingdom .
Think of the many species of fish in the sea , birds in the sky , animals on the land and under the ground , whether extant or extinct :
All of these species are products of minds , and the mind can take on a wider variety of forms than even that .
Kamma ( karma ) does n’t determine everything
This variety comes from the many different choices the mind makes under the influence of ignorance and defilement .
But the mind does n’t always have to be defiled .
Past kamma is not entirely deterministic .
Even though past kamma shapes the range of options open to the mind in the present , it does n’t have to determine present kamma — the intentions by which the mind chooses to fabricate actual experiences from among those options .
Thus present kamma can choose to continue creating the conditions for more ignorance , or not , because present choices are what keep ignorance alive .
Although no one — not even a Buddha — can trace back to when the defilement of ignorance first began , the continued existence of ignorance depends on conditions continually provided by unskillful kamma .
If these conditions are removed , ignorance will disband .
This is why the Buddha said that the mind is luminous , stained with defilements that come and go .
Taken out of context , this statement might be construed as implying that the mind is inherently awakened .
But in context the Buddha is simply saying that the mind , once stained , is not permanently stained .
When the conditions for the stains are gone , the mind becomes luminous again .
But this luminosity is not an awakened nature .
As the Buddha states , this luminous mind can be developed .
In the scheme of the four noble truths , if something is to be developed it ’s not the goal ; it ’s part of the path to the goal .
After this luminosity has been developed in the advanced stages of concentration , it ’s abandoned once it has completed its work in helping to pierce through ignorance .
The Buddha ’s most important assumption about the mind
The fact that the mind ’s own choices can pierce its own ignorance underlies the Buddha ’s most important assumption about the mind :
It can be trained to awaken , to see the causes of ignorance and to bring them to an end .
The primary step in this training is the first determination : not to neglect discernment .
This phrase may sound strange — to what extent do we consciously neglect discernment ?— but it points to an important truth .
Discernment is insight into how the mind fabricates its experiences .
This process of fabrication is going on all the time right before our eyes — even nearer than our eyes — and yet part of the mind chooses to ignore it .
We tend to be more interested in the experiences that result from the fabrication — the physical , mental , and emotional states we want to savor and enjoy .
It ’s like watching a play :
We enjoy entering into the make - believe world on the stage , and prefer to ignore the noises made by the back - stage crew that would call the reality of that world into question .
This ignorance is willed , which is why we need an act of the will to see through it , to discern the back - stage machinations of the mind .
Discernment thus has two sides : understanding and motivation .
You have to understand the mind ’s fabrications as fabrications , looking less for the what — i.e. , what they are — than for the how — how they happen as part of a causal process .
And you have to be motivated to develop this discernment , to see why you want it to have an effect on the mind .
Otherwise it wo n’t have the conditions to grow .
The importance of insight into patterns of cause and effect
The understanding comes down to the basic insight of the Buddha ’s Awakening , seeing things as actions and events in a pattern of cause and effect .
It also involves seeing how some actions are unskillful , leading to stress and suffering , while others are skillful , bringing stress to an end ; and that we have the freedom to choose skillful actions or not .
This understanding — which forms the basic framework of the four noble truths — is called appropriate attention .
The motivation to develop appropriate attention grows from combining good will with this understanding .
You set your sights on a happiness that is totally harmless .
You see that if you make unskillful choices , you ’re going to cause suffering ; if you make skillful ones , you wo n’t .
This motivation thus combines good will with heedfulness , the quality that underlies every step on the path .
In fact , heedfulness lies at the root of all skillful qualities in the mind .
Thus , in encouraging people to want to awaken , the Buddha never had to assume that they were already good or already awakened by nature .
He simply assumed something very basic and ordinary : that people like pleasure and hate pain , and that they care about whether they can gain that pleasure and avoid that pain .
It was a mark of his genius that he could see the potential for Awakening in this very common desire .
Building on Discernment
When you stick with the understanding and motivation provided by this first determination , it sets in motion the other three .
For instance , the determination to preserve the truth grows from seeing the mind ’s capacity to lie to itself about whether its actions are causing suffering .
You want to be honest and vigilant in looking for and admitting suffering , even when you ’re attached to the actions that cause it .
This truthfulness relates to the path in two stages : first , when looking for unskillful actions that keep you off the path ; and then , as the path nears fruition , looking for the subtle levels of stress caused even by skillful elements of the path — such as right concentration — once they have done their work and need to be let go for the sake of full liberation .
The determination to develop relinquishment can then build on this truthful assessment of what needs to be done .
Relinquishment requires discernment as well , for you not only need to see what ’s skillful and what ’s not ; you also need to keep reminding yourself that you have the freedom to choose , and to be adept at talking yourself into doing skillful things you ’re afraid of , and abandoning unskillful actions you like .
The determination to train for peace
The determination to train for peace helps maintain your sense of direction in this process , for it reminds you that the only true happiness is peace of mind , and that you want to look for ever - increasing levels of peace as they become possible through the practice .
This determination emulates the trait that the Buddha said was essential to his Awakening — the unwillingness to rest content with lesser levels of stillness when higher levels could be attained .
In this way , the stages of concentration , instead of becoming obstacles or dangers on the path , serve as stepping - stones to greater sensitivity and , through that sensitivity , to the ultimate peace where all passion , aversion , and delusion grow still .
This peace thus grows from the simple choice to keep looking at the mind ’s fabrications as processes , as actions and results .
But to fully achieve this peace , your discernment has to be directed not only to the mind ’s fabrication of the objects of its awareness , but also at its fabrications about itself and about the path it ’s creating .
Your sense of who you are is a fabrication , regardless of whether you see the mind as separate or interconnected , finite or infinite , good or bad .
The path is also a fabrication : very subtle and sometimes seemingly effortless , but fabricated nonetheless .
If these layers of inner fabrication are n’t seen for what they are — if you regard them as innate or inevitable — they ca n’t be deconstructed , and full Awakening ca n’t occur .
No Innate Nature
This is why the Buddha never advocated attributing an innate nature of any sort to the mind — good , bad , or Buddha .
The idea of innate natures crept into the Buddhist tradition in later centuries , when the principle of freedom was forgotten .
Past bad kamma was seen as so totally deterministic that there seemed no way around it unless you assumed either an innate Buddha in the mind that could overpower it , or an external Buddha who would save you from it .
But when you understand the principle of freedom — that past kamma does n’t totally shape the present , and that present kamma can always be free to choose the skillful alternative — you realize that the idea of innate natures is unnecessary : excess baggage on the path .
And it bogs you down .
If you assume that the mind is basically bad , you wo n’t feel capable of following the path , and will tend to look for outside help to do your work for you .
If you assume that the mind is basically good , you ’ll feel capable but will easily get complacent .
This stands in the way of the heedfulness needed to get you on the path , and to keep you there when it creates states of relative peace and ease that seem so trustworthy and real .
If you assume a Buddha nature , you not only risk complacency but you also entangle yourself in metaphysical thorn patches :
If something with an awakened nature can suffer , what good is it ?
How could something innately awakened become defiled ?
If your original Buddha nature became deluded , what ’s to prevent it from becoming deluded after it ’s re-awakened ?
These points become especially important as you reach the subtle levels of fabrication on the more advanced stages of the path .
If you ’re primed to look for innate natures , you ’ll tend to see innate natures , especially when you reach the luminous , non-dual stages of concentration called themeless , emptiness , and undirected .
You ’ll get stuck on whichever stage matches your assumptions about what your awakened nature is .
But if you ’re primed to look for the process of fabrication , you ’ll see these stages as forms of fabrication , and this will enable you to deconstruct them , to pacify them , until you encounter the peace that ’s not fabricated at all .
Exploring the present possibility of freedom
So instead of making assumptions about innate natures or inevitable outcomes , the Buddha advised exploring the possibility of freedom , as it ’s immediately present each time you make a choice .
Freedom is not a nature , and you do n’t find it by looking for your hidden innate nature .
You find it by looking at where it ’s constantly showing itself : in the fact that your present intentions are not totally conditioned by the past .
You catch your first glimmer of it as a range of possibilities from which you can choose and as your ability to act more skillfully — causing more pleasure and less pain — than you ordinarily might .
Your sense of this freedom grows as you explore and exercise it , each time you choose the most skillful course of action heading in the direction of discernment , truthfulness , relinquishment , and peace .
The choice to keep making skillful choices may require assumptions , but to keep the mind focused on the issue of fabrication the Buddha saw that these assumptions are best kept to a bare minimum : that the mind wants happiness , that it can choose courses of actions that promote happiness or thwart it , that it can change its ways , and that it can train itself to achieve the ultimate happiness where all fabrications fall away .
Testing the limits of freedom
These assumptions are the Buddha ’s starter kit of skillful means to get you on the path of good will , heedfulness , and appropriate attention .
As with any journey , you do best to take along only the bare essentials so that you do n’t weigh yourself down .
This is especially true as you test the limits of freedom , for the closer you come to ultimate freedom , the more you find that things fall away .
First the nouns of natures and identities fall away , as you focus on the verbs of action and choice .
Then the verbs fall away , too .
When the Buddha was asked who or what he was , he did n’t answer with a who or what .
He said simply , “ Awakened ” : a past participle , a verb that has done its work .
Similarly , when the suttas describe the Awakening of an arahant , they say that his or her mind is released from fermentations .
But when they describe how this release is experienced , they simply say , “ With release , there is the knowledge , ‘ Released . ’ ”
No comment on what is released .
Not even , as it ’s sometimes translated , “ It is released . ”
There ’s no noun , no pronoun , just a past participle : “ released . ”
That ’s all , but it ’s enough .

For many foodies and their lefty amigos , Taco Bell belongs in the pantheon of all - time anti-Mexican conspiracies -- a notch below Lou Dobbs but more onerous than the swine flu .
These custodians of cuisine and culture rail against the fast - food behemoth , bemoan how it mongrelizes one of the world ’s great food traditions with its chalupas and enchiritos , its Volcano Menu and cheese roll - ups .
The chain ’s ubiquity makes it just another foot soldier in corporate America ’s drive toward nationwide blandness , they ’ll argue .
And how insulting was that darn Chihuahua campaign from a couple of years ago ?
“ Yo quiero Taco Bell ? ” Muy racist !
Full disclosure : I ’m one of those whiners .
Ever tried one of their burritos ?
Blech .
But with the recent death of Taco Bell ’s founder , Glen Bell , it ’s time to praise the multibillion - dollar powerhouse .
It deserves a spot in Mexican American lore , in the gallery honoring those brave pioneers who helped us join the melting pot -- below Cesar Chavez but higher than George Lopez .
When Bell sold his first crunchy taco in 1951 , Americans outside the Southwest largely were unfamiliar with Mexican society beyond Hollywood ’s banditos and the spicy señoritas of song .
It was the years before the Great Brown Migration , and without a widespread population to introduce Mexican dishes to the general public , the nationwide reputation of Mexican food languished in the realm of slurs -- “ pepper belly , ” “ taco bender ” and the ever - dangerous “ Montezuma ’s revenge . ”
Advertisement
But Bell -- a white man operating a burger stand in San Bernardino ’s Mount Vernon barrio -- saw an opportunity .
“ I figured if Mexican food [ sold in a fast - food environment ] was successful , potential competitors would write it off to my location and assume the idea would n’t sell anywhere else , ” Bell said in his 1999 biography , “ Taco Titan : The Glen Bell Story . ”
He began streamlining the taco - making process , modified Mexican foodstuffs for mainstream acceptance and opened his first Taco Bell in Downey in the early 1960s , franchising nationwide soon after .
“ I did n’t invent the taco , ” he remarked , “ but I believe I improved it . ”
That claim is still debatable , but what ’s certain is that Bell ’s mass - produced version of Mexican food -- owing more to the palate of suburban Southern California than the Empire of the Sun -- caught on across the United States .
It was a more innocent time , one in which communities welcomed encroaching Mexican culture not with protests and vile slurs but with an order for three hard - shell tacos , easy on the sour cream .
Competitors quickly popped up and spread “ Mexican ” food to all corners of the republic long before actual Mexicans arrived .
Some kept versions of Taco Bell ’s original mascot , the archetypal peon sleeping under a cactus ; others modified the food further to match local tastes ( oh , how I ’d love to see gourmand purists react to Taco John ’s , a chain with hundreds of outposts in the upper Midwest whose signature breakfast burrito contains crunchy Tater Tots ) .
It ’s now a multibillion - dollar industry , with Taco Bell firmly on top .
The company ’s introduction of a culinary scaffold on which Americans learned to crave Mexican food proved momentous to American tastes .
Without Taco Bell , salsa would n’t have become as big a seller as ketchup and mustard .
No Taco Bell , then no Doritos empire or Super Bowl Sunday rush for guacamole .
Without Taco Bell , Mexican food would n’t have entered our gustatory vernacular alongside pizza , the hot dog , pita wraps and other vestiges of ethnic America .

Far from warping traditional recipes , the success of Taco Bell - style Mexican eats sparked a backlash led in the 1970s by author and culinary expert Diana Kennedy , and carried to the present day by Rick Bayless and other celebrity chefs to popularize “ authentic ” Mexican dishes so amateur cooks could ditch the taco kit and experience the real deal .
And the continual influx of Mexican immigrants into this country ensures that “ real ” Mexican fare wo n’t soon disappear .
More important , Taco Bell and its spawn became a gateway for Americans to accept Mexicans .
It has n’t been an easy ride , of course , but one smoothed by an endless stream of refried beans and nacho cheese .
If you can sit down and enjoy the cuisine of newcomers , then surely you can start thinking of them as fellow citizens , right ?
And with Taco Bell ’s recent push into international markets , it ’s making as bold a statement as any in the immigration wars , one that ’s downright revolutionary : Mexican food can represent U.S. culture with nary a second thought .
I ate at Taco Bell the other night for the first time in years in honor of Glen Bell , just to see if my bad memories of the chain were still justified .
They were .
My burrito contained bland pinto beans , cheese that tasted like chalk , all within a clammy flour tortilla .
But in front of me in the drive - through line were whites , Asians , even Mexicans , all trying to grab a slice -- scratch that , a taco -- of America .
But here ’s hoping they doused their grub with Tapatio instead of requesting extra packets of Border Sauce Fire -- it ’s still Taco Bell , after all .

More than 100 drivers in Austin , Texas found their cars disabled or the horns honking out of control , after an intruder ran amok in a web - based vehicle - immobilization system normally used to get the attention of consumers delinquent in their auto payments .
Police with Austin's High Tech Crime Unit on Wednesday arrested 20 - year - old Omar Ramos - Lopez , a former Texas Auto Center employee who was laid off last month , and allegedly sought revenge by bricking the cars sold from the dealership 's four Austin - area lots .
" We initially dismissed it as mechanical failure , " says Texas Auto Center manager Martin Garcia .
" We started having a rash of up to a hundred customers at one time complaining .
Some customers complained of the horns going off in the middle of the night .
The only option they had was to remove the battery . "
The dealership used a system called Webtech Plus as an alternative to repossessing vehicles that have n't been paid for .
Operated by Cleveland - based Pay Technologies , the system lets car dealers install a small black box under vehicle dashboards that responds to commands issued through a central website , and relayed over a wireless pager network .
The dealer can disable a car 's ignition system , or trigger the horn to begin honking , as a reminder that a payment is due .
The system will not stop a running vehicle .
Texas Auto Center began fielding complaints from baffled customers the last week in February , many of whom wound up missing work , calling tow trucks or disconnecting their batteries to stop the honking .
The troubles stopped five days later , when Texas Auto Center reset the Webtech Plus passwords for all its employee accounts , says Garcia .
Then police obtained access logs from Pay Technologies , and traced the saboteur 's IP address to Ramos - Lopez 's AT&T internet service , according to a police affidavit filed in the case .
Ramos - Lopez 's account had been closed when he was terminated from Texas Auto Center in a workforce reduction last month , but he allegedly got in through another employee 's account , Garcia says .
At first , the intruder targeted vehicles by searching on the names of specific customers .
Then he discovered he could pull up a database of all 1,100 Auto Center customers whose cars were equipped with the device .
He started going down the list in alphabetical order , vandalizing the records , disabling the cars and setting off the horns .
" Omar was pretty good with computers , " says Garcia .
The incident is the first time an intruder has abused the no-start system , according to Jim Krueger , co-owner of Pay Technologies .
" It was a fairly straightforward situation , " says Krueger .
" He had retained a password , and what happened was he went in and created a little bit of havoc . "
Krueger disputes that the horns were honking in the middle of the night ; he says the horn honking can only be activated between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m .
First rolled out about 10 years ago , remote immobilization systems are a controversial answer to delinquent car payments , with critics voicing concerns that debtors could suffer needless humiliation , or find themselves stranded during an emergency .
Proponents say the systems let financers extend credit to consumers who might otherwise be ineligible for an auto loan .
Austin police filed computer intrusion charges against Ramos - Lopez on Tuesday .

BARELY had the ink dried on a statement by European leaders supporting Greece in its struggle to finance its debts when more bad news emerged from the euro zone .
Figures released on Friday February 12th showed that GDP in the 16 - country currency zone rose by just 0.1 % in the three months to the end of December compared with the previous quarter .
That there was any improvement at all was largely down to France , where a burst of consumer spending lifted the economy by 0.6 % .
In the region 's other big countries , GDP was either flat — as in Germany — or falling , as in Italy and Spain ( see chart below ) .
The main problem is a familiar one : consumers within the euro zone are not spending enough and the strong currency is making it hard to tap demand in the rest of the world .
The best hope for a home - grown stimulus is Germany , where firms and consumers had practised thrift when the rest of the world indulged in a spending boom .
Sadly Germany still relies too heavily on exports .
Consumer spending and investment both fell in the fourth quarter and were it not for a boost from foreign trade , the German economy would have shrunk .
This week Axel Weber , the head of Germany 's central bank , gave warning that cold weather could mean that GDP falls in the current quarter .
Other countries are tapped out .
Spain was once a rich source of internal euro - area demand but its consumers are now weighed down by debts accumulated during a long housing boom .
The unemployment rate is perilously close to 20 % and its rigid jobs markets mean it is unlikely to come down soon .
Bond - market pressures mean Spain 's government is having to withdraw some of its support to the economy sooner than it would like .
The wonder is that Spain is not in a deeper funk .
GDP fell by 3.1 % in the year to the fourth quarter , not much worse than in Germany .
Those two countries ' struggles are two sides of the same coin .
Economies that in good times had enjoyed credit - fuelled consumer booms “ exported ” some of their pain once crisis struck .
In Spain and Greece , consumer spending has fallen far more than output , because a lot of discretionary spending had been on imported goods .
( This is true also of Britain , an important export market for the euro area . )
Foreign suppliers lost orders as well as local firms .
Big exporters , like Germany , felt this particularly hard .
France is bucking the dismal trend in part because its state plays a dominant role in the economy .
Government spending rose by 0.7 % in the fourth quarter , after similar increases in the previous two quarters .
France has done well also because it was not party to the euro - zone 's internal imbalances .
During the boom it had not relied greatly on foreign credit to fund its growth , as had Spain , nor had it been a big supplier of credit and exports to others , as is Germany .
The French economy is large , diversified and more self - contained than many of its euro - zone partners and so has been hurt less by global events .
There is a parallel with Poland , the most resilient of the eastern European economies .
Yet France cannot continue to grow quickly .
There is some small irony in the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , arranging a pan-European statement of support for Greece this week .
The budget deficit in France was a hefty 8 % of GDP last year :
France is hardly a model of fiscal rectitude and may struggle to contain its rising public debt .
The fiscal crisis in Greece has increased the pressure on other countries to put their public finances in order , which will curb GDP growth across the euro zone .
The only bright spot is that the troubles in Greece have brought the euro lower .
For a region that now relies so heavily on spending from without , a weaker currency is sorely needed .

He spent many years in research and as a long - time editor at Johns Hopkins APL .
He was a delightful and serious man , though one of the projects he worked on sounded much more like squeaky scifi than pure sci .
That was Project Pandora , and science fiction it definitely was n’t — it was an attempt at a form of control over human behavior via low level microwave radiation1 .
This came to mind as I was leading through some very low level , high impact behavior control exhibited in a series of social engineering pamphlets published by the Ladies ’
Home Journal in the early 1940’s .
It is heartbreaking , really , to think of people like my mother reading these things and being inundated by cultural architecture that left little to the imagination .
It seems so terrifically outrageous in 2010 ; and of course it makes me wonder about what things that seem so de rigueur today will be the Ladies ’ Home Embarrassments of 2050 .
Granted , nobody 's corneas were being shaken loose via this method , but the effect of the sentiments of control in these pamphlets still seem eye - poppingly strangulating .
I ’ve included only a few examples here , but there are at least a hundred others to choose from .
Perhaps it was the Date - Rate pamphlet that caused most of my teeth to fall out — it is sheer and painful , offering virtually nothing to the young women reading it and practicing its morality play but gender obedience and servility .
“ Did you give him all your attention ? ” “ Did he run things ? ” “ Did you give him a chance to impress you ? ” “ Could you make him laugh ? ”
It is n’t until the final rating question ( # 25 ) that we get to something that opened the possibility of a two - way interest in the relationship , but only barely : “ Did you find you liked the same things ? ”
Its sad , really .
When I read some of this to my 17 - year - old daughter , she just looked at me with an open mouth and eyebrow furrows : it was simply beyond listening to , for her , and certainly not anywhere near worthy of a response .
Of course this is just the tip of the tip of the tippity tip of the iceberg on the control of social thought and the keeping of the male - dominated social order , and its only one part of a very wide spectrum of overall codifications , much of which seem pretty much left to history within two generations .
Today the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) unexpectedly held interest rates at 3.75 % .
No doubt this was in fear of the Australia 's enormous housing bubble that exceeds the height of the bubble that long ago burst in the US.
20 economists predicted the RBA would hike .
Not a single one predicted anything else .
Fear in the board of governors over the pending crash is palpable .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd did not learn a single thing from the US and the disastrous policies of Greenspan .
He gave one last goose to the housing market with $ 14,000 tax credits in a foolish attempt to stem the tide of the global recession that started two years ago .
Prime Minister Rudd brags about Australia 's ability to duck the recession .
It did not work .
All Rudd did was delay the inevitable , fueling an even bigger housing bubble .
The bigger the bubble , the bigger the crash , and rest assured Australia is headed for a housing crash .
Here are a few snips from the Bloomberg article Australia Unexpectedly Keeps Interest Rate at 3.75 % .
The Reserve Bank of Australia kept the overnight cash rate target at 3.75 percent after three increases , it said in Sydney today .
The decision confounded the forecast of all 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey for a quarter - point move , and futures contracts that signaled a 74 percent chance of an increase .
Australia ’s dollar tumbled to a six - week low and Asian stocks pared gains after the announcement sparked concern at the economy ’s ability to withstand higher borrowing costs .
Business confidence fell to a six - month low , a report showed today , and Woolworths Ltd. , the country ’s biggest retailer , warned last week that rate increases would hurt consumers .
Business confidence fell in December to the lowest level in six months , a report by National Australia Bank Ltd. showed today .
The bank ’s sentiment index dropped 11 points to 8 .
Lending to companies “ has continued to fall as companies have sought to reduce leverage , and lenders have imposed tighter lending standards , ” Stevens said today .
“ Credit conditions remain difficult for many smaller businesses , ” he said .
Today ’s decision reduces the serious risk of a policy blunder
Serious Policy Blunder
First Time Buyers In Severe Stress
Almost half of first - home buyers lured into the market by the Rudd Government 's $ 14,000 grant are struggling to meet their mortgage repayments and many are already in arrears on their loans .
Thousands of young home buyers are using credit cards or other loans to meet obligations , while those in " severe stress " are missing payments .
Just weeks after the grant was withdrawn , a survey of more than 26,000 borrowers conducted by Fujitsu Consulting has found 45 per cent of first - home owners who entered the market during the past 18 months are experiencing " mortgage stress " or " severe mortgage stress " .
" The dream of home ownership has turned sour for many thousands of first - home buyers now that the reality of rising interest rates is kicking in , " said Fujitsu Consulting managing director Martin North .
" Rising utility costs and school fees are also cited as reasons for hardship , and many first - home owners are living without proper furniture or carpets as they divert all their cash to their monthly repayments . "
During the past 18 months , more than 135,000 first - home buyers have entered the market , encouraged by the generous grants and stamp - duty relief .
As a result , more than 50 per cent of first - home owners are forecast to be in the " mortgage stress " category by the end of this year .
" This was a disaster waiting to happen , " Steve Keen , professor of economics at the University of NSW , said yesterday .
" The grant panicked first - home buyers to rush into the market , which pushed prices up by far more than the grant itself .
Now we have buyers falling behind with their repayments as rates increase and thousands of owners exposed to the danger of bankruptcy as the situation deteriorates . "
No Lessons Learned
What have Australians learned from Americans over the last 2 years ?
Nothing ! "

Last week Westpac cut its loan - to - value ratio ( LVR ) for new customers to just 87 per cent of the property 's value - a new low for a big bank .
Although it may appear relatively small , such a cut has a disproportionate effect on how much people can borrow and can halve the value of the property they can afford to buy .
" If you have a $ 50,000 deposit and you can get a 95 per cent loan , you are able to bid on a property worth $ 1 million , " said Steve Keen , associate professor of economics at the University of Western Sydney .
" But if the LVR is cut to 90 per cent , your $ 50,000 deposit is only equivalent to 10 per cent deposit on a $ 500,000 property , so the amount you can spend is halved . "
Westpac 's reduction from a maximum LVR of 92 per cent means that buyers with a $ 50,000 deposit will see the maximum that they can afford to pay for a property slashed from $ 625,000 to $ 384,615 .
Somebody with a $ 20,000 deposit would see the amount that they could spend reduced from $ 250,000 to $ 153,846 , says Professor Keen .
Experts are worried that , if other banks follow suit , credit to the property market will be choked off and property prices could collapse .
According to research by broker Mortgage Choice , fewer than half of all new home buyers have a deposit of more than 10 per cent of the property 's value .
" Westpac 's move could affect many thousands of buyers and they will be forced to go to new lenders , " a spokesman said .
" It 's a very worrying development because if others follow suit , we could see the majority of first - home buyers priced out of the market . "
Further restrictions now appear to be inevitable .
" And banks ca n't go on lending forever . "
Lenders have gradually been cutting back the size of loans that they are prepared to offer home buyers .
Just over a year ago , 100 per cent - or even 105 per cent - loans were relatively common .
But over the past 12 months , the LVR has fallen steadily to 95 per cent , then to 90 per cent , and now to 87 for new borrowers approaching Westpac .
It was this same tightening of credit that led to the collapse of property prices in the UK in 2008 , even though the country was still suffering from a massive shortgage of homes at the time .

When Do Bubbles Burst ?
AN ECONOMIST known as the " Merchant of Gloom " will have to walk from Canberra to the top of Australia 's highest mountain after losing a bet about the resiliency of Australian house prices .
Last November , University of Western Sydney associate professor of economics and finance Steve Keen made a high - profile bet with Macquarie Group interest rate strategist Rory Robertson .
The two parts of the bet were that house prices would tank by the end of 2009 and that house prices would fall 40 per cent from their all - time high within 15 years .
The loser of the bet would have to make the more than 200 km trek from Canberra to the top of Mount Kosciuszko wearing a T - shirt that says " I was hopelessly wrong on house prices !
Ask me how . "

Ron Shuffield , president of Esslinger - Wooten - Maxwell Realtors says that " South Florida is working off of a totally new economic model than any of us have ever experienced in the past . "
He predicts that a limited supply of land coupled with demand from baby boomers and foreigners will prolong the boom indefinitely .
" I just do n't think we have what it takes to prick the bubble , " said Diane C. Swonk , chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago , who was an optimist during the 90's .
" I do n't think prices are going to fall , and I do n't think they 're even going to be flat . "
Gregory J. Heym , the chief economist at Brown Harris Stevens , is not sold on the inevitability of a downturn .
He bases his confidence in the market on things like continuing low mortgage rates , high Wall Street bonuses and the tax benefits of home ownership .
" It is a new paradigm " he said .
Flashback October 27 , 2005
Ben S. Bernanke does not think the national housing boom is a bubble that is about to burst , he indicated to Congress last week , just a few days before President Bush nominated him to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve .
U.S. house prices have risen by nearly 25 percent over the past two years , noted Bernanke , currently chairman of the president 's Council of Economic Advisers , in testimony to Congress 's Joint Economic Committee .
But these increases , he said , " largely reflect strong economic fundamentals , " such as strong growth in jobs , incomes and the number of new households .
Flashback February 12 , 2008
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers Tuesday he expects the downtrodden U.S. housing sector to improve by the end of the year , a senator who participated in the closed - door meeting said .
" He let us believe that the housing situation should begin to ameliorate by the end of the year , " said Sen .
Pete Domenici , a New Mexico Republican , told reporters .
" He gave a very good , succinct , short overview of where he thought the economy was right now and how it might move forward , " said Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona .

Demographia International Housing Survey
Here is a statement from the article that particularly caught my eye : Prasad Patkar , who helps manage about $ 1.5 billion at Platypus Asset Management in Sydney said " . ” Sorry Prasad , a serious policy error was made long ago , and there is not a damn thing the RBA or anyone else can do to stop the impending housing crash in Australia .
What follows is a post I actually wrote yesterday .
I intended to post this before the rate decisions , but it never happened .
I too , thought one more hike was coming .
That it did not come is a sign of panic at the RBA .
Just as happened in the United states with subprime borrowers , Australia 's first - home buyers struggle as interest rates rise " LD " , a reader from Australia who sent me the link asked and answered his own question : " Craig , another reader from Australia writes ... Craig is referring to Tighter credit rules to halve home loans
Note the above paragraph in red by Steve Keen , one of few economists in the world who actually has a clue .
His blog is Steve Keen ’s Debtwatch
Also note the worries of the so - called housing experts in the above article :
If those " experts " had an ounce of common sense they would be worried the housing bubble would get bigger .
Indeed , housing prices are so stretched in Australia that the bubble will bust soon enough regardless of whether lenders tighten standards or not .
The US housing bubble burst with credit standards still getting looser a year or more later .
Bubbles burst when the pool of greater fools runs out , and not before .
That is exactly why Economist Steve Keen lost housing bet against Rory Robertson Keen 's mistake ( miscalculation is a better word as I am positive he will ultimately be proven correct ) , was that he misjudged actions the Rudd administration might take to keep the bubble going .
Bear in mind that once the trend changes , it changes for good , but until the trend does change , efforts to keep bubbles alive frequently produce blowoff tops .
In Australia 's case I finally sense a blowoff top in fools .
The US suffered the same fate in 2005 when the cover of Time Magazine went " " and people were camping out overnight and entering lotteries for the right to buy Florida condos .
Inquiring minds might be interested in the following flashbacks , the first showing the funniest Time Magazine cover in history , the second shows approximately where we are today although I do have to move the arrow one notch closer to the bottom .
How did Bernanke and other experts fair ?
Let 's answer that with a few more flashbacks .
The initial data point on my chart came in the post It 's a Totally New Paradigm on March 26 , 2005 .
Here are some excerpts from that post .
Inquiring minds may wish to review Bernanke : There 's No Housing Bubble to Go Bust Bernanke has proven all the king 's horses and all the king 's men can not put bubbles together again .
For further proof please see Bernanke 's Deflation Preventing Scorecard After bubbles burst , nothing matters including loose lending standards in the US that lasted long after the housing peak in summer of 2005 .
I am willing to bet that at long last , Australia 's pool of greater fools just ran out .
Rudd 's ridiculous $ 14,000 grant and stamp - duty relief programs were likely enough to exhaust that pool .
The ultimate irony of Keen 's bet is that by the time he starts his hike in April he will likely be right .
Bear in mind however , that prices tend to fall slowly at first as inventory builds up .
Then the losses accelerate quickly .
By the way , Australia buyers might need to wait 5 - 7 years or more for reasonable valuations .
Look how long it took for the US housing bubble to implode .
We have not hit bottom yet after 5 years , and the Australia bubble has a bigger starting point .
Please see Housing Bubble Comparison : US , UK , Canada , Spain , Australia , Japan for a county by country comparison of housing bubbles from the Ecomomist .
Inquiring minds are reviewing the results of the 6th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey .
Countries in the survey include Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , and the United States .
Least Affordable Cities
The article shows the top 58 , I captured the top 20 above .
Congratulations To Canada And Australia
Congratulations go to Vancouver , Canada for being the least affordable city in the survey .
Vancouver thus wins the gold medal in the individual competition .
Sydney Australia proudly wins the Silver medal and the Sunshine Coast Australia wins the bronze .
It was close but no cigar for Australia 's Gold Coast .
Honolulu Hawaii came in a respectable fifth place .
Most Affordable Cities
Detroit , South Bend , Youngstown , Flint , Toledo , Akron , Peoria , Cleveland , and many other " affordable " cities are not places where anyone would particularly want to live .
Indeed many cities at the top of the affordability list are places that most would hope to escape from .
The high school graduation rate in Detroit is a mere 25 % !
I am willing to bet that Detroit 's graduation rate is far and away the worst of any city in the survey .
See Michigan Forces Business Owners Into Public Sector Unions ; Detroit's Aura of Hopelessness for more details .
Moreover , there are houses in Detroit , Cleveland , Flint , etc , that one could buy for $ 500 that have no takers .
Unlivable houses no one wants at any price skew the results .
Demographia Summary by Nation
All of the affordable markets were located in Canada and the United States , while most markets in Australia , New Zealand and the United Kingdom were severely unaffordable .
Australia : House prices have continued to rise in Australia ( Figure 2 ) , which registered the worst housing affordability ( the highest Median Multiple ) in the
history of the Survey .
Overall , housing in Australia is severely unaffordable , with a Median Multiple of 6.8 , more than double the 3.0 historic maximum norm .
Housing had been affordable in Australia in the late 1980s , with a Median Multiple of under
3.0 . The Median Multiple remained at or under 3.5 until the late 1990s .
All of Australia‟s major markets were severely unaffordable ( Median Multiple above 5.0 ) .
Moreover , all markets , including smaller markets were severely unaffordable except Ballarat ( Victoria ) , which was seriously unaffordable ( Median Multiple between 4.1 and 5.0 ) .
Canada : Housing is moderately unaffordable , as in previous Surveys .
Canada‟s Median Multiple is 3.7 .
Housing had been affordable in Canada in the late 1990s , with a Median Multiple of 3.0 .
Canada had 5 affordable markets , 13 moderately unaffordable markets , 5 seriously unaffordable markets and 5 severely unaffordable markets .
Vancouver remained the least affordable market of any size in the surveyed nations , at 9.3 , worsening from 8.4 last year .
Toronto joined Vancouver as severely unaffordable , with a Median Multiple of 5.2 .
However , Barrie , within the Toronto region was moderately unaffordable , at 3.4 .
Victoria , Abbotsford and Kelowna ( all in British Columbia ) were also severely unaffordable .
Ireland : Housing in Ireland has become moderately unaffordable with a Median Multiple of 3.7 , showing a trend toward historic norm of 3.0.20 Housing had been affordable as late as the middle 1990s , with a Median Multiple below 3.0 .
The extent of Ireland‟s recent housing affordability improvement is illustrated by the EBS / DKB Affordability Index , which indicates that mortgage payments have been halved in Ireland since the peak of the bubble in relation to first home buyer incomes .
New Zealand : Housing in New Zealand was severely unaffordable , with a Median Multiple of 5.7 , nearly double the historic maximum norm of 3.0 .
Housing had been affordable in the early 1990s , with a Median Multiple of under 3.0 .
Auckland is the least affordable larger market , with a Median Multiple of 6.7 , while Christchurch ( 6.1 ) and Wellington ( 5.7 ) were also severely unaffordable .
Tauranga - Bay of Plenty was again the least affordable market , with a Median Multiple of 6.8 .
Five of the 8 New Zealand markets were severely unaffordable , while Palmerston North , Napier - Hastings and Hamilton were seriously unaffordable New Zealand had no affordable markets and no moderately unaffordable markets
United Kingdom : Housing in the United Kingdom remains severely unaffordable , with a Median Multiple of 5.1 , well above the historic maximum norm of 3.0 .
Housing had been affordable in the late 1990s , with a Median Multiple of under 3.0 .
Less than one - half of the United Kingdom markets were severely unaffordable ( 14 of 33 ) , while the other 19 markets were seriously unaffordable .
The United Kingdom had no affordable markets and no moderately unaffordable markets .
United States : Housing in the United States is rated as affordable , with the Median Multiple of 2.9 .
The recent house price declines have restored U.S. housing affordability to the below 3.0 historic norm ( last achieved in the early 2000s ) , as the price bubble burst in many plan - driven markets .
The United States had 98 affordable markets , 58 moderately unaffordable markets , 8 seriously unaffordable markets and 11 severely unaffordable markets .
The most affordable major market ( population over 1,000,000 ) was Detroit .
Other affordable major markets were Atlanta , Buffalo , Cincinnati , Cleveland , Columbus ( Ohio ) , Dallas - Fort Worth , Houston , Indianapolis , Kansas City , Las Vegas , Louisville , Memphis , Minneapolis - St. Paul , Oklahoma City , Phoenix , Riverside - San Bernardino , Rochester , Sacramento , St. Louis and Tampa - St. Petersburg .

Mish :
When you come up with " national affordability " are all the cities given equal weight ?
Does Detroit count as much as San Francisco ?
Hugh : Yes .
Mish :
In my opinion , a weighted average is what matters most ( at least for the purpose of figuring out how big the bubble still is ) .
Hugh :
We are NOT attempting to explain how big the bubble is on a country wide basis .
We are simply illustrating what the Median Multiple is at the 3rd Qtr of each of the urban markets listed .
Other researchers are most welcome of course to take the next step and do a population weighting , if they wish to do so .
Our goal is simply to illustrate the degrees of housing stress of the urban markets listed .
Mortgage Stress in Australia
Australian Interest Rate Hikes
At its meeting today , the Board decided to raise the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent , effective 2 December 2009 .
With the risk of serious economic contraction in Australia having passed , the Board has moved at recent meetings to lessen gradually the degree of monetary stimulus that was put in place when the outlook appeared to be much weaker .
These material adjustments to the stance of monetary policy will , in the Board ’s view , work to increase the sustainability of growth in economic activity and keep inflation consistent with the target over the years ahead .

Advertisement A tiny group of bees act like " pied pipers " to trigger the onset of bee swarms report scientists .
By buzzing a " piping " signal the bees are able to initiate an explosive departure from the hive .
Bees are known to use signals to tell the colony when to swarm but which bees had the power to make this decision was unclear .
Now scientists have identified a small oligarchy of individual bees that hold the key to swarm behaviour .
The researchers reveal their findings in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology .
Exodus During the reproductive season , large honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) colonies synchronise an explosive departure of most of their workers and the queen .
This causes a swarm as the honeybees travel to form a new colony in a new location .
Before our studies little was known about how this sudden exodus was coordinated
Dr Juliana Rangel
Cornell University , Ithaca New York , US .
The sudden departure of bees has been known about for centuries and bee keepers have even found ways to avoid it happening and avoid loosing valuable bees .
But scientists have only recently begun to understand how the bees coordinate their departure and mass exodus .
" In this study we wanted to determine what bees are responsible for organising this mass departure , and how they organise this process in an efficient manner , " says Dr Juliana Rangel from Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , US .
Dr Rangel undertook the study along with Sean Griffin and Professor Thomas Seeley also from Cornell University .
The bee identity " Our study is the first one to reveal the identity of the signallers that initiate a swarm 's departure from the hive , " Dr Rangel says .
The report finds that a small group of experienced forager bees called nest - site scouts produce a " piping - signal " that primes the workers for swarming .
This makes the bees warm up their flight muscles for departure .
They then produce a " buzz - run " signal which releases the departure of the swarm .
BUSY BEES
Watch how a bee swarm is n't very picky about where it settles .
Watch how bees fight to the death against bears to save their honey supplies .
Male Dawson 's bees , one of the world 's largest bee species , kill each other in a bid to mate with females .
This small oligarchy of bees make up only 5 % of the colony 's total population .
The researchers think that the oligarchy in the colony they studied consisted of only 200 individuals in colony size of 8,000 .
It is the job of these bees to go out of the hive and search for potential homes for the colony .
When they find somewhere suitable , they return and start the process of swarming by producing the piping signal .
They also recruit others by undertaking a waggle dance .
This is a dance - like movement by which the bee communicates the distance and direction of a location to other bees .
" Before our studies little was known about how this sudden exodus was coordinated , and which bees were in charge of this process , " Dr Rangel says .
Group control Animals that travel in groups must synchronise the timing of their movements .
Three different decision making mechanisms are known to coordinate a group 's departure Dr Rangel explains .
" In a democracy , the majority of the individuals in the group decide when the move will take place , for example whooper swans and red deer . "
" In the other extreme is the despotic mechanism of decision - making , in which only one individual , the group 's leader , makes the decision of when to move , for example Hamadryas baboons and African elephants . "
Right in the middle lies an oligarchy where a small number of well - informed individuals , makes the decision of when the group should move .
" Decisions of group travel made by an oligarchy are very rare , and very few studies have reported an oligarchic control of group travel , " says Dr Rangel .
" This contributes to our knowledge of how a small group of individuals can make important decisions for an entire group . "

New adhesive device could let humans walk on walls
Could humans one day walk on walls , like Spider - Man ?
A palm - sized device invented at Cornell that uses water surface tension as an adhesive bond just might make it possible .
The rapid adhesion mechanism could lead to such applications as shoes or gloves that stick and unstick to walls , or Post - it - like notes that can bear loads , according to Paul Steen , professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering , who invented the device with Michael Vogel , a former postdoctoral associate .
The device is the result of inspiration drawn from a beetle native to Florida , which can adhere to a leaf with a force 100 times its own weight , yet also instantly unstick itself .
Research behind the device is published online Feb. 1 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The device consists of a flat plate patterned with holes , each on the order of microns ( one - millionth of a meter ) .
A bottom plate holds a liquid reservoir , and in the middle is another porous layer .
An electric field applied by a common 9 - volt battery pumps water through the device and causes droplets to squeeze through the top layer .
The surface tension of the exposed droplets makes the device grip another surface – much the way two wet glass slides stick together .
" In our everyday experience , these forces are relatively weak , " Steen said .
" But if you make a lot of them and can control them , like the beetle does , you can get strong adhesion forces . "
For example , one of the researchers ' prototypes was made with about 1,000 300 - micron - sized holes , and it can hold about 30 grams – more than 70 paper clips .
They found that as they scaled down the holes and packed more of them onto the device , the adhesion got stronger .
They estimate , then , that a one - square - inch device with millions of 1 - micron - sized holes could hold more than 15 pounds .
To turn the adhesion off , the electric field is simply reversed , and the water is pulled back through the pores , breaking the tiny " bridges " created between the device and the other surface by the individual droplets .
The research builds on previously published work that demonstrated the efficacy of what 's called electro - osmotic pumping between surface tension - held interfaces , first by using just two larger water droplets .
One of the biggest challenges in making these devices work , Steen said , was keeping the droplets from coalescing , as water droplets tend to do when they get close together .
To solve this , they designed their pump to resist water flow while it 's turned off .
Steen envisions future prototypes on a grander scale , once the pump mechanism is perfected , and the adhesive bond can be made even stronger .
He also imagines covering the droplets with thin membranes – thin enough to be controlled by the pump but thick enough to eliminate wetting .
The encapsulated liquid could exert simultaneous forces , like tiny punches .
" You can think about making a credit card - sized device that you can put in a rock fissure or a door , and break it open with very little voltage , " Steen said .
" It 's a fun thing to think about . "
The Parkash family waged a much - publicized battle in the courts to get charges filed against Mr. Rathore , and finally , in 1999 , the Haryana High Court ruled in their favor .
In January 2000 , nearly a decade after the incident , Mr. Rathore was charged with molesting Ruchika Girotra .
He faced a sentence of up to two years in prison if convicted .
He was placed on leave from the police force .
The trial stretched on for almost another decade .
Mr. Rathore ’s wife , Abha , a well - known High Court lawyer , defended him .
Mr. Girotra said that the defense found endless ways to drag out the trial .
There were more than 400 hearings and repeated continuances .
Mrs. Rathore cross-examined witnesses for months .
Finally , on Dec. 21 , 2009 , nearly two decades after the crime , Mr. Rathore was convicted of molesting Ruchika .
The judge gave him a reduced sentence of six months in prison after his wife argued that the long trial and Mr. Rathore ’s age , 67 , entitled him to leniency .
He was also fined 1,000 rupees , about $ 22 .
Mr. Rathore is out on bail as he appeals the verdict .
Mr. Girotra and his son have filed new charges against Mr. Rathore for his involvement in the son ’s arrest and treatment .
Now the Girotra and Parkash families want the government to charge Mr. Rathore with a more serious crime , abetment to suicide , contending that he drove Ruchika to her death .
That crime carries a 10 - year sentence .
The government is planning changes to its criminal procedures in response to the case .
Now officers will be required to file charges based on the victim ’s statement alone in cases involving sexual crimes , a measure aimed at making it harder to evade investigation .
It is also considering fast - track courts to deal with such crimes .
Mr. Parkash said these changes were proof that the people could take on the powerful and win .
“ This is a fight against a rotten system , ” he said .
“ We have to do our duty .
I will take this case to its logical end , until the end of my life . ”

Attrition Claims Many Before They Can Finish A Few Weeks of Training
The NATO goal to dramatic grow the Afghan police force continues to flounder , fueled in no small part by the massive attrition rate , according to training commander Lieutenant General William Caldwell .
Lt. Gen. Caldwell says 67 percent of police recruits drop out before the finish their basic training .
Previous comments have indicated that a significant portion also resign afterwards , disillusioned by the high risk , low pay and corrupt environment .
The enormous pre-graduation attrition rate is made doubly shocking , however , when one considers how little training Afghan police are actually expected to complete .
Though class lengths vary , many recruits in recent months are graduated after only about three weeks of training , thrust into the warzone with virtually no idea what to do next .
The problems are not new , in 2008 German General Hans - Christoph Ammon predicted it would take another 82 years to have a properly trained police force in Afghanistan .
The right of a state to secede from the nation is way outside my personal injury wheelhouse .
But it has become a source of conversation on professorial and political blogs , and the concept has generated interest from the Tea Party movement .
As it happens , my brother has a letter from Justice Antonin Scalia that is directly on point as to the legitimacy of secession .
How he got that letter , and its contents , are the subject of today ’s post .
The inspiration for writing , and the release of the letter , comes from Prof.
Eugene Volokh , who wrote , “ I keep hearing the claim that the legitimacy of secession from the U.S. was ‘ settled at Appomattox , ’ and I wanted to say a few words about why I think that makes little sense . ”
The good prof goes on to write that , while clearly not supporting secession of any State in concept , that the issue is far from settled .
He writes :
If in 2065 Alaska , California , Hawaii , or Texas ( just to consider some examples ) assert a right to secede , the argument that “ in 1865 , the victorious Union government concluded that no state has a right to secede in opposition to the wishes of the Union , so therefore you lack such a right ” will have precisely the weight that the Americans of 2065 will choose to give it — which should be very little .
Thus far , that post has generated 152 comments .
Well prof , Justice Scalia disagrees with you .
Explicitly .
Why did he do so in a letter to my brother ?
Glad you asked .
Dan is a screenwriter ( whose screenplay Tranquility Base was just named a finalist at the Vail Film Festival , and previously took top honors elsewhere ) .
Back in 2006 he started working on a political farce that had Maine seceding from the United States and joining Canada .
Bro was well ahead of the tea partiers in contemplating impending problems as we racked up massive debt .
This does n’t get him an agent or a foot in the door of Hollywood to get his screenplays made into films — it is n’t what you write , but who you know — but it does make him a prophet of sorts .
So , on a lark , he wrote to each of the 10 Supreme Court justices ( including O’Connor ) with this request :
I ’m a screenwriter in New York City , and am writing to see if you might be willing to assist me in a project that involves a unique constitutional issue .
My latest screenplay is a comedy about Maine seceding from the United States and joining Canada .
There are parts of the story that deal with the legality of such an event and , of course , a big showdown in the Supreme Court is part of the story .
At the moment my story is a 12 page treatment .
As an architect turned screenwriter , it is fair to say that I come up a bit short in the art of Supreme Court advocacy .
If you could spare a few moments on a serious subject that is treated in a comedic way , I would greatly appreciate your thoughts .
I ’m sure you ’ll find the story very entertaining .
I told Dan he was nuts .
I told him his letter would be placed in the circular file .
And then Scalia wrote back .
Personally .
Explicitly rejecting the right to secede :
I am afraid I can not be of much help with your problem , principally because I cannot imagine that such a question could ever reach the Supreme Court .
To begin with , the answer is clear .
If there was any constitutional issue resolved by the Civil War , it is that there is no right to secede .
( Hence , in the Pledge of Allegiance , “ one Nation , indivisible . ” )
Secondly , I find it difficult to envision who the parties to this lawsuit might be .
Is the State suing the United States for a declaratory judgment ?
But the United States cannot be sued without its consent , and it has not consented to this sort of suit .
I am sure that poetic license can overcome all that — but you do not need legal advice for that .
Good luck with your screenplay .
So there you have it .
At least one vote solidly on record as saying that there is no right to secede .
And it likely comes from a place the right wing secessionists most wanted to have a vote .
And yes , Dan still needs an agent .
Because writing great scripts is n’t enough if you do n’t know The Powers That Be on the other coast .
And , for what it ’s worth , his now - completed script of Maine joining Canada is better than his award - winning one about a mis-adventure in space .

Secession in the Air ( Patrick Buchanan )
No , it is not 1860 again .
But with all the talk of the 10th Amendment , nullification and interposition , states rights and secession — following Gov. Rick Perry ’s misstatement that Texas , on entering the Union in 1845 , reserved in its constitution a right to secede — one might think so .

They have a right .
While lower intelligence scores -- as reflected by low results on written or oral tests of IQ -- have been associated with a raised risk of cardiovascular disease , no study has so far compared the relative strength of this association with other established risk factors such as obesity , smoking and high blood pressure .
Now , a large study funded by Britain 's Medical Research Council , which set out to gauge the relative importance of IQ alongside other risk factors , has found that lower intelligence scores were associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and total mortality at a greater level of magnitude than found with any other risk factor except smoking .
The findings , published in the February issue of the European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation , are derived from the West of Scotland Twenty - 07 Study , a population study designed to investigate the influence of social factors on health .
The present analysis was based on data collected in 1987 in a cohort of 1145 men and women aged around 55 and followed up for 20 years .
Data were collected for height , weight , blood pressure , smoking habits , physical activity , education and occupation ; cognitive ability ( IQ ) was assessed using a standard test of general intelligence .
When the data were applied to a statistical model to quantify the associations of nine risk factors with cardiovascular mortality , results showed that the most important was cigarette smoking , followed by low IQ .
Similar results were apparent when the health outcome was total mortality .
The relative strengths of the association were measured by an " index of inequality , " which summarised the relative risk of a health outcome ( cardiovascular death ) in the most disadvantaged ( high risk ) people relative to the most advantaged ( low risk ) .
This relative index of inequality for the top five risk factors was found to be 5.58 for cigarette smoking , 3.76 for IQ , 3.20 for low income , 2.61 for high systolic blood pressure , and 2.06 for low physical activity .
The investigators note " a number of plausible mechanisms " whereby lower IQ scores could elevate cardiovascular disease risk , notably the application of intelligence to healthy behaviour ( such as smoking or exercise ) and its correlates ( obesity , blood pressure ) .
A further possibility , they add , " is that IQ denotes ' a record ' of environmental insults " ( eg , illness , sub- optimal nutrition ) accumulated throughout life .
Commenting on the public health implications of the findings , the study 's principal investigator Dr David Batty said that the individual skills reflected in a person 's IQ may be important in the management of personal cardiovascular risk .
" From a public health perspective , there is the possibility that IQ can be increased , with some mixed results from trials of early learning and school readiness programmes , " said Dr Batty .
" It may also be worthwhile for health promotion campaigns to be planned with consideration of individual cognition levels . "
He also noted that IQ may well be one important factor behind the place of social class as a fundamental determinant of inequalities in health .
So far , said Dr Batty , explanations for such socio-economic gradients in health have traditionally focused on access to resources ( such as education and income ) , physical exposures at home and at work ( such as housing conditions and toxins ) , and health related behaviours ( such as smoking and diet ) .
But studies show that such factors do not fully explain class - based differentials in health .
A low IQ , he explained , as suggested in this study , may be a further independent explanation .
The West of Scotland Twenty - 07 Study is funded by the UK Medical Research Council .
Mein Mandant ist afrikanischer Herkunft .
Sein Asylantrag wurde abgelehnt .
Er kann aber nicht in seine Heimat abgeschoben werden , weil ihm kein Land einen Pass ausstellt .
Zunächst hat die Botschaft Sierra Leones abgewinkt .
Mein Mandant gibt an , aus Sierra Leone zu stammen .
Später wurde er so gut wie zu jeder afrikanischen Botschaft in Deutschland gefahren .
Seltsamerweise fand sich kein Land , das ihn als Staatsbürger akzeptieren wollte .
Womit ihm also zumindest nicht nachzuweisen ist , dass er nicht aus Sierra Leone stammt .
Das hindert das Amtsgericht aber nicht , gegen meinen Mandanten einen Strafbefehl über eine Geldstrafe von 600,00 € zu erlassen .
Wegen Verstoßes gegen das Aufenthaltsgesetz .
Der Tatvorwurf : Mein Mandant habe keine zumutbaren Anstrengungen unternommen , um im Rahmen seiner , so wörtlich „ Mitwirkungs - und Initiatvipflicht die Feststellungen der sierreleonischen Botschaft zu widerlegen und insoweit die für eine Abschiebung erforderliche Passbeschaffung zu fördern “ .
Es wird interessant werden , welche Handlungen denn von meinem Mandanten im Rahmen seiner Initiativpflicht erwartet werden , um die Botschaft seines Heimatlandes davon zu überzeugen , dass er doch aus Sierra Leone kommt .
Soll er den zuständigen Sachbearbeiter schütteln ?
Oder ihn bestechen ?
Einen Hungerstreik vor der Botschaft beginnen ?
Diplomaten als Geiseln nehmen ?
Sehr freundlich ist auch , dass das Gericht meinem Mandanten gestattet , die Strafe in monatlichen Raten von 100,00 € zu zahlen .
Das wird ihm allerdings auch nicht leicht fallen .
Er kriegt vom Staat 1,91 € Taschengeld – pro Woche .
Aber vielleicht nimmt die Justizkasse ja auch Lebensmittelgutscheine , und ich weiß es nur nicht .

Frustration often begets creativity and innovation .
I really hate having to get the very last remaining bit of toothpaste that collects up at the bottom of the tube .
Well , this new toothpaste tube ( designed by Dominic Wilcox and illustrated by Clare Mallison ) solves this problem by putting a cap at both ends .
Now when you ( or your partner ) keep squeezing from the front or middle of the tube , no need to get angry – you can simply open up the other end to get the rest out !
It also does the double duty of fixing the problem of your partner gumming up one side of the tube because you can each have your own end cap .
Ingenious .

i use Youtube to watch Taylor Swift videos .
I always watch movie clips on Youtube .
What an awesome site .
: I love watching videos online specially on Youtube .
There are lots of music clips , movie clips and instructional videos on Youtube .
I love em all .
Actually , it 's probably harder to get the last bit out , as you can't roll up the end to force the toothpaste out .
You 'll end up with * two * ends of unusable paste !use a twist - off cap that wo n't pop when squeezed .
How do you stop the other end from popping off when you squeeze ?
So how does the factory fill it ?

This creepy - cool trailer for EBBËTO 's 25 - minute - long film Analog is an agoraphobe 's worst nightmare - a machine keeps a man alive during a deep space journey .
Unfortunately , the machine begins to reassess its programming , and a lot of symbolic oddness precipitates .
Advertisement
Here are the details on the flick , which is currently making the festival rounds :
ANALOG is Ebbëto's 2nd short film .
His first , Lagartija Nika , can be seen online at Tokyo's CON - CAN Film Festival site .
ANALOG is a 27 min , black and white , Science Fiction film made in 2009 .
This short extract features the music of OIL 10 " Passagen " , by the French electronic music composer , Gilles Rossire .
The film tells the tale of a machine travelling in deep - space which has as a primary function the preservation of a living organism : a man .
Strange events with biblical analogies begin , disturbing the machine and making it rethink it 's priorities .
ANALOG is probably the first authentic Brazilian Science Fiction film and it's currently competing in world wide short film festivals .
The film was made under an extreme low - budget condition and was only made possible do to the dedication of a hand full of people that believed in the project and gave their hearts and souls to make it come to life .

Analog evokes the black and white psychological strangeness of Pi and Tetsuo : The Iron Man .
Good stuff .

Was Jimi Hendrix 's ambidexterity the secret to his talent ?
This is the question explored in a new paper by psychologist Stephen Christman ( via TwentyFourBit ) , who argues that Hendrix 's versatility informed not just his guitar - playing – but his lyrics too .
According to Christman , who is based at the University of Toledo , Hendrix was not strictly left - handed .
Although he played his right - handed guitar upside down , and used his left hand to throw , comb his hair and hold cigarettes , Hendrix wrote , ate and held the telephone with his right hand .
He was , Christman argues , " mixed - right - handed " .
And this " mixed " - ness , signaling better interaction between the left and right hemispheres of the guitarist 's brain , suffused every part of his music .
Hendrix 's special ability , Christman wrote , " enabled him to integrate the actions of his left and right hands while playing guitar , to integrate the lyrics and melodies of his songs , and perhaps even to integrate the older blues and R&B traditions with the emerging folk , rock , and psychedelic sounds of the 60s " .
Certainly the guitarist 's technical virtuosity is clear .
Christman points to Hendrix 's technique on songs like Still Raining , Still Dreaming , " where Hendrix uses his right hand to play an intricate series of bends and slides , while his left hand , in between plucking the strings , uses the pickup selector to switch back and forth between the treble and bass pickups " .
Many guitarists are left - handed , including Paul McCartney , Mark Knopfler and Kurt Cobain , and Christman argues that great guitarists tend to be relatively ambidextrous .
Conversely , many piano and keyboard players are strongly right - or left - handed : they rely on the independence of their two hands , playing separate lines .
Hendrix 's mixed - handedness may have affected his songwriting too , bringing together lyrics and melody .
" [ Because ] language and rhythm processing are lateralised to the left side of brain while the processing of melody and harmony is lateralised to the right side , the possibility is raised that mixed - handers may have an advantage in integrating the lyrics and melody in song writing , " Christman suggested .
" Mixed - handers may be better able to put the ' right ' words with the ' right ' melody such that the syntactic and emotional aspects of the lyrics are tightly integrated with the phrasing and contour of the melody line . "
Hendrix 's speak - singing vocal style may also be tied to his inter - hemispheral quirk : whereas talking is governed by the left brain , singing is linked to the right .
From there , things get even more fanciful .
Mixed - handed people are " magical thinkers , " Christman argues , keen on mysticism and psychedelia .
They apparently have " an increased tolerance of ambiguity " , demonstrated in Hendrix 's androgyny , his mixture of flamboyance and gravitas .
And even Hendrix 's favourite chord reflects his neural set - up : Dominant 7# 9 is neither clearly major nor clearly minor .
It is , one might say , even - handed .
Then again , if mixed - handedness were the cause of Hendrix 's talent – and not , as Christman writes , just one contributing factor – the world would be a more virtuosic place .
Half of humankind is reportedly mixed - handed , and most of us have never written a song as good as Voodoo Chile .
To date , however , more than 820 million people do not have enough to eat .
The COVID - 19 pandemic is worsening the situation , according to Mr Antonio Gutierez , Secretary General of the United Nations , in his address of June 9 .

The sky is n't falling , exactly .
America is n't on a fast track to irrelevance .
Even in a state of total neglect , we could probably shamble along as a disheveled superpower for a few more decades .
But all empires end , and the warning signs of American decline seem to be blinking more consistently .
In the latest annual " prosperity index " published by the Legatum Institute , a London - based research firm , the United States ranks as the ninth most prosperous country in the world .
That 's five notches lower than last year , when America ranked No. 4 .
The drop might seem inconsequential , especially in the midst of a grueling recession — except that most of the world has endured the same recession , and other countries are bouncing back faster .
China and India have recovered smartly from the recession , for example .
Brazil seems to be barreling ahead .
Australia is growing faster than expected , prompting worry among government officials who fear they may have overstimulated the economy .
The United States , meanwhile , is muddling through a weak , jobless recovery , and we have a lot of problems that could make prosperity feel elusive for a long time .
Real household income in America has flat - lined , for instance , which means many middle - class families are barely keeping up with inflation .
The exploding federal deficit hamstrings the government 's ability to help .
Healthcare is too expensive , America 's manufacturing base is eroding , and two open - ended foreign wars are draining the national treasury .
This is not a recipe for building national wealth .
There are still millions of diligent , innovative Americans who could help the nation dig out of its hole .
But overall , the American population is falling behind , by a variety of measures .
Here are some of them :
Jobs .
The International Monetary Fund predicts that the U.S. unemployment rate will be 9.3 percent for all of 2010 .
That 's lower than in some European nations , but it 's higher than in Canada and a lot worse than most countries in Scandinavia and Asia .
Overall , the U.S. unemployment rate is about average for advanced economies and likely to stay that way .
It could be worse , but middling job creation is n't a sign of global leadership .
Economic growth .
The IMF also predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 1.9 percent in 2010 .
That 's a tad better than the average for all advanced economies , but at least 10 developed nations will grow faster .
Woo - hoo .
Three cheers for mediocrity .
Poverty .
The U.S. poverty rate , about 17 percent , is third worst among the advanced nations tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
In that sample , only Turkey and Mexico are worse .
Education .
American 15 - year - olds score below the average for advanced nations on math and science literacy .
But do n't worry , our nation 's future leaders are still ahead of their peers in Mexico , Turkey , Greece , and a few other places .
Competitiveness .
In the latest global competitiveness report from the World Economic Forum , the United States fell from No. 1 to No. 2 . Sure , let 's console ourselves that the No. 1 country , Switzerland , is a tiny outlier nation and that getting bumped from the top spot does n't really mean anything .
Add an asterisk , and we 're still No. 1 .
Prosperity .
The most prosperous nations , according to the Legatum report , are Finland , Switzerland , Sweden , Denmark , and Norway .
These fairly homogenous European countries are the teachers ' pets of global rankings , often appearing near the top because of right - sized economies and a relatively small underclass .
For a huge economy like America's , a No. 9 ranking is still respectable .
And part of the drop from last year 's No. 4 spot is a change in methodology that puts more emphasis on the health and safety of citizens .
Still , in the index 's subrankings , the United States is n't even in the top 10 for economic fundamentals , safety and security , or governance .
We should do better .
Health .
In the Legatum study , the United States ranks 27th for the health of its citizens .
Life expectancy in America is below the average for 30 advanced countries measured by the OECD , and the obesity rate in America is the worst among those 30 countries , by far .
And , of course , we spend far more on healthcare per person than anybody else — but get no bang for the extra buck .
Well - being .
In the United Nations ' Human Development Index , which attempts to measure the overall well - being of citizens throughout the world , the United States ranks 13th , one notch lower than in the prior set of rankings .
Norway , Australia , Iceland , and Canada are at the top .
Happiness .
The United States ranks 11th in the OECD 's measure of " life satisfaction " — behind Denmark , Finland , the Netherlands , and other usual suspects .
That 's not bad , but the United States is one of only five countries where life satisfaction is going down , not up .
The other downer nations are Portugal , Hungary , Canada , and Japan .
Plus , the research behind these rankings predates the recession , so it 's likely that Americans are a lot less satisfied these days .
The overall portrait of America is n't exclusively gloomy , and in some areas we still seem to have an important edge .
The Legatum prosperity index , for example , ranks America first for entrepreneurship and innovation .
And in a GfK Roper survey of how nations rate as global " brands , " America rocketed from No. 7 in 2008 to No. 1 in 2009 , largely because the world cheered the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president .
But a brand - name leader can't just strong - arm his nation back to greatness .
He needs a lot of help from educated , healthy , and employed citizens determined to spread the wealth .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Most Americans would like to see a “ public option ” in health insurance reform but doubt anything Congress does will lower costs or improve care in the short term , according to a poll released on Thursday .

The survey of 2,999 households by Thomson Reuters Corp shows a public skeptical about the cost , quality and accessibility of medical care .
Just under 60 percent of those surveyed said they would like a public option as part of any final healthcare reform legislation , which Republicans and a few Democrats oppose .
Here are some of the results of the telephone survey of 2,999 households called from November 9 - 17 as part of the Thomson Reuters PULSE Healthcare Survey :
* Believe in public option : 59.9 percent yes , 40.1 percent no .
* 86 percent of Democrats support the public option versus 57 percent of Independents and 33 percent of Republicans .
* Quality of healthcare will be better 12 months from now : 35 percent strongly disagree .
11.6 percent strongly agree .
29.9 percent put themselves in the middle .
* Believe the amount of money spent on healthcare will be less 12 months from now : 52 percent strongly disagree , 13 percent strongly agree .
* 23 percent believe it will be easier for people to receive the care they need a year from now .
The nationally representative survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percent .
The House of Representatives passed a healthcare overhaul bill last month .
The Senate is debating a plan and will vote on Thursday on competing measures to ensure women have access to mammograms and other preventive screenings and amendments on proposed spending cuts in the Medicare government health program for the elderly .
If the Senate passes a bill , the two versions will have to be reconciled and passed again by each chamber before being sent to President Barack Obama for his signature .
The Senate plan is designed to slow the rate of growth in healthcare , expand coverage to about 30 million uninsured Americans and halt industry practices such as denying coverage to those with pre-existing medical conditions .
It would require everyone to have insurance , provide federal subsidies to help them pay for it and establish a new government - run insurance option to compete with private industry .

DURHAM , N.C. -- Jon Scheyer stood near midcourt after his home finale at Duke .
As he soaked it all in , he could n't help but crack a wry smile .
" I was just trying to remember that moment , that picture in my head , " Scheyer said .
Nobody else affiliated with the fourth - ranked Blue Devils will forget this night , either .
Not after an 82-50 rout of North Carolina on Saturday that marked their most one - sided home win in college basketball 's fiercest rivalry and gave them a share of their 12th Atlantic Coast Conference regular - season title .
Kyle Singler scored 19 of his 25 points in the decisive first half , and Scheyer finished with 20 points in his final game before the Cameron Crazies .
Duke ( 26 - 5 , 13 - 3 ) shot nearly 46 percent -- 51 percent in a dominant first half -- and made eight 3 - pointers in beating the Tar Heels at home for the first time since 2005 and wrapping up the No. 1 seed in next week 's league tournament .
Freshman John Henson matched a season high with 14 points for the Tar Heels ( 16 - 15 , 5 - 11 ) , who had their lowest point total under coach Roy Williams and absorbed their worst loss in seven years .
" This is the first time that we 've had to come in this locker room after a loss , " fifth - year senior Marcus Ginyard said .
" But the thing is , teams in the past found success here because we were tough enough and we came in and stuck it out through the times that were n't going our way and we made things go our way .
And tonight we did n't do that .
They were the aggressors on everything , and when it got tough , we allowed them to put it on us . "
Nolan Smith scored 20 points and Brian Zoubek continued his late - season surge with 13 rebounds for the Blue Devils , who took command with an early 31 - 8 run , led by 30 in the first half and showed no mercy in polishing off their first sweep of North Carolina since 2004 .
" You never go into a game thinking you 're going to blow somebody out by 30 , " Scheyer said .
" But once we get a lead like that , we really want to have a killer instinct and put them away .
I thought we never let off the gas . "
In some ways , this result was like so many others here this season .
In setting a school record by finishing 17- 0 at Cameron , Duke won all but one home game by double figures , and it entered with an average margin of victory here of 26 points .
Just as they 've done all year , the Blue Devils pounced early and never let up on their overmatched visitor , no matter who that opponent was .
But of course , for the Blue Devils , this one meant so much more -- especially after the Tar Heels won their last four visits .
North Carolina is the only visiting team in three full years to beat Mike Krzyzewski on the court that bears his nickname , and following last year 's victory , some players flashed four fingers as they walked off the floor to mark their fourth win in a row at Cameron .
Already stewing from those defeats -- and this week 's loss at Maryland that kept them from clinching an outright ACC regular - season title -- Duke 's " Big Three " made certain from the jump that there would n't be a fifth .
In the process , they made the opening half feel like a 20 - minute - long burst by the Blue Devils .
Scheyer , Singler and Smith knocked down 3s on three straight trips downcourt to start the overwhelming run that put the Blue Devils in command .
That spurt was so one - sided that by the time it ended , Duke had two players -- Singler ( 12 ) and Smith ( 10 ) -- who had outscored the Tar Heels ( 9 ) .
" We told each other before the game [ that ] we need to have a game where the three of us start , every one of us start playing better , " Scheyer said .
" I thought that happened tonight , and it was a step in the right direction . "
The Blue Devils went up by double figures to stay 6 1/2 minutes into the game , stretched the margin to 20 on Smith 's three - point play midway through the half and made it a 30 - point game on Smith 's free throw in the final minute of the half .
The only question in the second half was whether Duke would administer its most lopsided beating in the history of college basketball 's fiercest rivalry : Ultimately , the Blue Devils fell shy of the 35 - point drubbing they handed North Carolina in 1964 .
" That was one of the best games we 've played all year , " Krzyzewski said .
" The three veterans on the perimeter really set the stage in the first half with how they passed and moved with one another .
... I think we would have been tough to beat by anybody tonight . "
It was the Tar Heels ' worst loss since a 96 - 56 loss at Maryland in 2003 , and their fewest points since a 60 - 48 loss to Duke in the 2002 ACC tournament .
Their No. 10 seed in the ACC tournament is their worst ; the last time their record was this bad , the league had nine teams .
" There 's not a lot you can say .
We got our tails kicked , " Williams said .
" I told them if they take this and learn something from it and change , you can still get something .
But if you just say , ' Oh , well , ' you 're not going to get anything from it . "
Deon Thompson had 11 points for the Tar Heels , who were serenaded by chants of " NIT " throughout and played without freshman guard Leslie McDonald after team officials said he strained his right hamstring during Friday 's practice .
Within a period of six years , Ted Hughes faced the sudden deaths of four people dear to him .
In February 1963 his estranged wife , Sylvia Plath , gassed herself in her kitchen following his affair with another woman , Assia Wevill .
He was just 32 when he found himself in sole charge of their children , Frieda , who was three , and Nicholas , barely one year old .
Six years later , in March 1969 , Wevill killed herself and Shura , their four - year - old daughter .
At that time , his mother Edith appeared to be getting on well after an operation on her knee , but Hughes was afraid that the news might affect her recovery .
In the following weeks he shunned his parents , and did not visit , phone or write to them .
When his father asked Olwyn , Hughes 's sister , what the matter was , she told him but made him vow to keep it a secret .
But he could not keep silent and told his wife .
Edith suffered a thrombosis , lapsed into a coma and died three days later .
Ted was certain that Wevill 's suicide was the final blow .
In a letter to his close friend Lucas Myers , Hughes reflected on his part in the deaths of his wife and lover , confessing that with Plath it was his " insane decisions " , while in Wevill 's case it was his " insane indecisions " .
When he granted us a rare interview in London in October 1996 , Hughes said Plath 's death " was complicated and inevitable , she had been on that track most of her life .
But Wevill 's was avoidable . "
Perhaps this was why he tried to erase her from his life .
The press refrained , for some mysterious reason , from reporting the tragedy .
The crime columns of the London newspapers that week in March 1969 ran items about the strangling of a wife in her home and the death of a girl who set fire to herself in Paris , but there was no word of the deaths of Assia and Shura Wevill in Clapham Common .
Only one local paper , the South London Press , violated what amounted to a hush - up .
Even there , the story was at the bottom of page 13 , and omitted any hint of an intimate connection between the poet and the deceased .
Throughout his life , Hughes warded off biographers and journalists and asked his friends to refrain from mentioning him in interviews or in their memoirs .
When his archive at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , was made available to the public in 2000 , it was devoid of Wevill 's presence in his life : none of the numerous letters they exchanged , the notes , drawings or photos , were there .
In the rare instances where he agreed to provide biographical details , Assia and Shura were never mentioned .
He claimed that after Plath 's suicide and until his marriage to Carol Orchard in 1970 , he raised his children assisted only by members of his family or a local woman who helped with the daily chores - that for all those years , he was looking for a permanent feminine figure but " the right woman failed to materialise " .
In fact , Wevill lived with him in what she called Plath's " ghost house " , 23 Fitzroy Road , London , and then in Ireland and Devon , and mothered his children .
In May 1962 , Assia and her third husband , the Canadian poet David Wevill , were invited to spend a weekend with Plath and Hughes , who were then living in the village of North Tawton in Devon .
It was on that weekend , as Hughes later wrote in a poem , that " The dreamer in me fell in love with her " .
Six weeks passed before he and Wevill met alone for the first time , when he came to London for a meeting at the BBC .
But Plath was quick to discover the budding affair .
She ordered him out , and he was happy to comply .
The following day he knocked on the Wevill 's door carrying four bottles of champagne .
Wevill made no secret of Hughes ' ferocious lovemaking among her office friends .
Equally repelled and fascinated , she told Edward Lucie - Smith , " You know , in bed he smells like a butcher . "
In the next two months he shuttled between the two women .
In mid-September he and Plath took a holiday in Ireland .
On the fourth day he disappeared .
His whereabouts have remained a mystery not only to Plath but to subsequent biographers and scholars .
However , in our research we discovered that when Hughes embarked on the Irish trip , he already had a ticket to another destination .
Ditching Plath in Ireland , he hurried to London to meet Wevill , and the two of them headed south for a 10 - day fiesta in Spain .
He and Plath had spent their honeymoon there , and she hated the country .
For him and Wevill , the trip was a delight , providing them with a creative boost : a film script that they had started writing together .
When he returned home , Hughes had a terrible row with Plath ; he refused to give up his mistress and left for London permanently .
Two months later , Plath moved to London as well .
Hughes and Wevill were no longer making a secret of their affair .
They were seen everywhere , so much so that many people mistakenly thought that they were actually living together .
On February 11 1963 , Plath ended her life .
Two days later , Myers came for a condolence visit and found Wevill resting in Plath 's bed .
A month later Hughes and Wevill decided to abort the child that Wevill was carrying .
Wevill and her husband , David , agreed to a six - month trial separation , and he went to Spain , while she moved in with Hughes and his children .
They spent the summer vacation with Hughes 's parents in Yorkshire .
In her diary , Wevill described a family dinner : as she was leaning over the table to give Frieda her food , she and Hughes collided in a kiss .
In September 1963 Hughes returned with his children to Devon , leaving Wevill on her own in the death - flat : he wanted some time to himself and she had serious doubts about his commitment to her .
When David returned from Spain , he joined Wevill in Plath 's flat .
The affair continued , but they lowered its profile and invented a secret code for their correspondence .
Hughes dispatched daily love letters to Wevill 's home , addressed to F Wall Esq .
It was a private joke between the lovers , that Hughes was the fly on the wall at the Wevills ' .
It is puzzling as to why they went to all this trouble when they could have used Wevill 's office address , as they had done before : was it for the thrill , and the romantic intrigue ?
Alexandra Tatiana Elise ( nicknamed Shura ) was born on 3 March 1965 .
Ten months later , Wevill left David and moved with Ted to Ireland .
It was a time of bliss , and Hughes was delighted and relieved that his children had taken to their half - sister .
Hughes was exploding with ideas .
He even found the strength to probe into the suicide of his wife and began writing Crow , handing Wevill the drafts to comment on .
Later , he dedicated the book to her and Shura .
Wevill 's diaries , still in private hands , give a unique account of Hughes at work , " like a great beast , looking over an enormous feast , dazzled and confused by the variety " .
Wevill was a perfect partner : artistically inclined , she wrote some poetry and was a rather skilful painter , but she was not ambitious and had no artistic ego herself .
" He 's almost incapable of performing one word wrong , " she wrote admiringly .
She said she felt reverence in the company of " one of God 's best creations " .
Together , they were working on a book of Hughes 's poems and her drawings .
The theme was A Full House , a pack of cards in which the kings , queens and knaves were biblical , mythological and historical figures .
The poet and translator Michael Hamburger , Hughes ' good friend , remembers another project of Wevill and Hughes : Wevill showed him " miniature paintings in brilliant colours with many animals and plants " .
Neither project materialised , and though some of the poems survived none of Wevill 's drawings has .
Originally , they planned to stay in Ireland for five years , but after a few months they had to return to Devon , to tend to Hughes 's ailing mother .
His parents were dismayed by their son's scandalous relationship with the haughty , thrice - married woman : they feared it had ruined his reputation .
Hughes 's father determinedly ignored Wevill 's presence .
He never spoke to her , refused to sit at the same table and averted his eyes when she put a plate of food in front of him .
And in any disagreement between Wevill and his parents , Ted invariably sided with them .
Edith Hughes was moving from one bout of illness to another , and eventually Hughes realised that she would never get better as long as she and Wevill lived under the same roof .
He initiated a disengagement plan : Wevill and Shura would return to London and wait there until his mother was strong enough to return to her home in Yorkshire .
On odd weekends Wevill and Shura came down to Devon , and he visited them in his trips to London .
They continued looking for a house of their own , but Hughes found fault with them all .
It dawned on Wevill that being at his side at the time of Plath 's suicide had contaminated her for ever , and that he would never marry her .
" I have lived on the dream of living with Ted - and this has gone kaput , " she wrote in her suicide note to her father .
" There could never be another man .
Never . "
Shura had become the core of Wevill 's existence , and she was quite certain that if left motherless , the four - year - old , pampered child would be a second - class citizen in the Hughes household .
She was afraid that Shura was too old to be adopted , and did not wish her to grow up alone as a foster child , an orphan .
Her murderous act was thus the outcome of a distorted over - responsibility : " Execute yourself and your little self efficiently , " Wevill had written in her diary three days before .
Soon after her death , Hughes wrote a poem in which he tormented himself about having been destructive towards his nearest and dearest " who were my life " .
He never published it .
Was it because it contrasted with the account that he wished to leave for posterity ?
In 1990 , he published a volume of 20 poems , Capriccio , which revolved around Wevill .
In it , he blamed her for consciously burning herself on Plath 's funeral pyre .

Martin Brodeur will go for his 40th win tomorrow night against Columbus , which will be his eighth season of 40 + wins .
No other goalie in NHL history has more than three 40 + win seasons .
Brodeur had three - straight 40 + win seasons until last year ’s torn bicep injury ended the streak .
The Devils ’ goalie believes reaching 40 wins is a significant achievement each and every season .
“ It ’s something I look at every year , ” Brodeur said of reaching 40 wins to Tom Gulitti of the Bergen Record .
“ It ’s a pretty big number for goalies to achieve .
Not many goalies have been able to put a lot of them together and I ’ve been fortunate playing here to do that .
But , because I play so much , I expect myself to get close and try to be there every there .
But you ’ve got to go out and do it .
You ’ve got to stay healthy . ”
Brodeur failed to get the win in Saturday ’s 1 - 0 loss to the Blues .

Ilya Kovalchuk was back in practice today after flying to Florida to be with his wife , Nicole , when she gave birth to the couple ’s third child , Artem .
Artem weighed in at 7.8 pounds and was 20 inches .
The Kovalchuk ’s have a four - year old daughter , Karolina , and a one - year old son , Philip .
While Kovalchuk flew back to join the team , his family stayed in Florida .
They have been living in their off - season home since the left - winger was traded to New Jersey .
Kovalchuk plans to move the family up to his rented apartment in Hoboken , NJ .
Devils ’ coach Jacques Lemaire believes the separation between Kovalchuk and his family could be weighing on the left - winger .
“ We do n’t know all that goes on in his mind , ” Lemaire said to Gulliti .
“ He ’s got the baby and moving and the wife and all of that .
It ’s part of worries . ”
Kovalchuk has five goals and seven assists in 16 games for the Devils .
Even with his struggles , Lemaire will stick with the left - winger on the powerplay .
“ If his minutes would be too high , I would take some power play ( time ) off as long as we would score , ” Lemaire said to Gulliti .
“ But if we ’re not scoring , I want him on the power play first and then cut his minutes somewhere else . ”
ANALYSIS : It matters little if Cardinal Brady resigns for he and the church he leads is damaged beyond repair , writes PATSY McGARRY
IT DID not seem possibile that it could get any worse .
It has .
The clerical child sex abuse scandal has now spread to the very top in Ireland and in Rome .
We heard at the weekend , through the German press , that in January 1980 the then Archbishop of Munich Joseph Ratzinger approved the transfer of Father “ H ” , a suspected paedophile , to Munich to undergo therapy .
Despite his record Father “ H ” was assigned work in pastoral care where he again abused minors .
In June 1986 he was convicted of sexually abusing minors , fined DM4,000 and given an 18 - month suspended sentence .
Father “ H ” is , apparently , still serving as a priest in Bavaria .
At the weekend priest Gerhard Gruber , who was at the time vicar general in Munich , assumed total responsibility for the decision to readmit Father “ H ” to pastoral care work , expressing regret and seeming to suggest that Archbishop Ratzinger had not been fully informed .
Few who are aware of the meticulous working methods of Joseph Ratzinger throughout his long career , right up to and including the current papacy , are convinced , however , that such a significant matter would have escaped his notice .
As the well - known US clerical child sex abuse activist Fr Tom Doyle said at the weekend : “ Tell the vicar general to find a better line .
What he ’s trying to do , obviously , is protect the pope . ”
We heard at the weekend also , through the Irish press that in 1975 as a 35 - year - old priest of Kilmore diocese Cardinal Seán Brady conducted canonical investigations , involving a 10 - year - old boy and a 14 - year - old girl , into clerical child sex abuse allegations against Fr Brendan Smyth .
He bound the children to secrecy , believed what they said and , acting on the information they supplied , recommended to his bishop that his priestly faculties be removed from Fr Smyth where diocesan work was concerned .
He told no garda and no one in the then health board of what he had uncovered , nor did any of his superiors .
And none of them told the two children at any time , either before , during , or after the inquiry , that they were free to tell the Garda or health board .
No , the only people they were told they could talk to about their abuse were authorised clergy .
Not just any old priest .
Whether intended or not , the oath these children were asked to take ensured their complete silence .
Some would suggest that putting young children through such an exercise in enforced silence was in itself a form of abuse by adults .
Cardinal Brady feels none of this is a resigning matter and that such would be a matter for the pope anyhow .
Considering the pope ’s own current troubles in this area , one has to wonder just what authority still remains to Benedict XVI on the subject .
But whether Cardinal Brady resigns or does not is really a moot point .
Similarly with the resignations , offered or otherwise , of bishops Moriarty , Walsh , Field , Drennan or Murray .
It does n’t matter anymore .
It is too late .
The Catholic Church in Ireland , as we have known it , is seriously damaged and probably beyond repair .
It is sinking and sinking fast .
And , as indicated from recent revelations on the European continent , the Irish Catholic Church may have company on that journey down .
And what seems to be missing in this process of decline and fall is any awareness of the truly great damage all of this is doing to Christianity itself , whether in Ireland and abroad .
But , be sure of one thing , such damage will not stop Ireland ’s Catholic bishops rallying to the side of Cardinal Brady in coming days , as he and they did where Bishop John Magee was concerned early last year and indeed where bishops Murray , Moriarty , Walsh , Field and Drennan were / are concerned since publication of the Murphy report at the end of November .
The only exception where such rallying around a beleagured colleague ( whatever the circumstances ! ) was concerned has been the Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin .
He was silent on the matter of Bishop Magee .
He challenged those bishops named in the Murphy report to explain themselves .
When Bishop Eamonn Walsh circulated a letter last December saying he had his ( archbishop ’s ) , support following publication of the Murphy report , Archbishop Martin responded with “ a clarification ” .
That was followed quickly by Bishop Walsh ’s and Bishop Field ’s offers of resignation .
But of late Archbishop Martin has dropped very far below the radar .
He was very much to the fore following publication of the Ryan report last May and again following publication of the Murphy report last November .
He has gone to ground since Christmas , having suffered the slings and arrows of of some outraged colleagues and clergy , it seems .
He must rediscover his mojo .
Otherwise the Irish Catholic Church has no future .
Either that , or he sinks with it .

Why Particle Physics is Important A personal view from Craig Dukes
The scientist does not study nature because it is useful ; he studies it because he delights in it , and he delights in it because it is beautiful .
If nature were not beautiful , it would not be worth knowing , and if nature were not worth knowing , life would not be worth living .
- Henri Poincaré .
As particle physicists we delight in discovering new aspects of nature , fundamental aspects of nature that are common to everything - the building blocks of the universe .
We are fortunate to be living in a society where we no longer must struggle just to survive from day to day , but where our prosperity has allowed time and money for more : art , literature , music , science .
Is the money spent on particle physics justified ?
I would reply with a resounding Yes !
even if the only return was the pleasure of an increased understanding of nature .
But there are technological spin - offs that have more than returned all of the money that has been spent on the pursuit of this knowledge .
The most oustanding example is the invention of the World Wide Web at CERN in the late 1980's .
The builder of Fermilab , R.R. Wilson , perhaps explained best why studying fundamental physics is so important in his testimony before the Congress of the United States in 1969 .
Congress was looking for some sort of justification in spending $ 200 million .
What follows is an excert from Wilson 's testimony before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy .
Pastore :
Is there anything connected in the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of this country ?
Wilson :
No sir ; I do not belive so .
Pastore : Nothing at all ?
Wilson : Nothing at all .
Pastore :
It has no value in that respect ?
Wilson :
It only has to do with the respect with which we regard one another , the dignity of men , our love of culture .
It has to do with those things .
It has nothing to do with the military , I am sorry .
Pastore : Do n't be sorry for it .
Wilson : I am not , but I cannot in honesty say it has any such application .
Pastore :
Is there anything here that projects us in a position of being competitive with the Russians , with regard to this race ?
Wilson :
Only from a long - range point of view , of a developing technology .
Otherwise , it has to do with :
Are we good painters , good sculptors , great poets ?
I mean all the things that we really venerate and honor in our country and are patriotic about .
In that sense , this new knowledge has all to do with honor and country but it has nothing to do directly with defending our country , except to make it worth defending .
It is my sincerist belief that when the history of our time is written , many many years from now , it will be regarded , with perhaps some envy , as the golden age of science .
We are fortunate to live in such exciting times and to play our part in making these great discoveries .

If you were watching last night 's episode of The Vampire Diaries ( believe us , we were not ) , you probably saw something a little ... strange .
Yes , with the opening credits still running , two women ( sorry , we have never seen a frame of this show so we do n't know who these broads are ) sitting in front of a laptop converse about a runaway teen named Isabelle Peterson or something like that .
Unsure of whether or not this suspicious Peterson character was using a fake name or not , the ladies needed ... well , they needed a tool that would allow them to search the vast and beautiful world wide web of information .
" But where 'd she get Peterson ?
Classmate ?
Best friend ? " the blond sitting at the terminal wonders .
" So ... " she says , turning to the computer , " ... I Binged it . "
Wait , what ?
You Binged it ?
Hmm ... we 've never heard that one before , though we have to say in this case , it seems like Bing really came through for the ladies , nailing down the information they were looking for with ease .
It 's quite an extended piece of advertising , really .
But seriously ...
Binged ?
Guess it 'll have to do .
Video is after the break .
[ Thanks , Eva ]

The NHL has made
Most players suspended this year are either marginal NHLers ( Maxim Lapierre ) , rats who ’ve someone stuck around this long ( Matt Cooke , Tuomo Ruutu ) , or players that no one would care if they did n’t play ( James Wisniewski ) .
Only 5 players are successful NHLers ( Alexander Ovechkin , Mike Green , James Neal , Danny Briere , and Ed Jovonoski ) .
That means the majority of the time that a player is suspended it has little or no consequence for their team .
Did the Montreal Canadiens seriously worry that Maxim Lapierre was going to miss 4 games ?
No .
He sucks .
If these suspensions do n’t actually affect the player 's team then how are they supposed to help curb dangerous plays ?
Teams can just call up someone from the AHL to fill the 3 - 10 minutes that they will be missing .
And this is certainly not a quality 3 - 10 minutes they are missing , so replacing the offending player is n’t a big deal .
Also , the league ’s minimum salary ensures that every player makes a small fortune and missing a few games wo n’t take a large hit from your salary .
The players clearly do n’t care .
To really make teams pay for their players ’ stupidity the league must actually make a punishment that will affect a team ’s performance .
If a player is suspended the team can not be allowed to replace that player on the roster .
That means they ca n’t make a call - up and they ca n’t dress a healthy scratch .
They need to play with one less player for the duration of the suspension .
For example , since James Wisniewski is suspended for 8 games the Ducks should be forced to play with only 5 defenceman for all 8 games .
When a team loses a defenceman to injury early in a game every other defenceman has to play more minutes and by the end of the game they all look exhausted .
Can you imagine having to play like this over a period of 8 games ?
How will a team respond to a lengthy road trip or playing three games in four nights ?
This rule would certainly have more effect when the league suspends a defenceman , since the fourth forward line does n’t usually play nearly as much as the third defensive pairing .
But it would still wear down a forward group .
Plus , this would make lesser known players play elevated minutes , which would certainly lead to more opportunities for the opposition .
This would ensure that teams of a suspended player are actually punished for their player ’s actions .
This rule would make dressing a rat player like Matt Cooke even more dangerous .
Instead of being valued for being a player who occasionally crosses the line , these players would become a huge liability for their teams .
In a perfect world it would eliminate this type of player from hockey .
I do n’t think there ’s anyone who would mind .
If players continue to play with a lack of respect and teams continue to sign these players then something must be done .
The league needs to properly punish both player and team and this is the best way to do so .
The NHL has made 24 suspensions this year .
This does n’t include 3 suspensions given out during the pre-season .
Of those 24 suspensions , there are 13 players who are repeat offenders , and three of which have actually been suspended more than once this season .
So really , that ’s 21 players being suspended , 13 of which are repeat offenders .
That ’s over 60 % .
Are suspensions working ?
Clearly they are n’t .

It ’s almost funny how poorly the NHL ’s image has suffered since the Olympics .
It did n’t even take a day after I posted about Ovechkin and Cooke for another player to violently injure an opponent .
James Wisniewski ( not Andy Wozniewski , he sucks even worse ) , a defenceman for the Anaheim Ducks , raced in from the blueline to deliver a retaliatory check on Chicago Olympian Brent Seabrook .
Earlier in the play Seabrook laid out Corey Perry in what maybe should have been a penalty , maybe not .
Hard to say really .
It certainly was n’t anything to lose your mind over .
The refs did n’t call anything , so Wisniewski took matters into his own hands .
Seabrook did n’t have the puck .
In fact , the player he passed to had enough time to pass the puck .
Seabrook was unsuspecting .
To compound the matter , Wisniewski leapt from his feet and launched Seabrook into the boards from a few feet away .
Seabrook was out before he hit the ground .
It was sickening This hit is stupid for multiple reasons .
Wisniewski claims he did n’t know Seabrook did n’t have the puck and that he was just finishing his check .
Well , if that ’s true then I guess it confirms Wisniewski is a player with no hockey sense because it was clear Seabrook did n’t have the puck .
Although , when you tunnel in on a player and are looking to take him out you ca n’t really pay attention to much else .
What ’s even stupider about this play is that Wisniewski is a defenceman .
Why was he below the red line finishing a check when the Hawks had cleared the puck from the zone ?
Should n’t he be on the blueline ?
Obviously , he was below the red line because he skated there full force to take out Seabrook .
No other reason .
What I really hate about these hits and “ the Code ” is what it says about the player being hit .
Corey Perry is 6 ’3 and 209 lbs .
He hits people and he fights .
He ’s accumulated 105 penalty minutes this year .
Just because he ’s close to being a point - per - game player does n’t mean he ’s incapable of defending himself .
Did Corey Perry react to the hit Seabrook threw ?
No .
If Perry had a problem he would have dealt with it himself .
Wisniewski charging in like a lunatic and launching himself at Seabrook is embarrassing to Perry .
It suggests that he ca n’t take a hit .
Certainly we ’re not at the point in the NHL where you ca n’t legally hit superstars .
The NHL suspended Wisniewski for 8 games , which is entirely appropriate , but at the same time ridiculous because of the Matt Cooke non-suspension .
It ’s clear that this was a suspendable offence , but because Colin Campbell made such an egregious error with Matt Cooke there was no way Wisniewski would be sentenced lightly .
Campbell was trying to save some face , but ends up looking clueless .
What I really want to talk about today is whether or not these suspensions are actually doing anything .
If they are n’t , then how is the NHL supposed to curb the illegal hits plaguing the game of hockey ?

Remarks of President Barack Obama – As Prepared for Delivery
Monday , March 15 , 2010
Strongsville , Ohio
Hello , Ohio !
It ’s great to be here in the Buckeye State .
And it ’s even better to be out of Washington for a little while .
I want to thank Connie and her family for being here on behalf of Natoma .
It ’s not easy to share such a personal story .
I appreciate your willingness to do so .
I want you to know that she is the reason that I am here today .
I know that she felt it was important that her story be told .
Last month , I read a letter from Natoma .
She ’s self - employed , trying to make ends meet , and has for years done the responsible thing : buying health insurance through the individual market .
The thing is , sixteen years ago , she was diagnosed with a form of treatable cancer .
And even though she had been cancer free for more than a decade , the insurance company kept jacking up her rates anyway , year after year .
So she increased her out - of - pocket expenses .
She raised her deductible .
She was doing everything she could to maintain health insurance that would be there for her in case she got sick .
But even as she upped her deductible to the maximum , last year Natoma ’s insurance company raised her premiums by more than 25 percent .
Over the past year , she paid more than $ 6,000 in monthly premiums .
She paid more than $ 4,000 out - of - pocket for co-pays , medical care , and prescriptions .
So she ponied up more than $ 10,000 dollars .
But because she never hit her deductible , her insurer only spent $ 900 on her care .
And yet what comes in the mail at the end of last year ?
A letter telling Natoma that her premiums would go up again by more than 40 percent .
She just could not afford it .
She did n’t have the money .
And despite her desire to keep her coverage – despite her fears that she would get sick and lose the home her parents built – she finally surrendered and gave up her health insurance .
January was her last month of being insured .
Like so many responsible Americans – folks who work hard every day , who try to do the right thing – she was forced to hang her fortunes on chance .
She hoped against hope she would stay healthy .
She feared terribly she would not .
That was the letter .
And I understand Natoma was pretty surprised when she found out that I read it – word for word – to the CEOs of America ’s largest insurance companies – including the company that hiked up her rates by more than 40 percent .
This was less than two weeks ago .
But then Natoma ’s worst fears were realized .
Just last week , she was working on a nearby farm , walking outside – apparently , chasing after a cow – when she collapsed .
She was rushed to the hospital .
She was very sick .
She needed two blood transfusions .
Doctors performed a battery of tests .
And on Saturday , Natoma was diagnosed with leukemia – a serious form of cancer .
The reason Natoma is not here today is that she ’s lying in a hospital bed , suddenly faced with this emergency – suddenly thrust into a fight for her life .
She expects to face a month or more of aggressive chemotherapy .
And she is racked with worry not only about her illness but about the cost of the tests and treatments she will surely need to beat it .
I ’m here because of Natoma .
I ’m here because of countless others who have been forced to face the hardest and most terrifying challenges in their lives with the added burden of medical bills they cannot pay .
I ’m here because I remember my own mother , in the last six months of her life , on the phone in her hospital room arguing with insurance companies when she should have been spending time with her family .
I ’m here because of the millions denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions – or dropped from coverage when they get sick .
I ’m here because of the small businesses forced to choose between health care and hiring .
I ’m here because of the seniors unable to afford the prescriptions they need .
I ’m here because of the folks seeing premiums going up by thirty , forty , fifty percent in a year .
I am here because this is not the America I believe in – and it ’s not the America you believe in .
And so when you hear people say " start over " – I want you to think of Natoma .
When you hear people saying that this is n’t the " right time " – think of what she ’s going through .
When you hear people talk about who ’s up and who ’s down in the polls – instead of what ’s right or what ’s wrong for the country – think of her and the millions of responsible people – working people – being hurt by today ’s system of health insurance .
And I want you to remember :
There but for the grace of God go I .
This status quo on health care is simply unsustainable .
We cannot have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people .
We know what will happen if we fail to act .
We know our government will be plunged deeper into debt .
We know millions more people will lose coverage .
And we know that rising costs will saddle millions more families with unaffordable expenses – and will force many small businesses to drop coverage altogether .
A study just came out yesterday – a non-partisan study – which found that without reform , premiums could more than double for individuals and families over the next decade .
Family policies could pass $ 25,000 .
Can you afford that ?
We have debated health care in Washington for more than a year .
Every proposal has been put on the table .
Every argument has been made .
I know many people view this as a partisan issue , but both parties have found plenty of areas where we agree .
And what we ’ve ended up with is a proposal that ’s somewhere in the middle – one that incorporates the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans .
On one side of the spectrum , there were those who wanted to scrap our system of private insurance and replace it with government - run health care .
But I did n’t think that was practical or realistic .
On the other side of the spectrum , there are those who believe the answer is to simply unleash the insurance industry , by providing less oversight and fewer rules .
I call this the " putting the foxes in charge of the hen house " approach .
It would only give insurance companies more leeway to raise premiums and deny care .
I do n’t believe we should give the government or the insurance companies more control over health care in America .
I believe it ’s time to give you – the American people – more control over your own health insurance .
That ’s why my proposal builds on the current system where most Americans get their health insurance from their employer .
If you like your plan , you can keep your plan .
If you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor .
I would n’t want any plan that interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor .
Essentially , my proposal would change three things about the current health care system .
First , it would end the worst practices of insurance companies .
Within the first year of signing health care reform , thousands of uninsured Americans with pre-existing conditions will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time in their lives .
This year , insurance companies will be banned forever from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions .
This year , they will be banned from dropping your coverage when you get sick .
Those practices will end .
If this reform becomes law , all new insurance plans will be required to offer free preventive care to their customers starting this year – free check - ups so we can start catching preventable illnesses on the front end .
Starting this year , if you buy a new plan , there will be no more lifetime or restrictive annual limits on the amount of care you receive from your insurance companies .
And if you ’re an uninsured young adult , you ’ll be able to stay on your parents ’ policy until you ’re 26 years old .
The second thing that would change about the current system is this : for the first time , uninsured individuals and small businesses will have the same kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress get for themselves .
If this reform becomes law , Members of Congress will be getting their insurance from the same place the uninsured get theirs .
Because if it ’s good enough for the American people , it ought to be good enough for the people you send to Washington .
My proposal also says that if you still can’t afford the insurance in this new marketplace , we will offer you tax credits to do so – tax credits that add up to the largest middle class tax cut for health care in history .
After all , the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is , and the least well - off are able to get coverage through Medicaid .
But it ’s the middle - class that gets squeezed , and that ’s who we have to help .
Now , it ’s true that all of this will cost money – about $ 100 billion per year .
But most of this comes from the nearly $ 2.5 trillion a year that America already spends on health care .
It ’s just that right now , a lot of that money is being spent badly .
With this plan , we ’re going to make sure the dollars we spend go toward making insurance more affordable and more secure .
We ’re also going to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance companies .
And we will set a new fee on insurance companies that stand to gain as millions of Americans are able to buy insurance .
Here ’s the point : our proposal is paid for .
Finally , my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for families , businesses , and the federal government .
Americans buying comparable coverage to what they have today in the individual market would see premiums fall by 14 to 20 percent .
For Americans who get their insurance through the workplace , costs could fall by as much as $ 3,000 a person .
By now , we have incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rising cost of health care – ideas that go after the waste and abuse in our system , especially in programs like Medicare .
Our cost - cutting measures would reduce most people ’s premiums and bring down our deficit by up to $ 1 trillion over the next two decades .
And those are n’t my numbers ; they are the savings determined by the Congressional Budget Office , the nonpartisan , independent referee of Congress .
Now , the opponents of reform have tried a lot of different arguments to stop these changes .
But maybe the most insidious is the idea that somehow this would hurt Medicare .
And I know we ’ve got some seniors with us today .
So let me just tell you directly : this proposal adds almost a decade of solvency to Medicare .
This proposal would close that gap in prescription drug coverage – called the doughnut hole – that sticks seniors with thousands of dollars in drug costs .
This proposal will over time help to reduce the costs of Medicare that you pay every month .
And this proposal would make preventive care free so you do n’t have to pay out - of - pocket for tests that keep you healthy .
Yes , we are going after the waste , fraud , and abuse in Medicare .
But that ’s because these are dollars that should be spent on care for seniors , not the care and feeding of insurance companies through subsidies and sweetheart deals .
Every senior should know : there is no cutting of your guaranteed Medicare benefits .
Period .
This proposal makes Medicare stronger , makes the coverage better , and makes its finances more secure .
Anyone who says otherwise is misinformed – or is trying to misinform you .
So that ’s the proposal .
And I believe Congress owes the American people a final up - or - down vote .
Of course , now that we ’re approaching this vote , we ’re hearing a lot of people in Washington talking about the politics .
Talking about what this means for November .
Talking about the poll numbers for the Democrats and the Republicans .
But that ’s why I wanted to come here today .
Because in the end , this debate is about far more than the politics .
It 's about what kind of country we want to be .
It ’s about the millions of lives that would be touched and , in some cases , saved by making private health insurance more secure and more affordable .
It ’s about a woman , lying in a hospital bed , who wants nothing more than to be able to pay for the care she needs .
And the truth is , what is at stake in this debate is not just our ability to solve this problem , but our ability to solve any problem .
The American people want to know if it 's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future .
They are waiting for us to act .
They are waiting for us to lead .
And as long as I hold this office , I intend to provide that leadership .
I do n’t know about the politics .
But I know what ’s right .
So I am calling on Congress to pass these reforms – and I look forward to signing them into law .
Thank you , God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .

Rudd ( right ) made his comments following Williams ' TV appearance Few are laughing in Australia following Robin Williams ' joke that its people are " basically English rednecks " .
His remarks prompted Australian PM Kevin Rudd to suggest he should " spend a little time in Alabama " before commenting on people being rednecks .
That in turn offended the governor of Alabama , who said Mr Rudd should know that people in the southern state were " decent , hard - working creative people " .
Williams also joked that Mr Rudd had heckled him during a recent concert .
" You go into a club and get heckled in Australia , it 's kind of mandatory - ' get on with it '!
" And that was just the prime minister , " the comedian said .
' Unusual country ' Speaking on The Late Show with David Letterman , Williams , 58 , said Australia was an " unusual country " , adding : " If [ Charles ] Darwin had landed in Australia , he'd have gone , ' I 'm wrong - I do n't know what I was thinking ' . "
Mr Riley said Alabamans were decent and hard - working people Commentators have since pointed out that the famous naturalist spent two months in Australia in 1836 .
Williams , recently seen in critically - slated comedy Old Dogs , went on to joke about Australian - rules football , which he likened to " rugby with a thong " .
In an Australian radio interview on Wednesday , Mr Rudd hit back at Williams ' comments .
" I think Robin Williams should go and spend a bit of time in Alabama before he frames comments about anyone being particularly redneck , " he said .
But in doing so , the chain of offence moved on to Alabama , with Gov Bob Riley issuing a statement saying : " I 'm not sure if Prime Minister Rudd has ever been to Alabama . "
" If he has , he would know that Alabamians are decent , hard working , creative people . "
Oscar - winning Williams , who performed in Australia last year as part of an international tour , underwent heart surgery last March to replace an aortic valve .

The end of prisons ?
In a country that claims to be the land of the free , the number of people under the control of the U.S. corrections system has exploded over the last 25 years to more than 7.3 million , or 1 in every 31 U.S. adults , according to a report released by the Pew Center on the States .
The actual number of people behind bars rose to 2.3 million , nearly five times more than the world ’s average .
The U.S. currently boasts the highest rate of incarceration of any country at any time in history , a full 25 percent of the world ’s prison population .
We also have the greatest number of laws of any country at any time in history , laws created by nearly 90,000 separate governmental entities .
This spaghetti mess of rules and regulation is so complicated that virtually any person can get tripped up by them .
One simple mistake may very well result in incarceration , and it goes downhill from there .
Incarceration is a system that breeds failure .
On the prisoner level , an incoming prisoner is instantly immersed in an “ us - vs - them ” mindset as their surrounding community is transformed into the worst of all possible social circles .
On the operational level , success in the prison industry is not measured by how many lives have been improved , but rather on occupancy levels , the number of prison incidents and escape attempts , and how well the budget is managed .
On the justice system level , more prisoners translate into larger budgets .
The system was created to protect people from criminals .
Its based on the notion that if someone is removed from society they can no longer harm anyone .
While certain crimes warrant imprisonment , it becomes an inappropriate form of punishment for most .
Police and court systems improve their standing in the justice community through the size of their organization which directly relates to the sheer volume of cases they handle .
On a certain level , albeit indirectly , there are incentives to “ create more criminals ” because more criminals mean more money .
A more appropriate measure of the effectiveness of an organization would be in the corrective or transformative nature of their actions , the overall efficiency with which a problem is solved and people ( both the offenders and the offended ) go back to leading productive lives .
The flaws in the overreaching authority of the U.S. justice system can be found in the system itself .
There are no checks and balances on the system level for the criminal justice system .
There are no caps or upper limits , no incentives for rehabilitating criminals .
Fact is that people coming out of the system are worse than when they went in , and virtually all of them will eventually make it back into society .
There are no ways of measuring the toll it takes on society and on an individual level , the relationships it severs , the dreams it shatters , the cost of opportunities lost .
Individuals who enter the prison system lose their jobs and their ability to earn an income .
The spillover effect is severe .
In most instances it has major repercussions on their spouse , their children , parents , siblings , and friends .
For the victims it offers little resolution .
Each imprisonment creates a blast zone of destruction that is difficult to recover from .
Authorities will be hard pressed to argue that the U.S. has an inferior gene pool , so therefore higher incarceration rates are warranted .
They will also be hard pressed to argue that the system works well .
A recent study showed that among nearly 275,000 prisoners released , 67.5 percent were rearrested within 3 years , and 51.8 percent went back in prison .
Making matters worse , 35 percent of the people entering prisons in the U.S. are there for violating parole .
Some minority groups are being particularly hard hit .
Jeremy Travis , President of John Jay College of Criminal Justice puts it this way .
“ On a national level , an African - American man today has a 30 percent lifetime chance of serving at least one year in prison .
I would like to be optimistic about the likelihood of reversing this reality and returning to the status quo of 1972 , but I think the chances of even getting close to that are slim .
I think we have to recognize that we now live - regrettably in my view - in an era of mass incarceration . ”
{pagebreak : Page 1}
Martin Horn , NY City Corrections Commissioner , voices a similar concern .
“ We are creating a culture of imprisonment ; we are turbo - charging whatever is going wrong in those young people ’s lives . ”
In addition to the great human toll of incarceration , $ 68 billion of our taxpayer dollars has been committed to pay for this travesty .
In the past two decades , state general fund spending on corrections increased by more than 300 percent , outpacing other essential government services like education , transportation , and public assistance .
But things may finally be looking up .
We are simply too broke to keep locking people up .
Incarceration rates in 30 states declined last year .
Could this be an indication that the $ 22,000 per year spent on housing prisoners is starting to outweigh the benefits ?
Restorative Justice
The U.S. has constructed a massively bureaucratic justice system that feeds off the missteps of its citizens , a system that it can no longer afford .
As a result , new systems are coming to light .
Restorative Justice is one such approach where offenders are brought into the same room with the people they harmed and encouraged to take responsibility for their actions .
Sometimes they agree to repair or pay for the damage , return stolen money , or perform community service .
In Longmont , Chief of Police Mike Butler has been a pioneer in Restorative Justice techniques , applying it in more than 1,200 cases with an amazing 90 percent success rate .
“ We work with people before the lawyers get involved and before they enter the courts , ” says Butler .
“ By doing this , we have been able to eliminate most of the costs and give the offenders a reasonable shot at turning their life around . ”
These offenders are given a chance to meet with their victims and community members in a respectful process where they can learn the full impact of their crime and agree to repair their harm .
On average 90 percent complete their agreements and are welcomed back to the community .
Its a far different model than the old school idea of just “ lock ‘ em up ! ”
Restorative Justice is a balance between the rights of offenders and the needs of victims .
Perhaps better stated , it is a balance between the need to rehabilitate offenders and the duty to protect the public .
You might think it is dangerous to allow lawbreakers back into the community , yet the opposite appears to be true .
The average re-arrest rate for offenders who participate in Longmont ’s restorative justice program is 10 percent .
Compare that to the nearly 70 percent re-arrest rate for the national penal system .
According to participant feedback data , every group engaged in the Longmont program – including victims , offenders , parents and community members – reported over 95 percent satisfaction with their restorative justice experience .
In restorative justice , because victims are heard and offenders repair the harm of their crime , they become higher functioning citizens able to work and make a contribution to their community , including paying their share of taxes .
So why has n’t Restorative Justice caught on in a big way yet ?
My guess is that the current prison system has a lot of inertia and any changes will require the buy - in from everyone currently working inside the system .
Barring any legislative changes , its just easier to maintain the status quo .
PREDICTIONS :
• Even though the signals are weak , the system is too broken to be maintained .
Look for the U.S. prison population to decline by more than 25 percent over the next 10 years .
• Look for a significant defunding of the justice system and a radically new set of criteria for measuring success .
OPPORTUNITIES :
There will be major opportunities for those who can help unravel the present bureaucracy and help rethink the new system that will soon be created .
Since many of the people in the currently criminal justice system will be looking for new career paths , significant opportunities will be found in helping people through the transitions .
Prisoners who are released early through this process , and there will be many of them , represent a sizable labor force that can , and should , be put to good use .
Many existing prisons will be closed .
These facilities will need to be converted into other uses .

Nomar Garciaparra , who for the better part of nine years was the face of the franchise before his shocking trade in 2004 , has come home to the Red Sox .
At his request , the Red Sox today signed the 36 - year - old to a minor - league contract at which point he announced his retirement from baseball during a press conference held at City of Palms Park .
He was accompanied by his wife , Mia Hamm , and their twin daughters along with his father , Ramon .

“ I was getting choked up then , I ’m choked up now , and I ’ve got the chills , ” Garciaparra said .
“ But to be able to have that dream come true , I just ca n’t put it into words what this organization has always meant to me , ” an emotional Garciaparra said .
“ It ’s my family , the fans — I always tell people Red Sox Nation is bigger than any nation out there .
I came back home , and to be part of Red Sox Nation is truly a thrill . ”
Garciaparra also announced that he had taken a position with ESPN to appear on Baseball Tonight and as a game analyst .
But first he wanted to fulfill what he called “ a dream ” by retiring as a member of the team he came up with and starred for .
“ I think last time I was in Boston when the Oakland A ’s came to town [ last season ] . . .
I was talking about always having a recurring dream to be able to retire in a Red Sox uniform , ” Garciaparra said .
“ I want to thank John Henry , Mr. Werner , Mr. Lucchino , and Theo , and the Red Sox organization , because today I get to retire and fulfill that dream and retire as a Red Sox .

Garciaparra played for the Sox from 1996 until he was traded midway through the 2004 season .
He hit .323 for the Red Sox for his career with 178 home runs , 690 RBI and a .370 on - base percentage .
He was a two - time batting champion and finished in the top 10 of the MVP voting five times .
Garciaparra , Derek Jeter , and Alex Rodriguez were once the subject of intense debate about who was the better shortstop .
Garciaparra was a five - time All - Star in Boston , the Rookie of the Year in 1997 and finished second in the MVP voting of 1998 when he hit .323 and drove in 122 runs while hitting 35 homers .
“ This is how it ’s supposed to happen , ” former teammate Tim Wakefield said .
“ He was a Red Sox for a long time and he ’ll always be remembered as a Red Sox .
Having him retire as a Red Sox is pretty special . …
The best , he was a great teammate and to have him behind you defensively and in the box for you was really amazing . ”
Garciaparra , wearing his old No. 5 jersey , threw out the first pitch before today ’s Rays - Red Sox exhibition game at City of Palms Park .
When the announcement of his decision was made , Garciaparra received a thunderous ovation from the sellout crowd .
The current players lined the top step of the dugout and applauded as well .
Jason Varitek , Garciaparra ’s teammate at Georgia Tech and with the Sox , caught the pitch and the two embraced in front of the plate .
Theo Epstein , the man who traded Nomar to the Cubs , said during the press conference that this day meant a lot to him personally .
He expanded on that thought later on .

“ I grew up a Red Sox fan and even through I was already in baseball when he became a player , I knew
what he meant to Boston and to the fans .
When his agent contacted us about doing this , I thought it was great .
He should go out as a Red Sox because he was such a great player . ”
Team president Larry Lucchino said the team hopes to have Garciaparra at Fenway Park for some sort of ceremony and the hope is that Garciaparra will be representing the
team in the future at various events .
Garciaparra fell out of favor with the organization and was traded to the Cubs on July 31 , 2004 as part of a four - team ,
eight - player deal .
The Red Sox went on to win the World Series with Orlando Cabrera as their shortstop .
Terry Francona , who managed Garciaparra only in 2004 , reflected on the trade this morning and how surprised he was by the reaction of the fans .
It was Francona ’s first season in Boston .
“ His last part in Boston was tough , ” Francona said .
“ He was kind of Boston - ed out .
It had kind of wore on him for whatever reasons .
Sometimes it ’s time to move on .
That does n’t mean he ’s a bad person .
I think the fact he ’s come back kind of shows that . ”
Garciaparra played for the Dodgers and Athletics in recent seasons with mixed success .
He hit .281 for Oakland last season as a reserve .
He became a free agent after last season , but was not in demand .
He contacted the Red Sox a few weeks ago , seeking career closure and a one - day contract .
“ This is where I started , this is where the dream to play baseball in the big league started here , with the Red Sox , ” he said .
“ Once I got to play in front of all these fans , and the way this city and all these fans embraced me , I mean , I always just felt that connection .
Like I said , for me , I always said I truly wanted this to be the last uniform I ever put on .
And today , I get to do that .
And that ’s why it ’s so important to me . ”
But first Garciaparra had to come to grips with the idea of ending his playing career .
“ Everyone has to come to a point where they have to retire .
For me , I think , what really hit was working out this offseason , the genetic ( leg ) condition I have that has limited me over the years , I just could n’t work out the way I wanted to work out .
You know , I had a teammate and friend who once said he knew the last day he played he said , ‘ I knew my tank was empty . ’
When I heard him say that quote , I thought it was one of the greatest quotes I ’ve heard .
I thought , I wish someday I could say that .
There was one day this offseason where I was getting ready and I came home and told my wife , ‘ My tank ’s empty . ’ ” It truly is .
I really just gave everything that I could to this game , and as much as I could . ”

There is a very important research contribution that is relevant to the effect of the siting of surface temperature instrumentation with respect to the assessment of spatially representative long - term trends .
The implications of her study goes beyond that of cattle grazing , as this is the first study , to my knowledge , of the effect on surface temperatures of vegetation / soil patterns on the scale of a few meters .
This , of course , assures that the overlying atmosphere is essentially identical such that any differences in the soil temperatures , and other climate metrics are due to the details of the immediate land surface characteristics .
The study is in an M.S. thesis ( which is a peer reviewed contribution ) under the direction of Peter D. Blanken of the University of Colorado in Boulder .
The thesis is
Wolchansky , Jennifer E. ( M.A. , Geography )
Effects of Simulated Grazing on Soil Temperature , Moisture , and Respiration on a Shortgrass Steppe in Northeastern Colorado .
University of Colorado , 2005 .
The abstract reads
“ Cattle grazing , a common form of land use on grasslands , could alter the climate at the surface .
This study focused on how physical landscape changes associated with grazing could have a significant impact on soil temperature and moisture , and subsequently on soil respiration on a shortgrass steppe in northeastern Colorado .
Using micrometeorological data , the objective of this research was to discern the connections between energy , water , carbon and land use , particularly grazing .
To achieve this objective , the research was divided into two sections , each with its own objectives and results , yet both related to the overall objective .
The first section examined the impacts of simulated grazing on soil temperature and moisture .
Plots with varying fractions of bare ground were used to simulate grazing density .
Results indicated that both soil temperature and soil moisture increased with an increase in the fraction of bare ground .
In addition , this section investigated the effects of the arrangement of bare ground on soil temperature and moisture .
Soil temperature was found to be similar under contiguous and mosaic patches of bare ground while soil moisture was found to differ .
The second section of the research expanded upon the results found in the first section .
Having found the relationship between the fraction of bare ground , and soil temperature and moisture , simulated cattle grazing was indirectly linked to changes in soil respiration .
Soil respiration increased with an increase in soil temperature , until a critical threshold temperature was reached .
An increase in soil moisture resulted in a decrease in soil respiration .
Because grasslands cover nearly half of the earth ’s terrestrial surface , it is important to understand how land management on these grasslands can affect the ecosystem .
In addition , determining how grazing can influence the release of CO2 to the atmosphere is crucial at such a time when there is growing concern about global climate change . ”
One of the predictions which she confirmed in her study was that
“ Configuration of patchiness will impact spatial variation of soil temperature and moisture .
An increase in soil temperature and a decrease in upper profile soil moisture is expected with distance from vegetation .
Therefore , a plot of half bare ground and half vegetation will have a higher maximum temperature and lower minimum soil moisture than that of a randomly arranged plot . ”
An excerpts in the conclusion , that is directly relevant to the issue of spatial representativeness of long - term temperature trends read
“ The first phase of this research found that while Ts under bare ground was generally greater than that under vegetation , more importantly , Ts values increased as the fraction of bare ground increased under both bare and vegetated cover throughout the full period .
Essentially , because there is a positive correlation between grazing density and the fraction of bare ground ( Teague et al. 2004 , Metzger et al. 2005 ) , these results imply that an increase in grazing density will increase Ts. Additionally , greatest differences in Ts between bare ground and vegetated cover were found in the plot with roughly half vegetation , half bare ground .
Although recommended grazing densities generally result in 15 - 20 % bare ground ( Justin Derner , personal communication ) , this result indicates that if an area were overgrazed enough to produce 50 % bare ground , then implications would be great .
Such a significant difference in Ts between the bare and vegetated cover could influence surface heat fluxes and , in turn , could affect atmospheric conditions . ”
In terms of station siting , the spatial assessment completed by Jennifer Wolchansky and Peter Blanken can be interpreted as what occurs if a single location undergoes these local land surface changes over time .
The effect on the surface temperature trends as more bare ground is gradually exposed for whatever reason would result in a warming trend that can be misinterpreted as a larger scale surface temperature trend .
Similarly , a gradual reduction in bare soil coverage due to revegetation , would result in a cooling trend , which could similarly be misinterpreted as a larger scale cooling .

Two weeks ago the Alabama Senate passed a bill legalizing the homebrewing of beer and wine .
If the bill , which is now being considered by the Alabama House , goes into law , Alabama will become one of the last states in the US to legalize homebrewing .
Although homebrewing is legal under federal law there a few states which still ban the hobby .
Unfortunately , these are n’t the only restrictive beer laws on the books in many US states .
This includes not just what you can make at home , but what you can buy form the store , such as how strong beer can be .
Here ’s a quick rundown of some of these prohibitive beer laws .
Iowa – Beer > 5 % ABV must be shipped through state warehouse , making it difficult to find and all but illegal .
Utah – Beer >
4 % ABV can only be sold in state stores .
Only 4 % ABV or below beer available on tap .
Ban on the sales of kegs .
Pennsylvania – Beer is only available through state run distributors or restaurants .
Distributors mainly sell cases and kegs , making it difficult to try new and unusual beers .
Six packs and 12 packs of beer can be purchased from bars and restaurants to be taken home , but only 194 ounces ( or sixteen 12 oz bottles ) at a time .
Pennsylvania is also one of the few states in which you must be 21 to purchase non-alcoholic ( 0.5 % ABV ) beer .
Breweries most also register their beer with the state , last week a controversial raid took place in Philadelphia of three bars selling aged beers not registered because the brewery had gone out of business .
Alabama – Beer stronger than 13.9 % ABV is not permitted .
No bottles larger than 16 ounces .
Florida –
No bottles larger than 32 ounces .
Georgia – 14 % ABV cap on beer .
A recent development , up until five years ago the cap was 6 % ABV
Oklahoma – Beer stronger than 4 % ABV can on be sold at room temperature .
This refrigeration ban has lead to many craft breweries to skip the state .
Homebrewing is also still illegal .
Kansas – Until 1987 selling alcohol to be consumed on site , such as at a bar or restaurant was illegal .
Today many counties still require bars and restaurants restaurants make 30 % of their profits from food to sell alcohol .
Michigan – Beer made at micorbreweries or brewpubs cannot be served on site
New Hampshire – 14 % ABV cap on beer .
New York – Beer and liquor cannot be sold at the same store .
North Carolina – 15 % ABV cap on beer .
Ohio – 12 % ABV cap on beer .
South Carolina – 14 % ABV on beer .
West Virginia – 12 % ABV cap on beer .
Washington , D.C. –
No singles bottle sales permitted .
Although limits as high at 15 % ABV may seem permissive enough , it does ban many of the more experimental beers from Belgian brewers and adventuresome craft brewers .
Moreover , it confines brewers from exploring uncharted brewing territory .
If distilled liquors which are frequently 40 - 45 % ABV are permitted , why limit how strong beer can be ?

What do you think of the current beer laws ?

Advertisement Some of the heaviest snow for decades has hit parts of the eastern US , paralysing air and road transport , and bringing Washington DC to a standstill .
The storm knocked down power lines and left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity .
Nearly 2ft ( 60 cm ) of snow had fallen by noon on Saturday in cities across the region , the Associated Press reports .
The mayor of Washington DC , and the governors of Virginia and Maryland have declared states of emergency .
West Virginia , Delaware , Pennsylvania and New Jersey are also affected .
WASHINGTON SNOWSTORMS
More than 1ft ( 12in , 30.5 cm ) of snow has fallen only 13 times since 1870 Heaviest on record is 28in ( 71 cm ) in January 1922
Worst snowfall is believed to have hit in 1772 , before records began , with as much as 3ft
In pictures : Snow chaos The National Weather Service declared a 24 - hour blizzard warning for the Washington - Baltimore region until 2200 on Saturday ( 0300 GMT on Sunday ) .
Most flights from the Washington - Baltimore area's three main airports and Philadelphia International Airport have been cancelled .
Hundreds of car accidents were reported , including two fatalities - a father and son who died while helping another motorist in Virginia .
US national rail service Amtrak cancelled a number of trains between New York and Washington , and also between Washington and some southern destinations .
Local weather forecasters said the Washington area could see its heaviest snowfall in 90 years .
It comes less than two months after a December storm dumped more than 16in ( 41 cm ) of snow in Washington .
The usually traffic - heavy roads of the capital were deserted , while the city 's famous sites and monuments were covered with snow .
DC traditionally panics when it comes to snow - this time , it may be more justifiable than most times .
Becky Shipp
Resident of Arlington , Virginia The Washington Metro was operating only on underground lines , and bus services were cancelled .
US government offices in the Washington area closed four hours early on Friday , while the Smithsonian museums and National Zoo were closed on Saturday .
Debi Adkins , who lives just outside the city of Baltimore , told the BBC : " The snow started at 1130 yesterday morning and it just has n't stopped ... about 20 inches came overnight - and thunder and lightning .
" I 'm not going anywhere - I could n't if I wanted to .
You just can't get your cars out .
The front door of the building I live in is closed shut , so I just can't get out . "
Ushaa Shyam Krishna in Chantilly , Virginia , said he - like many others - had stocked up on essential food items ahead of the storm .
" For the first few hours after the storm began , my daughter and I tried to shovel the snow , but now we have given up , " he said .
" On Thursday the supermarkets were half empty - we went again yesterday and the shelves were totally empty . "

March 3 , 2010 -- Olivier Bonford and Eric Toussaint are members of the International Council of the World Social Forum ( WSF ) and of the the Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt ( CADTM ) .
In this interview with Marga Tojo Gonzales , they discuss the future and role of the World Social Forum as it enters its second decade .
They also examine the relationship between the WSF and the call for a Fifth Socialist International by Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez .
Translated by Vicki Briault and Christine Pagnoulle .
* * *
Marga Tojo Gonzales :
Ten year after the first use of the slogan , " Another world is possible " , a majority of humankind still lives in subhuman conditions , and with the international financial crisis , the situation has become even worse .
Does this mean that the alternative globalisation movement has failed ?
Olivier Bonford :
When the question is asked in these terms , we have to acknowledge that the WSF and the alternative globalisation movement in general have failed to genuinely change the course of the world .
At the origin of these World Social Forums , we find the objective of changing society into something better , with more social justice , less inequalities , where the fundamental human needs of all citizens are met .
But in fact , the question should be asked differently .
We have to establish whether the WSF and the alternative globalisation movement played a positive part in the construction of a power relationship more favourable to the exploited and oppressed .
The answer is then rather positive .
But there is nothing miraculous about the WSF .
It is still a dynamic process , with its weaknesses and contradictions .
It is also quite " young " .
The WSF is only 10 years old , and the alternative globalisation movement is hardly older , which is very short compared to the forces they fight against -- namely those of an international capitalist oligarchy and transnational companies served by such powerful instruments as the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) .
After 10 years , what do you see as the main asset of the movement ?
Eric Toussaint : The WSF has played a major part at two levels .
First , in delegitimising neoliberalism as the one and only possible model for humankind .
Obviously , the battle of ideas is not over and the logic of fatalism is still at work in many minds , but the alternative globalisation movement has been able to demonstrate the necessity and possibility of a global alternative .
It has exposed the vanity of fashionable claims such as the " end of history " ( Francis Fukuyama ) or Margaret Thatcher 's famous " TINA " ( " There is no alternative " ) .
The WSF 's other important asset is that it has allowed , on the one hand , the construction and strengthening of international networks and , on the other hand , interconnection between these various networks .
In the context of our struggle against global capitalism , this is essential .
Indeed , faced with strategies and power relations that lead to isolation and / or competition among countries and peoples , it is essential to go beyond the national context and propose global alternatives that weave threads of solidarity , but also -- and perhaps more importantly still -- coordinate international mobilisation and strategies for action .
In the first years of the WSF , there was obviously an interesting dynamic at work among the various forums , between them and the social movements , as well as ongoing international campaigns on issues such as the debt , the WTO , militarism , the environment , women 's rights , etc. , and the organisation of large - scale mobilisations on the occasion of World Bank , IMF , WTO , Group of Eight ( G8 ) and NATO meetings , or the overwhelming global mobilisation against the planned invasion of Iraq in February 2003 .
It is thus no longer quite the case today ?
Are you among those who consider that the World Social Forum is running out of steam ?
Bonford :
The WSF has clearly lost some of its vitality and usefulness , and part of its legitimacy ( especially with the WSF in Nairobi in January 2007 ) . [ 1 ]
There are various reasons for this : the WSF 's institutionalisation , the stronger influence of some large NGOs with significant financial resources , the propensity of some delegates for four - or five - star hotels , the inability to really merge events ( more than 1500 events in five days at the last WSF in Belém ) , the collection of funds from mixed or private companies ( Petrobras , the large Brazilian oil company with 61 per cent private capital , the Ford Foundation , the CELTEL transnational company in Africa ... ) .
Political developments over these last years have also had a deep influence .
We have to remember that since 2003 , the two countries where the WSF was most deeply rooted at the beginning , namely Brazil and Italy , have each been subjected to a government experience that has had a deep influence on the WSF : Lula 's presidency in Brazil and the Prodi government in Italy . [ 2 ]
Significant forces that had initiated the WSF supported , and in some cases still support , those governments , which have implemented social - liberal or downright neoliberal policies .
We also have to recognise that the WSF and the alternative globalisation movement have failed to achieve global " victories " .
Fortunately , on the Latin American continent , the struggle against the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA , directed from Washington , DC ) , which triumphed in 2005 , is partly to its credit .
But on the global stage , while capitalism is facing a major crisis , we can't even get a tax adopted on financial transactions to curb speculation .
Imperialist war adventures are more belligerent than ever .
Putschists are still in power in Honduras .
The Copenhagen climate summit was a patent failure for the superpowers .
The very fact that on an international level the movement has been unable to achieve any victory has resulted in many who were expecting prompt and tangible results feeling discouraged .
In this respect , we can say that the WSF is running out of steam , in the sense that it needs air or fuel to get into higher gear .
Toussaint :
It has to be added that a majority of the WSF leadership refused to move towards a movement determined to call for mobilisation on a common platform .
And without the concerted determination to mobilise on an international level , without the determination to establish common goals , it is difficult to move on .
Inevitably , the WSF looks more and more like some huge market for ideas ( and proposals ) that has not resulted in a convergence of objectives to struggle for .
We do need an international instrument to set up priorities in terms of demands and objectives , a common schedule of actions , a common strategy .
If the WSF cannot fulfill this function , we will have to build another instrument , without turning away from the WSF .
I think it serves a purpose .
But since part of the WSF does not want it turned into an instrument of mobilisation , we had better build another instrument with the individuals and organisations that are convinced this is what we need .
This will not prevent us from still being active in the WSF .
I am saying this to avoid a scission and endless debate that would lead to a sterile standstill .
What new instrument are you referring to ?
Toussaint : A proposal was made which , in point of fact , has had relatively [ few ] repercussions .
I 'm talking about Hugo Chávez 's call at the end of November 2009 for the creation of a Fifth Socialist International composed of social movements and left - wing parties . [ 3 ]
I think it 's very interesting in principle .
There could be a new perspective if there were reflection and dialogue between parties and social movements : a Fifth International as an instrument of convergence for action and for the creation of an alternative model . [ 4 ]
But in my opinion , it would not be an organisation like the previous [ socialist ]
Internationals were -- or still are , since the Fourth International still exists -- that is to say , party organisations with a fairly high level of centralisation .
In my view , the Fifth International should not be highly centralised , and it should not require the self - dissolution of international networks or organisations like the Fourth International .
They could join the Fifth International and still keep their own specifics , but their membership would demonstrate that all the networks or major movements are determined to go further than the present ad - hoc coalitions on climate or social justice , food sovereignty , the debt , etc .
We have common causes among many networks , and that 's a positive thing .
But if we could successfully form a permanent front , it would be better still .
The term " front " is a key word in defining the Fifth International .
For me , the Fifth International would be , in the present situation , a permanent front of parties , social movements and international networks .
The term " front " clearly implies that each would keep its identity , but would give priority to what unites us in order to achieve objectives and take the struggle forward .
Recent months have once again shown the need to increase our capacity to mobilise , because international mobilisation against the coup d'état in Honduras was totally inadequate .
This is a matter of serious concern , because with the United States supporting the coup by validating the elections that followed [ 5 ] , putschist forces the world over are once again thinking that a putsch is a reasonable option .
In Paraguay , for example , discussion among the putschists is all about " when " and " how " .
They are convinced that a coup d'état should be staged from the National Congress against President Fernando Lugo .
This goes to show that mobilisation in the case of Honduras was not enough .
Nor was it enough in the case of Copenhagen , and now Haiti .
Response to the US intervention in Haiti is totally insufficient .
What do you think of the recent development in the WSF , and more particularly , what is your analysis of the forums held in Porto Alegre and Salvador de Bahia in Brazil at the beginning of this year ?
Bonford :
The more positive side of what has happened at Porto Alegre in January 2010 was undoubtedly the launching of an international campaign against military bases on the Latin American continent .
This campaign -- Latin America and the Caribbean : a region of peace , no to foreign military bases -- supported by major organisations [ 6 ] , shows that the WSF as open space can still lead to mobilising campaigns .
Another positive point : lots of organisations were brought together in actions that prepare for a mobilisation around the Peoples ' World Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth , to be held at Cochabamba from April 19 - 22 , 2010 .
Unfortunately , the negative elements were n't wanting , either in Porto Alegre or in Salvador de Bahia .
We have to underline the weak attendance of social movements ( notably Indigenous organisations that had had such a positive influence on the Belèm WSF in January 2009 ) , and consequently , the debates were largely dominated by large NGOs , which do not wish to question the underlying logic of the capitalist system .
Next , even though this is nothing new , these two forums were financed by transnational companies , such as Petrobras .
Petrobras is a mixed oil and gas company active in Bolivia , Ecuador and Brazil , where it causes major environmental damage .
If we recall that Article 4 of the Porto Alegre Charter of Principles , the alternatives proposed at the WSF , stand in opposition to a process of globalisation commanded by the large multinational corporations , and by the governments and international institutions at the service of those corporations interests , we immediately understand that there is a problem .
All the more so , as these forums are marked by the imposing presence of the Brazilian governments .
In all events I attended , there was one representative of the Brazilian government , which , as can be expected , stressed the positive results of the Lula government .
There is thus a real danger of the WSF turning into an instrument of legitimisation for a government with social - liberal policies .
With respect to the issue of the nature of the Brazilian government , some media described a keen debate between you , Eric Toussaint , and Socorro Gomez , the representative of Cebrapaz [ Brazilian Centre of Solidarity to the Peoples and Struggle for Peace ] and a member of PcdoB [ the Communist Party of Brazil ] .
During a debate on the new world order , you said that Brazil was a peripheral imperialist power .
A member of the audience , who was also a member of PcdoB , charged you with playing into the hands of US imperialism .
What can you say about this ?
Toussaint : Brazil has a specific position .
With a national economy that amounts to half of South America 's gross domestic product , it can indeed be considered a peripheral imperialist power that is able to decide on a political course without asking for Washington 's consent .
We can apply the term imperialism to a country like Brazil for a number of reasons .
The foreign investments of its transnational companies ( Petrobras , Vale Rio Doce , Odebrecht ) [ 7 ] mean that it has significant economic weight and can influence the political decisions of foreign governments ( this is the case in Paraguay , Bolivia and Ecuador , despite the fact that these countries ' respective governments are trying to retrieve some sovereignty over their economies , which leads to tensions with Brasilia ) .
These companies exploit resources and workers in the countries where they invest as much as they can .
The Brazilian government 's foreign policy largely serves the interests of Brazilian transnational corporations .
Brazil is gradually acquiring a military force capable of permanently intervening abroad ( Brazil is in charge of the Minustah in Haiti ) . [ 8 ]
But we have to add the attribute " peripheral " to the noun " imperialism " to the extent that Brazil 's is not a dominant imperialism comparable to that of the US , of the major countries in the European Union ( or indeed to the European Union as such ) , or of Japan .
Brazil belongs to the same category as Russia , India and China , with whom they make up the " BRIC " , an acronym that was invented some 15 years ago to refer to the main peripheral powers capable of developing a political and economic influence that dominant economic powers cannot ignore .
We must further specify that Brazil comes last in this foursome through its economic size and through the fact that it has no access to nuclear weapons .
In this respect , it can be compared to South Africa .
Brazil and the US have divergent interests in several respects : the economic interests of the Brazilian bourgeoisie in the areas of farming and manufacturing cannot be content with US protectionism ; the reactivation of the US Fourth Fleet [ 9 ] and the US military bases in Colombia and Peru are resented by Brazil , as a sign of Washington 's renewed determination to control South America , and more particularly the strategic zone of Amazonia .
The recent deployment of more than 15,000 US soldiers in Haiti , where Brazil runs the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti ( MINUSAH ) , has also annoyed the Brazilian government .
On the other hand , Washington , too , is annoyed by Lula 's continued good relations with Cuba and Venezuela , its two main bugbears in the Western hemisphere .
The definition of Brazil as a peripheral imperialist power is not dependent on which political party -- whether right wing or left wing -- is in power .
The word imperialism may seem excessive because it is associated with an aggressive military policy .
But this is a narrow perception of imperialism .
Did the loss of military power in Germany and Japan ( and the loss of its colonies in the former 's case ) erase their imperialist nature after the Second World War ?
The main forerunner in using the term sub-imperialism about Brazil is the Brazilian economist Ruy Mauro Marini , one of the fathers of the school of dependence . [ 10 ]
He wrote , " We can consider Brazil to be the best current manifestation of sub-imperialism . "
To answer those who contest such a term , he formulated arguments that have become even more relevant :
Does n't the Brazilian expansionist policy in Latin America and Africa correspond , beyond the quest for new markets , to an attempt to gain control over sources of raw materials -- such as ores and gas in Bolivia , oil in Ecuador and in the former Portuguese colonies of Africa , the hydroelectric potential in Paraguay -- and , more cogently still , to prevent potential competitors such as Argentina from having access to such resources ?...
Does n't the export of Brazilian capital , mainly via the state as exemplified by Petrobras , stand out as a particular case of capital export in the context of what a dependent country like Brazil is able to do ?
Brazil also exports capital through the constant increase of foreign public loans and through capital associated to finance groups which operate in Paraguay , Bolivia and the former Portuguese colonies in Africa , to mention just a few instances .
He added an argument that has become stronger since he formulated it : " [ I ]t would be good to keep in mind the accelerated process of monopolisation ( via concentration and centralisation of capital ) that has occurred in Brazil over these past years , as well as the extraordinary development of financial capital , mainly from 1968 onward . "
As a conclusion , he asserted that for the revolutionary left , it is essential to be aware of what sub- imperialism means :
" To conclude this foreword we should repeat how important the study of sub- imperialism is for the development of the Latin American revolutionary movement . "
During the debate at Porto Alegre on the new world order , I explained that , of course , the United States is the dominant imperial power and the most aggressive .
Brazil is certainly not in the same league .
I also severely criticised the European Union for its imperialism .
Nevertheless , Brazil is definitely an imperialist power with the characteristics of a peripheral power .
I prefer the term " peripheral imperialism " to " sub- imperialism " because , since Ruy Mauro Marini first noted the phenomenon 30 years ago , Brazil has gained in autonomy with regard to the United States .
In fact , during the conference I was criticised by members of the PCdoB , whose party supports Lula .
Indeed while staying in Brazil , we have clearly felt an intolerant attitude on the part of Lula 's partisans .
They are not prepared to hear the government criticised .
Let me add that of the other panelists taking part in the debate on the new world order , Patrick Bond of South Africa , gave me clear support in my characterisation of Brazil as practicing peripheral imperialism .
He explained that South Africa was in the same situation as Brazil , and that the BRIC countries were not a viable alternative .
The WSF is financed by transnational corporations that want to be seen as " greener " or more humane , and it is courted by political groups that want to use it as a campaign tool .
Some think it has been completely co-opted by the system and is therefore unlikely to do much good now .
How do you feel about that ?
Bonford :
It is perfectly possible that the WSF could be gradually " absorbed " by the capitalist system .
That would hardly be surprising .
The capitalist system has long since proved capable of adapting and appropriating the ideas behind attempts to resist it .
Like the NGOs , social movements and individuals who make it up , the WSF is constantly under threat of being co-opted .
However , as a radical network , we at CADTM believe that the WSF still has a role to play as a place for discussing alternative ways of ensuring authentic human development , based on social justice and respect for nature .
The WSF must also strengthen convergence between all the movements that want to join in collective action .
The movements will find their common ground during the WSF 's activities .
Indeed , CADTM will continue to take an active part in the worldwide Assembly of Social Movements that emerged from Porto Alegre in January 2001 at the first WSF .
Could you remind us what exactly the Assembly of Social Movements is ?
In fact , just before the WSF in Porto Alegre , you took part in an international seminar in Sao Paulo on the social movements .
What was the outcome ?
Bonford : The Assembly of Social Movements ( ASM ) developed within the framework of the World Social Forum .
Its main interest was as an open space for working out a common agenda of mobilisations .
It is composed of miscellaneous social movements and networks such as Via Campesina , the World Women 's March , CADTM , Jubilee South , No Vox , trade union organisations , the Social Continental Alliance of the Americas , COMPA , ATTAC , etc. , which all have specific regional or national objectives , but want to get together to fight capitalism in its neoliberal , imperialist and military phase , against racism and patriarchy .
From January 21 - 23 , 2010 , in São Paulo , different social movements that have been participating in the ASM , some for a long time , some for less , held a seminar to examine the new international conjuncture , and also , more importantly , to see how the various forces present could be organised and better coordinated so as to strengthen struggles around the world .
Debates about the conjuncture emphasised the gravity and the multidimensional nature of the systemic crisis we are faced with at the moment mainly because of the militarisation and the criminalisation of social movements .
When it comes to a strategy for action , the most important decision was undoubtedly to work towards organising the next seminar of the Assembly for Social Movements in Africa , a few months before the 2011 WSF , which is to be held in Dakar in January 2011 .
There are two reasons for this .
The first is to reinforce communication on the African continent , while keeping a worldwide perspective , since it will be an international meeting with the presence of African , Asian , American and European social movements .
The second is to dynamise mobilisation for the next World Social Forum and make sure that it will have a positive , concrete impact for the social movements and African struggles .

7. According to a 2007 Columbia Law School survey , the five main Brazilian transnational corporations in terms of assets abroad in 2006 are : Companhia Vale do Rio Doce , Petrobras SA , Gerdau SA , EMBRAER and Votorantim Participacoes SA .
The survey brings out the fact that in 2006 thanks to its transnational corporations , Brazil is the second - largest investor among developing countries in terms of direct foreign investment flows .
Moreover , the 20 main Brazilian transnational corporations own assets abroad with a value of US $ 56 billion , which amounts to more than half the country 's IDE stock abroad .
Those top 20 businesses produce and sell goods and services worth about $ 30 billion and have some 77,000 employees .
About half of them focus on their own region , Latin America .
8. Since 2004 , MINUSTAH ( UN Mission for the Stabilisation of Haiti ) under Brazilian military command has occupied Haiti .
Most of Haiti's left - wing social movements demand the withdrawal of this military force which before the earthquake consisted of just over 7000 soldiers , 1282 of whom are Brazilian .

Clues left in the clumsily encrypted notes of a Mafia don have helped Italian investigators to track his associates and ultimately contributed to his capture after years on the run .
The recently busted Bernardo Provenzano , reputed to be the " boss of bosses " of the Sicilian Mafia , used a modified form of the Caesar cipher to obscure " sensitive information " in notes left to either his family or underlings .
According to a biography ( written by Italian journalists Salvo Palazzolo and Ernesto Oliva ) on bernardoprovenzano.net , the content of these notes varied from meal requests to his family to orders to his lieutenants where numbers were used to disguise people 's names .
Provenzano , 73 , was arrested last week in a farm close to his home town of Corleone on the Italian island of Sicily after almost 40 years on the run .
He 's accused of numerous homicides including the 1992 murder of two judges , a crime that earned him a life sentence in absentia .
Provenzano who earned the nickname Binnu u tratturi ( Binnu the tractor ) because of his rep for mowing down enemies , latterly took to writing instructions incorporating basic encryption on small scraps of paper , known locally as pizzini .
The classic Caesar cipher moves every letter in the alphabet three charecters later ( so A becomes D and B becomes E , etc . ) .
The so - called Binnu code assigns a number in order to each letter in the Italian alphabet and adds three to that number in the ciphertext so that " A " is 4 , " B " is 5 and so on .
The code would have been more secure if the numerical shift applied to the ciphertext was varied from time to time .
As it was , the contents of messages was readily deciphered .
" Looks like kindergarten cryptography to me .
It will keep your kid sister out , but it wo n't keep the police out .
But what do you expect from someone who is computer illiterate ? " security guru Bruce Schneier told Discovery News .
Provenzano left school aged only eight , a factor which might explain the simplistic nature of the way sensitive messages , normally typed out on old typewriters , were encoded .
The decipherment of the pizzini sent and received by Provenzano allowed police to identify his associates and ultimately contributed to investigative efforts that led to Provenzano 's arrest , Discovery News reports . ®
