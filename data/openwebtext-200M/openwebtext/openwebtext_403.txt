Buying a Used Handgun By Chuck Hawks
This article is concerned with the purchase of used handguns by the recreational shooter .
Handguns that will be used for their intended purpose , which is shooting , not with collectors ' guns or wall hangers .
The common reasons to purchase a used handgun are to save money or acquire a model no longer in production .
For example , I own several used Colt Diamondback revolvers in .22 LR and .38 Special , all of which I purchased after the Diamondback was discontinued .
Guns hold their value very well , so if you later decide to trade or sell a used gun you should be able to get pretty much what you paid for it , assuming you paid a fair price .
This is very important to those of us who have bought and sold a fair number of firearms for our personal use .
Before you buy , check the price and condition of any used firearm in Fjestad 's Blue Book of Gun Values , which is the accepted reference for pricing .
Buy from someone that you trust
If you are not an experienced used gun buyer , perhaps the most important thing is to buy from someone you trust .
A reputable gun shop is not looking to rip you off , they are looking for repeat customers and they should have already inspected the gun for condition and safety before putting it on the rack .
They should be willing and able to give you an honest appraisal of the gun .
Most will allow you to return a used gun for a refund or exchange within a reasonable period of time ( like a week , not a month ! ) if it does n't meet normal standards of accuracy and function .
Obviously , a handgun being returned must come back in the same condition it left the store .
Always test any pistol for function and accuracy with factory loads .
If there is a problem , you want to be sure that reloaded ammunition cannot be blamed .
I recently purchased a used Weatherby rifle from a local gun shop where I have done business for years .
The owner was familiar with the history of this particular rifle , and assured me that he had seen the previous owner shoot consistent 3 - shot groups of less than one inch at 100 yards .
It checked out functionally perfect .
We looked - up the rifle in the current issue of Fjestad 's Blue Book of Gun Values and agreed on a price we could both live with .
Had there been a problem of some sort ( there was n't , the gun was exactly as advertised ) , I could have returned it without any hassle .
This is the way a used gun sale is supposed to work and it is entirely dependent on dealing with honest people .
Buying through the mail or Internet My advice to the novice used gun buyer is to avoid doing so .
Do n't buy any firearm you cannot inspect first .
Not that there is a problem with most mail order sales , but should there be a problem you are entirely dependent of the good offices of a stranger .
It is always better to deal face to face with the seller .
How to check the condition of a used handgun -- general points
Before handling any firearm , always open the action and verify that both the chamber and the magazine are empty .
Remove the magazine if possible .
Every time a firearm changes hands it should be cleared .
1 . Look at the overall condition of the gun .
Notice the condition of the bluing and the overall wear .
Look for rust pitting on external metal surfaces .
Are the grips in good condition ?
All screws should be tight and the screw heads un -marred .
The gun does n't have to be perfect in every area , but it should show care rather than neglect .
A pistol could be rough on the outside , yet perfect on the inside , but the chances are that an owner who did n't care for the external parts of a gun also did n't care for the parts you can't see .
2 . The size , shape and angle of the grip should fit your hand .
When you bring the gun to eye level your master eye should be looking straight down on the barrel .
The gun should not be tipped up or down .
Having a gun that points naturally is especially important for a pistol that might be used for protection .
3 . Look carefully down the external length of the barrel to see that it looks straight and there are no subtle bulges .
Do n't buy any handgun if you suspect that the barrel ( or the cylinder of a revolver ) has been bulged , no matter how slightly , or if it is not straight .
Also look at the crown of the muzzle - - it should not be dinged .
4 . Note the position of the rear sight on guns with adjustable sights .
If it is way off to one side , suspect some sort of problem and ask to shoot the gun to verify accuracy before purchase .
If the seller refuses , pass on the gun .
5 . Check the condition of the grips .
There should not be any splits , chips , or cracks in the grips , particularly if you are looking at a discontinued model ( for which it may be hard to find replacement grips ) .
Scratches in the grip finish , worn checkering , and tiny nicks in the grips will not affect the gun 's function , but should lower the price .
As the screws holding wood grips to the grip frame are tightened they will tend to pull deeper and deeper into the wood .
Check to see that they are not about to pull clear through .
This is particularly common with Ruger single action ( SA ) revolvers , but applies to most guns with wooden grip panels .
6 . Get permission to dry fire the gun and check the trigger pull .
Dry firing will not hurt most centerfire handguns , but it is still a good idea to use snap caps to protect the firing pin .
Whatever the trigger pull weight , it should be consistent from shot to shot .
If it feels like a stock factory trigger ( too heavy with some creep ) , fine , you can get it adjusted later .
If it feels crisp and breaks at 2.5 - 3 pounds it has probably been worked on or adjusted .
This is great if done properly , as it will save you some money , but make sure that the piece will not jar off .
To test this , get permission to bump the butt of the cocked handgun against some firm but padded surface .
The gun should not fire .
Push against the fully cocked hammer ( if the pistol has one ) with your thumb -- it should not slip out of its notch ; reject the gun if it does .
7 . Check the inside of the barrel ( and the chambers of a revolver 's cylinder ) .
If the barrel is dirty , ask that it be cleaned or for permission to clean it yourself .
Do not oil the barrel after cleaning , and be suspicious of any barrel that has been oiled .
The shine from the oil can hide minor barrel imperfections and pitting .
Once the barrel is reasonably clean , dry , and oil free , open the action or remove the barrel and look into it from both ends .
Use a bore light .
Hopefully it will be clean and bright with sharp rifling .
A slight amount of rust or pitting inside the barrel ( or the cylinder of a revolver ) will ordinarily not seriously degrade the performance of a handgun , unless it is a target pistol , but it should lower the used price .
Specific things to check on used revolvers 1 .
Note the condition of the forcing cone at the back of the barrel .
Slight erosion in this area , particularly on magnum revolvers , is not cause for concern , but it should not be seriously eroded .
The more erosion you see the more the gun has been fired with heavy loads .
2 . Check for cutting of the top strap at the cylinder gap , particularly with magnum revolvers .
A little erosion here will not hurt , but excessive cutting is undesirable and indicates a lot of shooting with heavy loads , or a wide cylinder gap , or both .
3 . To test the safety notch of a traditional single action revolver , pull firmly ( about 8 - 10 pounds -- this is not intended to be a test to destruction ) on the trigger with the hammer in the safety notch to see if it can be easily forced .
Put the revolver on half cock ( the loading position ) and repeat the test , applying about 5 pounds of pressure on the trigger .
The hammer should not drop .
This test does not apply to New Model ( two screw ) Ruger SA revolvers , as they use a different lockwork than traditional SA revolvers .
4 . The cylinder of Colt double action revolvers should be completely tight when the trigger is pulled all the way back ( the hand forces the cylinder against the bolt ) .
S&W revolvers are never as tight as a Colt , but at least they should not rattle .
Slight cylinder play is permissible with S&W DA ( and also Ruger SA ) revolvers .
5 . Check the cylinder gap .
It should not exceed .010 " , and .006 " is ideal .
Cock the gun to turn the cylinder so that every chamber , in turn , lines up with the barrel .
The cylinder gap should remain constant .
Also , the cylinder should not slide back and forth appreciably on the cylinder pin .
This is called endplay , and it generally increases with use .
6 . The crane of a swing out cylinder DA revolver should fit tight to the frame ( when closed ) without any unsightly gaps .
If it does n't the crane may be sprung .
When you wiggle the cylinder with your fingers the crane should barely move , if at all .
While you are at it , check to make sure that the ejector rod has not been bent .
This is easy to see if you spin the cylinder , which should spin true .
7 . Use you fingers or thumb to put a small amount of drag on the cylinder while you manually cock the revolver ( single action mode ) .
The cylinder bolt should click into the locking notches in the cylinder , locking the cylinder in place , at the end of each segment of cylinder rotation .
If it does not , the gun is out of time and needs work .
Then rapidly thumb cock the gun ( do n't " fan " a revolver ) -- the cylinder should not rotate past the proper locking notch .
Also , the bolt should not be dragging on the cylinder as it turns .
If it does it will leave a clearly visible wear line in the cylinder 's finish .
8 . Examine the sideplate of a DA revolver .
If it has been improperly disassembled it may show pry marks at the edge or have been warped .
The sideplate should fit flush and tight , without any gaps .
9 . Check the tip of the firing pin , it should be smooth and rounded , not sharp or broken .
The firing pin hole should not be chipped or burred .
Specific things to check on used semi-automatic pistols 1 .
See that all of the controls work smoothly and with a reasonable amount of pressure .
The safety should prevent the gun from firing ( check by setting the safety and pulling the trigger normally ) .
The slide lock should hold the slide open .
The magazine release should release the magazine easily and yet hold it securely in place until it is pushed .
If there is a grip safety the gun should not fire unless the grip safety fully depressed .
If there is a magazine safety the gun should not fire unless the magazine is in place .
Also , pulling the trigger should not fire the gun when the slide is held slightly out of battery .
2 . Cycle an autoloader to verify that it operates smoothly and properly .
See that the slide is tight and reasonably free of slop when closed and the pistol is cocked .
( There is ordinarily some play or the gun will not function . )
Verify that the pistol fieldstrips and reassembles correctly .
Also see that the action has been kept reasonably clean for proper functioning .
3 . Examine the slide ( especially at the front and at the ejection port ) and frame for excessive wear or cracks .
Aluminum alloy frames are particularly susceptible to developing hairline cracks ( and eventually failing ) from extended use .
4 . The cocked hammer or striker of a SA auto pistol should not drop when the slide is closed smartly .
If you can make the hammer drop by letting the slide slam closed the gun is unsafe .
5 . Check the magazine (s ) for wear and condition .
A proper magazine is very important to the functioning of an autoloading pistol .
You want the original , name brand , magazine (s ) in good condition .
Inspect the feed lips for bends , cracks and wear , and insure that the seam at the back of the magazine is tight .
Also check the bottom of the magazine to insure that it has not been ejected from the pistol and allowed to fall to the ground .
This looks great on TV or at action matches , but in real life it is very hard on magazines .
Magazines are not expendable .
Conclusion Quality firearms are built to last for generations .
This makes used guns a much better investment over time than most consumer goods .
Buying a used handgun can be , and usually is , a rewarding experience .
I have bought the great majority of all of the guns I have ever owned used and I can't remember ever being burned .
What I do remember is a lot of fun owning and shooting guns I could not otherwise afford .
Sometimes I have even made a slight profit when it became necessary to sell a gun that I originally purchased used .
( Usually because I needed the money to purchase some other used gun I could not resist . )
Buy used , save money and have more fun shooting !
The second day at LinuxTag is over .
It showed how KDE is steadily taking over the world .
Today a group of CIOs did a guided tour through the exhibition halls , and of course the icing cake was the KDE booth .
There the main question was : how can KDE be interesting for such people , for companies .
And the answer was never easier than with KDE 4 : through portability .
The KDE 4 libs are amazing , and additionally the already existing apps on top of it are excellent programs .
The key point for such people is however Kontact ( which was also presented in a talk today which I unfortunately missed ) .
Kontact provides an easy to manager group ware client compatible with a lot of different servers out there – and now it is also available on all three big platforms .
This makes it possible for business people to have one central place for the configuration for all platforms while the client itself is fully integrated with the native platform look &feel .
And the most important thing is : this is not theory , it exists already .
In fact , the booth of the BSI , the German Federal Office for Information Security , shows Kontact running natively on Windows and on Mac OS X .
Here are three screenshots for comparison ( thanks to the BSI for the Mac OS X and Windows screenshots ) :
Kontact on Linux .
Kontact on Mac OS X .
Kontact on Windows XP .
The versions displayed are based on the current in development KDE 4.1 libraries .
But they are already working , and it is just a question of time until this becomes stable enough to use it in daily business life .
This ports would not have been possible without the help of the BSI – which does support and promote Kontact and help with the development of security plugins – and also Kolab who do an amazing job in the world of group ware .
So , at the moment there is only one serious group ware client out there which runs on all three major platforms .
And it does not only run there , it is natively integrated , users will immediately feel at home in them .
The importance of these two facts can not be underestimated , and in the mid term more and more companies will consider Kontact – and therefore KDE – as a possible solution for their often mixed setups .
And with Kontact other useful apps like Konqueror , Dolphin , Okular and others – which could again be configured at one single central point – are in reach as well .
Florida police made public two notes handwritten by Deborah Jeane Palfrey this weekend , touching off debate on whether her hanging was in fact suicide or staged to look so .
At least one reporter is claiming the DC Madam mentioned she 'd kill herself before returning to prison , but another interviewer has aired recent audio of Palfrey warning that if she was found dead , it would be murder .
Initial reports of Palfrey 's death conclusively ruled it a suicide , a bit hasty considering the magnitude of the sensitive secrets she held .
I first heard the news on an NPR broadcast Thursday afternoon which included an official 's soundbyte on how relatives are victimized in suicides , a strange generalization that pointed blame at Palfrey for hurting her own mother before any other details of the case were released .
This statement was attached to the breaking news by an " imbedded pundit " , only raising suspicion of media manipulation in the earliest going .
Any intelligent debate is impossible with this lack of detail available so far .
We 're told the letters were penned a few days before her body was discovered hanged in her mother 's shed , left on a nearby motel stand , though we do n't know when investigators first saw them .
Police say relatives confirmed her handwriting , but we know virtually nothing about their opinion on the letters , her physical condition or other clues .
We are not told whether the shed or hotel room was forensically examined .
Her autopsy was conducted quietly and quickly , though a final report is due this week after toxicology results come in .
Palfrey 's note used a number of clichéd expressions , strangely including " modern day lynching " , referring to the extremely selective enforcement that found her guilty in federal court and a darkly ironic reference to her impending manner of death .
In the note to her sister , she writes " With complete certainty , I believe Dad is standing watch - prepared to guide me into the light " .
Only a close relation would know if this echoed her true feelings and beliefs , or if the statement was coded to signal a forced hand .
Among Palfrey 's known clients were current Louisiana Senator Vitter , former AIDS Czar Randall Tobias , Dick Morris and military - industrial wonk Harlan Ullman , but Dick Cheney 's McLean , VA phone number , reported earlier was summarily un-reported after a turnaround by ABC News .
ABC anchor Sam Donaldson has also been a rumored client , along with a law partner of Rudy Giuliani , associates of Jack Abramoff and many more Pentagon , DC and corporate insiders on a list of over 10,000 numbers .
Then , going into to a weekend news cycle we heard about the hanging , presented as a suicide from the first mention with no investigation .
The public was left bereft of details - was it a full autopsy and inquest ?
Witness statements ?
Did the Madam check out without leaving behind anything critical of those who hounded her ?
No mentions left behind about the DOJ Attorney fired after investigating her case ?
So we 've seen the handwritten notes , but many questions remain .
Can Brian Ross ( now elevated in the ABC ranks ) answer the most basic inquiries about the DC Madam story that never was ?
We will , if Brian Ross ' can say the words " journalistic integrity " while looking in a mirror .
Mr. Ross may wonder himself if Palfrey 's death was self - inflicted or a torturous murder , but as long as he withholds the secrets of the ABC / DC johns , I 'd wager he 's safe from harm .
Hint to Mr. Ross :
If you need to get a message to your old journalism professors , just say " They made me sign a non-disclosure agreement " .
Tarpon Springs authorities could also be instrumental in divulging to the public whether government officials commandeered or influenced their work in any way .
GOP priest attacks Obama in invocation
Here 's the video of the invocation at the New York State Republican Party dinner last night , delivered to a crowd including Rudy Giuliani and Rep. Peter King , and where Dick Cheney later spoke .
In it , the priest , Monsignor Jim Lisante mockingly asks God to change Obama 's mind and volunteers to replace Rev. Jeremiah Wright as Obama 's pastor .
" One more thing , Lord .
Please tell Sen .
Obama that maybe change is a good thing and maybe he should think about changing his favorite preacher , " he said , to applause .
" I know a lot more of us would be comfortable with his judgment skills if he had n’t sat for 20 years through those words offered by his preacher of division , bigotry , and — honestly — half - truths without a word of objection from the senator until the media brought it up , and now he does n’t want any part of the guy , " he said .
" I ’m willing to be his new preacher . "
This is n't Lisante 's first partisan invocation .
He got attention for a prayerful attack on Eliot Spitzer a couple of years ago , which he jokes in the video above was " prophetic . "

One of the biggest search challenges has long been that the major search
engines like Google cannot crawl material that can only be retrieved through the
use of forms .
Now Google is filling out those form to obtain the information
previously hidden , the company has announced .
Google says that for the past few months , it has been filling in forms on a
" small number " of " high - quality " web sites to get back information .
What words has it been entering into those forms ?
Words automatically selected that occur
on the site , with check boxes and drop - down menus also being selected :
In the past few months we have been exploring some HTML forms to try to
discover new web pages and URLs that we otherwise could n’t find and index for
users who search on Google .
Specifically , when we encounter a < FORM > element
on a high - quality site , we might choose to do a small number of queries using
the form .
For text boxes , our computers automatically choose words from the
site that has the form ; for select menus , check boxes , and radio buttons on
the form , we choose from among the values of the HTML .
Results returned are then crawled .
Ironically , it was just over a year ago
that Google warned
against getting search results like these indexed .
Now it ’s actually
generating and crawling those results itself .
Do n’t want Google doing this to your site ?
Google says that if your form is
blocked through robots .
txt or meta robots instructions , those forms wo n’t
be accessed .
In addition , some other forms wo n’t be touched if they fit certain
technical criteria :
We only retrieve GET forms and avoid forms that require any kind of user
information .
For example , we omit any forms that have a password input or that
use terms commonly associated with personal information such as logins ,
userids , contacts , etc .
The move is potentially good for searchers , in that it will open up material
often referred to being part of the " deep web " or " invisible
web " as it was hidden behind forms .
Search Engine Land executive editor
Chris Sherman actually
co-authored a book on the topic .
He and fellow author Gary Price did n’t coin
the term invisible web , but they certainly help popularize it .
It should be noted that Google ’s not the first to do something like this .
Companies like Quigo ,
BrightPlanet , and
WhizBang Labs were doing this
type of work years ago .
But it never translated over to the major search
engines .
Now chapter two of surfacing deep web material is opening , this time
with a major search player — in that , Google is being a pioneer .
In 2005 Ted Patrick posted a great article on the frame execution model inside the Flash Player that he dubbed the ‘ elastic racetrack ‘ .
It ’s served as a great reference for me over the years to help understand how code execution and rendering were balanced within the processing of a frame .
Since the introduction of Flash Player 9 and the new AVM2 , I ’ve noticed a few changes to the elastic racetrack model and thought I ’d share them .
This information is based on research into Flash player internals as well as observations I ’ve made playing around with the event and rendering model , but the full model has n’t been confirmed by Adobe engineers .
The basic premise of the original elastic racetrack is still the same .
Given a specific frame rate to operate on , the Flash player will devote the first segment of the frame to execute code , and the second segment to render display objects .
Either segment can grow its part of the racetrack to accommodate more processing and effectively extend the duration of the frame .
What changes from the previous model is how those segments look under a microscope and how they come together to form a ‘ frame ’ .
AVM2 is controlled by what I ’m going to call the Marshal .
The Marshal is responsible for carving out time slices for the Flash Player to operate on .
Its important to clarify up front that these time slices are not the same thing as the framerate compiled into a swf , but we ’ll see below how the player ultimately synthesizes a framerate from these slices .
Running a Flex compiled swf within Firefox under Mac OS X , the Marshal appears to be carving out 19 - 20 millisecond slices , but this can be different between platforms and browsers based on what I ’ve observed as well as Adobe employees have hinted at .
This can also change depending on how the swf was compiled , see some of the comments below .
For the sake of the article lets assume we ’re only talking about a 20 millisecond slice to make the math easy .
This means the Marshal will attempt to generate and execute no more then 50 slices each second , and it may be less depending on the elasticity of code execution or rendering .
Inside each slice , 5 possible steps are processed in the following order .
Player events are dispatched – This includes events dispatched by the Timer , Mouse , ENTER_FRAMEs , URLLoader , etc … User code is executed – Any code listening to events dispatched by step 1 are executed at this stage .
RENDER event is dispatched – This special event is dispatched when the user calls stage.invalidate ( ) during normal user code operation .
Final user code is executed – User code listening specifically for step 3 is executed at this point .
Player renders changes to the display list .
The Marshal executes this 20 millisecond slice over and over and decides on the fly which actions to run .
The exact actions processed within a slice will ultimately derive the 2 main racetrack segments ( code execution and rendering ) that constitute a ‘ frame ’ .
User actions and Invalidation actions fill up the code segment track , while Render actions fill up the render segment track .
Its important to note that actions will only occur at times predetermined by the Marshal , so a if you have a short running User action , the Marshal will still wait a few milliseconds before moving on to the Invalidate and Render actions .
The best way to illustrate which actions are run and how the elastic racetrack is created , is to look at how those slices are processed on a swf running at 5 fps , 25 , fps , and 50 fps .
As you can see , the elastic racetrack performs different actions per frame and requires a different visual illustration depending on the framerate that the player is trying to synthesize .
So for a swf running at 5 fps , each frame processed 10 User actions , 1 Invalidation action , and 1 Render action .
At 25 fps , each frame processed 2 User actions , 1 Invalidation action , and 1 Render action .
At 50 fps , each frame processed 1 User action , 1 Invalidation action , and 1 Render action .
Whats important to note in the above chart is that some events are only available in certain slices .
For instance , the Event .
ENTER_FRAME
event will only ever be dispatched in a slice that occurs at the start of a frame .
So what does this all mean ?
Theres a couple quick ideas to take away from this .
Long running code execution or render segments can extend a given slice beyond 20 milliseconds .
Elasticity will be applied to that particular slice and the duration of the frame may or may not be extended as a result .
The Marshal may drop the number of slices that constitute a frame in order to keep the active framerate close to the compiled framerate .
A swfs real framerate wo n’t exceed the Marshals rate defined for the player instance .
You can set your compiled framerate at 120 fps , but Flash will still only process 50 slices max that generate 50 render calls ( more or less depending on the system config ) .
Code can be executed more often then the compiled framerate .
A swf compiled at 1 fps can execute a Timer or Mouse event in every slice , even though it will only render in the last slice .
Additionally , if you choose , you can render to the screen sooner then the compiled framerate by calling updateAfterEvent ( ) , but only within a Mouse , Timer , or Keyboard event handler .
In this instance though , the Marshal will consider that the end of the frame and start a new frame on the next slice .
Lastly , Flash will force an automatic render when mousing over any Sprite that has had its visual properties ( x , y , width , height , etc . . ) changed , naturally this still occurs at the end of the slice and any prerender logic will still run .
Compiling a framerate that is n’t a multiple of the total number of slices per second for your platform will cause irregular rendering as it tries to divide up the slices .
If you were to compile in a framerate of 20 on a platform executing 50 slices per second , then the player has to render 2 frames every 5 slices and would follow a 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 slice - to - render rate .
These 4 facts are moving targets though , since for this article we ’re working on a 20 millisecond slice that ’s processed 50 times per second .
In reality you ’ll see time slices as low as 5 milliseconds or as high at 100 milliseconds and some of the math will change as a result .
If you ’d like to test this model for yourself , the easiest route is to create a swf running at 1 fps and another at 100 fps both with a Timer object set on a 1 millisecond interval .
Inside the Timer event handler change the x property of a display object and hook a bunch of getTimer ( ) traces up to different player events like Mouse , EnterFrame , and Render and watch the carnage unfold in your console .
The rest of the information you ca n’t derive from the results comes from alot of context about the player I ’ve learned over the past 2 years and so is n’t as easily visible .
If anyone has any information to help add to or correct the above model , please submit it in the comments .
Thanks to several readers who have clarified some of the differences between Flex and Flash as well as how the Flash API is able to change the default behaviors described above .

UPDATE| 1:30 PM
May 13
In response to some comments , Jeremy Stoppelman , Yelp ’s chief executive , wrote to clarify that Yelp has paid people to write some of the reviews in cities it is entering .
His e-mail on this and a few other matters , is in the comments here .
The post has been edited to reflect his comments .
When Yelp began in early 2005 , I yawned .
Who needs another site where people review restaurants and other local businesses ?
It ’s one of the oldest ideas on the Internet .
Citysearch , the leader , continues to struggle to find a sustainable business model more than a decade after its founding .
Start - ups like Insider Pages come and go .
Big companies , from search engines to yellow - pages publishers , have long added user reviews to their local listings .
But Yelp has thrived .
In March , it had 3.3 million users , according to Comscore , up 87 percent from a year ago .
Citysearch still towers above it with 16.2 million users .
What Yelp did differently than these others , as Jeremy Stoppelman , the site ’s co-founder and chief executive describes it , was to spend most of its energy attracting a small group of fanatic reviewers .
It did n’t try to pay for reviews , as some sites have .
It did n’t subordinate the users ’ contributions to professional reviews , as on Citysearch , or to directory information , as on yellow - pages sites .
Instead , it structured the site to motivate people through the praise and attention that their reviews receive from others .
“ Yelp is about the reviewing experience , ” Mr. Stoppelman said .
“ It is like a blog with a little bit of structure . ”
Most people are n’t drawn to write a witty review of the scrambled eggs at the local diner simply to get their ego stroked .
But enough people find it rewarding to turn
Yelp into one of the richest repositories of local reviews on the Web .
Now a much broader audience is discovering how useful the site can be , and some visitors are adding their own contributions as well .
Yelp understood that , as with Wikipedia , a small group of people can create something that the rest of us can take advantage of .
Reviewers also benefit because they can see how other users vote on their reviews .
Moreover , the site mimics the structure of a social network , so that active members can see information about and follow the work of other reviewers who interest them .
Yelp has also started holding social events for its frequent reviewers .
“ People come to write reviews as a hobby and also to meet other people , ” Mr. Stoppelman said .
This playbook is n’t new .
Epinions , a product review site , built a similar community ( see this interesting Wired piece from 2000 ) until it was dissolved into Shopping.com , now part of eBay .
One reason for Yelp ’s success is that it focused on San Francisco in its first year .
The new generation of Web workers took
Yelp to be their entertainment bible , and that helped generate enough critical mass that others joined in .
Now the Bay Area represents only about 30 percent of Yelp activity , Mr. Stoppelman said .
Los Angeles is second , followed by Chicago and New York .
The site is also popular , Mr. Stoppelman said , because Yelp has been slow to add advertising , and there still is n’t that much of it .
There are no only a few banner ads .
Instead ,
Yelp uses some relatively subtle advertising formats : Businesses can pay to have their companies listed first on search pages ( identified as a sponsored listing ) .
And they can pay to add photos and a little other information to the page about their business .
But revenue from these sources is n’t enough to make Yelp profitable , Mr. Stoppelman said .
Responding to criticism from business owners that some user reviews are unfair , Yelp also recently introduced a way for the business owner to send a message back to a reviewer .
If the reviewer does n’t choose to write back , the business owner can’t send a second message .
But Mr. Stoppelman said that the site deliberately tilts its rules to support the reviewers .
“ We put the community first , the consumer second and businesses third , ” he said .
Yesterday I received a few “ hot off the presses ” copies of The Annotated Turing : A Guided Tour through Alan Turing 's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine , kindly forwarded to me by Wiley , the book 's publisher .
Even after writing 15 books over the past 20 years , I still get a thrill when I see the first copies .
Just to get a sense how the book is shipping to people other than the author , a couple weeks ago Deirdre and I submitted test orders to Amazon and Barnes & Noble .
This morning B&N sent me an email saying that the book is " now packed and ready to leave our warehouse . "
I guess they 're just waiting for the UPS guy to show up .
Amazon has n't been quite as prompt ; let 's just hope they do n't mess up royally like they did with 3D Programming for Windows .
I wish I could say that The Annotated Turing was " 10 years in the making " but it 's really only been 9 years .
I created the first Word file for the book on May 12 , 1999 , and I sent my final fixes to the production editor on May 8 , 2008 .
From its conception to its completion , the idea behind the book remained constant : to put Alan Turing 's 1936 paper " On Computable Numbers , with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem " in an historical and intellectual context , and then to annotate the hell out of it .
Whether this was a great idea for a book or a really stupid idea for a book , I never really decided , but undecidability is what Turing 's paper is all about , so I was n't very concerned .
Now the book is yours rather than mine , and I 'm interested in hearing your reactions to it .
Gandhi’s Top 10 Fundamentals for Changing the World
“ You must not lose faith in humanity .
Humanity is an ocean ; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty , the ocean does not become dirty . ”
“ The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world 's problem . ”
“ If I had no sense of humor , I would long ago have committed suicide . ”
Mahatma Gandhi needs no long introduction .
Everyone knows about the man who lead the Indian people to independence from British rule in 1947 .
So let 's just move on to some of my favorite tips from Mahatma Gandhi .
1. Change yourself .
“ You must be the change you want to see in the world . ”
“ As human beings , our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world – that is the myth of the atomic age – as in being able to remake ourselves . ”
If you change yourself you will change your world .
If you change how you think then you will change how you feel and what actions you take .
And so the world around you will change .
Not only because you are now viewing your environment through new lenses of thoughts and emotions but also because the change within can allow you to take action in ways you would n't have – or maybe even have thought about – while stuck in your old thought patterns .
And the problem with changing your outer world without changing yourself is that you will still be you when you reach that change you have strived for .
You will still have your flaws , anger , laziness , negativity , self - sabotaging tendencies etc. intact .
And so in this new situation you will still not find what you hoped for since your mind is still seeping with that negative stuff .
And if you get more without having some insight into and distance from your ego it may grow more powerful .
Since your ego loves to divide things , to find enemies and to create separation it may start to try to create even more problems and conflicts in your life and world .
2 . You are in control .
“ Nobody can hurt me without my permission . ”
What you feel and how you react to something is always up to you .
There may be a “ normal ”  or a common way to react to different things .
But that 's mostly just all it is .
You can choose your own thoughts , reactions and emotions to pretty much everything .
You do n't have to overthink , freak out , worry of even react in a negative way .
Perhaps not every time or instantly .
Sometimes a knee - jerk reaction just goes off .
Or an old thought habit kicks in .
And as you realize that no - one outside of yourself can actually control how you feel you can start to incorporate this thinking into your daily life and develop it as a thought habit .
A habit that you can grow stronger and stronger over time .
Doing this makes life a whole lot easier and more pleasurable .
3. Forgive and let it go .
“ The weak can never forgive .
Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong . ”
“ An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind . ”
Fighting evil with evil wo n't help anyone .
And as said in the previous tip , you always choose how to react to something .
When you can incorporate such a thought habit more and more into your life then you can react in a way that is more useful to you and others .
You realize that forgiving and letting go of the past will do you and the people in your world a great service .
And spending your time in some negative memory wo n't help you after you have learned the lessons you can learn from that experience .
You 'll probably just cause yourself more suffering and paralyze yourself from taking action in this present moment .
If you do n't forgive then you let the past and another person to control how you feel .
By forgiving you release yourself from those bonds .
And then you can focus totally on , for instance , the next point .
4 . Without action you are n't going anywhere .
“ An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching . ”
Without taking action very little will be done .
However , taking action can be hard and difficult .
There can be much inner resistance .
And so you may resort to preaching , as Gandhi says .
Or reading and studying endlessly .
And feeling like you are moving forward .
But getting little or no practical results in real life .
So , to really get where you want to go and to really understand yourself and your world you need to practice .
Books can mostly just bring you knowledge .
You have to take action and translate that knowledge into results and understanding .
Move on to the next point for more on the best tip for taking more action that I have found so far .
5 . Take care of this moment .
“ I do not want to foresee the future .
I am concerned with taking care of the present .
God has given me no control over the moment following . ”
The best way that I have found to overcome the inner resistance that often stops us from taking action is to stay in the present as much as possible and to be accepting .
Why ?
Well , when you are in the present moment you do n't worry about the next moment that you can't control anyway .
And the resistance to action that comes from you imagining negative future consequences – or reflecting on past failures – of your actions loses its power .
And so it becomes easier to both take action and to keep your focus on this moment and perform better .
Have a look at 8 Ways to Return to the Present Moment for tips on how quickly step into the now .
And remember that reconnecting with and staying in the now is a mental habit – a sort of muscle – that you grow .
Over time it becomes more powerful and makes it easier to slip into the present moment .
6. Everyone is human .
“ I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal .
I own , however , that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps . ”
“ It is unwise to be too sure of one 's own wisdom .
It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err . ”
When you start to make myths out of people – even though they may have produced extraordinary results – you run the risk of becoming disconnected from them .
You can start to feel self - doubt and like you could never achieve similar things that they did because they are so very different .
So it 's important to keep in mind that everyone is just a human being no matter who they are .
And I think it 's important to remember that we are all human and prone to make mistakes .
Holding people to unreasonable standards will only create more unnecessary conflicts in your world and negativity within you .
It 's also important to remember this to avoid falling into the pretty useless habit of beating yourself up over mistakes that you have made .
And instead be able to see with clarity where you went wrong and what you can learn from your mistake .
And then try again .
7. Persist .
“ First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win . ”
Be persistent .
In time the opposition around you will fade and fall away .
And your inner resistance and self - sabotaging tendencies that want to hold you back and keep you like you have always been will grow weaker .
Find what you really like to do .
Then it will be easier to stay positive and you 'll find the inner motivation to keep going , going and going .
You can also find a lot of useful tips on how keep your motivation up in 27 Simple Ways to Motivate Yourself .
One reason Gandhi was so successful with his method of non-violence was because he and his followers were so persistent .
They just did n't give up .
Success or victory will seldom come as quickly as you would have liked it to .
I think one of the reasons people do n't get what they want is simply because they give up too soon .
The time they think an achievement will require is n't the same amount of time it usually takes to achieve that goal .
This faulty belief partly comes from the world we live in .
A world full of magic pill solutions where advertising continually promises us that we can lose a lot of weight or earn a ton of money in just 30 days .
Finally , one useful tip to keep your persistence going is to listen to Gandhi 's third quote in this article and keep a sense of humor .
It can lighten things up at the toughest of times .
8 . See the good in people and help them .
“ I look only to the good qualities of men .
Not being faultless myself , I wo n't presume to probe into the faults of others . ”
“ Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow - men . ”
“ I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles ; but today it means getting along with people . ”
There is pretty much always something good in people .
And things that may not be so good .
But you can choose what things to focus on .
And if you want improvement then focusing on the good in people is a useful choice .
It also makes life easier for you as your world and relationships become more pleasant and positive .
And when you see the good in people it becomes easier to motivate yourself to be of service to them .
By being of service to other people , by giving them value you not only make their lives better .
Over time you tend to get what you give .
And the people you help may feel more inclined to help other people .
And so you , together , create an upward spiral of positive change that grows and becomes stronger .
Nowadays it 's easier than ever to help people out and to start such a spiral .
You can do via social media , a podcast , a channel on Youtube or you can start a blog like I did .
Another tip is to strengthen your social skills .
By doing you can become a more influential person and make the upward spiral I mentioned even stronger .
Move on to the next tip for more on that .
9 . Be congruent , be authentic , be your true self .
“ Happiness is when what you think , what you say , and what you do are in harmony . ”
“ Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed .
Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well . ”
I think that one of the best tips for improving your social skills is to behave in a congruent manner and communicate in an authentic way .
People seem to really like authentic communication .
And there is much inner enjoyment to be found when your thoughts , words and actions are aligned .
You feel powerful and good about yourself .
When words and thoughts are aligned then that shows through in your communication .
Because now you have your voice tonality and body language – some say they are over 90 percent of communication – in alignment with your words .
With these channels in alignment people tend to really listen to what you 're saying .
You are communicating without incongruency , mixed messages or perhaps a sort of phoniness .
Also , if your actions are n't in alignment with what you 're communicating then you start to hurt your own belief in what you can do .
And other people 's belief in you too .
10 . Continue to grow and evolve .
“ Constant development is the law of life , and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position . ”
You can pretty much always improve your skills , habits or re-evaluate your evaluations .
You can gain deeper understanding of yourself and the world .
Sure , you may look inconsistent or like you do n't know what you are doing from time to time .
You may have trouble to act congruently or to communicate authentically
But if you do n't then you will , as Gandhi says , drive yourself into a false position .
A place where you try to uphold or cling to your old views to appear consistent while you realize within that something is wrong .
It 's not a fun place to be .
To choose to grow and evolve is a happier and more useful path to take .
In this post , I will present 3 important examples of the impact of Christianity in the United States that the Christian right does not want us to remember .
I have selected these examples out of many possible choices because they represent important chapters in American history in which secular Americans played a role and because they can easily be validated from newspaper articles , books , and sermons ( yes , sermons ) published at the time each event was happening .
Thus , the revisionist history presented by the modern Christian right is simply ludicrous .
1 . The majority of American Christians opposed the abolition of slavery and defended the institution of slavery as being the will of their god and justified by their bible .
The more conservative they were in their religious beliefs , the stronger was their opposition to abolition .
What does that tell us ?
2 . The majority of American Christians opposed suffrage .
Again , they used their bibles to argue that women should not have the right to vote .
And again , the more conservative they were in their religious beliefs , the more vehement their opposition .
3 . The majority of White American Christians opposed the civil rights movement .
While some Catholics supported the goals of the movement , most fundamentalist Protestants did not .
Many of the few White Christians who supported the movement were thrown out of their churches , demonized as atheists and / or communists , and deluged with hate mail from their Christian neighbors .
In each of these cases , we witnessed " culture wars " with secular freethinkers , repressed groups , and select liberal Protestants on one side and conservative Christians on the other .
It helps put today 's culture war in perspective , does n't it ?
It also demonstrates a pattern of fundamentalists Christians being fundamentally wrong on important social issues .
For more information about the distinguished role of freethinkers , secular humanists , and atheists throughout American history , Susan Jacoby 's Freethinkers : A History of American Secularism is a great read .
MORTGAGE RATES TICK UP MORTGAGE RATES TICK UP Rates on 30 - year mortgages edged up this week to the highest level since March as investors worried about inflation .
Mortgage company Freddie Mac reported Thursday that 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages averaged 6.09 % , compared with 6.08 % last week .
It was the highest mark for 30 - year mortgages since they averaged 6.13 % the week of March 16 .
Analysts said investors ' concern about inflation and possible Fed action helped boost rates .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke expressed new concerns this week about inflation .
The markets interpreted his comments as a signal the central bank will not cut interest rates further because of fears that inflation could spiral out of control .
In the latest survey , rates on 15 - year fixed - rate mortgages averaged 5.65 % , compared with 5.66 % last week .
The five - year adjustable - rate mortgage averaged 5.51 % vs. 5.62 % last week .
The rate on a one - year adjustable - rate mortgage stood at 5.06 % , compared with 5.22 % last week .
The mortgage rates do not include add - on fees known as points .
Nationwide , fees for 30 - year and 15 - year fixed - rate mortgages averaged 0.6 point ; fees on five - year mortgages averaged 0.5 point .
One - year adjustable - rate mortgages averaged 0.7 point .
A year ago , rates on 30 - year mortgages averaged 6.53 % , 15 - year mortgage rates averaged 6.22 % , five - year adjustable - rate mortgages were at 6.24 % and one - year adjustable - rate mortgages were at 5.65 % .

With homes entering foreclosure at a record rate , economists see no letup in the surge of homeowners who are losing their properties for failure to pay their mortgage .
For the first quarter of the year , the rate of new foreclosures hit 0.99 % , the highest point since record - keeping began in 1979 , the Mortgage Bankers Association said Thursday .
And the delinquency rate — reflecting those at least 30 days behind on their bills and at risk of sinking into foreclosure — reached 6.35 % .
That was another record .
STORY : Fed bank presidents question helping securities firms " It does n't get any worse than this , " says Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody 's Economy.com .
" There 's no sign of stabilization .
It 's going to continue at least through the end of this year . "
Patrick Newport , an economist at Global Insight , says : " I look at a lot of housing reports , and this is probably the worst report I 've come across .
We still think home prices will drop another 10 % , and foreclosures will remain elevated through the end of the year . "
At the same time , Newport says , there 's some sign that home sales may be picking up in California and Florida .
If so , he says , that could lead to an uptick in sales nationwide by the end of this year .
But he and other economists agree that the high rate of foreclosures will persist nationwide .
The main reason is that so many adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) have been resetting this year , and in many cases they 're leaving people with higher mortgage bills .
And in a sagging economy , with workers facing job losses or shrunken paychecks , many homeowners can't afford bigger payments .
Compounding the misery , prices are plummeting , in part because of a swelling supply of homes for sale , magnified by the rising foreclosures .
Stuck with foreclosed properties , banks are slashing prices to unload those homes , forcing other sellers to cut their own prices to compete .
A drop in housing values , in turn , has left current homeowners with dwindling equity , spurring even more foreclosures .
" Foreclosures are creating price declines , " Zandi notes , " and price declines are leading to more foreclosures due to negative equity . "
Further exacerbating the problem is that banks have tightened lending rules to reduce their own financial risks .
Fewer people , as a result , are qualified to buy .
Some states have been battered .
California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada combined represent 89 % of the increase in homes entering foreclosure , the MBA says .
Nationwide , the proportion of all homes in some stage of foreclosure reached 2.47 % .
That was yet another record in the MBA 's figures dating to 1979 .

The latest GDP numbers , that supposedly showed that real GDP expanded 0.6 % in the first quarter of 2008 after having expanded at the exact same rate the previous month , was used by a number of economists , mainly supply - side Republican ones , to deny that America is in a recession .
First and foremost among them was Larry Kudlow , along with Jerry Bowyer , whose book The Bush Boom Kudlow wrote the introduction of .
The argument made is that since GDP supposedly still expands and since recession is supposedly defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP , this means that there are n't no recession .
But as a matter of fact , both parts of this argument is wrong .
First of all , recession is in fact usually not defined by two consecutive quarters of falling GDP .
Although there were three quarters of falling GDP in 2000 and 2001 , these declines were interrupted by quarters of rising GDP , so using the definition of two consecutive quarters of falling GDP there were n't any recession in 2001 .
Instead , recession is usually declined as a broad based decline in economic activity , which specifically means falling industrial production , payroll employment , real disposable income excluding transfer payments and real business sales .
This , together with some indicator of monthly GDP is how the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) define a recession .
And although monthly GDP estimates are n't available to us mere mortals , the other 4 indicators are available to us , and they are summarized by the Conference Board in its index of coincident indicators .
And the current numbers for the index of coincident indicators shows that the recession is indeed here , and more specifically began in November 2007 .
The index has fallen each month since October 2007 , except for March 2008 .
And that number looks likely to be revised down .
Previous months numbers have systematically been revised down ( Two months ago , they claimed that the coincident index in January 2008 were 0.2 % higher in January 2008 compared to October 2007 .
Now they say the index fell 0.2 % in that three month period ) and considering the fact that two of the components , real disposable income and real business sales , were a mere imputation due to lack of actual data .
Since then , we have gotten the number for real disposable income in March which did not rise 0.25 % as the Conference Board assumed , but instead was unchanged .
But it 's not only the index of coincident indicators which tells us that the recession began late last year .
In fact , using a more proper price index to deflate the increase in nominal GDP gives us the same conclusion and does in fact show two consecutive quarters of falling GDP .
If we use a price index that underestimate inflation , this will not only lead us to underestimate price inflation , but it will also given a certain level of nominal GDP growth lead us to overestimate real GDP growth .
Many readers will at this point probably think that I will argue that the government price indexes underestimate price inflation and that some alternative measure , from for example John Williams '
Shadow statistics web site is better .
However , while there is a case for believing that the price inflation numbers produced by the government underestimate price inflation ( their methodology have been revised numerous times , curiously always resulting in lower inflation ) , my argument that real GDP has fallen for two consecutive quarter does not depend on doubting the validity of government price index .
Even if we accept for the sake of the argument that the government price indexes are completely accurate , that still means that real GDP has fallen for two consecutive quarters .
Instead , my case rests on pointing out that the headline GDP number is derived by deflating the nominal GDP increase by the wrong government price index .
That means specifically , the Gross Domestic Product price index instead of the Gross Domestic Purchases .
The first index is based on the prices Americans sell , while the second index is based on the prices Americans buy .
To a large extent , these price indexes overlap as they both include the prices of things Americans sell to other Americans .
The difference is that the Gross Domestic Product index include the price of exports while excluding the price of imports while the Gross Domestic Purchases index exclude the price of exports while including the price of imports .
When export - and import prices increase at the same rate , these two price indexes will increase at the same rate .
But when import prices rise faster than export prices , then the Purchases index will rise faster and conversely when export prices rise faster than import prices the Product index rill rise faster .
As the point of GDP statistics usually is said to be to indicate how much purchasing power for Americans their production will give them , it makes much more sense to deflate nominal GDP growth with the price index of what they buy rather than the price index of what they sell .
If the prices of the things you buy fall , then other things being equal this will increase your real income .
But if the prices of the things you sell fall , then this will other things being equal lower your real income .
Your real income certainly do n't rise if you work 2 % more but your hourly wage fall 3 % and the prices of the things you buy are unchanged .
But according to the methodology used to produce the alleged positive GDP number , real income in that case did in fact rise 2 % .
Similarly , the net income of a company who cuts the price of its product by 20 % while increasing volume sales by 10 % at a time when the prices of the things the owners and workers of that company are unchanged .
Even assuming no fixed costs , that would of course imply a 12 % decline in real profits and real wages ( For simplicity I assume that wages fall too .
The basic point does not however rest on this assumption ) .
But according to the methodology used to produce the alleged positive GDP number , we are supposed to assume that the real income for the owners and workers rose 10 % .
And what is absurd for individual workers and companies is also absurd for aggregates of workers and companies , like the GDP number .
Having established that it is more proper to deflate nominal GDP with the Gross Domestic Purchases index , we can now re-evaluate the GDP numbers .
Nominal GDP growth was 3.0 % in Q4 2007 and 3.2 % in Q1 2008 , yet the price index that measure the purchasing power of Americans , the gross domestic purchases deflator , rose 3.7 % and 3.5 % respectively , meaning that real GDP fell 0.7 % in Q4 2007 and 0.3 % in Q1 2008 .
Illustrating the fact that this is a more proper approach , we can note that the alleged positive growth number was in part based on a alleged increase in net exports .
Yet the actual trade deficit rose in fact from $ 708.9 billion to $ 737.3 billion at an annual rate .
Rising net exports means a falling , not a rising , trade deficit yet the methodology used to provide the alleged positive GDP numbers still counted this increased trade deficit as rising net exports because the increase in imports were mostly based on rising import prices .
In short , there can be little doubt that America is in a recession now and that this recession probably began in November 2007 .
The supply - siders that deny this must resort to using the absurd logic that it is irrelevant for your living standard if you must pay more for the things you buy , or get paid less for the things you sell .
Somehow , I doubt that they are willing to apply this logic in their personal life and accept a lower pay for their propaganda pieces .

Breaking Guinness World Records ai n't that hard , really : you just need to invent a new one .
For example , " most software downloads in 24 hours , " as that 's the record Firefox wants to break with the launch of Firefox 3 .
The actual date of the launch is , unfortunately , yet to be announced , but when it comes , you better be ready for some heavy duty downloading .
Breaking this particular world record is not a small feat ; I can remember several pieces of software which got downloaded a lot in a short timespan , for example World of Warcraft 's latest expansion .
Although you cannot actually download anything yet , you can pledge that you 're ready to help them break the record .
Over 40.000 people have already pledged , but I can imagine this number will grow significantly in the following days .
You can even see how many people have pledged from each individual country on a nifty world map , as pictured below .
So far , the US is in the lead , with Spain and China holding the second and third place .
You might think that a chocolate company with one of the world 's most famous brands would have a flashy headquarters with a visitors ' centre and a neon sign .
Not Mars .
A notoriously secretive Virginia - based firm , it is run out of an anonymous brown building near the CIA 's headquarters .
Nicknamed " the Kremlin " for its opaque ways , the snacks manufacturer is wholly owned by a reclusive dynasty of billionaires who spend a good deal of time on a remote ranch in Wyoming .
This week 's $ 22bn ( £ 11.6 bn ) takeover of the chewing - gum maker Wrigley put Mars dead centre on Wall Street 's radar screen — giving the firm the kind of visibility it had studiously avoided for 98 years .
" They 're based in a dark , hidden building , " says Jan Pottker , author of a tell - all book about the Mars family , Crisis in Candyland .
" It 's simply incredible — rather than being proud of their company , they do n't want to be noticed . "
With 129 factories and 223 offices in 66 countries , Mars employs 48,000 staff and commands annual sales of $ 22bn .
As well as confectionery such as its eponymous bar , Twix , Snickers and Starburst , its lines include Uncle Ben 's rice , Dolmio pasta sauces , Masterfoods ready meals and Whiskas catfood .
Its move for Wrigley came out of the blue — astonishingly audacious for such a relentlessly low - profile business .
" Mars is a very , very quiet company , " says Mitchell Howard , a food analyst at the stockbroker Morningstar in Chicago .
He believes the deal 's logic is largely driven by marketing muscle and by distribution power — the combined company will command shelf space at more corner - shop retailers , particularly in emerging markets .
" This gives them a huge distribution footprint all over the world , " says Howard .
" Wrigley has a lot of distribution in Asia and eastern Europe .
The retail trade is a lot less consolidated in those markets , so distribution really matters . "
The deal , agreed in just three weeks , was negotiated with Wrigley 's bosses over sandwiches around the kitchen table of Mars 's president , Paul Michaels .
Mars tapped the world 's richest man , Warren Buffett , for $ 6.5bn and secured a further $ 5.7 bn from Goldman Sachs .
Food industry experts see it as a sign that Mars is finally opening up — possibly due to the influence of Michaels , a former Johnson & Johnson executive who is part of a first generation of non-family members to be responsible for the day - to - day business .
" They did have a leadership change about four years ago , " says Howard .
" They 've got quite aggressive in terms of advertising and innovation — there have been more product extensions , more line extensions . "
Michaels took the reins in 2004 after the retirement of Forrest Mars junior and his brother John who , with sister Jacqueline , still own the company .
They are the grandchildren of Franklin Mars — a Minnesota - born entrepreneur who started the company by making butter cream sweets in his kitchen .
Forbes magazine estimates that each of the three siblings has a fortune of $ 14bn .
But they do n't grace the society pages of America 's newspapers and grand gestures of philanthropy are not their style .
However , there have been occasional donations to the Republican party .
Mars will only say that certain descendants of Frank Mars still occupy management positions and refuses to reveal how many of them sit on the board .
When second - generation boss Forrest senior died aged 95 in 1999 , Mars would not even confirm his death .
Strait - laced
Traditionally , Mars has been deeply conservative and highly competitive .
It lobbied Congress to change the end date of daylight saving time to get an extra hour 's evening light on Halloween — a crucial day for selling confectionery .
Its strait - laced approach has sometimes tripped it up .
Mars refused to allow its M&Ms to be featured in Stephen Spielberg 's blockbuster ET .
So the film 's young hero , Elliot , used Hershey 's Reese 's Pieces to lure his alien friend to come out from a hiding place — prompting rocketing sales .
" You could n't laugh at the products in any way , " says Pottker .
" At the time , they would never do a product placement — certainly not with an extra-terrestrial . "
She says the " cult of secrecy " around the firm dates back to the second world war when Forrest Mars senior patented a method of parboiling rice to extend its shelf life — subsequently launched as Uncle Ben 's rice .
American military chiefs read about the patent and tried to overturn it in order to supply troops .
" Forrest was absolutely appalled at what even a positive article about rice could end up with , " says Pottker .
" The kids took it to heart . "
This insistence on privacy has been a useful device in helping the Mars family to maintain its unanimity according Joseph Astrachan , an expert in family enterprises at Kennesaw State University in Georgia .
He says it implies betrayal if any relative dissents or talks to outsiders .
" It keeps the family aligned — you do n't give the people the sense that they can go elsewhere , " says Astrachan .
" They 've been unswayed , unbowed by the so - called experts who tell them to do things differently . "
A booklet signed by 13 members of the family gives a glimpse into their thinking .
The pamphlet , the Five Principles of Mars , explains what makes the company " different " .
It lists quality , responsibility , mutuality , efficiency and freedom — of which the last is described in a curious way .
Private ownership , says the pamphlet is crucial to Mars 's " freedom " as it means the firm is not answerable to anybody .
" Many other companies began as Mars did , but as they grew larger and required new sources of funds , they sold stocks or incurred restrictive debt to fuel their business , " wrote the Mars clan .
" To extend their growth , they exchanged a portion of their freedom . "
Mars has shown more flexibility in recent years .
In response to concerns over obesity , it has launched a range of healthier snacks for school vending machines called Generation Max .
And it has developed a chocolate ingredient called CocoaVia that can help lower cholesterol levels .
The fact that Wrigley , too , is a family company may have smoothed the path to this week 's deal .
The Wrigley family controls 60 % of the gum maker 's stock and is chaired by Bill Wrigley , great grandson of founder William Wrigley — a baking powder salesman who began giving away free packets of gum to merchants in the 1890s .
In the chewing gum firm 's hometown of Chicago , the Cubs ' baseball stadium is called Wrigley Field and the white terracotta - clad Wrigley building is an architectural landmark , floodlit at night on the Chicago river .
The Wrigleys command a degree of public respect — a little like another legendary American business founder , Wal - Mart 's Sam Walton .

In the enthusiasm for renewable energy and taking care of our environment , it is easy to assume that making fuel from plants ( biofuel ) must be by definition " green " and renewable .
However when it comes to energy issues , easy assumptions can be dangerous assumptions .
In previous years some politicians and advocates in Europe have made these assumptions without sufficient thought and research and secured government subsidies for companies importing palm oil from South East Asia to make biodiesel for transport and for use in electricity generation .
The demand for palm oil in Europe has soared in the last two decades , first for use in food and cosmetics , and more recently for fuel .
This cheap oil can be used for a variety of purposes , including as an ingredient about 10 percent of supermarket products , from chocolate to toothpaste .
Promoted by hundreds of millions of dollars in national subsidies , the Netherlands quickly became the leading importer of palm oil in Europe , taking in 1.7 million tons in 2006 , nearly double the previous year .
Now it is increasingly difficult to ignore the mounting body of scientific evidence that palm oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia , rather than preserving the environment are in fact actively destroying it .
By subsidising biofuels , European governments have artificially raised demand for palm oil in Europe , and accelerated the destruction of huge areas of rainforest in South East Asia .
Palm oil plantations are often expanded by draining and burning peatland , releasing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
As a result Indonesia has become the world 's third largest emitter of carbon dioxide , ranked after the United States and China , according to a study released in December by researchers from Wetlands International and Delft Hydraulics , both based in the Netherlands .
The 2003 European Union Biofuels Directive , which required all member states aim to have 5.75 percent of transportation run on biofuel in 2010 , is now under review .
In the Netherlands , the data from Indonesia has prompted the government to suspend palm oil subsidies .
In Europe a small amount of rapeseed and sunflower oil is used to make diesel fuel , however increasingly plant oils are being imported from the tropics , since there is simply not enough plant matter or land for biofuel production at home .
So while the billions of dollars in European subsidies appear to have reduced carbon emissions in European countries by importing biofuels , this has been achieved by exporting them and increasing their impact many times by the permanent destruction of rainforest and peatland in South East Asia .
For anyone familiar with how the ethanol industry works in the United States , they will be unsurprised to learn that the palm oil industry was promoted long before there was adequate research .
Biofuel Watch , an environment group in Britain , now says that " biofuels should not automatically be classed as renewable energy . "
It supports a stop on subsidies until more research can determine if various biofuels in different regions are produced in a nonpolluting manner .
The group also suggests that all emissions arising from the production of a biofuel be counted as emissions in the country where the fuel is actually used , providing a clearer accounting of environmental costs .
Friends of the Earth estimates that 87 percent of the deforestation in Malaysia from 1985 to 2000 was caused by new palm oil plantations .
In Indonesia , the amount of land devoted to palm oil has increased 118 percent in the last eight years .
Peat is an organic sponge composed of 90 percent water that stores huge amounts of carbon , which when it is drained emits huges amounts of carbon into the atmosphere .
Even worse peatland is often burned to clear ground for plantations .
The Dutch study estimated that the draining of peatland in Indonesia releases 660 million tons of carbon a year into the atmosphere and that fires contributed 1.5 billion tons annually .
The total is equivalent to 8 percent of all global emissions caused annually by burning fossil fuels , the researchers said .
" These emissions generated by peat drainage in Indonesia were not counted before , " according to a Wetlands spokesperson .
" It was a totally ignored problem .
" While for the moment the widescale destruction of rainforests in South East Asia continues , hopefully the palm oil story will serve as a cautionary tale which will lead to much better informed policymaking and behaviour .
Politicians must resist the urge to rush to legislate and subsidise in order to bask in the glow of being seen to be " doing something " while a number of so - called green companies profit from taxpayer subsidised destruction .
Energy policy must make sense from a scientific ( i.e. it should be energy positive ) , economic and environmental viewpoint .
However the continued promotion of ethanol and coal - to - liquids calls for continued skepticism .

Everything about the interests of a mature person
The Florida Bar asked for an " enhanced disbarment " in the disciplinary hearing of Jack Thompson , held earlier this afternoon .
The recommendation means Thompson would be disbarred and prohibited from applying to practice law again for ten years , according to 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida spokesperson Eunice Sigler .
Advertisement
Thompson 's disciplinary hearing apparently ended in the attorney walking out of the courtroom after saying the judge did not have the authority to hear his case , a reader who sat in on the hearing told us .
The case proceeded without Thompson 's presence and the Florida Bar issued its recommendation for the enhanced disbarment .
Judge Dava Tunis ' specific recommendations for sanctions will be included in her official report , to be due to the Florida Supreme Court by September 2nd .
Advertisement
Before walking out of the courtroom , Thompson filed what he called " Thompson 's Formal Objection to June 4 Sanctions Hearing . "
In the rambling , 4,500 - word objection , Thompson questioned Tunis ' ability to preside at his hearing , calling her incompetent and arrogant and threatening to have her removed from office " in the days and weeks ahead . "
He also went on to call the people run The Florida Bar fascists and denied that he was involved some sort of " petty culture war . "
Thompson wrapped up his 14 - page objection by quoting from the bible , and saying that he and Senators Clinton and Obama understand the dangers posed by the Grand Theft Auto games .

We 've contacted Thompson for a reaction to the recommended disbarment recommendations and will update you if and when he responds .
In the meantime , hit the jump for the full letter .

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA
THE FLORIDA BAR ,
Complainant ,
v. Case Numbers SC 07 - 80 and 07 - 354
JOHN B. THOMPSON ,
Respondent .
THOMPSON'S FORMAL OBJECTION TO JUNE 4 SANCTIONS " HEARING "
This document is hereby submitted to the referee at the commencement of this non-hearing sanctions " hearing " and read into the record as well , and thus I depart from the traditional identification of myself , a party herein , in the third person and instead speak in my own voice in the first person directly to the referee .
Advertisement
I object , strenuously , as I have in the past on the record , to the very notion that this proceeding can even occur , on various grounds any single one of which is fatal to its legitimacy , including but not limited to the following grounds :
You , the referee , are not even a judge .
The law in Florida on that is clear , and it is found in Florida 's Loyalty Oath Statute 876.05 , et sequitur , held constitutional and binding by the United States Supreme Court in Connell v. Higginbotham .
We know now from a recently concluded State Attorney 's investigation and Report that your first state loyalty oath was forged .
We also know that your next two oaths , which you signed , did not conform to that statute in that the language deviated from what is required and they were not even notarized .
A number of formal opinions by Florida 's Attorney General state that such flaws are fatal regardless of intent .
Advertisement
The statute itself states that if any state official , including a judge , fails to comply strictly with the loyalty oath statute , then that judge is without legal authority to serve and must immediately be removed from office .
I will accomplish your removal from office in the days and weeks ahead , as the litigation that will achieve that has already been filed by me in Miami - Dade Circuit Court .
The Supreme Court of Florida , which you , the referee think is your ally in what you are doing here has ruled that your loyalty oath screw - up is fatal .
As Richard Nixon found , the cover - up is worse than the initial law breaking .
When I found out about your forged loyalty oath and then about your two subsequent inadequate loyalty oaths , I moved for your recusal .
You then immediately commenced a cover - up , refusing by a false , formal order to acknowledge the loyalty oath problem , pretending it did not exist .
Proving the cover - up , you even more foolishly executed on February 4 , 2008 , finally , a loyalty oath , which I attach hereto , that complies with the state statute , but you did so too late to keep you in office , as the oath must be timely executed , and yours is years too late .
Advertisement
The law is clear ; your post facto oath is invalid .
This panicked oath is an irrefutable admission that you never had a valid oath in the first place .
How could you do something so dumb ?
Easy ; desperate people do desperate things .
You will be removed from office , and all of what you have done in this Bar matter will be voided as a result .
Secondly , we know now that six of the seven Florida Supreme Court Justices never executed valid state loyalty oaths .
I have proven that , as has Florida and Washington , D.C. lawyer Montgomery Blair Sibley , whose own Bar referee , Judge Prescott , had his oath forged by the same person , Sayed A. Shah , who forged yours .
What a coincidence .
Advertisement
The Florida Supreme Court entered its order seeking to deny me my right to represent myself before it on this disciplinary matter when I alerted the Court to its loyalty oath problem .
They , too , in a panic , executed too - late , post facto , wholly ineffectual loyalty oaths after the whistle was blown on them .
This just proves that sitting on the highest court in the state neither make you clever .
The consequence of all of this post facto oath taking is that all that the Florida Supreme Court has done in this case is invalid and will be voided , and if you think I will not accomplish that end then a ) you do not understand the lawsuit already filed , and b ) you do n't know Jack .
Thirdly , we are here today because you issued a written document you called " Recommendations " by which you announced to the world with this document you leaked to the press , that I am guilty on 27 of 31 counts brought by The Bar .
In issuing and leaking this document called " Recommendations , " you have clearly violated Florida Bar Rule 3 - 7.6 ( m ) which states in pertinent part :
The referee 's report shall include :
( A ) a finding of fact as to each item of misconduct of which the respondent is charged , which findings of fact shall enjoy the same presumption of correctness as the judgment of the trier of fact in a civil proceeding ;
( B ) recommendations as to whether the respondent should be found guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary measures ;
( C ) recommendations as to the disciplinary measures to be applied ;
English is the greatest of all languages .
It allows its users to be very precise .
Any rational person conversant in English understands , upon reading Rule 3 - 7.6 , that the document containing findings of guilt must also contain " findings of fact " as to what I am guilty of .
Your " Recommendations " have absolutely no findings of fact , and yet we are here today on that invalid document .
There is absolutely no provision in our Bar Rules for a document called " Recommendations " devoid of such findings of fact .
You and The Bar have made it up .
You and The Bar have made a lot of things up in the last four years , and this is just your latest .
Advertisement
From the day this Bar effort began four years ago and in which you , the referee have become ensnared , although you have certainly warmed to the recruitment , I have been asking for a document that informs me what I have done to violate the Rules .
Four years later , I still have no such document and no notice and thus no due process by virtue of that failure .
You could n't even come up with it in your " Recommendations . "
This is a game of " hide and seek , " Referee Tunis , which you cannot win .
I have said it before , and I will say it again to you , and of course you will not listen , but the record must be made clear :
You can't charge a lawyer and you can't charge a rapist with anything unless you tell him in the charging document with specificity - with facts alleged - what he has done .
Advertisement
We went into the trial here in November 2007 with no specific charges .
The Bar said , " Here are the Rules you have violated , here are the documents , you figure it out . "
At the trial , there was absolutely no evidence - no facts - put forth that I violated any of these Bar Rules .
My favorite " testimony , " if you want to call it that , which highlights the problem of not telling an accused what he has done wrong , was from Alabama Judge James Moore , who admitted under oath , that I did not withhold any of my colorful disciplinary history from him , as Blank Rome alleged , but that in fact I gave him more facts than I was required to give .
My sin was that I did not tell him how " serious " were my Bar sins .
I did n't even have to tell him I was merely reprimanded by The Bar in 1992 for trying to protect my family from death threats , but because I did not characterize my sins as more serious than The Florida Bar itself did , when I provided him all the facts , he said I had not " see the whole picture . "
Believe me , I see the whole picture .
I am to be punished for telling the truth because I pose a threat to this white judge who put this black teen on death row in Alabama .
That 's the " whole picture . "
I am also to be punished , you have concluded , for going on 60 Minutes and warning the American people , like Paul Revere , that , inspired by video games , " the murders are coming . "
And they have come .
Advertisement
I am to be punished for trying to save lives , over the objection of Blank Rome , which gives more money to the Bush family than any other law firm in the world .
This is the Bush family that put you on this bench and whom you have protected by refusing to give me a subpoena that puts Jeb Bush under oath about his personal , financial relationship with the two law firms that are behind all of these Bar complaints , Tew Cardenas and Blank Rome .
You are Jeb Bush 's protector and shield from Jack Thompson , and you have discharged your sordid task in that regard effectively .
Fourthly , most of what I am charged with I did not do on behalf of any client but in pursuit of efforts to secure enforcement of laws for the common good .
The Florida Supreme Court ruled , again in English so that any rational person can understand , in Florida Bar v. Brake , that a lawyer cannot violate Rule 4 - 8.4 ( d ) unless he is " engaged in the practice of law on behalf of a client . "
I had no client , Referee Tunis , in almost all of this , and thus you have had no jurisdiction over any of that .
You have ignored this clear Florida Supreme Court ruling , and you will be undone by this cavalier disregard for the law in this regard as well .
Advertisement
Fifthly , you have received numerous motions to recuse , all of which have been facially and legally sufficient .
The law in Florida in state court is clear as to recusal .
Once you receive a motion to recuse which on its face conforms to the requirements of Florida Statute 38.10 and Rule 2.330 , Florida Rules of Judicial Administration , you must withdraw from a case .
You are not allowed to assess the validity of the facts in the motion .
The filing of a motion that conforms to the statute mandates recusal , period .
There is no wiggle room on this .
You have wiggled , repeatedly , like a nightcrawler on a hook .
You have thumbed your nose at this Florida recusal law as well , and this alone will undo you and which renders whatever you do today and after null and void .
Advertisement
Sixthly , we come to an issue about which The Florida Bar 's Board of Governors and I are in total agreement .
The Governors have come up with a new Rule that before Judges can serve as referees in Bar matters they must be trained as to how to discharge these specialized duties of a referee .
In the other Bar case you had Arthur Teele was the respondent , and he solved your problem by killing himself in the lobby of the Miami Herald .
I 'm not giving you that out .
The Bar Governors have decided : No training , you can't be a referee .
Leaving aside your bias against me , which you have never missed an opportunity to express , proof of your incompetence and total lack of training as a referee has been legion .
You did whatever The Bar told you to do , even to the point of refusing to give me hearings , refusing to issue subpoenas , and refusing to afford me any semblance of due process .
Smiling and saying " Have a nice day , " after you have just informed me that I can't get a continuance for my wife 's cancer surgery and chemotherapy is not due process , Referee Tunis .
It is incompetence wedded to arrogance , poorly masked by a happy face .
Advertisement
Going into this complex " disciplinary " matter with no training on what a referee should do and how you should act undoes all of what you have done and will yet do to me , as the new Bar Rule - let 's call it the Tunis Rule - will alone be a basis for reversal .
There is more that I could say and frankly want to say at this Star Chamber , kangaroo court " hearing , " but the record has probably been sufficiently made to date to make it easy enough to undo this mess , but I note here , as I conclude my objection to these proceedings :
You have been so cruel and at the same time so foolish as to call my pleadings herein " propaganda . "
That word means something , given how propaganda was used in the last century by the Third Reich in Nazi Germany to justify the placement of people of faith in " relocation centers " where they were starved and gassed as the " final solution " to the problem they posed .
A human spirit that could do that is more than capable of doing to me what you have done .
Clarence Thomas , at his Senate confirmation hearings , spoke of those proceedings as " a high - tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves , to do for themselves , to have different ideas , and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order , this is what will happen to you .
You will be lynched , destroyed , caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree . "
Advertisement
The US Senate , Referee Tunis , has nothing on you and your high - tech lynching of the uppity Christian who stands before you .
U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas warned in Lathrop v. Donohue that integrated state bars , like Florida's , if they were left unchecked as to their ideologies , would turn into , his phrase " goose - stepping brigades " for nonconforming lawyers who did not fit the majority 's mold .
There is a reason my e-mail address is amendmentone@comcast.net .
It is because of the fascists who run The Florida Bar identified as such by a U.S. Supreme Court Justice .
Advertisement
You also smeared me with the epithet that I am involved in some petty " culture war " into which I have tried , you allege , to recruit you .
Some of us , Referee Tunis , simply know and dare act upon the fact that children should be protected from corporate predation , whether it be the violent pornography in Grand Theft Auto IV , sold to my 15 - year - old son in a sting he did at Best Buy in Dadeland , in which women proclaim " I 'll suck your cock real nice " then do so , only to be killed by the hero in the game .
We actually do something about the sale of simulators to underage teens on how to kill policemen in ways you would not even imagine , which is precisely what Devin Moore did in a police station in Fayette , Alabama .
We come against radio broadcast descriptions , in our hometown on WQAM - AM , by Howard Stern as kids are going to school at 8 am by female amputees on how to lubricate their stumps and place them into the anuses of men to achieve orgasm .
Those of us who have done something about this do not want you in what you derisively call a " culture war " anymore than we would want Frank Fuster to run a day care center .
I represented Ileana Fuster in her divorce from Frank Fuster , and she knows more about what I have been trying to do and why I have been trying to do it over the past twenty years than you even care to know and yet which you mock .
It 's your and The Bar 's culture war on me and upon people of faith that indicts you , not me .
Advertisement
The Preamble to your and my Bar Rules , Referee Tunis , prohibits the bringing of Bar complaints by opposing parties and counsel as a means of collateral attack .
Such SLAPP
Bar complaints are illegal and they are void .
When I provided you a letter from The Bar 's own prosecutor in Ft. Lauderdale saying just that , you refused to have a hearing on the matter .
You refuse to have a hearing on any matter that threatens to derail this locomotive in whose engine you oh - so - primly sit , as it careens toward the bridge that is already washed out .
Just this past week you entered an order asserting that The Bar has never demanded a mental health assessment of me .
I have the letters from The Bar that prove you a liar .
It was in response to those repeated demands that I went to one of The Bar 's own favored forensic psychologists , Oren Wunderman , Executive Director of the Family Resource Center of South Florida , who spent hours examining me , administering tests , and he found me a ) wonderfully sane , and b ) a person whose Christian faith has enhanced his activities as a lawyer .
The Bar has a real problem in that Dr. Wunderman simply echoes what The Bar itself had to formally admit in 1991 when its insurer paid me damages for forcing me to undergo forced psych evaluations , on the order of the oathless Florida Supreme Court .
Advertisement
The Bar then formally found my actions stemmed from my religious faith , and it has never gotten over being bested at its own game .
This latest installment of this anti-Christian persecution is simply payback by The Bar , and you have allowed yourself to become part of it .
You have chosen to ignore Dr. Wunderman 's findings and The Bar 's own previous findings as to why Jack Thompson does what he does , because you must :
To do otherwise would have given me a hearing to which I am entitled under Florida Statute 761 , called the Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act , held constitutional by the United States Supreme Court , which provides me a total defense in these Bar proceedings and which also , when they are over , gives me a cause of action against you personally and against the State of Florida .
This act provides that if my actions stem from a religious impulse , then The Bar cannot discipline me for acting upon my religious impulse .
Good luck to a Bar whose own formal findings establish why I do what I do .
Advertisement
When I wrote a letter to Al Cardenas , calling him to be ashamed of what he and his law firm have done to harm children by fronting for the Howard Stern Show , I was acting upon the Scriptural template of John the Baptist confronting Herod about marrying his brother 's wife and the example of Jesus confronting the Pharisees , who called them " hypocrites , whited sepulchers , and vipers . "
Jesus was not a silent doormat and neither am I .
This Florida Religious Freedom Restoration
Act , which you arrogantly chose to pretend does not exist and on which you would not give me a hearing as to my defense thereunder , has been found to protect as a religious practice the consumption of peyote because there is a religious sect that makes doing so a sacrament .
You cannot be serious , Referee Tunis , if you think that a jury will not look at what you have done to me for what I have done , in the name of Jesus Christ , and not be appalled at your discrimination against this uppity Christian " propagandist " whom you smear as a mere " culture warrior . "
Advertisement
Finally , and then I am done with this formal objection to these proceedings , over a year ago I taught an evening class at Miami - Dade Community College on the campus a few minutes from here .
When I was introduced by the professor as the man who got Howard Stern off terrestrial radio , which Stern himself admits , and despite the Bar complaints of Tew Cardenas and other porn lawyers made at the time , all of the African American women in that classroom gave me an ovation .
They get it .
They understand the racism and the misogyny by Stern targeting them .
You , a white woman of privilege living on Key Biscayne , obviously do n't " get it . "
Those black female students are the people who will be on my jury in the trial in which you and The Bar will be a defendant .
I do what I do for them , and not for you , not for the ultra-liberal extremists on the Board of Governors like Steve Chaykin , my actual designated reviewer who publicly states that lawyers like Jack Thompson who oppose gay adoption are " enemies of The Bar and outside the core values of The Bar . "
My other designated reviewer was Ben Kuehne , to the left of Stalin ideologically who is an operative for the ACLU , which national organization has targeted me for years .
Kuehne is now under federal indictment for money - laundering and you , you obstructionist sitting illegally on that bench , would not issue a subpoena to allow me to depose him .
In that single act of ministerial arrogance you violated any conceivable notion of due process under our Constitution .
In doing so , you embarrass the bench more than any words I could write about Judge Ron Friedman .
Advertisement
The Steve Chaykins and the Ben Kuehnes who have hijacked this Bar , and who have hijacked you , the referee , are the ones who have fashioned Justice Douglas ' " goose - stepping brigades " that will undo both you and The Bar .
I have put up with your serial breaches of Florida laws , of the Canons of Judicial Conduct , of the Constitution , and of common decency for a year and a half now .
When this is done , and when you recommend my disbarment , and when the Supreme Court does disbar me , as I am presently bound and gagged and unable to represent myself before them in this matter , even though I now have a client whom I represent before them in that very same court , the tables will be turned .
It will then be my time at bat , and a jury of normal people in this County will undo all that you have done .
Even now , this day , I thank God that I am who I am , in the situation in which I now find myself , rather than the one in which you brazenly put yourself .
From the Gospel of John 15 : 18-25 I end with the words of Jesus of Nazareth , which you , Referee Tunis , have proven true :
18 " If the world hates you , keep in mind that it hated me first .
19
If you belonged to the world , it would love you as its own .
As it is , you do not belong to the world , but I have chosen you out of the world .
That is why the world hates you .
20 Remember the words I spoke to you : ' No servant is greater than his master . '
If they persecuted me , they will persecute you also .
If they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours also .
21 They will treat you this way because of my name , for they do not know the One who sent me .
22 If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin .
Now , however , they have no excuse for their sin .
23 He who hates me hates my Father as well .
24 If I had not done among them what no one else did , they would not be guilty of sin .
But now they have seen these miracles , and yet they have hated both me and my Father .
25 But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law : ' They hated me without reason . ' "

Having only scratched the surface with what is wrong about these lawless proceedings and why they are illegitimate under the laws and Constitution that you were supposed to take an oath to uphold , I have no choice , as a matter of law , but to depart from these proceedings now and not participate in them other than to object to them , which I have now done .
To do otherwise , to participate in any fashion in these invalid , unauthorized , unconstitutional , vicious proceedings , waives my objection to them and in fact validates them .
I will not do that because I am too good a lawyer to do that , having practiced law , Referee Tunis , in continuous good standing for 31 years , despite the efforts of the anti-Christian Florida
Bar that recruited you to do exactly what you have done like a good little soldier in your own little culture war on a man who protects the children you should be protecting .

Jesus said , " If any of you should cause one of these little ones to stumble , then it would be better for you that a millstone be tied around your neck and that you be cast into the uttermost depths of the sea . "
By perseverance and by God 's grace , I have fashioned a legal millstone that I will place around your neck and the neck of The Bar .
Do n't blame me , Referee Tunis , when you feel the water rising .

I have been invited to be one of four honorees this year in Utah at what is called America 's Freedom Festival .
I will ride with the other four honorees in a parade attended in the past by 250,000 folks lining the streets of Provo .
The petty hypocrisy by which you , a referee , seek to harm me cannot undo the blessing that awaits me , by God 's mercy and grace , in middle America a month from this day .
I attach the news release from the Freedom Festival so that you can see that I am being blessed because I have stood against The Bar , not in spite of that stand .
I have put myself in harm 's way , at the hands of harmful people like you , Referee Tunis , and in doing so I have " fought the good fight " to protect little ones who mean more to me than anything you think you can do to me .
You are the one who is out of touch , Ms. Tunis .
Senators Clinton and Obama have both warned the American people , specifically , of the danger posed by the Grand Theft Auto games .
The Blank Rome lawyers who protect this game want me disbarred because I dared to sound the alarm about Grand Theft Auto on CBS ' 60 Minutes before Senators Clinton and Obama followed my lead .
Now , in part because of my efforts , a recent poll shows that 65 % of the American people want a federal law to prohibit the sale of games like GTA to kids .
I am " guilty " of being right and ahead of the curve when it came to Howard Stern and as to Grand Theft Auto .
Because I took on Bar complainant , Al Cardenas , the Howard Stern Show is off terrestrial radio and his influence diminished .
Because I took on this cop-killing , woman - bashing video game , the Presidential race is now addressing the issue and this particular video game .

Try to get me disbarred .
Go ahead , do your worst , Referee Tunis .
I will continue to do my best .

Qwaq developing new fast Smalltalk VM 7 June , 2008
Eliot Miranda has posted some exciting news – he is working at Qwaq to develop Cog , a fast Smalltalk VM for Croquet .
The VM will dynamically compile Smalltalk bytecodes to machine code transparently to the programmer , and execute this machine code instead of interpreting bytecode .
He expects to have an initial release within a year which should execute pure Smalltalk code some 10 to 20 times faster than the current Squeak VM .
The new VM will be released under the Qwaq open source licence ( MIT - compatible ) .
Eliot will be posting notes on his progress and design decisions on his blog , and notes that the VM is to be released under the Qwaq open source licence .
He ’s looking to maintain compatability with the existing Croquet VM , Hydra , and Slang plugins .
His first post gives lots of interesting details of work done so far , and his future plans .
Eliot is a long - time Smalltalker , having worked on VisualWorks for many years with a focus on VM development , and has recently been working with Gilad Bracha at Cadence .
For thirteen centuries , between 1200 B.C. and the second century A.D. , the Jews lived in , and often ruled , the land of Israel .
The population was clustered mainly in Judaea , Samaria , and Galilee .
The Jews ’ dominion was long but not eternal .
The Romans invaded and , after suppressing revolts in A.D. 66-73 and 132-135 , killed or expelled much of the Jewish population and renamed the land Palaestina , for the Philistines who had lived along the southern seacoast .
After the conquest , some Jews stayed behind , and the faith of the Hebrews remained a religio licita , a tolerated religion , throughout the Roman Empire .

When Mark Twain visited in 1867 , his imagination soaked with the Biblical imagery of milk and honey , he discovered to his surprise “ a hopeless , dreary , heartbroken land . . . desolate and unlovely . ”
Jericho was “ accursed , ” Jerusalem “ a pauper village . ”
Twain ’s passages on Palestine in “ The Innocents Abroad ” have , over the decades , been exploited by propagandists to echo Lord Shaftesbury ’s notion that , before the return of the Jews to Zion , Palestine was a land without a people for a people without a land .
Twain and Shaftesbury , as it turned out , were hardly alone in failing to recognize a substantial Arab population in the Judaean hills and beyond .
And yet nineteenth - century Palestine certainly was desolate and impoverished .
The population in 1881 consisted of four hundred and fifty thousand Palestinian Arabs and twenty - five thousand Jews , nearly all of them ultra-Orthodox non-nationalists living in Jerusalem , Hebron , Safed , and Tiberias .
Palestine , despite its importance to the three monotheistic religions , was a political backwater .
The Ottomans divided the land into sanjaks , or districts , which were ruled from Constantinople , Damascus , and Beirut .
It was at this time , however , that European Jews — poor , mainly secular , and feeling the onset of an intensified anti-Semitism in their countries of origin — began to emigrate to Palestine .
This was the First Aliyah , or ascent .
Most European Jewish emigrants headed to North America and Great Britain , but some , in small numbers at first , sailed to Palestine .
The local Ottoman bureaucrats were strapped for cash , and the new arrivals had little problem obtaining entry rights , agricultural plots , and building permits .
This was colonialism not by conquering armies but by persistent real - estate transactions — and , when necessary , baksheesh .
The plans of the early Jewish settlers were unambiguous , even if they seemed , at the time , wholly incredible .
As one early Zionist , Ze ’ev Dubnow , wrote to his brother Simon , “ The ultimate goal . . . is , in time , to take over the Land of Israel and to restore to the Jews the political independence they have been deprived of for these two thousand years .
. . .
The Jews will yet arise and , arms in hand ( if need be ) , declare that they are the masters of their ancient homeland . ”
In the midst of this first wave of immigration , Zionism found its chief tribune , dreamer , and theorist in Theodor Herzl .
A mediocre playwright and the Paris correspondent for a liberal Viennese daily newspaper , Neue Freie Presse , Herzl witnessed the Dreyfus trial in 1894 and the appalling anti-Jewish demonstrations that followed .
In the four - volume “ History of Anti-Semitism , ” Léon Poliakov writes that in the last decades before the First World War it was “ hard to determine whether the French Jews or the German Jews were the more fervently patriotic . ”
But Herzl concluded that if anti-Semitism was as pervasive in the capitals of the European Enlightenment as it was in tsarist Russia there was no hope for assimilation .
He was thoroughly secular and had no real Jewish learning .
He spoke neither Yiddish nor Hebrew .
( Indeed , the pathos of his conversion to Zionism lay in his devotion both to Vienna and to German culture , and in the degree to which events in Europe would , with the rise of the Third Reich , surpass his darkest predictions . )
When Herzl published “ Der Judenstaat ” ( “ The Jewish State ” ) , in 1896 , the book seemed to most readers as utopian as Bacon ’s “ New Atlantis . ”
As portrayed in Amos Elon ’s wonderful 1975 biography , Herzl was an almost comically quixotic figure — the bearded café intellectual with his historical dreams travelling the world , trying ( and failing ) to win financial support from the Rothschilds and political support from the Kaiser and the Ottoman sultan .
And yet the Zionist movement , with Herzl at its center , took hold , and in 1897 , at the First Zionist Congress , in Basel , Switzerland , a motley collection of Jewish intellectuals and political activists voted to establish a Heimstätte , a “ publicly and legally secured home , ” for the Jews in Palestine .
Although the delegates surely had a sovereign state in mind , they were careful in these early days not to use such terms , so as not to alarm the Gentiles or offend any Jewish grandees who might eventually decide to fund their project .
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , the Palestinian Arabs identified themselves not as a unified people but as subjects of the Ottoman Empire and of the greater community of Islam ; their local identities were tied to their villages , clans , and families .
Resistance to the earliest wave of Jewish immigration was apparent , but it was polite compared to what came later .
In 1899 , the mayor of Jerusalem , Yusuf Dia al - Khalidi , wrote to Zadok Kahn , the chief rabbi of France , saying that the Zionist idea was in theory “ natural , fine , and just .
. . .
Who can challenge the rights of the Jews to Palestine ?
Good lord , historically it is really your country . ”
But , like other Palestinian notables , he opposed Jewish immigration , because the land was inhabited and resistance would inevitably follow .
“ In the name of God , let Palestine be left in peace , ” Khalidi wrote .
Rabbi Kahn passed the letter on to Herzl , who blithely wrote to Khalidi to reassure him that the Zionists , with their wealth , their skills , and their education , would build an economy to benefit both Arab and Jew .
As the flow of immigration increased , so did the resistance , especially with the end of the First World War and the beginning of British control over Palestine , in 1917 - 18 , and culminating in the 1936 - 39 Arab revolt against the Yishuv , the name for the pre-state Jewish community .
The resistance took the form of demonstrations ( some of them virulently anti-Semitic ) , riots , assaults , and bombings .
The Palestinian leadership became more and more radicalized , and small clandestine groups were formed .
In turn , radical Jewish factions and militias began to win support .
Where the Arabs were concerned , Herzl had been more oblivious than cruel .
But the leader of the Yishuv , David Ben-Gurion , recognized the us- or - them nature of the conflict ; he sensed the emotional force of his adversary ’s position even as he fought for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine .
Between 1931 and 1939 , as Jewish emigration mounted , the Arab majority declined from eighty - two per cent to seventy per cent .
“ What Arab can not do his math and understand that immigration at the rate of sixty thousand a year means a Jewish state in all of Palestine ? ” Ben -Gurion stated .
As he confessed years later to the Zionist Nahum Goldmann , “ Why should the Arabs make peace ? . . .
We have taken their country .
Sure , God promised it to us , but what does that matter to them ?
Our God is not theirs .
We come from Israel , it ’s true , but two thousand years ago , and what is that to them ? ”
Among Arab clerics , kings , and diplomats , the view of the Jews hardened into a maximalist politics , at once threatened and threatening .
In 1943 , when Franklin Roosevelt sent out feelers to King Ibn Sa’ud of Saudi Arabia to solve the Palestine situation , the King responded that he was “ prepared to receive anyone of any religion except ( repeat except ) a Jew . ”
In a letter to F.D.R. , he wrote , “ Palestine . . . has been an Arab country since the dawn of history and . . . was never inhabited by the Jews for more than a period of time , during which their history in the land was full of murder and cruelty . ”
In 1947 , Jordan ’s prime minister , Samir Rifa ’i , hardly the most radical politician in the region , told reporters , “ The Jews are a people to be feared .
. . .
Give them another twenty - five years and they will be all over the Middle East , in our country and Syria and Lebanon , in Iraq and Egypt. . . .
They were responsible for starting two world wars .
. . .
Yes , I have read and studied , and I know they were behind Hitler at the beginning of his movement . ”
What followed was a drama of redemptive , liberating settlement on one side and catastrophic dispossession on the other — all of it taking place on a patch of desert land too small for easy division and too imbued with historical and holy claims for rational negotiation .
For the Jews in Palestine , Zionism was a movement of national liberation after untold suffering ; for the Arabs , Zionism was an intolerable assault by the colonial West against sacred ground and Islam itself .
Even now , more than a century later , politicians and scholars alike quickly betray prejudices , passions , and allegiances in the details they select when relating the saga that led to the U.N. Partition Plan , on November 29 , 1947 , and the war that began just hours later .
In Soviet - era Russia , honest young men and women of academic inclination knew never to enter the field of modern history .
In order to live a scholarly life relatively free of cant and suppression , one studied Byzantine manuscripts , Mayan civilization , medieval Burma — anything that would safely skirt mention of one ’s own time and place .
In the new society of Israel , however noisily democratic , national history is inescapably political , too .
And , like any young nation , especially one born of conflict , Israel did not readily accept scholarly work that challenged its most cherished national myths .
Self - doubt , complexity , and reflection are not the modes of infancy ; in any country , mythmaking precedes documentary rigor .
For nearly forty years , Israeli histories and textbooks , with few exceptions , endorsed the notion that the more than seven hundred thousand Arabs who left Palestine as refugees in the years between 1947 and 1950 did so voluntarily or at the urging of their leaders .
This was a view echoed abroad by Leon Uris in his fantastically popular novel “ Exodus ” ; Uris writes of “ the absolutely documented fact that the Arab leaders wanted the civilian population to leave Palestine as a political issue and a military weapon . ”
In the late eighties , Israel encountered its first revisionist historians , a group of rigorous young scholars intent on seeing clearly the founding and development of the state , come what may .
At the head of that small and diverse movement was Benny Morris , a Sabra and a Cambridge - educated leftist , who , like Israel itself , was born in 1948 .
His latest book on that pivotal year of war and transformation , “ 1948 : A History of the First Arab - Israeli War ” ( Yale ; $ 32.50 ) , is a commanding , superbly documented , and fair - minded study of the events that , in the wake of the Holocaust , gave a sovereign home to one people and dispossessed another .
Remarkably , the book makes every attempt at depth and balance , even though its author has professed a “ cosmic pessimism ” about the current situation in the Middle East and has denounced the Palestinian leadership in the harshest terms imaginable .
Benny Morris ’s family emigrated from Britain in 1947 , and Morris grew up in the heart of a left - wing pioneering atmosphere .
As an infant , he lived on Kibbutz Yasur , which had been established in 1949 on the ruins of the Arab village of Al Birwa , where the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish lived before going into exile .
His father , Ya’akov Morris , was an Israeli diplomat and a published historian and poet .
In 1982 , Morris experienced Mena - chem Begin and Ariel Sharon ’s invasion of southern Lebanon , first as a correspondent for the Jerusalem Post , then as a soldier , when his division was called up and took part in the siege in West Beirut .
As a reporter , he visited Rashidiye , a Palestinian refugee camp near Tyre , and interviewed refugees who had lived in the town of Al Bassa , in Galilee .
When Morris returned home , he examined newly declassified papers in the Israel State Archive , along with documents in archives in the U.S. and Britain and at the United Nations .
( Arab governments have made available very little archival material on the period . )
His subject was the military conflict between the early Zionists and the Arabs and the subsequent exile of the Palestinians from their cities and towns .

In 1988 , Morris published “ The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem , 1947 - 1949 , ” which revolutionized Israeli historiography and , to a great extent , a nation ’s understanding of its own birth .
Relying less on testimony than on the newly available documents , Morris described how and why sixty per cent of the Palestinians were uprooted and their society destroyed .
It was a far more complex picture than many Israelis were prepared to accept .
The book features a map that shows three hundred and eighty - nine Arab villages , from upper Galilee to the Negev Desert .
Morris revealed that in forty - nine of these villages the indigenous Arabs were expelled by the Haganah and other Jewish military forces ; in sixty - two villages , the Arabs fled out of fear , having heard rumors of attacks and even massacres ; in six , the villagers left at the instruction of Palestinian local leaders .
The refugees , who probably expected to return to their homes in a matter of weeks or months , went to Gaza and the West Bank , and also to surrounding Arab countries — Lebanon , Jordan , Egypt , and Syria — where , to this day , they have never been fully absorbed .
Well , as predicted , the government backed down on its decision of ruling out the removal of head chief of security at the International Airport , and gave the decision up to the Lebanese National Army to decide on Hezbollahs ’ underground communications network , if it benefits the Lebanese people , and whether it truly secures the Lebanese resistance against Israel .
Someone had to back down .
Hezbollah came out with the upper hand , though at what expense this blogger asks ?
Hezbollah has lost a lot of credibility due to the usage of its arms on its own people , something the Lebanese feared the most .
Now it seems , their fear was not unfounded .
A lot has to be said for the 2009 elections .
I just hope the Lebanese will remember what happened these last 2 years when elections come around .
Hezbollah said it will remove it ’s forces from Beyrouth , while giving the Lebanese National Army the task of being the caretaker and restoring peace in the area .
An air of defeat hung over the Sunni areas .
“ The Shia have won , ” said one young man , in Tareeq Jedida area on the Sunni side of Corniche al - Mazra ’a “ They [ the Sunnis ] pay me $ 100 to fight , the Shia are fighting for their beliefs , and man , they have been fighting for 25 years , we ca n’t match them . “
BELGRADE ( Reuters ) - A Serb farmer used a grinding machine to cut in half his farm tools and machines to comply with a court ruling that he must share all his property with his ex-wife , local media reported on Thursday .
Branko Zivkov , 76 , told Belgrade daily Kurir he had been ready to give his wife Vukadinka her equal share of everything earned during their 45 - year marriage , but was furious at being asked to give away half his farming equipment .
Instead , he bought a grinder and cut in two all his tools , including large items such as cattle scales , a harrow and a sowing machine .
“ I still have n’t decided how to split the cow , ” he told the newspaper .
“ She should just say what she wants -- the part with the horns or the part with the tail . ”
The American political landscape has changed and I believe the change is permanent .
The two main political parties should be disbanded , because they are irrelevant .
Most Americans that do n’t make their living in politics see no great difference between the Democrats and the Republicans .
The issues that separate them no longer apply .
The Republican Party that once believed in smaller government and a smaller role in social programs while favoring business and States Rights ( A great departure from the party of Abraham Lincoln ) now believes in government interference in everything except the corporate bottom line .
The Democrats , once the party of the Middle Class and large scale involvement in social programs while defending the American taxpayer from corporate class - warfare is a thing of the past , both political parties and the people that comprise them ca n’t be recognizes from each other without a pundit telling us which side they are on .
There are two separate and distinct political views in our nation today .
They are not the Republican view or the Democratic ideas of government .
The two main schools of political thought in America today are the politicians that support involvement of big money and corporations to lead this nation , and the people that want a return to constitutional law and exclusion of multi-national stateless corporations in running the affairs of this country .
We may just as well call these two differing sets of people political caucuses .
In fact , the divide is so great that this country would be better off scraping the two political parties that dominate this nation and forming two parties that accurately reflect the political realities of today ’s political climate .
We could call these two differing parties the Corporatists and the Constitutionalists .
This would be a better way to differentiate the politicians that run for office , and make the process easier for the people of the United States .
To illustrate my point , let us take the current field of candidates and separate them not by the confusing labels of Democrats and Republicans which mean absolutely nothing in today ’s political reality , but separate them into the two political divisions I mentioned above .
It is apparent that the party lines would not only be drastically different , but it would also be much easier to differentiate these politicians by ideology .
Corporatists ; Biden , Dodd , Clinton , Obama , Romney , Guiliani , Tancredo , Huckabee , Thompson , McCain .
Hunter , Keyes
Constitutionalists : Kuchinich , Edwards , Richardson , Paul , Gravel

Driving less ?
More than two - thirds of car owners already are .
It 's a natural reflex to $ 50 - $ 70 tank fill - ups .
But US drivers may also know it 's time to pay a price to curb global warming .
That may be one reason they reject the campaign stunt of urging a holiday for the federal gas tax .
US politicians can't have it both ways .
Most seek the type of solutions for climate change that would raise energy costs , yet they are now trying to prevent the very kind of high pump prices that help drive conservation and green technology .
Next year , Democrats in Congress plan to pass antiglobal - warming measures that are sure to drive up consumer costs .
Rather than prevent $ 4 - a - gallon gas now , legislators should welcome it .
One courageous lawmaker , John Dingell ( D ) , who heads the House energy panel , even proposes a 50 - cent hike in the gas tax .
World oil markets are doing the US a favor by imposing a form of tax that challenges energy profligacy and disregard for the planet 's future .
A gas price threshold has now been reached to influence behavior .
SUV sales are down .
Mass transit ridership and carpooling are up .
More people want to live closer to work .
What do these lifestyle - altering trends signal ?
That Congress must impose a " carbon " tax on fossil - fuel use , from electric utilities to home furnaces to gas - guzzling vehicles .
Such a tax is a better tool than the alternative favored in Congress : a " cap and trade " system that would force only industries to curb greenhouse gases while allowing cleaner companies to sell permits to more polluting ones .
The system is complex , inflexible , and easily abused .
A carbon tax ( with progressive rebates for the poor ) would directly make lawmakers accountable for taking action on global warming , while providing revenue for innovation in clean energy .
In a February report , the Congressional Budget Office found a carbon tax would be five times more effective in reducing carbon emissions than a cap - and - trade market .
Is there a model for a carbon tax ?
Yes , Sweden has had one since 1991 .
While it has not been perfectly implemented , the Nordic nation of 9.2 million people has seen a 9 percent drop in carbon dioxide emissions – more than required under the Kyoto treaty – while maintaining a healthy economy and becoming a " clean tech " leader .
A German environmental group finds Sweden has done the most of all countries to protect the climate .
It also helps that the country relies on nuclear and hydro power for all its electricity .
Sweden , of course , has done more than simply tax fossil fuel .
It 's created bicycle lanes , encouraged " green " cars and buses , favored heat pumps over oil furnaces , put a toll on driving in Stockholm , and invested in renewable energies and recycling of waste heat , among other steps .
The government now taxes vehicles based on carbon dioxide emissions rather than weight , helping Sweden become the leader in Europe in reducing carbon emissions from new cars .
The initial reason for a carbon tax was Sweden 's dependency on imported fossil fuel .
Now its success in improving national energy security has made it a global model for achieving climate security .
Most of all , Swedes still welcome the tax .
Americans can accept a similar sacrifice rather than trying to roll back prices at the pump .

Designer Ben Wilson has produced a monowheel - a cycle where the rider sits inside a large , spokeless wheel .
The cycle was commissioned for the XXIst Century Man exhibition at 21_21 Design Sight in Tokyo .
" As part of the exhibition the 21st century man ( showing at 21 - 21 tokyo midtown until july ) I was comissioned to create a new piece of work , " says Wilson .
" Ever since cycling for the first time without stablisers I have been fascinated by human propulsion .
Over the years the myth of the monowheel has become an equal fascination . "
" Since the 1860s many patents have been filed in the monowheel 's name and today there are even rumors of a production monowheel in China , but as it stands there is nothing currently available .
As we could n’t buy a monowheel we made one . "
" We do n 't suggest for one moment that a functioning human powered monowheel could ever provide an improvement on the modern bicycle .
Instead its value comes from the discourse and ideas generated as a result of this research . "

Records of the National Park Service
View of Valley from Mountain , " Canyon de Chelly " National Monument , Arizona View in National Archives Catalog
In 1941 the National Park Service commissioned noted photographer Ansel Adams to create a photo mural for the Department of the Interior Building in Washington , DC .
The theme was to be nature as exemplified and protected in the U.S. National Parks .
The project was halted because of World War II and never resumed .
The holdings of the National Archives Still Picture Branch include 226 photographs taken for this project , most of them signed and captioned by Adams .
They were taken at the Grand Canyon , Grand Teton , Kings Canyon , Mesa Verde , Rocky Mountain , Yellowstone , Yosemite , Carlsbad Caverns , Glacier , and Zion National Parks ; Death Valley , Saguaro , and Canyon de Chelly National Monuments .
Other pictures were taken at the Boulder Dam ; Acoma Pueblo , NM ; San Idelfonso , NM ; Taos Pueblo , NM ; Tuba City , AZ ; Walpi , AZ ; and Owens Valley , CA .
Many of the latter locations show Navajo and Pueblo Indians , their homes and activities .
The Kings Canyon photographs were taken in 1936 when the establishment of the park was being proposed .
These prints were added by Adams to the mural project .
The one photograph of Yosemite was a gift from Adams to the head of the Park Service , Horace Albright , in 1933 .
In addition , there are eight photographs taken by Adams of Yosemite in the General Photographic Files of the National Park Service .
These photos may still be under copyright protection .

The invitation list is typical of the star - studded soirees that have placed Elisabeth Murdoch at the pinnacle of London 's most glamorous party circuit .
Later this month , the Oscar - winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow will rub shoulders at Ms Murdoch 's home with , among others , a Swedish heiress , the fashion director of Vanity Fair and the River Café co-founder Ruthie Rogers .
But what may seem just another gathering of the capital 's mid-Atlantic glitterati at the Notting Hill house that Ms Murdoch shares with her husband , Matthew Freud , the PR guru , was given global political significance yesterday when it was announced that the occasion in question is a fundraiser for Barack Obama , with attendees paying up to $ 2,300 ( £ 1,160 ) each into the American presidential candidate 's campaign fund .
The fact that the host for the event is the second daughter of Rupert Murdoch provoked immediate excitement on the other side of the Atlantic , where the political favour of the 77 - year - old media mogul and his dynasty has long been a subject of debate .
The New York Times declared yesterday that the London social event offered " possible clues to Hillary Clinton 's Murdoch status " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Until recently , it had been assumed that Mr Murdoch had conferred his favour on Mrs Clinton after he organised a fundraiser for her , and his New York Post newspaper endorsed Mr Obama 's rival for the Democrat candidacy for a second term as New York State Senator in 2006 .
The rapprochement between the magnate and the former first lady seemed complete last year when he made a donation to her campaign .
His son James also gave $ 3,450 to Mrs Clinton .
But now it seems the Murdoch political wind has decisively changed direction .
The New York Post has been a harsh critic of Mrs Clinton throughout her campaign and now , to add insult to injury , one of the stars of the Murdoch clan , who holds both American and British citizenship , is acting as transatlantic cheerleader for the Democrat frontrunner .
The list of confirmed attendees for the Elisabeth Murdoch gathering on 28 April reads , predictably , like a roll call of London 's Anglo - American movers and shakers , with film stars and a speechwriter for the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan jostling for space alongside investment fund managers and property developers .
A flyer for the Obama fundraiser names Ms Murdoch , the woman once declared the world 's most powerful blonde by Tatler magazine as one of 12 " event chairs " alongside Ms Paltrow , Ruthie Rogers and Cristina Stenbeck , a leading Swedish businesswoman and heiress .
A list of 20 " event hosts " includes Kay Saatchi , the ex-wife of the art mogul Charles Saatchi , Joanna Shields , the president of the social networking website Bebo , Elizabeth Saltzman Walker , the fashion director of Vanity Fair , and David Blood , who runs an investment fund with the Nobel Prize - winning former US vice - president Al Gore .
Potential guests , who are warned " RSVP required – space is limited " , are invited to pay the $ 2,300 fee to attend a " VIP reception " , or $ 1,000 to appear at the main reception an hour later .
Anyone hoping to attend who does not hold an American passport will be disappointed because only US citizens can contribute to a presidential campaign .
The key role of Ms Murdoch , 39 , in the event will cement her growing importance as a public and business figure .
Her Shine television production company recently became one of Britain 's most influential " super indies " after it acquired three rivals including Kudos , the maker of Spooks and Life On Mars , and Reveille , the American company behind Ugly Betty and the US version of The Office .
But last night , those close to the burgeoning entrepreneur played down any wider significance to her support for Mr Obama .
Speaking from his yacht in the Caribbean , Mr Freud told The New York Times : " I do n't think you can interpret the event as anything other than she is enthusiastic about Obama 's campaign . "
Raided counsel 's office shut down investigation into Siegelman case Associated Press
Published : Thursday May 8 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The U.S. Office of Special Counsel Scott Bloch -- whose home and office were recently raided by the FBI -- last year shut down a previously undisclosed investigation into the federal prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , according to an internal memo made public Wednesday .
The investigation was being conducted by a task force formed at the agency a year ago to pursue high - profile political investigations in Washington , most notably whether the White House played politics in firing U.S. attorneys .
It began gathering information on the Siegelman case in September and was planning to request documents from the Justice Department in October before Special Counsel Scott Bloch ordered the case closed , according to the Jan. 18 draft memo , made public by the Project on Government Oversight , a watchdog group .
RAW STORY 's David Edwards has a video of the FBI 's raid here .
The investigation was one of many that the task force had taken up , and the memo shows that Bloch frequently differed with investigators about which cases to pursue .
For example , he asked the task force to broaden its investigations into the fired prosecutors and into whether federal agencies received political briefings from the White House to boost GOP electoral fortunes .
But he shut down an investigation into whether the Justice Department was hinging its hiring decisions on job applicants ' political affiliations .
An attorney for Bloch , who himself is under a federal investigation , declined comment .
But a person familiar with the origins of the POGO draft document said the decision to not pursue Siegelman or other cases stemmed mostly from a shortage of time and resources .
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation .
Siegelman , a Democrat , said the memo suggests further political interference in his case and reiterated his call for the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to take up the matter .
" The question is who told them to shut it down , " Siegelman said Wednesday when told of the memo .
" Why would you start an investigation and let it proceed and then shut it down ?
The logical conclusion is that somebody intervened and told them to shut down the investigation . "
Siegelman has long claimed that Republicans engineered his prosecution on bribery and other corruption charges to kill his chances for re-election , a claim repeatedly denied by federal prosecutors .
His attorneys requested earlier this year that the Justice Department appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether White House appointees in Washington , including former Bush adviser Karl Rove , influenced the case .
Rove also has denied any involvement .
The Special Counsel 's office is an independent agency charged with investigating unlawful political activity by government employees and ensuring that government whistle - blowers are not subjected to reprisals .
The January memo is a summary of the task force 's activities and recommendations since it was formed in May 2007 .
It says investigators expressed concerns about closing the Siegelman investigation before completing it .
But the task force was " directed to not further investigate this case and to wait for further instructions . "
The memo says the task force still considered the case open and was requesting authorization to continue .
" I 'm stunned by all this , " said Vince Kilborn , one of the former governor 's attorneys .
" If an ongoing government investigation was shut down , I would say it 's potential obstruction of justice . "
FBI agents raided the office and Bloch 's home this week in an investigation into whether he destroyed evidence potentially showing he retaliated against staffers who opposed his policies .
Siegelman , who served one term as governor after being elected in 1998 , was convicted in 2006 on bribery and other charges and sentenced to more than seven years in prison .
He was recently released on bond pending appeal .
Associated Press writer Lara Jakes Jordan contributed to this report .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Robert Rubin said the weak dollar , caused by unsound Bush administration fiscal policy , has now got to be a factor in the Federal Reserve 's thinking about how low it can cut rates to spur economic growth in coming months .
Rubin said the Bush administration 's " unsound fiscal regime " has hurt the dollar and this has created the " additional problem " for the Fed .
" It is there as an issue they have to face , " Rubin , who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration and is now chairman of the board of directors at Citigroup , said in an interview with MarketWatch after speaking at a forum at the National Press Club .
Rubin stressed he had " no knowledge " about how much weight Fed officials put on the dollar in their closed - door discussions .
" The dollar certainly has been soft , " he said .
During his tenure in Washington , Rubin was a firm believer in a strong - dollar policy .
While he was Treasury Secretary he repeated the phrase " the U.S. supports a strong dollar " so many times that even former Fed chief Alan Greenspan wrote in his autobiography that he got sick of it .
Urges more regulation of derivatives
Asked for the views on the origins of the financial market turmoil , Rubin said it was a " confluence " of a series of events that no one foresaw .
A 3 - 4 year period where the markets under priced risk , some unsound financial engineering that created AAA rated complex securities and a large increase in housing prices " all came together , " he said .
It has been much broader and lasted much longer than anyone imagined , he said .
Asked when the crisis might subside , Rubin replied : " I have no idea . "
He said there should n't be " any let up " by economic policymakers working on solving the crisis .
Rubin repeated his earlier call for some margin requirements or capital requirements for complex derivative products .
Globalization of U.S. politics
During the session , Rubin said the global economy will be greatly affected by what direction the U.S. moves in politically over the next year or so .
He said he did n't have any idea of the direction at the moment .
Looking at the big picture , Rubin said that " the whole architecture " of the post - War global economy might need to be changed to take into account the rising power of India and China .
The current system of trade imbalances and rising food and oil prices " just does n't work , " he said .
" We need an architecture that respects modern circumstances , " he said .
It is frustrating that these ideas are not part of the debate over who should be the next president , he said .
" When you think how much time it would take to go down all the lanes , and the miles we would have to travel , we have to look at the most effective system that can be introduced at tax payers ' expense , " he said .
The life of Windows XP has been extended twice before Microsoft has given another lease of life to Windows XP only days before PC makers have to stop selling it .
Windows XP reaches its end of life on 30 June but Microsoft has now said it can continue being sold until June 2010 but only on cheap desktops .
The decision follows one made in April to extend the life of XP on low cost laptops until the same date .
It comes as Dell , HP and Lenovo exploit loopholes in Microsoft 's licensing terms to keep putting XP on machines .
Growing market
In an announcement at the Computex trade show in Taiwan , Microsoft said the decision was prompted by customers asking for the software to be put on low cost desktops .
Industry experts believe the decision is also motivated by the fact that low cost machines cannot run Windows Vista - the newest version of the operating system .
They also say that many of the low cost laptops run Linux - an open source rival to Microsoft 's operating system .
Low cost laptops , such as the Asus Eee PC , have proved hugely popular .
Research firm IDC predicts that sales of ultra low - cost notebooks , will reach nine million units in 2012 .
The extension Microsoft granted to XP for these low cost laptops , or netbooks , covered machines that have no more than 1GB of RAM ; a hard drive up to 80 GB in size ; a processor running no faster than 1GHz ; a screen no larger than 10.2in ( 25 cm ) and no touch screen .
So far Microsoft has laid down no specifications for the low cost desktops , called nettops , but it said it was working with 20 PC makers on these machines .
The terms of Microsoft 's licensing arrangements with PC makers dictate that they must stop offering XP as an option on new machines after 30 June .
Many PC makers have flouted this cut off by shipping machines running certain versions of Vista with a " downgrade licence " that lets customers revert to the older operating system .

What are these ?
Bankers and housing market analysts are warning of a chilling new trend in the mortgage world : homeowners voluntarily defaulting on their loans even though they can afford to make the payments .
It ’s known colloquially as “ walking away , ” or more jocularly as “ jingle mail , ” for the sound your house keys supposedly make when you mail them back to your bank .
It ’s a way of saying that Americans are beginning to apply a cold financial calculation to home ownership :
When a home ’s value has fallen below what is owed on its mortgage , they think it makes no sense to keep up the payments .
“ That is going on , clearly , and there ’s lots of evidence of that in the market , ” Donald K. Truslow , senior executive vice president of Wachovia Corp. , said in a conference call with investors last month .

A few weeks earlier , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson had waggled a stern finger at homeowners contemplating walking away from affordable mortgages :
Do that , and you ’re no better than a “ speculator , ” he said .
Elsewhere , media reports and Internet postings are rife with stories about the trend and a supposed sea change in American attitudes toward debt .
But there ’s a major problem with all this talk about the phenomenon of solvent homeowners walking away :
There does n’t appear to be any hard evidence that it ’s actually happening .
‘ Hard to quantify ’
Advertisement
When pressed for the number of walkaways who could afford their mortgage payments , major banks and lender groups could not produce figures .
Nor could the Mortgage Bankers Assn. , the leading trade group for housing lenders .
Truslow acknowledged during the conference call April 14 that walkaways were “ hard to quantify . ”
A Wachovia spokesman said this week that “ we have heard anecdotally that people are walking away ” but that the bank had no hard numbers .
Bank of America Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth D. Lewis , whose company is acquiring mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. , complained about “ a change in social attitudes toward default ” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in December .
In response to questions from The Times , Bank of America spokesman Terry Francisco said the bank had seen indications that some homeowners were taking pains to keep their credit card accounts current at the expense of their mortgage balances , often by raiding their home equity lines to pay their cards , a reversal of traditional customer priorities .

But he said the bank did not have “ firm figures ” on how many homeowners were unnecessarily defaulting on their mortgages .
Others suggest that it may be impossible to find out .
“ How would you know what someone ’s true ability to pay would be ? ” asked Todd Sinai , an associate professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School .
“ I ’m not sure you could even come up with a definition . ”
At Fannie Mae , the government - chartered company that owns or guarantees billions of dollars in home mortgages , Senior Vice President Marianne Sullivan conceded that there was growing “ folklore ” about residential walkaways and said that the phenomenon was more likely connected to investors than people who live in their homes , or “ owner-occupants . ”

“ The vast majority of borrowers , we find , have been acting in good faith , ” she said .
“ If they get behind , they are interested in working with their lender . ”
Bruce Marks , chief executive of Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America , a Boston - based nonprofit agency that helps strapped homeowners , said that the notion that legions of borrowers are deciding not to pay is an “ urban myth ” that largely reflects the mortgage industry ’s desire to blame homeowners , rather than lenders , for the surge in problem loans .
Shifting the blame
Marks and others assert that mortgage bankers have an incentive to blame the rise in delinquencies and foreclosures on borrowers skipping out on obligations they ’re financially able to meet , because that diverts attention from the lenders ’ role in the mortgage crisis .

“ So many of the loans made were irresponsible -- for the borrowers and for the lenders , ” said Kurt Eggert , an expert on predatory lending at Chapman University School of Law in Orange County .
“ Lenders have an interest in painting themselves as responsible , even caring entities .
They want to cast blame for the sub - prime meltdown as much as possible on their borrowers . ”
It is generally agreed that the real culprit in the meltdown is the proliferation of exotic mortgages that hit borrowers -- many with paltry down payments , and therefore almost no home equity -- with huge payment shocks in the early years of the loan .
The new payments are often raised to levels that borrowers could never have afforded but expected to escape via refinancing or the sale of the house in a rising market .
When home values fell instead , their exit strategy evaporated .
Experts say that some supposed owner - occupants who are walking away may , in fact , be speculators in disguise : buyers who acquired properties as investments to resell for a fast profit .
Investors , unlike genuine homeowners , will treat their purchases strictly as economic transactions .
Advertisement
Their decision to abandon payments should n’t be seen as a sign that American homeowners no longer feel obligated to pay their debts , said Stuart Gabriel , director of the Ziman Center for Real Estate at UCLA ’s Anderson School of Management .
“ A number of [ foreclosed ] properties are actually investor - owned , not owner - occupied , and we have to be careful that we ’re not attributing to homeowners the actions of investors , ” he said .
Predictable behavior
Sinai , of the Wharton School , pointed out that homeowners have long been known to do whatever it takes to avoid foreclosure .
They ’re concerned about maintaining their credit ratings and building equity in their homes , and they ’re typically invested not only in their properties but in their communities .
Advertisement
Historically , owner - occupants did n’t default on their mortgages except under extraordinary circumstances , such as death , divorce , illness or job loss .
Their predictable behavior helped keep mortgage rates low .
“ If it ’s correct that there ’s a change in behavior , all the default and credit risk models will have to be recalibrated , ” Gabriel said .
But , he added , “ I have not seen one shred of data that conclusively or systematically speaks to that point . ”
One source of walkaway “ folklore ” may be services that purport to help homeowners skip out on their mortgages without long - term harm to their credit ratings .
Among them is San Diego - based You Walk Away , which launched a website in January offering to help homeowners “ unshackle yourself from a losing investment and . . . Walk Away . ”
Advertisement
Co-founder Jon Maddux acknowledged in an interview , however , that the firm ’s typical clients are people facing genuine financial stress , because they either cannot make their current mortgage payments or know that an upcoming interest - rate jump will make default all but inevitable .
“ We do have a lot of people who cry to us on the phone , ” he said .
“ They ’re under stress and do n’t know what to do .
A lot of these people should never have got the house . ”

Putin secretly divorces his wife and marries rhythmical gymnast Alina Kabaeva ?
A recent issue of Italy ’s La Repubblica newspaper said that Russia ’s outgoing President Vladimir Putin was going to marry a girl who is 30 years younger .
Furthermore , the newspaper wrote that Putin secretly divorced his wife , Lyudmila Putin , in February of the current year .
With reference to rumours , La Repubblica wrote that Putin was going to remarry on June 15 , Whit Sunday .
Putin secretly divorces his wife and marries rhythmical gymnast Alina Kabaeva ?
His new wife will be Alina Kabaeva , the rhythmic gymnast , who won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics and obtained numerous European awards , the newspaper said .
According to the newspaper , “ Russians consider Kabaeva to be sexier than Sharapova and Kournikova . ”
After the Olympic Games in Athens Kabaeva gave up sport ( read article ) and decided to try her hand at cinema .
La Repubblica underlined the authenticity of the news .
According to the newspaper , “ Putin divorced his wife in a St. Petersburg registry office . ”
The only disclaimer was voiced by Kabaeva ’s press secretary , but it sounded so unconvincing as if it had been motivated by fear to unlock some mystery , since Putin still remains the most powerful personality in Russia .
Also read : Alina Kabaeva tops the list of Russia 's most popular athletes
The newspaper concluded that Putin ’s plan concerning Kabaeva had been implemented long ago : Kabaeva became deputy head of the State Duma Committee on Youth Affairs and chaired the supervisory board of the National Media Group - Russia ’s new media - holding owned by Yury Kovalchuk , who is a close friend of Putin’s .
It was not incidental that Russia ’s state - run TV channels and newspapers highlighted the story of Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni – their story is similar .
Russian , Italian and French blogs have been inundated with comments on the allegedly forthcoming wedding of Putin and Kabaeva , Moskovsky Correspondent newspaper wrote with reference to a Moscow - based company that specializes in organizing solemn events .
A tender for organizing this wedding has been reportedly announced .
The wedding is due on June 15 .

The Moskovsky Correspondent article dedicated to the forthcoming wedding of Putin and Kabaeva was published on April 11 and received an extensive coverage in the European media .
Italy ’s La Repubblica , Poland ’s Wyborcza and Austria ’s Die Presse have already covered the story with numerous pictures of Alina Kabaeva .
The most abstract article on the topic was posted on the website of Germany ’s Der Spiegel : “ No matter what she touches - a mace , hoops or the fate of Russia ’s youth , the 24 - year - old Olympic champion always astonished people with her ideal elegance and sports achievements .
Russians extol her enormously .
Now Moscow is visibly agitated about the widely rumoured wedding .
It was the day when Putin agreed to lead United Russia .
Before that the president ’s personal life was kept secret , but now it hit the headlines .
The former KGB spy allegedly divorced his wife and is going to marry the young athlete .
The wedding is due on June 15 in the Konstantin Palace in St Petersburg ’s suburb of Strelna . ”
In an interview with Spiegel Online , the Moscow - based event - organizing company Karnaval - Stil ( Carnival - Style ) , which was mentioned in the above - mentioned article , disclaimed its involvement in the organization of Putin ’s wedding .
“ We learnt it from the Internet as well as you did , ” stated the company ’s Director Sergey Tylkin .
“ We would be greatly honoured to organize such a wedding , but it absolutely nonsensical . ”
Meanwhile , the Kremlin declined any comments .
Alina Kabaeva ’s spokesman refuted any allegations of the wedding .

Ma , a 42 years old farmer in China recently build a simply solar water heater from beer bottles as a gift to his mother .
This heater only cost about twenty dollars and three days labor .
Now this simply water heater is expanding within the village and more rural elderly people are benefiting from it .
Ma 's long goal is to promote this device into more rural areas in China .

Barack Obama 's Senior Foreign Policy Advisor Susan Rice appeared on Friday 's Morning Joe to discuss foreign policy , and more specifically North Korea 's destruction of a long - defunct nuclear cooling tower yesterday .
The Scar thought this was a huge diplomatic victory for George Bush , but Rice sets him straight , reminding him that North Korea 's nuclear program expanded by leaps and bounds under Bush 's watch and that if he would have opened negotiations years earlier , much of this could have been avoided in the first place .
Joe pretends to be a middle of the road kind of guy , but when he gets punked , especially by a Democrat , it drives him crazy and his true , far - right colors always come through .
As Rice goes down the laundry list of Bush failures , Joe gets snippy with her , and even stoops so low as to hurl an insult at Jimmy Carter in the process .
NBC's David Gregory chimes in at the end of the segment and drops a question on Rice that was pulled directly from Karl Rove 's playbook :
Gregory : " Hello , Susan .
While we are talking about the prospect of nuclear terrorism , which is what is behind the concerns of North Korea and Iran .
I have a broader question for you and really for Senator Obama .
Why is it , does he believe that America has not been attacked in this country by terrorists since 9/11 ?
And does George W. Bush , President Bush deserve credit for that ? "
Rice : " I think what we have to acknowledge , David , that we have n't been attacked but we are nonetheless less safe as a sequence of the policies of this administration has pursued .
Our standing in the world is at an all - time low .
Al Qaeda is more dangerous now in Afghanistan and Pakistan than it has been .
Our intelligence community is warning they are reconstituting and more deadly to U.S. forces than Iraq . "
Of course , Gregory is incorrect , there HAS been a deadly terrorist attack in the U.S. since 9/11 -- the anthrax attacks that killed 5 Americans ring a bell to you ?
It 's interesting that so many seem to forget this factoid .
Speaking of anthrax and Bush failures , you 'll be happy to learn that $ 5.8 million of your tax dollars were just awarded to Steven Hatfill in his lawsuit against the Bush Justice Department .
Hatfill is an Army scientist who was deemed a " Person of Interest " in the anthrax attacks , but was eventually ruled out as a suspect in the Bush administration 's botched investigation .
Hatfill 's lawyer placed partial blame on the media for not questioning the Bush administration 's motives in targeting him and for reporting leaked disinformation they could not substantiate .
A Culture of Lawlessness Russia 's Raiders
Companies are paying public officials to raid the offices of business rivals and subject them to criminal investigations .
Von Jason Bush
At some point the business sector realized the best way to take advantage of consumers was to use default options that make them spend money .
A default option works because it creates an automatic decision by the consumer doing nothing .
And doing nothing is the path of least resistance for time - poor consumers struggling to balance the many difficult responsibilities associated with work , family , maintaining financial security , and coping with stresses on their health .
Consider , for example , the endless advertisements that offer a free sample or trial for a product , such as some nonprescription medication or vitamin supplement .
It may be a free week ’s or month ’s worth of product .
But the find print is that you will automatically be enrolled in a program that mails you a monthly supply and bills your credit card .
There probably will be some opportunity for you to cancel or opt out of this program , but doing so will require some significant effort by mail or phone that most consumers will not find the time or energy to execute .
No , the easy way is to just let the default option control your cost , even if you were not especially impressed with the trial use of the product .
The same thing often happens with free trials for a magazine or some email publication .
If consumers were given a truly free choice they would have the opportunity to explicitly decide to buy a product that they tried or do nothing and have no future cost .
This is the way it used to be before companies discovered the tyranny of coercive default options .
Even today , when you are in a store and take a sample of food or some other product you have the freedom to walk away with no future cost or to decide to buy the product .
Not so , however , with almost all “ free ” offers coming by way of newspaper and magazine ads , or the mail or Internet .
We should be sensitive to the ugly reality that there are many consumers who simply do not comprehend all the consequences of product default options .
The principal example being elderly and ill Americans that may have some reduced intellectual or cognitive capabilities .
Younger consumers and overly busy ones can also fail to appreciate default options .
Millions of people are vulnerable to slick “ free ” offers that cleverly hide or disguise costly default options .
Governments can also use default options .
The power of default options was recently illustrated by a study of how the rates of organ donation consent vary among nations .
In the US where the default option is a negative decision ( you must positively declare your organ donation consent ) , the rate is 28 percent and is somewhat similar in other countries using that default option , including 17 percent in the United Kingdom and 12 percent in Germany .
But in nations where the default option is a positive decision for organ donation the rates are consistently very high , including nearly 100 percent in France , Austria and Hungry .
This huge national difference was explained by University of Chicago behavioral economist Richard Thaler : “ God made us lazy and busy and prone to inertia . ”
Another example pertains to employers .
When new workers are told that retirement accounts will automatically be started for them , unless they intentionally opt out ( a positive default option ) , most gladly sign up .
In contrast , if new hires are informed that such accounts will not be started unless they opt in ( a negative default option ) , most do not sign up .
These two examples show the positive use of default options for the good of people and society .
This is not the case for consumer products .
People should always question “ free ” offers .
Always ask yourself “ Is there a costly default choice that will hit me ? ”
Such a default choice is really no choice at all .
Companies should not be free to deny us of real free choice when it comes to purchases .
Before you tie 'em , you have to lace 'em — and you can choose from among 43,200 perfectly legitimate ways to do it .
A smart stringing strategy can actually improve your game , sportswise and otherwise , so Wired turned to Professor Shoelace ( aka Ian Fieggen , an Australian programmer with a lace permutation fetish ) for a rundown of the ins and outs .
Here are four techniques to help your kicks kick ass .
— Mathew Honan
1 ) Runner 's stitch
Are your dogs yapping after a jog ?
This method alleviates pressure points inside the sneaker to give your pups some breathing room .
Start with a horizontal lace across the bottom eyelets .
Go straight up and emerge from the second set , cross over to the third , and go up to the fourth .
Repeat .
2 ) Hacky weave Popular in footbag circles , this method opens up the front of the shoe so there 's more room to " catch " a hacky sack .
Lace across the third eyelets , then dive into the second and emerge from the first .
Now run the laces up , into the fourth eyelets .
From there , crisscross to the top .
3 ) Skater special
We 're talking ice skating , not skateboarding .
To keep the instep tighter than the upper half of the boot , lace normally to the ankle at the desired pressure , then tie a square knot ( right over left , left over right ) and continue crisscrossing up the calf .
4 ) Two - tone tie
This one 's pure fashion statement .
You 'll need two laces of different colors .
String the first one across the bottom eyelets :
Tuck the left end into the shoe ; thread the right side through the second eyelet , then across to the opposite side , and repeat to the top .
Now take the second lace and weave it through the first from bottom to top and back down .
Weave until you run out of room .
Then stuff the loose ends into comfortable spots inside the shoe .
Kick it with your posse .
How to : Memorize a 20 - Digit Number
Think beyond the killer party - trick potential : Imagine you had to learn and repeat two phone numbers quickly — in , say , 20 seconds or less .
Memory guru Ron
White can .
Here 's his basic technique :
Prep Assign a visual mnemonic to each of the digits 09 ( e.g. , Kevin Bacon = 6 ) .
Then create a mental filing system :
Take a walk around the block and pick out 20 objects in the order you encounter them .
Each represents a " folder . "
( Note : You can reuse your mnemonics and folders with any number . )
Learn
To memorize 20 digits , replay the walk in your head .
As you pass each object , " file " a digit by creating a mental image of its mnemonic at that spot — if the third digit is 6 and the third object is a bus stop , you might envision Mr. Bacon getting footloose at the bus stop .
Recite
To recall the whole number , simply repeat the mental trip around the block , pulling each digit from its folder as you go .

How to : Get Bought by Google
In October , Google bumped its 2007 acquisition tally to 15 .
But do n't fret — there 's plenty of change left in the Googleplex sofas .
To get on the radar : Take chances YouTube got huge by flouting copyrights .
Lawsuits were inevitable , but so was Google 's $ 1.65 billion offer .
Fill a void Blogger , Writely , and FeedBurner made Google a power player in their respective markets for under $ 150 million total .
In B - school , that 's called ROI ; in Silicon Valley , it 's called Tuesday .
Be a threat When DoubleClick got sniffs from Microsoft , Google shelled out $ 3.1 billion to protect its stranglehold on the digital ad industry .

Neuroscience researchers at the Duke - NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore have shown for the first time what happens to the visual perceptions of healthy but sleep - deprived volunteers who fight to stay awake , like people who try to drive through the night .
The scientists found that even after sleep deprivation , people had periods of near - normal brain function in which they could finish tasks quickly .
However , this normalcy mixed with periods of slow response and severe drops in visual processing and attention , according to their paper , published in the Journal of Neuroscience on May 21 .
“ Interestingly , the team found that a sleep - deprived brain can normally process simple visuals , like flashing checkerboards .
But the ‘ higher visual areas ’ – those that are responsible for making sense of what we see – did n’t function well , ” said Dr. Michael Chee , lead author and professor at the Neurobehavioral Disorders Program at Duke - NUS .
“ Herein lies the peril of sleep deprivation . ”
The research team , including colleagues at the University of Michigan and University of Pennsylvania , used magnetic resonance imaging to measure blood flow in the brain during speedy normal responses and slow “ lapse ” responses .
The study was funded by grants from the DSO National Laboratories in Singapore , the National Institutes of Health , the National Institute on Drug Abuse , the NASA Commercialization Center , and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research .
Study subjects were asked to identify letters flashing briefly in front of them .
They saw either a large H or S , and each was made up of smaller Hs or Ss.
Sometimes the large letter matched the smaller letters ; sometimes they did n't .
Scientists asked the volunteers to identify either the smaller or the larger letters by pushing one of two buttons .
During slow responses , sleep - deprived volunteers had dramatic decreases in their higher visual cortex activity .
At the same time , as expected , their frontal and parietal ‘ control regions ’ were less able to make their usual corrections .
Scientists also could see brief failures in the control regions during the rare lapses that volunteers had after a normal night ’s sleep .
However , the failures in visual processing were specific only to lapses that occurred during sleep deprivation .
The scientists theorize that this sputtering along of cognition during sleep deprivation shows the competing effects of trying to stay awake while the brain is shutting things down for sleep .
The brain ordinarily becomes less responsive to sensory stimuli during sleep , Chee said .
This study has implications for a whole range of people who have to struggle through night work , from truckers to on - call doctors .
“ The periods of apparently normal functioning could give a false sense of competency and security when in fact , the brain ’s inconsistency could have dire consequences , ” Chee said .
“ The study task appeared simple , but as we showed in previous work , you ca n’t effectively memorize or process what you see if your brain is n’t capturing that information , ” Chee said .
“ The next step in our work is to see what we might do to improve things , besides just offering coffee , now that we have a better idea where the weak links in the system are . ”

Democrats on both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees should take note of Chairman Leahy 's opposition ( via e-mail ) :
" After months of negotiations , the legislation unveiled today to replace the so - called Protect America Act , which Republicans refused to extend , is not a bill I can support .
I have said since the beginning of this debate that I would oppose a bill that did not provide accountability for this administration ’s six years of illegal , warrantless wiretapping .
This bill would dismiss ongoing cases against the telecommunications carriers that participated in that program without allowing a judicial review of the legality of the program .
Therefore , it lacks accountability measures that I believe are crucial .
My interest is not in harming telecommunications carriers .
I would have supported indemnification by the government or substitution of the government for them in these lawsuits .
But for me , there must be accountability .... " [ emphasis mine ]
Sen . Feingold :
" The proposed FISA deal is not a compromise ; it is a capitulation .
The House and Senate should not be taking up this bill , which effectively guarantees immunity for telecom companies alleged to have participated in the President ’s illegal program , and which fails to protect the privacy of law - abiding Americans at home .
Allowing courts to review the question of immunity is meaningless when the same legislation essentially requires the court to grant immunity .
And under this bill , the government can still sweep up and keep the international communications of innocent Americans in the U.S. with no connection to suspected terrorists , with very few safeguards to protect against abuse of this power .
Instead of cutting bad deals on both FISA and funding for the war in Iraq , Democrats should be standing up to the flawed and dangerous policies of this administration . " [ emphasis mine ]
The Judiciary Chairs were essentially shut out of the recent round of negotiations , if press reports are to be believed .
That should be enough to make the Democratic majority members of those committees vote against this bad bill .
It likely wo n't .
But you can add them ( links above show committee members with links to their pages ) to the other calls .
And this was all before acid met the counterculture on Haight Street in the 1960s .
But meet they did , and it was love at first sight .
Dr. Hofmann ’s child was no hustler from a shotgun lab in Tijuana , after all , but a bourgeois revolutionary , born into establishment medicine and able to travel the world and enter societies from the top down , through their most hallowed institutions .
The English novelist Aldous Huxley , who struck up a friendship with Dr. Hofmann , was one of the first prominent proponents of LSD use for personal transformation .
Timothy Leary , LSD ’s pied piper , was a Harvard professor whose public raptures over the drug were a strong cocktail of mystical and scientific jargon .
Ken Kesey , founder of the protoraves known as acid tests , was at age 30 already an acclaimed novelist , author of “ One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest . ”
He likened taking acid to “ putting a tuning fork on your whole body . ”
Not that acid was a hard sell to young people in the early 1960s , at least to those who longed not only to shake free of mainstream suburban - corporate culture but also to transform it , and themselves .
They were n’t looking for an angry fix but something far grander .
“ To put matters bluntly : the hippies were an attempt to push evolution , to jump the species toward a higher integration , ” wrote Jay Stevens in his 1987 book , “ Storming Heaven : LSD and the American Dream . ”
A joint is not going to get you there .
Nor , in the end , did LSD .
By 1966 a raft of toxic knockoffs were on the street , and the authorities recognized that , whatever its upside , acid had become part of a self - devouring drug culture that exposed many users to a poisonous menu of illicit drugs .
The government outlawed distribution of LSD , and research into its effects soon ground to a near halt .
Where some saw a long - overdue crackdown on abuse , others saw an overreaction .
“ Once the drug illegalization crowd gets hold of it , that ’s that , ” said Alexander Shulgin , a former Dow chemist who discovered the effects of MDMA , or ecstasy , which has also been made a controlled substance .
“ People start talking about protecting little children , and worrying about whether someone ’s going to jump out the window , and meanwhile we have these substances  MDMA and LSD  that may be of tremendous value in psychotherapy and could n’t be explored . ”
They can now ; several trials testing psychedelics are in the works , thanks in part to the steady example set by Dr. Hofmann .
“ I think people in this country , when they see a patient in pain , will not deny that person a medication just because the drug has abuse potential , ” said Dr. John Halpern , a Harvard psychiatrist who is testing the effect of MDMA - assisted psychotherapy in late - stage cancer patients .
“ LSD is always going to be a touchy subject but I think it ’s kind of fallen back to earth . ”
The trip is over , the hangover gone , and the prodigal child arrived home , just in time to say goodbye .

Global demand for oil has been fuelled by China and India
The price of crude oil could soar to $ 200 a barrel in as little as six months , as supply continues to struggle to meet demand , a report has warned .
Goldman Sachs energy strategist Argun Murti made the warning as benchmark US light crude passed the $ 123 mark for the first time .
Surging demand was increasingly likely to create a " super - spike " past $ 200 in six months - to - two years ' time , he said .
Oil prices have now risen by 25 % in the last four months and 400 % since 2001 .
US sweet , light crude hit an all - time peak of $ 123.53 ( £ 63.25 ) on Wednesday , while London Brent crude jumped to $ 122.32 .
Mr Murti correctly predicted three years ago - when oil was about $ 55 a barrel - that it would pass $ 100 , which it reached for the first time in January of this year .
Chinese demand
Soaring global demand for oil is being led by China 's continuing economic boom and , to a lesser extent , by India 's rapid economic expansion .
Both are now increasingly competing with the US , the European Union and Japan for the lion 's share of global oil production .
This additional demand comes at a time of continuing production problems in a number of oil - producing nations .
Production is down in Nigeria after the latest attacks on pipelines this week by anti-government militants , while Iraqi exports through the north of the country have been hit by renewed cross - border raids by Turkish forces against Kurdish insurgents .
Oil prices are also rising as the key US summer driving season approaches .
Economists warn that continuing high oil prices will impact on the global economy , hitting growth and fuelling inflation .
Google Earth is one of the most amazing apps in the world .
This app basically gives everyone the ability to use its “ Aerial View Mode ” and see how every place on Earth looks like .
What ’s interesting is that while recording high resolution data for maps , Google Earth sometimes makes fascinating discoveries such as the collection of ancient structures in Saudi Arabia .
Google Earth Finds Ancient Structures in Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia is known for being a total wasteland which contains some of the world ’s most amazing archeological sites .
Luckily , Google Earth ’s aerial images revealed almost 400 never seen before ancient structures that date back to 2,000 and 9,000 years ago .
Technology Reinvents Archeology
Traditionally , archeologic discoveries were done through field work .
Archeologists would use different searching patterns while digging which would result in new findings .
However , things are so much easier nowadays since scientists and archeologists can use high resolution satellite images which give them some clues on where to dig .
Special Gates
Regarding these new structures , Professor David Kennedy who is a researcher in Classics and Ancient History is categorizing them as “ gates ” .
This is what the professor had to say about these newly discovered structures : “ I refer to them as Gates because when you view them from above they look like a simple field gate lying flat , two upright posts on the sides , connected by one or more long bars ” .
Another cool thing about these “ gates ” is the fact that they are not visible at ground level .
This means that they would have never been discovered without the help of Google Earth ’s satellite images .
Lastly , we need to mention that even though Professor Kennedy is the one who is responsible for these new 400 discoveries , he never visited Saudi Arabia in his life !
This shows just how much technology is improving our lives .
Update :
I found some great photos of the event ( outside of course ) at this website :

2008 Bilderberg Conference
Location / date :
Westfields Marriott Hotel
Chantilly , Virginia , USA , June 5 - 8 , 2008
List of attendees can be found here :
[ Official 2008 Bilderberg List of Attendees – LiveLeak.com ]
The Bilderberg group is meeting again this weekend apparently to discuss cyber terrorism , the Middle East , a nuke - free world , Africa , and Russia among other things accoring to a press release issued by the group which you can find here :
[ Bilderberg Press Release ]
To my knowledge , this is the first time the Bilderbergers have issued a press release directly to the public .
Apparently you can get a list of the attendees yourself by a calling their number at the bottom of the press release ( how kind of them , sure beats people having to get someone from the inside to send it , and then the people on the list still deny they were there , sheesh ) .
So what 's new with Bilderberg ?
Well besides the out - of - character press release , there have been rumors circulating that Obama and Hillary Clinton may have attended the conference Thursday night .
News outlets say they were meeting somewhere in Virginia in that area under closed doors ( including the private meeting announced by the mainstream ) .
Chantilly is only a few miles from Dulles International Airport where Obama 's press was duped .
Obama's / Hillary 's campaign office would not confirm / deny they visited Bilderberg .
More information about the event can be found here :
[ Obama / Hillary Secret Meeting – WorldNetDaily ]
It also interesting that one of the attendees is none other than James A. Johnson who is in charge of selecting Obama 's running mate .
Maybe he 's getting some advice from the major global interests of who he should pick .
I 'm going to guess it 's someone with some big business ties .
Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina is attending the Bilderberg meeting for the first time .
His name was on the attendee list received .
I had someone call the Governor 's office to ask of his whereabouts , and they were told he was attending a “ private function in Virginia . ”
This is a suprise to many since Sanford has been a stark opponent of the Real ID Act and has still not signed it into law in the state of South Carolina .
Maybe he 's an insider ?
If I was asked to attend the conference , I would happily attend .
Where else are you going to obtain all the secrets of Bilderberg ?
I hope to have a follow - up story later in the year about Sanford 's visit .
Condeleeza Rice ( US ) and Minister Babacan ( TUR ) are also attending .
Apparently Babacan did n't get the memo to keep quiet .
It is his fifth time attending the conference .
[ Today 's Zaman – Turkish Website ]
Other notables this year include Keith Alexander , Director of the US National Security Agency , Ben Bernake , Chairman of the Federal Reserve , Donald Graham , CEO of the Washington Post , Henry Paulson , US Secretary of the Treasury , and Robert Zoellick , President of the World Bank Group .
And of course the man who runs it all , David Rockefeller .
What is Bilderberg ?
Why should I care ?
Bilderberg is a secretive group of powerful and well - known politicans , businessman , and people who are involved with international affairs .
They have been meeting since 1954 in almost absolute secrecy until recent years .
No one would admit they attended back in those days even if someone had pictures of them going in and their name on the attendee list .
The conference is supposed to be an outlet for these big-namers to freely discuss their opinions on policy and world events .
The meetings are extremely well guarded and kept under tight wraps .
At this year 's conference , private security , local / county police , Secret Service , FBI , foreign secret service were all spotted and identified .
Even a couple of people dressed like US Marines were seen .
These actions from US officials are supposedly illegal since they violate the Logan
Act which does not allow for US officials to meet secretly with persons from other governments to discuss / make policy .
Though , charges are rarely filed against anyone .
So the big question here is , why do these meetings have to be so secret ?
The attendees and press obviously pay no attention to the Logan Act .
Is it so they can speak openly and freely as described in the press release ?
Or is there a more devious plot happening here ?
The thing that bothers people the most is not everything I 've just listed , but the fact the media gives the Bilderbergers absoultely zero media coverage .
But when a G8 or major UN conference is happening , the media is all over it .
Everyone knows these high - ranking officals are meeting now especially with this press release .
And the media still pays no attention ?
In light of this year 's meeting , it is obvious that the meeting 's planners do not care anymore or are not worried about people finding out about their meeting .
Even though reportedly this conference was moved from Greece to Chantilly , Virginia which is just outside Washington D.C.
And it would seem Obama and Hillary felt it was safe enough to so obviously attend this major secret function during the first day of the Bilderberg meeting .
If they did not meet , it would be a major coincidence since Chantilly is only a 15 min drive away from where Obama 's press was left behind , and there just happened to be a powerhouse , global meeting going on where anybody whose was anybody was at .

Samad 's new Q - Starling uses stylistic cues from classic fighter planes and contemporary sportscars , while establishing a few of its own .
Here 's a good reason to remember your postal carrier at Christmas time .
Apparently , he or she can tell you if the government is secretly monitoring your mail .
Federal prosecutors in Detroit say letter carrier Darlene Cry illegally tipped off a postal customer that he was the subject of a " mail cover " – a form of warrantless surveillance in which the envelope information on every card and letter received is secretly recorded by the Post Office , then passed to federal law enforcement or intelligence officials .
" From on or about April 22 , 2005 thought on or about May 21 , 2005 , a mail cover was conducted for all mail pieces addressed to an individual residing on Lauder Street in Detroit , Michigan who was , at all times relevant to the Information , the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation , " reads the complaint ( . pdf ) filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on Friday .
On July 8th of that year , Cry " did disclose to the subject … that his mail was monitored by the Postal Service , " the complaint alleges , violating a federal law against disclosing confidential government information , a misdemeanor .
Courts have ruled that Americans have no reasonable expectation of privacy in the address information on their mail , and mail covers have a long and storied history in the annals of domestic surveillance .
In the 1970s , the Church Committee found that the CIA and FBI had used the mail cover program as a front to secretly open , copy and re-seal some 215,000 letters , in a single spying operation run from an office in New York .
In 2005 , the Bush administration unsuccessfully lobbied Congress for expanded authority to obtain mail covers , complaining that the Postal Service 's standards for approving the surveillance were too restrictive .
Unlike other forms of surveillance , like wiretaps and pen registers , statistics on the number of mail covers performed each year are not released .
In 2007 , Salon reported on widespread suspicions in the civil liberties community that the secret number is rising .
It 's surprising to hear that an ordinary letter carrier would be privy to the workings of a surveillance program , even one as antiquated as mail snooping .
It 's also kind of reassuring .
If you notice your mailman , or mailwoman , avoiding eye contact the time you sign for a parcel , they may be trying to send you a message .

Five million are dead , our cities laid waste and the nation 's infrastructure is shattered .
The nightmare aftermath of a Soviet nuclear assault is outlined in apocalyptic detail in a secret government report in 1955 .
And among the issues troubling civil servants is ... tea .
More precisely , would there be enough to go round and help the nation recover from Armageddon ?
Scroll down for more ...
Nuclear defence : Civil servants believed stockpiling tea could be the key to recovery
" The tea position would be very serious , " notes one civil servant in the report .
" With a loss of 75 per cent of stocks and substantial delays in imports and with a system of rationing , it would be wrong to consider that even 1 oz per head per week ( enough for about 12 cups ) could be ensured . "
It adds that " no satisfactory solution has yet been found " to the tea problem and calls for a plan to ensure a decent supply .
The report 's writers suggest a huge effort to stockpile staple foods and prepare the nation for the aftermath of a nuclear strike .
Their shopping list includes 40,000 tons of condensed milk , 200,000 tons of oils and fats , 700,000 tons of raw sugar , and 800,000 tons of wheat and flour .
Another crucial ingredient for the UK 's survival would be corned beef .
Cold War staple : Tinned meat
Officials recommend putting aside 240,000 tons of the canned meat , noting that it is " an ideal food for stockpiling " and praising its nutritional value .
The report from the Defence Plans Division , released by National Archives today , outlines what officials " assumed " would happen in the first two weeks of a nuclear war .
The top five targets of the Soviets , which were each expected to be hit by a 20 - megaton hydrogen bomb , were London , Birmingham , Merseyside , Manchester and Clydeside , according to the document .
A further 14 less powerful atom bombs , similar to the one dropped on Nagasaki at the end of the Second World War , were likely to strike Tyneside , Teeside , Leeds , Sheffield , Hull , Derby , Southampton , Portsmouth , Bristol , Plymouth , Cardiff , Coventry , Belfast and Purfleet in Essex .
The report warns : " At least five million people would be killed at once and up to another 10 million injured or affected by fall - out .
" The machinery of Government in such conditions would be crippled .
" The mechanisms of finance , commerce and industry - including transport and communications - would for a time be paralysed .
Scroll down for more ...
" All the normal means of food distribution , based as they are upon the great towns , would vanish . "
The National Archives yesterday admitted it had been fooled by a master forger .
It discovered in 2005 that 29 documents relating to alleged treachery during the Second World War were fakes .
These include claims that the Duke of Windsor was a traitor and that British agents murdered SS boss Heinrich Himmler on the orders of Winston Churchill .
" Forensic examination confirmed that the suspected documents had been introduced to the files from 2000 onwards , " said an archives spokesman .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush would veto climate change legislation to be considered by the U.S. Senate this week if it passes Congress in its current form , the White House said on Monday .
“ As the legislation is drafted , if it were to pass in its current form , the president would veto it , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters .
But she added , “ It ’s very unlikely to pass the Senate anyway . ”
The legislation the Senate will debate , which is not expected to become law this year ahead of the presidential election in November , could cut total U.S. global warming emissions by 66 percent by 2050 , according to a summary of the measure .
ALCHEMY 1 : This simple 17th century " sign " illustrates the blending of geometric shapes , elemental symbols and astrological signs .
Each part representing the various " elements " and forces needed for magical work in the quest for physical transformation and spiritual illumination and immortality .
Many medieval alchemists based their philosophies on mystical traditions rooted in the Kabbala ( Jewish mysticism ) , Hermetic magic and the occult practices of ancient civilizations such as Egypt and China .
See Philosopher 's stone and phoenix .
Compare it with the next symbol :
ALCHEMY 2 : This compound " magical - alchemical symbol " replaces the above triangle with a hexagram and adds more shapes within the magical circle : a cross [ in this context it become an occult counterfeit ) and an additional circle with the Hindu " Bindu " ( dot in the center ) at the bottom of the hexagram .
AMULET : A magic charm ( such as this little Navajo bear earring ) , worn to bring good luck and protection against illness , accidents and evil forces .
Do n't believe it !
[ See Establishing a Global Spirituality ]
ANARCHY : Popular among school aged children today , this symbol for anarchy fits the message that pervades the most popular video games , role - playing games , movies and television .
The lines of the " A " often extend outside the circle .
To many satanists and other fast - growing occult groups it represents their slogan , " do what thou wilt . "
A former occultist explained that it represents the ASMODEAS : a demonic force driving teenagers toward sexual perversion and suicide .
ANKH : An Egyptian cross symbolizing a mythical eternal life , rebirth , and the life - giving power of the sun .
ANGEL : Symbol of good and evil spirits in religions around the world .
This picture shows a Tibetan guardian angel .
For a comparison between Biblical angels and occult angels read Chapter 8 in A Twist of Faith .
For a summary , see Touched by an Angel .
ARROW : These two pictures shows the astrological sign for the archer ( Sagittarius ) -- part of the zodiac .
But , through history , the arrow has also symbolized war , power , swiftness , the rays of the sun , knowledge ... as well as deities such as the Greek god Apollo and goddess Artemis ( both hunters ) , the Hindu weather god , Rudra ; and various gods of sexual attraction : Eros ( Greek ) , Cupid ( Roman ) , Kama ( Hindu ) ....
On ancient Roman coins , it represented the Zoroastrian god , Mithra .
The native American Cheyenne warriors revered the " sacred medicine arrows " as symbols of male power .
Arrows held by skeletons would point to disease or death .
Today , they usually just point in the preferred direction .
Crystal ( Gazing ) BALL : Used for divination ( fortunetelling , scrying , clairvoyance ... ) .
When the heavy crystal balls were too expensive , witches often used glass - ball fishing floats , colored glass balls , or magic mirrors .
One website that markets these balls beckons : ' Why not buy one and try your own free psychic reading . "
BAT : A symbol of good fortune in the East , it represented demons and spirits in medieval Europe .
BLAIR WITCH : A five - pointed compound symbol with a center triangle pointing down .
The five lines resemble the microcosmic man with arms and legs outstretched inside a circle ( with a pentagram in the background ) -- a magic symbol or charm among medieval alchemists and wizards .
BUTTERFLY : Reminds Christians of the amazing transformation that takes place through Christ 's redemption and regeneration .
When " born again , " we become " a new creation . "
( 2 Cor. 5:17 ) To many pagans , its mythical meaning is linked to the soul ( of the deceased ) in search of reincarnation .
See the new , politically correct meaning at Butterfly 208 : " There 's a theory that says if a single butterfly flaps its wings in , say , China , the air disturbance may cause a storm in Nunavut , Canada a month later .
If that 's the case , imagine the power of your own ideas and others to help improve the quality of life in the world 's 208 countries !
The Butterfly 208 contest is a chance for you to create your own Butterfly effect !
208 = Number of Countries in the World Butterfly + 208 = A totally interconnected world !
A world where even small actions can have a big effect . "
" Sacred " BULL ( Egyptian idol ) :
These ancient Egyptian idols -- once worshipped as manifestations of gods -- are being revived .
We have deleted a smaller ( commercial ) bull with horns resemble a crescent moon supporting the divine sun disc .
Some suggest that this combination -- like the Chinese yin yang -- may symbolize a mythical duality : a union of opposites such as light / dark , sun/moon , life / death , and male / female .
God told
His people long ago , " Do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt . "
But they ignored
His warning and faced devastating consequences for refusing to " cast away the abominations which were before their eyes . "
( Ez. 20:7 -8 )
CADUCEUS ( The Staff of Hermes ) :
An ancient symbol dating back to the Greek messenger god Hermes ( the Romans called him Mercury ) . "
In Indian philosophy and medicine the Caduceus is intimately associated with the system of energy centers called Chakras .... The 2 serpents coiling around the staff [ represent positive and negative forces like ] the Yang and Yin of Chinese Medicine .
The crossing over of the 2 serpents creates 5 energy fields in the body . "
Polarity Therapy ( See Reiki and Rick Warren 's Risky Health Plan )
CHAOS : Apparently a self - made form of occultism taught through role - playing games such as Warhammer .
According to one WH fan , " Chaos is the opposite of order .
Since everything changes , there is no right or no wrong -- only the quest for pleasure .
The 8 - pointed star represents the many different directions of chaos and the many ways you can follow it .
We worship deamons and angels ... "
Another comment : " They got it from Elric of Melnibone .
In it , the force of Chaos had as its symbol an eight - pointed double - cross ( symbols within symbols ) with points representing the noncommittal and omnidirectional behavior of Chaos . "
See Chaos Magic .
However , other Warhammer fans disagree with the quote above .
Read more here .
CIRCLE ( sun disc , sacred hoop , ring ) :
An ancient and universal symbol of unity , wholeness , infinity , the goddess , female power , and the sun .
To earth - centered religions throughout history as well as to many contemporary pagans , it represents the feminine spirit or force , the cosmos or a spiritualized Mother Earth , and a sacred space .
( See next item ) Gnostic traditions linked the unbroken circle to the " world serpent " forming a circle as it eats its own tail .
( See serpent )
CIRCUMPUNCT - CIRCLE with DOT ( BINDU ) in the center :
It represents the sun and a sun god ( called Ra in Egypt ) , gold ( as in alchemy ) , an ( unbiblical ) archangel ( Kabbalah ) , emotional restraint ( Freemasons ) , and the creative spark of divine consciousness within people linking everyone to the creative mind of a universal " god " thus making each persona " co-creator " ( astrology ) .
In the complex symbolic system of Hinduism and Buddhism , the bindu ( dot ) represents the male force .
Together , the circle and the bindu symbolize the spiritual merging of male and female forces .
( See Sun Sign and the above explanation for CIRCLE )
CIRCLE ( Quartered ) :
The sacred circle filled with a cross , four equal lines pointing from the center to the spirits of the north , east , south , and west -- or to the basic element : earth , water , air ( or wind ) , and fire .
In Native American traditions , it forms the basic pattern of the MEDICINE WHEEL and plays a vital part in major spiritual rituals .
Many contemporary pagans consider it their main symbol for transmitting the energy of the goddess .
( See sun wheel ) Churches have used variations of the same popular shape , usually calling it the Celtic Cross .
Masonic COMPASS : The Masonic symbol of the compass and the T - square represents movement toward perfection and a balance between the spiritual and physical which resembles Egyptian and oriental mysticism .
The compass ( used to form circles ) represent spirit .
The ruler ( part of a square ) represent the physical .
Some public schools pass out pencil cases and other gifts decorated with this emblem .
COW : It symbolized the sky goddess Hathor to Egyptians , enlightenment to Buddhists , one of the highest and holiest stages of transmigration ( reincarnation ) to Hindus .
CRESCENT MOON : A symbol of the aging goddess ( crone ) to contemporary witches and victory over death to many Muslims .
In Islamic lands , crescent can be seen enclosing a lone pentagram .
To grasp the significance of the Cross and its cost to our crucified and risen Savior , see The Cross .
The CROSS of Christians : While anyone -- even pagans -- now use the cross as decoration or as an occult symbol , Christians must continue to treasure the cross of Calvary .
But be careful what kind of cross you wear - and what message you communicate to others .
To understand the Christian significance of the cross and appreciate its excruciating cost to our crucified and resurrected Christ , read The Triumph of the Cross and " The Cross " .
Inverted cross :
Originally represented the apostle Peter 's humility in his martyrdom .
He insisted that he be crucified upside - down , because he felt that he was unworthy to die in the same position as Christ .
But today , especially in the rock music culture , it generally represents the opposite : satanism and its mockery of Christ .
Lucifer continues to twist
God 's wonderful truths and works into lies and deceptions .
COMMUNISM : Originally the hammer and sickle represented a hammer and a plough -- the collective unity of Soviet workers and peasant farmers .
It 's interesting to see its resemblance to Islam 's symbol ( crescent / star ) .
The two ideologies have had much in common : hatred for Biblical Christianity and Jews ( remember the Russian pogroms ) , readiness to kill those who do n't conform , hope of world conquest , etc .
C ELTIC CROSS : The symbol for a cultural blend of medieval Catholicism and ancient Celtic traditions .
Sometimes this cross is seen with four additional " arms " dividing the circle into eight instead of four sections .
Notice the similarity between the old Celtic cross and the cross designed by PBS ( tax - funded Public Broadcasting in the U.S. ) to represent Christianity ( left side ) .
Do you wonder why PBS would choose a similar cross ( right side ) to represent the Quartered Circle of the earth - centered religions of Aborigenes around the world ?
The Celtic cross also represents the neo-pagan followers of the French anti-Christian philosopher Alain de Benoist .
JERUSALEM CROSS :
In medieval heraldry , it symbolized the " Crusader 's Kingdom of Jerusalem " often displayed on shields and banners after the initial victory in the battle to recapture Jerusalem during the Crusades .
( See the Maltese Cross ) .
Some have linked the four corner crosses the " holy " wounds of Jesus or the four gospels .
Similar shapes can be found on Hindu and Buddhist temples or coins -- and in various earth - centered cultures -- with entirely different sets of meanings .
( See circle for relevant references to the four directions )
IRON CROSS ( or Cross Pattée or EISERNES KREUZ ) : Adopted as the Iron Cross in Prussia .
During the First World War , it appeared on German fighter planes and tanks .
Later , it became a fascist symbol in France , Portugal and other nations .
Compare it with Swastika 3 .
CROSS ( MALTESE ) : CROSS ( MALTESE ) :
This eight - pointed cross ( linking the points of four arrowheads at the center ) dates back to the First Crusade in the 12th century .
It was used by the Knights Templar , the Knights of Malta , and the Order of St. John of Jerusalem among others .
In 1813 , during the War of Liberation against Napoleon , it was revived by Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III and became an award for acts of heroism , bravery or leadership skills .
Double - headed EAGLE : A Masonic seal and initiation symbol .
The number inside the pyramid over the eagle 's head is 33 .
The eagle is a universal symbol representing the sun , power , authority , victory , the sky gods and the royal head of a nation .
DOVE : Peace .
It sometimes accompanies other symbols occasionally representing the world 's vision of universal peace , such as the rainbow , olive branch , broken cross ( see peace ) , globe , and Egyptian ankh .
See Peace and Culture of Peace , which tells us that " ' The CULTURE OF PEACE Initiative ' is a United Nations - designated ' Peace Messenger Initiative ' - with Participants in all the world 's regions . "
In the Bible , the Holy Spirit is , for a moment , made visible as a different kind of dove .
It tells us that " Jesus also was baptized ; and while He prayed , the heaven was opened .
And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him , and a voice came from heaven which said , ' You are My beloved Son ; in You I am vwell pleased . ' ”
Luke 3:21 - 22
DRAGON : A mythical monster made up of many animals : serpent , lizard , bird , lion ...
It may have many heads and breath fire .
To mediaeval Europe , it was dangerous and evil , but people in Eastern Asia believe it has power to help them against more hostile spiritual forces .
In the Bible it represents Satan , the devil .
DREAMCATCHER : An American Indian magic spider - web inside a sacred circle .
After making dreamcatchers in crafts lessons in school , many children hang them on or near their beds .
They have been told that these occult symbols will block bad dreams but allow good dreams to pass through the center .
Do n't believe that myth !
[ See New Beliefs for a Global Village ]
ELEMENTS :
The four basic elements to many pagans are earth , water , air ( wind or spirit ) and fire .
Many consider the first two passive and feminine - and the last two active and masculine .
In Wiccan or Native American rituals , the " quartered circle " ( also the Medicine Wheel ) represents a " sacred space " or the sacred earth .
The four lines may represent the spirits of the four primary directions or the spirits of the earth , water , wind and fire .
( This set of elements differs from those used in alchemy . )
ETERNITY : See Infinity and Uruborus
EVIL EYE :
The symbol of a dreadful , fabled curse ( believed to bring sickness , death , bad luck loss ... ) .
This " evil eye " has frightened people in many parts of the world through the centuries .
Here it looks like a female eye on the " Hand of Fatima , " but its shape varies with the culture .
EYE OF HORUS : A favorite crafts project in schools , it represents the eye of Egyptian sun-god Horus who lost an eye battling Set .
Pagans use it as a charm to ward off evil .
( See All - Seeing Eye ) Notice that the picture shows a compound symbol - several symbols joined together to give a more complex meaning .
It includes an unbiblical cross and , at the bottom , part of a face inside the rays of the sun .
( See Sun )
FISH ( Ichthys ) : Sometimes this early Christian symbol contains the name of JESUS or this set of Greek letters : " ΙΧΘΥΣ " .
This acronym has traditionally referred to " Jesus Christ , Son of God , Savior . "
It probably served as an identification sign among Christians as early as the 2nd Century AD .
As Jesus said , " Follow Me and I will make you fishers of men . " ( Matt. 4:19 ) ( A new version of this fish symbol contains the name of Darwin and is designed to mock Christianity . )
FLEUR-DE-LIS : Also called Lily of France , it was first an adaptation of the Gaulish lily representing the Virgin Juno .
Among goddess worshippers , it apparently had several meanings , including the Triple Goddess .
It appeared in Arthurian legends as well as on the French ( and other national ) " coat - of - arms " and royal or military emblems .
It has also been an emblem for the Boy Scouts .
FROG : A symbol of fertility to many cultures .
The Romans linked it to Aphrodite , the Egyptian to the shape - shifting goddess Heket who would take the form of a frog .
To the Chinese , it symbolized the moon -- " the lunar , yin principle " bringing healing and prosperity . [ 1 ]
Since frogs need watery places , their image was often used in occult rain charms .
HAND OF FATIMA ( daughter of Muhammad ) or KHAMSA ( five ) : Many Muslims believe that the image of the hand with an eye in the center will protect them from the " evil eye . "
While this symbol often appears on magical charms , amulets , and jewelry , it is seen in many other places .
See a similar image painted next to the main door to a home here .
This Khamsa seems to be the same as the Jewish Hasma ( below ) .
Many serious Muslims view this as folklore or superstition .
See comments , corrections and explanations HERE .
Compare it with the next symbol :
HAND OF FATIMA or HAMSA ( five ) : Jewish versions of the supposed " hand " of protection ( above ) from " evil eye " ( Some expect protection from demons and sorcerers as well ) .
During the Israelites ' exile in Babylonian , some began to blend Old Testament beliefs with Babylonian myths and mysticism .
Such syncretism continued through the centuries .
One of its manifestations was the mystical Kabbalah -- the heart of many streams of modern occultism ( including the Order of the Golden Dawn and other secret societies , Tarot cards and divination , etc . )
HAND OF ... what ?
Native American version of two above symbols .
Found on a flat , round sandstone disk during the excavation of an old Indian mound in Alabama , its original meaning is lost .
Perhaps it was used in rituals preparing for tribal wars .

The patterns of the labyrinth are similar in design and conception to the mandalas of South Asian Buddhism , which are physical representations of the spiritual realm designed to aid in meditation .
Labyrinths blend their visual symbolism with the process of walking , which is similar to the Japanese Zen practice of kinhin , literally ' walking meditation ...
In the early 90’s , when Jean Houston , one of the leading New Age teachers , introduced the Christian world again to the use of this practice for seeking spiritual enlightenment through walking the labyrinth . "

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ( WHO , a UN agency ) :
This symbol points back to the days of Moses , when a dead serpent was displayed on a stake during the Israelites 40 - year journey through the wilderness .
Instead of trusting God , the people complained , so " the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people ... and many ... died . "
When they confessed their sin , God told Moses to " make a fiery serpent , and set it on a pole . "
Those who then looked at the bronze serpent on the stake with confidence in God 's promise , were healed ( Numbers 21: 4 - 9 ) .
This became an illustration of the crucifixion through which Jesus bore the judgment we deserve for our sins .
( See John 3:14 ) About 700 BC , faithful king Hezekiah ' broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made , since the people worshiped it as an idol and " burned incense to it . "
( 2 King 18:1-5 )

YIN YANG : A Chinese Tao picture of universal harmony and the unity between complimentary opposites : light / dark , male / female , etc .
Yin is the dark , passive , negative female principle .
Yang is the light , active , positive principle .
Since the holistic balance between Yin and Yang is dynamic and constantly changing , it illustrates the consensus process , the vision of global unity , and the blending of opposing energies at the heart of Holistic Health .
Since it represent monism ( all is one ) and pantheism ( all is God ) , it opposes Christianity , which shows us that there is only one God ( monotheism ) , and only in Christ can we be one .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NEW YORK — Family members of 9/11 victims have sent a letter today to Susan Crawford , Convening Authority of the Guantánamo military commissions , sharply criticizing the politicization of the system .
According to news reports , a Pentagon representative secretly invited an outspoken supporter of the military commissions to Guantánamo Bay for Thursday 's arraignment of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other detainees on terrorism - related charges , but did not make this option available to family members who have expressed criticism of the commissions .
This type of politicization is symptomatic of the unconstitutional and biased tribunal system , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .
The letter echoes the widespread call for a system to try the Guantánamo detainees that adheres to the Constitution , stating , " As people who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , we want nothing more than to see that justice is served in the prosecution of suspects .
However , we know that no justice will come out of a system that has been compromised by politics and stripped of the rule of law . "
The military commission proceedings have been subject to unlawful political influence since they started .
After holding detainees for over six years , the government is now rushing through these cases , giving the defense just three months to prepare for a trial timed to begin only weeks before the November elections .
" The American public has every right to expect that prosecutions of 9/11 suspects will be conducted in a fair , open and honest manner that is not compromised by crass political considerations .
Selectively inviting only 9/11 family members whose views are in alignment with those of the Bush administration is only one example of the repeated attempts to infuse politics into what should be an impartial process that has the goal of achieving justice , " the letter stated .
Since the inception of the Bush administration 's military commissions , a growing number of lawyers , legal scholars , government officials , military personnel and others have raised concerns about prosecuting detainees under a system that ignores the fundamental tenets of due process and allows the admission of highly questionable evidence - particularly evidence possibly obtained through torture .
According to the ACLU , these cases belong in a civilian court of law or a traditional military court operating in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice that upholds due process and in which judges and attorneys are held to constitutional obligations and accountable to the rule of law .
In April , the ACLU launched the John Adams Project — a partnership with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers ( NACDL ) — to provide civilian legal representation to assist under - resourced military counsel of Guantánamo detainees .
For more information on the ACLU and NACDL's John Adams Project , see : www.aclu.org/johnadams

Bad Information US Officials Accuse German Intelligence of Pre-Iraq War Failures
Five years ago , US troops marched into Iraq , convinced they would find weapons of mass destruction .
One threat seemed particularly palpable -- biological weapons produced in mobile facilities .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .

Two - Armed Spiral Milky Way
Illustration Credit : R. Hurt ( SSC ) , JPL - Caltech , NASA
Survey Credit : GLIMPSE
Explanation : Gazing out from within the Milky Way , our own galaxy 's true structure is difficult to discern .
But an ambitious survey effort with the Spitzer Space Telescope now offers convincing evidence that we live in a large galaxy distinguished by two main spiral arms ( the Scutum - Centaurus and Perseus arms ) emerging from the ends of a large central bar .
In fact , from a vantage point that viewed our galaxy face - on , astronomers in distant galaxies would likely see the Milky Way as a two - armed barred spiral similar to this artist 's illustration .
Previous investigations have identified a smaller central barred structure and four spiral arms .
Astronomers still place the Sun about a third of the way in from the Milky Way 's outer edge , in a minor arm called the Orion Spur .
To locate the Sun and identify the Milky Way 's newly mapped features , just place your cursor over the image .

As the video here demonstrates , the talking heads — or maybe that should be airheads — at Faux & Friends are clueless when it comes to history .
According to Gretchen Carlson , Steve Doocy , and Brian Kilmeade , former president Carter not only revealed previously unknown history , but he has provided Iran with an excuse to build nukes .
" It appears that he ’s giving out secret information about Israel and how many nuclear weapons they may have , " declared Carlson .
" No one ’s done it … so why not leave it to a former president , a one - term president like Jimmy Carter ? …
He said , ‘ Well , Israel ’s got an arsenal , about 150 . ’
Excuse me ?
We never heard that confirmed before .
We ’ve heard rumors about that , " added Kilmeade .
Rumors because Kilmeade and Faux are highly selective in reporting historical fact that does not jive with the neocons .
As far back as 1961 , British intelligence reported the existence of Israel ’s nuclear weapons program .
In 1969 , U.S. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird said he believed Israel had a nuclear weapon , a suspicion apparently valid enough that Nixon in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir pressed Israel to " make no visible introduction of nuclear weapons or undertake a nuclear test program , " thus maintaining a policy of nuclear ambiguity .
The CIA accused Israel of stealing uranium from the U.S. Navy nuclear fuel plant operated by the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation in Apollo , Pennsylvania .
So much for the idea that Israel is our friend .
But it would be Mordechai Vanunu , formerly employed at the Negev Nuclear Research Center , a facility located in the Negev desert south of Dimona , who would reveal Israel ’s nuclear weapons program .
Vanunu provided photographs to back up his assertion .
Vanunu ’s revelation was published in the Sunday Times on October 5 , 1986 .
For publication of state secrets , he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for treason and espionage .
( See video at right . )
And then , in 1998 , former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said that Israel " built a nuclear option , not in order to have a Hiroshima but an Oslo , " in other words Israel used its nukes to blackmail the Palestinians .
Peres , in his capacity as the Director General of the Ministry of Defense in the early 1950s , was responsible for building Israel ’s nuclear capability , so he should know , not that we should expect the Faux Friends of Israel to pick up a history book .
Additional detail on the program was provided by award - winning American journalist Seymour Hersh in his book , the Samson Option .
According to Hersh , Israel worked jointly with South Africa to develop a bomb and it was Moshe Dayan who gave the go - ahead for starting weapon production in early 1968 .
A Center for Nonproliferation Studies report lists four separate Israel - South Africa “ clandestine nuclear deals . ”
" Unlike Iran and North Korea — two countries whose alleged nuclear ambitions have recently come to the fore — Israel has never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , designed to prevent the global spread of nuclear weapons , " the BBC reported on December 22 , 2003 .
" As a result , it is not subject to inspections and the threat of sanctions by the United Nations nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency . "
Because of this , Faux & Friends consider Israel ’s nuke arsenal a secret and Carter a traitor .
Now that Carter has brought this historical information to the forefront , it may be more difficult for the neocons to make the argument that Iran has no right to develop nuclear weapons , not that there is any evidence they are actually doing so .

Clinton can’t stop hitting the wrong note
Years ago , I was having a conversation with a jazz pianist who told me , “ When I hit a wrong note , I keep hitting it — so the audience will think it ’s intentional . ”
To move away from the wrong note would be a subtle admission of a mistake .
About a week ago , Hillary Clinton hit the wrong note when she called for a “ gas- tax holiday ” over the summer .
The dumb idea ran counter to almost every positive quality Clinton has — her commitment to telling voters the truth , her intelligence , the seriousness with which she takes policy details , etc .
The whole mess contradicts who Hillary Clinton really is , and she knows it .
But like the pianist , instead of quickly transitioning to a better note and hoping no one notices , Clinton has decided to hit the wrong note over and over again , with increasing volume and intensity .
The more reality pushes back against her nonsensical idea , the more aggressively Clinton pounds the ivory .
As someone who ’s respected Clinton ’s intellect for years , it ’s been painful to watch .
Jason Zengerle added :
[ S] tubbornness and refusal to admit error — and , in fact , the penchant for taking actions that only compound the original error — would seem to be qualities we do n’t want in our next president , right ? ”
The demagogic pandering prompted the Clinton campaign to create another ad to tout her ridiculous idea — the second commercial this week — and bash Barack Obama for taking reality seriously .
The ad , which started airing in Indiana yesterday , says Clinton ’s proposal would “ save families $ 8 billion , ” adding , “ Barack Obama says that ’s just pennies . ”
The ad concludes that Obama would “ make you keep paying that tax , instead of big oil . ”
The irony , of course , is that Clinton ’s plan would ensure that the oil companies “ end up the biggest beneficiaries . ”
Everything about Clinton ’s idea is backwards — consumers lose , the environment loses , conservation loses , Big Oil wins .
Clinton knows all of this — she ’s far too smart to believe otherwise — but she insists on shamelessly pandering anyway .
The new ad , as it turns out , was only part of yesterday ’s offensive display .
On Thursday , the Clinton campaign said policy experts no longer matter , and added a Bush - like ultimatum to congressional Democrats : “ Do they stand with the hard - pressed Americans who are trying to pay their gas bills at the gas station or do they once again stand with the oil companies ?
I want to know where people stand and I want them to tell us , are they with us or against us when it comes to taking on the oil companies ? ”
( Remember , the biggest beneficiaries of her plan are the oil companies . )
On Friday , the Clinton campaign actually managed to make an insulting situation even more offensive by accusing those who care about reality of being elitist : “ Clinton strategist Geoff Garin deployed [ the elitism card ] on a conference call with reporters , and Clinton used the tactic on the trail : ‘ I find it , frankly , a little offensive that people who do n’t have to worry about filling up their gas tank or what they buy when they go to the supermarket think it ’s somehow illegitimate to provide relief for … millions and millions of Americans . ' ”
To press her point , Clinton adopted one of the Republicans ’ favorite tactics : she announced she would go forward with her idea of introducing legislation , forcing Democrats to either vote against a popular - but - ridiculous idea in an election year , or vote for a policy that would boost oil company profits and undermine the environment .
Some of her biggest supporters — including Rep. Barney Frank and Sen. Patty Murray — both said yesterday that ca n’t support her bad idea .
Rep. Mark Udall , an uncommitted superdelegate who ’s running for the Senate in Colorado , went even further , calling Clinton ’s proposal a “ bumper - sticker fix ” that would n’t “ fix anything . ”
Udall added , “ We ca n’t afford more Washington - style pandering while families keep getting squeezed .
It is exactly the kind of short - sighted Washington game that keeps us from getting real results to our energy problem . ”
Also yesterday , Clinton told voters in North Carolina :
“ We ought to say : Wait a minute , we ’d rather have the oil companies pay the gas tax than the drivers of North Carolina , especially the truck drivers , or the farmers , or other people who have to commute long distances . ”
This is just factually wrong on multiple levels .
Looking at the big picture , John Dickerson notes that Clinton ’s campaigning on this has a familiar feel :
Embracing intellectual obtuseness and deflecting criticism with charges of elitism is a tactic George Bush often deployed while campaigning .
It ’s striking to see Clinton do it because she has been a regular and harsh critic of Bush ’s blindness to expert opinion .
It ’s even more striking to hear her aides actually sound like Bush administration officials .
When I asked Communications Director Howard Wolfson if the Clinton team could offer any intellectual ballast for the gas - tax vacation , given that so many policymakers had criticized it , he said , “ The presidency requires leadership … .
There are times when the president does something that the group of experts , quote unquote , does not agree with .
Presidents get advice and then act , and that is what Senator Clinton is doing . ”
Or , as George Bush used to put it : A leader leads .
Even if off a cliff .
Campaigns have ups and downs , but I ca n’t remember ever being this frustrated with Clinton .
" There sure as hell is a draft going on , " the passenger sitting next to me said grudgingly as the flight attendant handed him a ginger ale on our way into Los Angeles last week .
" I signed up to be in the Navy , not the damn Army . "
It will be his third deployment to Iraq in four years but his first to be served on shore .
Thousands of Navy and Air Force personnel are now serving nontraditional roles in Iraq  posts they never signed up for .
Steven , who asked that I not use his last name in print , said he ’s to receive six weeks of weapons training at a California Army base before being flown over to Iraq for a year - long deployment .
" We ’ve all heard of the stop - loss policy , there ’s even a new movie about it , but few know about what else is happening in our armed forces right now , " Steven explained .
" The backdoor draft is real , for sure , but here we are being shipped off to Iraq to basically serve in the infantry .
It ’s ridiculous . "
The Department of Defense reports that sailors and Air Force members are carrying out many different missions in Iraq , from traditional duties in the air and sea to construction jobs , medical operations , civil affairs , customs inspection , security , and detention operations .
Most are promised non -combat roles in Iraq , but many have found themselves to be in harm ’s way once they arrive .
In 2007 the Navy sent roughly 2,200 " individual augmentees , " as the service calls them , to handle combat - related duties with Marine and Army units stationed in Iraq .
As of early April 2008 , 92 Navy and 46 Air Force personnel had been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan , with those numbers sure to rise as the U.S. troop surge continues into its second year .
On March 31 , 400 Navy reservists who had received training at military bases in Virginia were shipped back to Iraq .
" The good news and bad news about this is that we are out doing things that our people were n’t originally trained for , " said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley in a speech last year .
Such a trend has increased over the past several years .
In 2006 , for example , there were 4,000 Air Force members in Iraq , but that number has jumped significantly .
Now the Pentagon reports that over 6,000 are to serve in the country by year ’s end .
" Technically , these combat - related assignments do not violate service members ’ contracts , " said Lawrence Korb , who handled manpower as assistant secretary of defense during the Reagan administration .
" But many are not volunteering for these jobs  they ’re being told to do them . "
Military recruitment numbers across the board are dwindling , and as a result all branches of the service are being overextended to maintain current troop levels in Iraq .
Aside from combat - related roles , however , sailors and Air Force members have been deployed in order to protect U.S. economic interests in the region  from oil pipelines to Halliburton ’s numerous reconstruction projects .
And that ’s what seems to have sailors like Steven irked at the troop surge and his new job in Iraq .
“ It ’s a draft , plain and simple .
I do n’t care what they call it , " Steven told me as our plane landed at LAX .
" I did n’t sign up for the Navy to be in the Army .
But I ’m going because I do n’t feel I have a choice .
I have children to feed and a mortgage to pay . ”

Phil Bredesen says that if the contentious slog continues until the Democrats ’ late - August convention in Denver , the party would have a vastly diminished chance of recapturing the White House .
Dem warns party to avert disaster
Democrats are increasingly nervous about their party ’s protracted nomination fight , and some prominent figures are publicly warning that the party needs to act fast to avoid disaster .
Chief among these voices is Phil Bredesen , the two - term governor of Tennessee who is uncommitted to either Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) or Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) .
Advertisement
In an interview this week with Politico , Bredesen said flatly that if the contentious slog continues until the Democrats ’ late - August convention in Denver , the party would have a vastly diminished chance of recapturing the White House .
“ They have a much steeper , rockier hill to climb if it goes to the convention , ” the governor said over a dinner of rockfish and red wine .
“ You ’re going to spend this whole summer — and lots of money and time and effort — trying to convince people that whoever is n’t eventually nominated , is n’t electable .
" That ’s a heck of a hole to climb out of come the first of September , ” he added .
“ What ’s been going on for the last 90 days just gets worse and worse as the summer goes on . ”
Bredesen also joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) in warning that superdelegates should not overturn the outcome from primaries and caucuses .
If Obama were denied the nomination by Democratic insiders after winning the party ’s popular vote , Bredesen said , “ There would be hell to pay in the party for a long time to come . ”
Bredesen is doing something about his concerns .
He was in Washington this week to promote his idea for holding a “ superdelegate primary ” in June , in which the 795 party bigwigs would gather to hear one last time from Clinton and Obama before casting a final vote .
Rather than allow the horse - trading and bloodletting go on all summer , he ’d get it over with during a two - day business meeting in a neutral , easily reached city like Dallas .
“ Invite the candidates to come and talk if they want , and then literally call the roll , ” he explained .
“ We should not go through the summer and have a divided and exhausted Democratic Party .
The inescapable conclusion is : OK , you ’ve got to find some way to bookend and bring it to closure earlier .
How do you do that ?
Do it in June rather than August . "
The governor said he decided to push the plan because of what he called a “ sea change ” in opinion among Democratic elites .
What once appeared to be a once - in - a - generation blessing — having two strong candidates with significant appeal among Democrats — seems more like a burden now , as the race drags on toward April and May contests that are unlikely to offer any more clarity than the muddled results of the past three months .
“ Ninety days ago , everybody was talking in warm terms about both the candidates : ‘ Is n’t it wonderful ?
Whoever ’s president is going to be great , ’ ” the governor said .
“ It has gotten vastly more polarized now , and that really concerns me . ”
To Bredesen , an even - keeled political pragmatist , superdelegates are certain to ultimately decide the nominee , so it makes no sense for them to do it later rather than sooner .
“ The bottom line here is that we have a problem , and I think we need to take it off autopilot and try to find some way of resolving it , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know any way that is not going to generate some hard feeling and some divisions in the party .
But if we do it early , we ’ve got a chance to patch them up . ”
Practicing his sales pitch , Bredesen added : “ I think it ’s an opportunity to show the public that we ’re a modern party and when confronted with a problem , we do n’t just have to glide along and hope for some seismic event to solve it all for us . ”
The governor said he has spoken to Clinton about his plan , which he unveiled last week in an op -ed in The New York Times , and that she did not reject it out of hand .
He said he had traded messages with Obama .
Bredesen gave a technocrat ’s answer to why he made the proposal , calling himself “ a problem solver " and saying it ’s “ common sense . ”
He came to Washington to meet with Democrats about the idea and has lobbied several fellow well - regarded Democratic governors — including Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania , Joe Manchin of West Virginia , Janet Napolitano of Arizona and Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas — about it over the phone .
The notion has found more favor among party activists outside Washington , he said , suggesting that Beltway Democrats and particularly Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean were not moving quick enough to recognize a growing problem .
“ He certainly was not warm to it , ” Bredesen said .
“ He was afraid that such a convocation … would present negative publicity for the party : the graybeards gathering in a back room to do it — smoke - filled room , all this kind of stuff .
My retort to that is :
You ’re going to have that anyway .
The superdelegates are going to decide the thing .
Better to happen in June . ”
Then the governor jabbed : “ Howard Dean ’s not the whole party .
They call it a committee for a reason . ”
Bredesen said superdelegates should be independent agents and noted his own case to underscore the point that superdelegates should not necessarily be guided only by who has the lead in total delegates ( Obama ’s case ) or who has won more big states ( Clinton ’s argument ) .
“ In my case , Obama has a majority nationally and Hillary Clinton won Tennessee , ” he said .
“ So who ’s the majority for me ? ”
The governor did , though , say that if the winner of both the popular vote and leader in pledged delegates was denied the nomination it could prove disastrous for the party ’s chances .
“ This is really divisive , " he said .
“ If Obama were to have a clear majority of the popular vote and the superdelegates for some reason turned it around the other way , I think there would be hell to pay in the party for a long time to come .
You ’ve got to try to come out of this with some sense of fairness about it , to have any chance of putting the party together .
“ If Obama has more delegates and has a clear majority of the popular vote and the superdelegates come together and pick Clinton , I think it ’s a problem that going to take some time to work out , ” he continued .
" There ’s going to be a lot of hard feelings . ”
Bredesen , who was reelected with nearly 70 percent of the vote in 2006 , is prevented by term limits from running again in two years .
He said his effort to broker a solution to his party ’s nomination fracas is n’t connected to making a play for vice president .
“ I do n’t think so , ” he said .
“ A couple of years ago , I gave some thought to , do you want to try to be a player in that stuff —
Southern governor and all that kind of stuff .
What I really decided is :
If you do that , you ’re going to get nothing done in your second term as governor . ”
Bloggers , liberal - leaning journalists and Democratic strategists have all warned in recent days that their party , yet again , risks snatching defeat from the jaws of victory .
“ How Obama vs. Clinton Is Killing The Democrats ” is the subheadline on the cover of the latest edition of The New Republic , just below “ We Have To Choose One ” and an arresting composite image of the two Democrats .
“ All of which is to say that it ’s about time for the Democratic Party to panic , ” the editors write at the end of an editorial titled “ Bush ’s Last Laugh . ”
“ If it wants to win this election , it needs this race to end as soon as possible .
Every day spent on the primaries represents an opportunity cost and diminishes the chances for ultimate victory . ”
“ What it signifies is a strategy of some criminal organizations who seek to terrorize society and paralyze the government , ” he said last week .
“ The question is , should we persevere and go forward or simply hide in our offices and duck our heads .
No way is the Mexican government going to back down in such a fight . ”
The violence between drug cartels that Mr. Calderón has sought to end has only worsened over the past year and a half .
The death toll has jumped 47 percent to 1,378 this year , prosecutors say .
All told , 4,125 people have been killed in drug violence since Mr. Calderón took office .
But the steady drumbeat of police killings has caused more shock here .
On Wednesday , for instance , the second in command of the police in Morelos State and his driver were found dead in the trunk of a car .
A placard on the bodies warned against joining the Sinaloa Cartel .
Several terrified local police chiefs have resigned , the most recent being Guillermo Prieto , the chief in Ciudad Juárez , who stepped down last week after his second in command was killed a few days earlier .
“ It is not just happening in Ciudad Juárez , ” Mayor José Reyes Ferriz , said at the funeral for the deputy commander , Juan Antonio Roman García .
“ It ’s happening in Nuevo Laredo , in Tijuana , in this entire region .
They are attacking top commanders to destabilize the police . ”
One reason for the surge in violence is that Mr. Calderón and his public security minister , Genaro García Luna , have upset longstanding arrangements between the police and drug traffickers at every level of government , several experts on crime in Mexico said .
Last year , Mr. García Luna removed 284 federal police commanders across the country , replacing them with his own handpicked officers , many from outside the force , who had been trained at a new academy and who had been closely vetted for signs of corruption .
This really was a lot of fun !
I can understand why it has so many views .
I really like how you have such a wide open space .
I did n't have much trouble not falling off .
I like his little screams when he dies .
Boy , is that sick .
You should n't have reused the cutscene between levels .
It was hard telling the difference between the good and rotten muffins .
They were n't entirely green .
Someone call Derpy !
The music was wonderful too .
Sep
I know what you ’re thinking : " What if I attached a faucet to a watermelon and filled it with spiked watermelon juice so party guests could serve themselves right from the melon ? "
Well , my husband finally turned that dream into a reality .
After testing three different types of faucets and spending the entire afternoon of our housewarming party creating his masterpiece — only to have it clog just hours before guests arrived , resulting in a mad dash to Home Depot and the supermarket so he could do it all over again — he ’s now perfected the model so all you have to do is build it .
Want to impress guests with a DIY watermelon keg of your own ?
Read on to find out how …
What you ’ll need :
• 10 - pound seedless watermelon
• Sharp knife
• Big spoon
• Big bowl
• Drill with a 1/2 - inch drill bit
• 3/4 - inch ball - valve faucet with a handle that ’s easy to turn with one hand
• PVC - to - faucet adapter that will screw into the back of the faucet
• Rubber O-ring that fits the back of the faucet
• Blender
• Sieve
• Pitcher
• 1 1/2 cups rum
• 4 limes
• About 90 minutes of your time
1 . If your watermelon is wobbly when standing on one end , use a knife to trim off the stem end of your watermelon rind just enough that the melon sits flat .
Then decide which side of your melon looks best — that ’ll be your front .
Cut the top jack - o’- lantern style , big enough to fit your hand through , but center the cut more toward the back of the melon so you ca n’t see the seam from the front .
2 . Use a big spoon to scoop out the fruit into a large bowl .
Eat some of the watermelon as you ’re scooping it out to make sure it does n’t poison your guests .
Pour any juice in the bottom of the melon into your pitcher .
3 . Drill a hole a few inches from the bottom of the melon for your faucet .
Then use a knife to slightly widen the hole till it ’s just a little smaller than the diameter of the back of the faucet .
4 . Gently screw the faucet into the hole , putting your other hand inside the melon for leverage .
Do n’t jam it in or you ’ll bruise the outside of the rind and compromise your seal .
Inside the melon , carve away a little more fruit from around the back of the faucet ( do n’t go through the rind ) to make room for screwing on the adapter .
5 . Slide the O-ring onto the back of the faucet , then screw on the adapter .
To test for leaks , fill the melon halfway with water , then turn on the faucet .
Once you ’ve confirmed that your watermelon is indeed operational , pour out the water through the top .
6 . Reserve some watermelon to eat tomorrow for breakfast , then throw the rest into a blender and puree .
Use the back of a spoon to push the puree through a sieve placed over your pitcher so you ’re left with just juice .
Discard any solids .
You should have about 6 cups of juice .
Mix the juice with 1 1/2 cups of rum and 1 /2 cup of fresh lime juice ( about four limes ’ worth ) .
7 . Pour the mixture back into the watermelon .
Put the top back on the melon and set it on the edge of a counter or table to serve .
If You Could Rejuvenate Three Parts Of Your Body
Suppose you find a lamp that contains a genie .
Suppose the genie grants you 3 wishes to make parts of your body young again .
You have to use the wishes by age 55 ( before most old age diseases become apparent ) or immediately if you are already over 50 .
The wishes are for only parts of the body .
Each could make an organ ( and the skin is an organ ) or subsystem ( e.g. immune cells or spine ) young again .
You could n't wish your entire chest or entire leg be young again .
But you could wish your heart or your muscles to return to youthfulness .
Also , you could wish any other single organ ( or pairs in the case of eyes , kidneys , or other organs that come in pairs or all the parathyroids that come in quadruplets ) to be young again .
Okay , with these restrictions in mind what would you wish to make young again in your body ?
A woman friend of mine would waste no time in wishing her skin young again .
No sags , discolorations , wrinkles .
But she'd be at least partially disappointed since the bones in her face and the rest of her body also age and shift around .
Also , one would really need to rejuvenate fat cells as well in order to rejuvenate the face .
Would you go for appearances ?
You could opt for younger skin , fat cells , and bones .
This would yield benefits other than with appearances .
Some people will have an easy decision to make if they already have heart problems or perhaps failing kidneys or liver damaged by hepatitis C or alcohol .
Imminent threats make prioritizing a much simpler task .
Before reading further have you made up your mind ?
Next I 'll say what I would choose for my top rejuvenation wishes .
The first thing I 'd go for is a totally rejuvenated vascular system .
This would greatly reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke among other cardiovascular diseases .
But it would also help the brain substantially by cutting back on brain microbleeds , probably reducing inflammation that leads to Alzheimer 's disease , and reducing risk of dementia .
My problem would be in deciding when to opt for the therapy .
At 50 ?
Or at 55 ?
If I wait longer will I suffer from some otherwise avoidable brain damage ?
Or will I benefit more by protecting my body into a more distant future ?
After the rejuvenated vascular system I would opt for a rejuvenated immune system .
Why ?
Of course some old folks die from influenza and other diseases because their immune systems are too weak .
But that is not my biggest reason .
One of the most interesting research reports of the last year reported aging immune systems become less able to kill early stage cancer cells .
If I could know exactly which organ I might get cancer I would opt to rejuvenate that organ .
But since I can't know which organ poses the biggest threat the next best way to cut my cancer risk ( short of total body rejuvenation ) is to make my immune system young again and far more able to kill aberrant cells before they develop into a full cancer .
Notice how I 'm not going for internal organ rejuvenation .
That 's because I do not know which internal organ of mine puts me at greatest risk .
Now , maybe 5 or 10 years from now blood tests and biopsies of internal organs will provide us much longer warnings of which organ looks likely to fail first .
In the future then I 'd want to have up - to - date lab tests before using my wishes .
Heck , given such wishes I would want to go for a full physical even with today 's testing capabilities .
But absent a firm idea on which organ will fail first my preferences lean toward the circulatory system and immune system .
My third choice is hardest .
I could just guess on some internal organ like the heart or maybe the liver or prostate and say " give me a new one " .
Maybe it would make sense to look at a list of causes of death and choose the organ that rates highest in combined causes .
For example , liver failure and liver cancer both kill .
But I 'm strongly biased toward rejuvenating my brain .
First off , doing so will boost my productivity .
Second , I 'll avoid the risk of assorted causes of dementia , especially when combined with vascular rejuvenation .
Plus , the brain does a lot of chemical endocrine signaling to the rest of the body ( e.g. from the hypothalamus ) .
That signaling will be done better by a younger brain .
So what 's your list ?
Got good reasons for rejuvenating one part of your body or another ?
Resources for MBA Students
Make the most of your business school experience with these resources on internships , course loads , networking , career development , and more .
There has been lots of discussion and buzz around the Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) lately .
I posted a few links about this last week .
Most of the articles that I have read on AWS speak of it from a high level .
General discussions about how the service allows your web application to increase capacity as required are interesting but I was curious about the interface that these services present application developers and to the Internet .
More specifically , how do the AWS interfaces compare with normal server colocation services .
Amazon AWS is actually a collection of services .
The Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) is the service most commonly discussed .
Other interesting services that are part of AWS include the Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) , SimpleDB and the Simple Queue Service ( SQS ) .
This article will only discuss EC2 but does not aim to be a EC2 tutorial .
Amazon provides a good user guide if you are sufficiently interested .
Everything below comes from an afternoon of experimentation with EC2 .
Please leave a comment with any corrections or other useful bits of information you might have .
Signing up
EC2 operates on a pay for what you use model .
As a result you need a credit card to use EC2 so Amazon can bill you once per month based on your usage .
The first step is to sign - up for an AWS account .
This account will give you access to AWS documentation and other content .
After you have an AWS account you can then enroll in EC2 .
It is at this point that the credit card is required .
All interaction with EC2 occurs over web service APIs .
Both REST and SOAP style interfaces are supported .
Web service authentication occurs via X.509 certificates or secret values depending on the web service API used .
Amazon nicely offers to generate an X.509 certificate and public / private keys for you .
Letting Amazon create the keys and the certificate is probably a good idea for most people since it is not an entirely trivial task .
However , depending on how paranoid you are you might want to create the keys locally .
Amazon says they do n’t store the private keys they generate and I have no reason to doubt them but generating the keys locally reduces the possibility that your private key will be compromised .
It ’s all about virtual machines
The fundamental unit in EC2 is a virtual machine .
If you have experience with Xen or VMWare you can think of EC2 as a giant computer capable of hosting thousands of virtual machines .
In fact , the virtualization technology used by EC2 is Xen .
At present only Linux based operating systems are supported but Amazon says that they are working towards supporting additional OS ’s in the future .
Since Xen already has the capability to host Windows and other operating systems this certainly should be possible .
All virtual machine images in EC2 are stored in Amazon ’s S3 data storage service .
Think of S3 as a file system in this context .
Each virtual machine image stored in S3 is assigned an Amazon Machine Image ( AMI ) identifier .
It is this identifier that serves as the name of the virtual machine image within EC2 .
Virtual machine images within EC2 can be instantiated to become a running instance .
Many instances of an image can be running at any one time .
Each instance has its own disks , memory , network connection etc so it is completely independent from the other instances booted from the same image .
Think of the virtual machine image as an operating system installation disk .
This is all very similar to VMWare and other virtualization technologies .
Amazon and the AWS community provide a large number of AMIs for various Linux distributions .
Some are general images while others are configured to immediately run a Ruby on Rails application or fill some other specialized role .
Of course it is also possible to create new AMIs either for public or private use .
Private images are encrypted such that only EC2 has access to them .
Since private images will likely contain proprietary code this is a necessary feature .
For an example of why you might want multiple images consider a three tier web application which consists of a web server tier , application tier and a database tier .
By having an AMI for each of these machine types the application author can quickly bring new virtual machines in any tier online without having to make configuration changes after the new instance has booted .
EC2 also allows a small amount of data to be passed to new instances .
This data can be used like command line arguments .
For example the address of a database server could be passed to the new instance .
Interacting with EC2
All interaction with EC2 occurs via very extensive web service APIs .
Creating and destroying new instances is trivial as is obtaining information on the running instances .
There is even a system in place for instances to obtain information about themselves such as their public IP address .
Where applicable , such as when starting a new virtual machine instance , these web service calls must be authenticated via a X.509 certificate or a secret value .
Since not everyone will want to write their own EC2 management software Amazon provides a set of command line utilities ( written in Java ) which wrap the web service APIs .
This allows the user to start , stop and manage EC2 instances from the command line .
Creating a new instance is as simple as :
./ec2-run-instances ami-f937d290 -k amazon
The ‘- k amazon ’ specifies the name of the SSH private key to use .
I ’ll come back to this in a bit .
Starting ten instances of this image can be accomplished by adding ‘-n 10 ’
./ec2-run-instances ami-f937d290 -n 10 -k amazon
It is also possible to look at the virtual machines console output .
Unfortunately , this is read - only .
Management activities are not possible via the console .
In this case the instance identifier is passed not the AMI .
./ec2-get-console-output i-8fad57e6
Again , all of the management activities happen via web service APIs so you can build whatever management software you require .
What do the VMs look like ?
Hardware platforms
At present Amazon offers three different virtual hardware platforms .
Small instance : 1.7 GB of memory , 1 EC2 Compute Unit ( 1 virtual core with 1 EC2 Compute Unit ) , 160 GB of instance storage , 32 - bit platform .
Large instance : 7.5 GB of memory , 4 EC2 Compute Units ( 2 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each ) , 850 GB of instance storage , 64 - bit platform .
Extra large instance : 15 GB of memory , 8 EC2 Compute Units ( 4 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each ) , 1690 GB of instance storage , 64 - bit platform .
Data storage
The storage layout of a small instance running a Fedora 8 image looks like the following :
- bash - 3.2 # cat / proc / partitions major minorÂ # blocks Â name Â Â 8Â Â Â Â 2Â 156352512 sda2 Â Â 8Â Â Â Â 3Â Â Â Â 917504 sda3 Â Â 8Â Â Â Â 1Â Â Â 1639424 sda1

Output from top :

Data persistence
The disk partitions attached to each instance are allocated when the reservation is created .
While these file systems will survive a reboot they will not survive shutting the instance down .
Also note that Amazon makes it clear that internal maintenance may shut down virtual machines .
This basically means that you cannot consider the disks attached to the reservations as anything more then temporary storage .
It is expected that applications running on the EC2 platform will make use of the S3 data storage service for data persistence .
In fact , signing up for the EC2 service automatically gives access to S3 .
Network configuration
Once instantiated each virtual machine has a single Ethernet interface and is assigned two IP addresses .
The IP address assigned to the Ethernet interface is a RFC - 1918 ( private ) address .
This address can be used for communication between EC2 instances .
The second address is a globally unique IP address .
This address is not actually assigned to an interface on the virtual machine .
Instead NAT is used to map the external address to the internal address .
This allows the instance to be directly addressed from anywhere on the Internet but does limit communication to using the protocols supported by Amazon ’s NAT system .
At present traffic to and from the virtual machines is limited to the common transport layer protocols ( TCP and UDP ) making it impossible to use other transport protocols such as SCTP or DCCP .
Both the internal and external IP addresses are assigned to new instances at boot time .
EC2 does not support static IP address assignment .
Authentication and Security
Firewall
Amazon implements firewall functionality in the NAT system which handles all public Internet traffic going to and from the EC2 instances .
When instantiated each instance can be assigned a group name or use the default group .
The group name functions like an access list .
Changing the access rules associated with a group is accomplished with the ec2 - authorize command .
The following example allows SSH , HTTP and HTTPS to a group named ‘ webserver ’ .
ec2 - authorize webserver - P tcp -p 22 ec2- authorize webserver - P tcp -p 80 ec2 - authorize webserver - P tcp -p 443
Instance authentication
The authentication method used to connect to an EC2 instance depends on whether or not you build your own images .
If you build your own image you can use whatever authentication or management solution you like .
Obvious examples include configuring the image with predefined usernames and passwords and using SSH or perhaps Webadmin .
Installing SSH keys for each user and disabling password authentication is probably the best choice .
Authentication when using the publicly available images is a little more complicated .
Having a default user / password combination or even default user SSH keys would allow other users to easily login to an instance booted from a publicly available image .
To get around this problem Amazon has created a system whereby you can register an SSH key with EC2 .
During the virtual machine imaging process the public portion of this SSH key is installed as the user key for the root user .
How is this different from normal server co-location ?
The biggest difference between server colocation and EC2 is the ephemeral nature of the resources in EC2 .
This is a positive property in that it is trivial to obtain new resources in EC2 .
On the negative side of things the fact that ‘ machines ’ can disappear and that other resources such as IP address assignments are unpredictable adds new complexities .
Machine failure
Amazon states that servers can be shut down during maintenance periods and of course hardware failures will happen .
Both of these events will result in virtual machine instances ‘ failing ’ .
Since disks and therefore the data that they contain disappear when instances die it seems that the complete failure of individual virtual servers is going to be a more common event than one might expect with traditional server co-location .
Consider that a massive power failure event in Amazon ’s data center (s ) will be the equivalent to a traditional colocation facility being destroyed .
Not only do you temporarily lose operational capability but each and every server and the data they were processing and storing would be gone .
In reality every large scale web service should plan for large failure events and individual server failure is also expected to happen regularly given enough nodes .
Perhaps deployment on EC2 will make these events just enough more likely to force developers to address them rather than implicitly assuming that they will never occur .
If anyone reading this has experience using EC2 I would love to hear about how often you experience virtual machine failure .
HTTP load balancing
Another interesting complication comes from the fact that EC2 does not support static IP address assignments .
Often large web deployments include a device operating as a load balancer in front of many web servers .
This may be a specialized device or another server running something like mod_proxy .
Using example.com as an example , a typical deployment would point the DNS A records for www.example.com to the load balancer devices .
When colocating a server it is normal to be assigned a block of IP addresses for your devices .
This makes it easy to replace a failed load balancer node without requiring DNS changes .
However , in the case of EC2 you do not know the IP address of your load balancer node until it has booted .
As already discussed , this node can disappear and when its replacement comes back online it will be assigned a different IP address .
This presents a problem because the Internet ’s DNS infrastructure relies on the ability of DNS servers to cache information .
The length of time that a particular DNS record is cached is called the time to live ( TTL ) .
Within the TTL time a DNS server will simply return the last values it obtained for www.example.com rather than traversing the DNS hierarchy to obtain a new answer .
The dynamic nature of IP address assignment inside EC2 does not mix well with long TTL values .
Imagine a TTL value of one day for www.example.com and the failure of the load balancer node .
The result would be up to a full day where portions of the Internet would be unable to reach www.example.com.
Perhaps more inconvenient would be the user seeing another EC2 customer ’s site if the address was reassigned .
In order to work around this problem one solution is to use a very low TTL value .
This is the approach taken by AideRSS .

AideRSS is using a sixty second TTL for the aiderss.com A record .
This means that every sixty seconds all DNS servers must expire the cached value and go looking for a new value .
Another site hosted on EC2 is Mogulus ( just found them when looking for EC2 customers ) .
They take a slightly nicer approach to this problem .

Rather than a single A record with a very low TTL Mogulus uses two A records pointing to two different EC2 nodes and a TTL of 7200 seconds ( two hours ) .
Personally , I consider these low TTL values ( especially the 60s one ) to be mildly anti-social behavior because it forces additional work on DNS servers throughout the Internet to deal with a local problem .
Amazon should consider adding the ability to statically provision IP addresses .
This would allow the Internet facing EC2 nodes to have consistent addresses and thereby reduce the failover problems .
Like everything else in EC2 , this could be charged by usage .
I ’d be happy to pay a few dollars ( 5 , 10 , x ? ) a month for single IP v4 address within EC2 that I could assign to a node of my choosing .
Pricing
Unless you are reading this close to the date it was written it is probably a good idea to visit Amazon for pricing information instead of relying on the data here .
Instance time
When I first starting investigating EC2 I misinterpreted EC2 ’s pricing .
I thought that instance usage was charged on a CPU time basis .
This would effectively mean that an idle server would cost next to nothing .
The correct interpretation is that billing is based on how long the instance is running not how much CPU it uses .
The current EC2 pricing is :
$ 0.10 / hour – Small Instance
$ 0.40 / hour – Large Instance
$ 0.80 / hour – Extra Large Instance
This makes the constant use of a single small instance cost $ 70 / month .
Pretty reasonable especially when you consider that you do not have to buy the hardware .
Data transfer
Using EC2 also incurs data transfer charges .
Data transfer into EC2 from the Internet : $ 0.10 / GB .
Data transfer out of EC2 to the Internet : $ 0.18 / GB ( gets cheaper if you use > 10 TB / month ) .
Data transfer between EC2 nodes and to / from the S3 persistent storage service is free .
Note that S3 has its own pricing structure .
Summary
In a lot of ways EC2 is similar to server location services .
At its lowest level EC2 gives you a ‘ server ’ to work with .
Given the prices outlined above using EC2 as a colocation replacement may be a good choice depending on your requirements .
What really makes EC2 interesting is its API and dynamic nature .
The EC2 API makes it possible for resources such as servers and the hosting environment in general to become a component of your application instead of something which the application is built on .
Applications built on EC2 have the ability to automatically add and remove nodes as demands change .
Replacing failed nodes can also be automated .
Giving applications the ability to respond to their environment is very intriguing idea .

Lending Club is the “ Amazon of Person to Person Lending ” sites .
Why is that ?
Well , partially because last week I referred to Prosper as the Ebay of Lending .
The other reason I refer to Lending Club as the Amazon of P2P Loans is because of their lending process .
Making loans through Lending Club is set up like an on - line store – you find a loan and you “ buy it . ”
To fund a loan , you first select the loan you wish to fund .
Then click the loan button and it updates your portfolio ( just like your shopping cart ) .
When you review your portfolio , you have the option to Start Over ( empty cart ) , Add More Loans ( continue shopping ) , or Check Out ( check out ) .
OK , I bet you did n’t need that last one !
As long as you are familiar with on - line shopping , you can use Lending Club to make loans .
Now let ’s look at the details .
There are two methods for making loans with Lending Club :
Individual loans selected by the lender .
Lendingmatch™ , Lending Club ’s target portfolio composition .
1. Individual loans selected by the lender .
I chose to make loans with Lending Club using this method because there is more long term flexibility in selecting my own loan and the minimum loan is only $ 25 .
It is very easy to fund a loan at $ 25 , in fact , if you use this link to sign up , Lending Club will give you your first $ 25 that you can use to fund a loan .
2. Lendingmatch™ , Lending Club ’s target portfolio composition .
This method preselects the loan allocation for the lender based upon their selected risk level .
There are 9 risk levels lenders can choose , each with an interest rate corresponding to the level of risk .
This method is good because it allows lenders to select a target and forget it .
However , there is a $ 500 minimum to lend with this method .
I chose not to lend using this method because my current Lending Club portfolio is $ 100 .
I hope to grow that over time , but as for now , I chose individual loans .
Making a Loan with Lending Club
I made three loans with Lending Club , each at $ 25 .
The blended return rate for those loans is 9.70 % , which certainly is n’t the highest possible rate , but is still a nice return on investment if everything goes to plan .
The loans I funded had a high rating and have a good chance of being paid in full .
As mentioned above , making a loan with Lending Club is much like making an on - line purchase .
The first thing you do is select an individual loan or portfolio plan , then click the “ Loan ” button .
It will take you to a screen that displays the loan in your portfolio .
My first impression was that there was no confirmation page , but in fact , there are two more steps to go before the loan is official .
The first is to click the “ Check Out ” button , then you need to confirm the loan once you check out .
Much like shopping with Amazon , you ca n’t “ accidentally ” fund a loan .
You must consciously select the loan to make it happen .
My Impression of Lending Club
I think Lending Club is providing a good service to lenders and borrowers alike .
Borrowers have the opportunity to get a better interest rate on loans , and lenders have the opportunity to “ be the bank , ” and earn more interest on their money than it would earn in a regular bank account or CD .
The lending process is easy to understand , secure , and offers a good reward for the risk you take .
I currently have $ 100 in my account and plan on growing that as time and moey allow .
Try it out at virtually no risk !
If P2P lending intrigues you , now is a great time to try it out with little to no risk on your end .
You can even set up a Lending Club as a Roth IRA , and save on taxes down the road .
New Lender Referral Bonus from Lending Club .
Lending Club is currently offering new lenders a Sign Up Bonus for creating a new investor account .
All you need to do is register your account and make your first deposit and you will receive the $ 25 bonus .
You must use this special link to receive the bonus money : Lending Club new lender bonus .
Prosper is also giving new lenders $ 25 to sign up , but you have to fund a loan before you get the bonus , and the minimum loan is $ 50 .
So , it will only cost $ 25 to try the lending process .
Prosper also has a referral program , so you can again refer people and make money .
Keep in mind the bonus is not paid unless the person you refer either makes a loan or borrows money .
The best way to beat one is NOT to get one , so we 'll deal with that first .
WHAT NOT TO DO :
1 . Do n't act like a dick .
If you act like a belligerent idiot , you will end up with a lot more than just a speeding ticket .
More likely you will end up in jail with your car impounded !
2 . Do not admit guilt .
Say nothing , if possible .
The cop can use your admission against you in court .
Better to say nothing or act dumb ( see below )
WHAT YOU MUST DO :
1. Say " yes Officer , no Officer " to everything .
You want this over with - fast !
2 . Act stupid .
It helps , even cops do n't want to torture the stupid !
3 . Act scared !
As if the tickets means the end of your life !
Again , cops waver at this point .
They may not write it if they feel sorry for you .
4 . Act ignorant about what you did .
Even if they give you a ticket at least you did n't admit you were speeding , which they will use in court against you later .
IF YOU GET A TICKET :
1 . Do n't argue the situation out on the road - you will not win !
You do n't want them to remember you when you do go to court .
SAY NOTHING - then drive away .
2. Remember everything about the situation !
How much traffic , the weather , which lane you were in .
Write it down if you are too stoned to remember this stuff .
AFTER YOU GET THE TICKET / PRE - TRIAL PLEA OR APPEARANCE
1. Always plead ' not guilty . '
This may be a pre-trial appearance , or you may be able to send in the ticket with ' not guilty ' plea .
Try to delay a pre-trial appearance if possible .
There will be a specified date if you have to mail in the plea .
AS THE COURT DATE APPROACHES :
1. Very important .
DELAY , DELAY , DELAY !!!!!!
Keep putting off that court date !
You do n't want to go to court !
You want to make it so the cop thinks the case is so far in the past he 'll never remember anything .
A small story : When John Hussar , the director of The Blur of Insanity went to college he got a speeding ticket ( 90 mph in a 55 mph zone ) from a New York State Trooper .
He successfully put off going to court for two and a half years ( mainly by lying about going on various trips to Europe ) !!
When he final did show up in court he discovered that the Trooper had been transferred out of the area !
The case was immediately dismissed !
The Lesson ?
The longer you wait the better chance the cop wo n't show up !
2. Request information ( optional , it can work for you , or make them want to nail you more ! )
Also they may or may not give you any of this depending on local laws ! :
a.Copies of manufacturers names , including makes , models and serial numbers of all radar / laser guns in use by the Town / City / State Police Department .
b. Copies of manufacturers recommended maintenance for all of the above stated radar guns .
c. Copies of any manufacturer literature as it relates to the correct use , including but not limited to mounting , aiming , weather and traffic limitations , for all radar guns in use by the Town / City / State Police Department .
d. A copy of the past six months ' maintenance records for all of the above stated radar guns , including , but not limited to , calibration specifications .
e. A copy of the Authorized Certification of Training , issued to the Officer who gave you the ticket , in the proper use of all radar guns in use by that Town / City / State Police Department he / she works for .
f. A copy of the patrol car assignments for the date you got the ticket .
This should give you something to work with , and also make the cop not want to show up to deal with all this crap !
COURT - A FRIGHTENING PLACE
What happens in court :
Go check in with the clerk .
See if your officer arrives , if he does n't that will often be the end right there .
The judge will call your case .
The officer will testify first .
You then question the officer
You then call any witnesses you have
The officer can make a closing statement
You can make a closing statement
The judge decides .
1 . Wear a suit , if you own one .
If you look like a derelict , you will be treated like a derelict .
We do n't care if you think that is unfair !
The world is not fair - grow up .
2 . Be nice .
Again , being a dick will just get you in trouble and solves nothing .
3. IT is the officers duty to prove you GUILTY .
If he fails to prove your guilt the case will be dismissed .
BE confident that you will win the case !
Check the actual wording of the code you violated .
If the officer fails to prove guilt in any part of the code then you should be dismissed .
BEFORE an officer can use the radar / laser reading as evidence , he has to establish a few things Jurisdiction Certification , up to date , accurate , traffic and engineering survey , radar / laser properly calibrated , tuning forks calibrated ( with radar ) , FCC license , radar / laser unit appears on that FCC license
If the officer attempts to use the radar reading before establishing those things above , politely interrupt and say " objection your honor , inadmissible evidence . "
Then tell the judge why .
If the officer fails to prove your guilt at the end of his testimony do n't question him , move to have the case dismissed .
And explain what he failed to prove .
If the officer was moving when was his speedometer last calibrated ?
Have the records to see if he contradicts himself .
If officer guesses your speed .
throw something and ask him how fast it was going .
If he is off by 3 MPH at 15 MPH speed then think about how far off he is at 35 MPH .
Were the speed limits prima facie ? or Absolute ?
If prima facie then prove the speed you were traveling at was n't unsafe .
ASK questions like : what color clothes was I wearing ?
did I have any passengers ?
What was the weather like ?
To see how well versed the officer is .
See if you can attend traffic school in exchange for a dismissal of the charge ( never bothers your insurance . )
OFTEN the worst part of a ticket is the increase in your insurance .
By beating the ticket you do n't have to worry about that ...
Hopefully the cop wo n't show up - in which case you will ask that the case be dismissed - 99 % of the time it will .
Anyway - there you have it .
Good Luck .
And if you beat a speeding ticket with any of this advice you have to make ten people you know go and see the movie !
ADVICE ON DWI TEST COMING NEXT
Google Earth is getting better and better and will soon be almost as good as actually being there .
Do n’t beleive me ?
I decided to pick a couple of shots and line up the same view in Google earth to compare .
This first photo is from San Bruno Mountain ( original photo here ) , showing the San Francisco skyline :
You should definitely click through to see the full - sized version .
The version on the right is missing the flowers in the foreground and the clouds are a little different but otherwise it ’s very recognizable .
Here ’s another shot of San Francisco , this one from the bay ( original photo here ) .
I thought this would show off the detail of some of the 3d buildings in Google Earth .
I had a hard time lining up a large screenshot because the photo was taken at 8 x zoom , but you get the idea .
Again , you should click though to the full sized version to get the full effect .
What do you think ?
Will Google Earth evolve to the point where no one will ever need to travel ?
My guess is that people will still get wanderlust and until Google unveils a food modem you ’ll have to go get the sourdough yourself .
Let me know if you liked these in the comments and I ’ll do a few more .

Heather Squires was the designated driver .
Never exactly a fun thing , but a college buddy of her husband 's was driving up from Tucson to celebrate his acceptance into law school .
So when her husband , Jason , asked , Heather said yes .
At Chuy 's in Tempe , Heather 's brother and her husband and the soon - to - be - law - school student knocked off four pitchers of beer .
Everybody was having a great time .
Around 9:30 p.m. , they decided to head home .
So they piled into Jason Squires ' new pickup truck .
As planned , Heather drove .
Info Arizona DUI laws
They did n't get very far .
A motorcycle cop spotted the truck as Heather drove through the intersection of Baseline Road and Mesa Drive .
Not familiar with the truck , she 'd failed to flip on her lights .
Soon the cop was flipping on his — and they were flashing .
Heather was ordered out of the vehicle and almost immediately handcuffed .
She was taken to the Mesa Police Department and charged with both driving under the influence and driving with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit .
The truck was searched , then impounded .
Party 's over .
Heather Squires was no different from any of the thousands of people who 've been charged with DUI this year in Arizona .
They drank , they got busted , and now — thanks to the toughest DUI laws in the nation — they can expect jail time , big fines , and an ignition interlock .
Except for one thing .
Heather Squires ' blood alcohol content that night was 0.00 .
The records prove , beyond the shadow of a doubt , that she was an exemplary designated driver .
She had n't had a drop to drink .
Heather Squires is a 29 - year - old legal assistant , but with long blond hair and wholesome good looks , she resembles nothing so much as a fresh - scrubbed high school student .
So it does n't surprise me that the Mesa policeman 's first question was , " How old are you ? "
On a dark night , it would be easy to assume she was underage and out past curfew .
The problem is , she was n't .
Was n't underage , was n't past curfew , was n't drunk .
Was n't even drinking .
The arrest should never have happened .
And though Mesa police quietly dismissed the charges against her a month later , I think her case still raises serious questions .
Let 's face it .
The DUI situation in Arizona is out of control .
As I reported earlier this year , drivers are getting popped after just one or two drinks , with blood alcohol contents far below the legal limit .
But Heather 's case is the only one I 've seen in which the driver drank nothing .
It certainly makes me wonder whether her treatment was related to the fact that her husband , Jason , is a DUI attorney based in Mesa .
A few months before Heather 's arrest , in fact , he helped a client beat the rap for extreme DUI at a jury trial , even though records suggest the guy was guilty .
The officer who arrested the guy ?
Bond Gonzalez — the same cop who would arrest Heather Squires .
I would call that a remarkable coincidence , except I 'm not so sure it is a coincidence .
The truck , after all , was registered to Jason Squires .
And when Gonzalez began questioning Heather , Jason immediately identified himself from the back seat , as Gonzalez 's report confirms .
Gonzalez wrote in the report that he did not recognize Squires for quite some time .
In fact , when Squires showed his bar card to verify that he's an attorney , Gonzalez wrote that Squires was attempting to claim he worked for the county attorney .
I find the officer 's report a little disingenuous .
The Squireses agree that , upon his pulling them over , Gonzalez was almost immediately hostile .
Rather than ask Heather Squires whether she 'd had anything to drink , he ordered her out of the truck .
Then he immediately ordered her to do a field sobriety test .
Sensing trouble , Jason Squires advised her to refuse .
" I did n't like the way this was happening , " he explains .
" At that point , I 'm not going to trust him to be fair . "
It did n't help that the area where they were standing was covered in thick gravel and Heather Squires was wearing strappy heels .
As any DUI lawyer knows , that 's setting a driver up for failure .
Now , the law is clear .
If you refuse a blood test , the police confiscate your license right away and suspend it for a year .
By refusing , you 're admitting guilt .
But that is not true for field sobriety tests .
They are supposed to be optional .
That 's not how Gonzalez handled it .
When Heather Squires refused the field tests , Gonzalez said he had no choice : " If you 're not going to do these , I 'm putting you under arrest . "
" What for ? " Jason Squires asked , incredulous .
He knew his wife had n't been drinking .
Within minutes , she was in cuffs anyway .
The Mesa police are equipped with portable Breathalyzers — a test that would have shown immediately that Squires was not intoxicated .
But Gonzalez never administered one .
And though Gonzalez 's supervisor showed up , he never administered a breath test , either .
In total , five cops reported to the scene .
( Nice use of Mesa 's tax dollars , eh ? )
And not one of them did anything to stop the madness .
Not one of them noticed that the woman they were arresting was as sober as an undertaker .
The next day , Jason Squires filed an Internal Affairs complaint , alleging retaliation .
He and Heather say there will be a lawsuit .
The Mesa police see things a bit differently .
Detective Steve Berry , a spokesman for the department , tells me that by refusing the field test , Heather Squires " forced " Gonzalez 's hand .
" He had to look at the totality of the situation , " Berry says .
" You have a car where the other two individuals are clearly drinking .
He smells alcohol .
And then you have someone driving without their headlights , not willing to do field sobriety tests — he 's left with few options at that point . "
Berry adds that Gonzalez likely had no idea whom he was pulling over .
Yes , police typically run license plates before making a traffic stop , but they 're mostly checking to make sure a vehicle is n't stolen .
He 's skeptical that Gonzalez actually recognized Squires ' name .
But as scary as it is to think that the police harassed the wife of a DUI lawyer , I think the other option is almost scarier .
And that 's this :
In this time of anti-DUI zeal , are police so eager to make arrests that everyone on the road at night is presumed to be a drunk driver ?
It 's interesting to read the affidavit that Officer Gonzalez wrote that night about Heather Squires , intending to ask the Motor Vehicles Division of ADOT to yank her license .
( He never mailed it — possibly because of the blood - test results . )
It describes " bloodshot and watery eyes . "
" Flushed face . "
" Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from breath . "
All this on a woman who was sober .
Anyone at that scene should have noticed that Heather Squires did n't smell of alcohol , that her eyes were n't bloodshot , that her face was n't flushed .
She was n't , after all , drunk .
But that 's not what they wanted to see .
There 's no one who understands that better than Jason Squires .
Two months ago , when Squires questioned Officer Gonzalez in court for that extreme DUI arrest he'd made , Gonzalez admitted that he'd pull people over at night for things he'd never bust them for during the day .
And when a juror asked if he had a quota , Gonzalez replied that he liked to arrest three people per night .
So what if some of them are sober , right ?
One month after her arrest , Heather Squires is still nervous behind the wheel .
" Particularly when I 'm in Mesa , " she admits .
" Like , I would not want to call them in an emergency — the people you think are there to help you and assist you are not . "
Even knowing that she was sober , she says , she agonized over whether the charges would be dismissed .
Keep in mind , this is coming from a woman whose husband handles DUI cases for a living .
Most of us would have been on our own .
Honestly , I do n't want to believe that Officer Gonzalez sought out the lawyer who beat him in court — and then penalized his wife when she 'd done nothing wrong .
But a rogue cop is almost preferable to a system that 's stacked against motorists who want nothing more than to get home at night .
Those people might not be as sober as Heather Squires proved to be , but after one or two drinks , I 'm willing to bet that they do n't have bloodshot eyes or reek of booze .
You 're still going to read that in the police report .
That 's how the system works these days .
" We have to fight this , " Jason Squires tell me , " for all the people out there who can 't . "
It 's going to be a lonely fight in this teetotaler 's paradise .
But if nothing else , I bet he 's got the Mesa PD 's attention .
Drive carefully , Jason .
( CNN ) --
An aggressive wildfire has burned 10 homes and spread across 3,000 acres in Northern California , officials said Thursday .
A wildfire in the Santa Cruz Mountains is causing mandatory evacuations for neighboring homes .
Flames were threatening at least 50 more homes , the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said .
About 200 children at a 4 - H Club camp were told to take immediate shelter as high winds fanned the flames in the Santa Cruz mountains .
The wildfire was burning in rugged terrain in Santa Clara County and moving south towards Santa Cruz County , south of San Francisco .
About 190 people from the two counties had been evacuated , officials said .
The Summit Fire began around 5:30 a.m. PT ( 8:30 a.m. ET ) Thursday near Mount Madonna County Park in Santa Clara County .
Five fixed - wing aircraft and four helicopters were dropping water on the fire , fanned by sustained winds of 15 mph to 20 mph with gusts up to 40 mph .
Officials ordered a so - called Supertanker , a jumbo jet modified to battle fires from the air .

Voting in St Petersburg :
The city was Mr Putin 's launch pad
First deputy PM Dmitry Medvedev - the Kremlin 's chosen candidate - is expected to easily beat his three challengers , correspondents say .
But the Kremlin wanted a good turnout to counter criticism that the vote was not fair .
Various inducements were offered to mobilise voters , including cheap food , free cinema tickets or toys , correspondents say .
There are also reports that many workers were told to vote by their bosses .
The election brings to a close Vladimir Putin 's eight years in office .
Observers say the poll 's outcome is not in doubt .
Mr Medvedev , 42 , the Kremlin 's preferred candidate , has promised to make Mr Putin his prime minister .
The electoral commission chief , Vladimir Churov , said turnout was higher than in the December parliamentary election .
CANDIDATES FOR POWER Dmitry Medvedev : First deputy prime minister and chairman of Gazprom , endorsed by President Putin Gennady Zyuganov : Veteran Communist Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky : Ultra-nationalist leader Andrei Bogdanov : Little - known head of small Democratic Party
Wooed with caps and food In pictures : Russia votes Q&A : Russian elections
But the independent Russian election watchdog Golos has condemned what it sees as coercion to ensure a high turnout .
" There can't be a small turnout when people are forced to go to the polls , " said Golos deputy director Grigory Melkonyan , quoted by the AFP news agency .
But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the turnout showed that many people " are choosing to vote for a continuation of the changes " made by Mr Putin .
The BBC's Richard Galpin in Vladivostok , in the Far East , says there was barely any campaigning by any of the candidates and little excitement amongst the electorate .
Medvedev media blitz
Mr Putin , hugely popular because of Russia 's economic boom , was barred by the constitution from seeking a third term .
How Russians will vote through the day
Enlarge Map
In the run-up to the vote Russia 's main television channels gave generous coverage to Mr Medvedev , who refused to debate with his rivals .
The other candidates are : Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov , nationalist Liberal Democrat Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Democratic Party candidate Andrei Bogdanov .
More than 109 million Russians were registered to vote in the elections .
Voting closes in the western enclave of Kaliningrad at 1800 GMT on Sunday .
Pressure to vote
Mr Medvedev voted in Moscow , saying " spring has arrived - although it is raining , a new season has come " .
Before his rise to power in the Kremlin he trained as a lawyer in St Petersburg , where he also worked alongside Vladimir Putin .
But unlike Mr Putin , he has no background in the security services .
There has been very little scrutiny of voting by Western election observers , many of whom stayed away .
Civil servants were ordered by their managers to vote , and there are reports that police and teachers were under similar pressure , our correspondent in Vladivostok says .
A prominent critic of the Kremlin , former chess champion Garry Kasparov , told the BBC that support for Mr Putin and his allies was not self - evident .
" Mr Putin never stood for free and fair elections and when you talk about his big numbers they are obviously inflated by the pro-Kremlin polling organisations " , he said .
Western criticism
The main European election monitoring body - the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) - decided not to send a delegation .
It said the Russian authorities were planning to impose unacceptable restrictions on its work .
The OSCE complained about Russian limits on the number of observers and on the duration of their stay .
In a sign of continuing unrest in the Caucasus , two bomb explosions targeted a police convoy on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan .
Several people were reported injured in the attack in Khasavyurt , near the border with Chechnya .
Hillary Clinton Lied About Ohio Woman Who Was Denied Treatment
While on the campaign trail Hillary Clinton has been telling a story about a pregnant woman whose baby was stillborn , and who also died because of complications during chilbirth .
She has been using this story as a way to tout her socialized heath care plan .
While the woman and the baby in the story did in fact die , Mrs. Clinton ’s storytelling does n’t quite match what actually happened .
hospital administrators said Friday that Ms. Bachtel was under the care of an obstetrics practice affiliated with the hospital , that she was never refused treatment and that she was , in fact , insured .
Furthermore , the hospital wants her to stop telling her lies .
“ We implore the Clinton campaign to immediately desist from repeating this story , ” said Rick Castrop , chief executive officer of the O’Bleness Health System .
While it is not shocking that Hillary Clinton would stoop so low as to lie about a woman and a baby who died during childbirth for her own political gain , it is still depicable .
I have said it time and time again and I will say it again , there is no level the Clinton ’s wo n’t stoop to regain the White House .
This is just another example .
In that regard , they never disappoint , do they ?
Read the NY Times article here .
A new wave of women ’s liberation is crashing on an unexpected shore , the world of free and open source developers .
The FOSS communities might pride themselves with being the promoters of free , open and transparant .
It is a world where a meritocracy rules , where you are judged by your skills and not by who you are of who you know .
Right ?
Wrong !
In the wake of the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit the grand master of free software , Richard Stallman , received a lot of flack due a remark that was considered sexist .
This week Canonical ’s Mark Shuttleworth , by most accounts the mr .
Nice Guy in the FOSS world , found himself in the firing line because of a remark in his LinuxCon keynote which he no doubt considered to be funny but was condescending to women .
The responses to Stallman ’s and Shuttleworth ’s remarks are no isolated incidents .
The women in the FOSS community are making themselves heard .
And the men should pay attention .
First , a bit of a reconstruction
Bruce Byfield wrote his article “ Richard Stallman , Leadership , and Sexism ” almost apologetically .
He noticed that while blogs were accusing Stallman of sexism , the regular free software press remained quiet about it .
Bruce found he had some difficulties reconstructing what RMS actually had said on the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit , but at least some in the audience took offense about Stallman ’s remarks and found them to be sexist .
Fortunately Matthew Garrett published a transcription of the presentation in question .
The words that were regarded as sexist were part of Stallman ’s Saint Ignucius routine :
And we also have the cult of the virgin of emacs .
The virgin of emacs is any female who has not yet learned how to use emacs .
And in the church of emacs we believe that taking her emacs virginity away is a blessed act .
Garrett drew a twofold conclusion .
Is Stallman a sexist ?
Not really , but for someone with a proclaimed positive attitude towards women he showed a definite lack of introspection :
One of the frequent counterarguments against this being sexist is that RMS has often spoken out against sexism ( see here , for example ) .
It ’s very easy to claim to be free of sexism .
It ’s much harder to perform the degree of introspection required to understand whether any of your actions are motivated by viewing genders differently .
Do I believe that Richard is attempting to deliberately denigrate women ?
Not in the slightest .
But I also do n’t believe that someone entirely gender - blind would have made the above joke .
Stallman was tapped on the shoulder by David Schlesinger who first send him an e-mail and later published the response .
The gist of Stallman ’s position : ‘ hey , it ’s only meant as a joke ’ .
Byfield also points to an earlier incident , this time in the presentation “ Perform like a pr0n star ” bu Matt Aimonetti at the Golden Gate Ruby Conference in April 2009 .
Matt did apologize for that presentation , though the following phrase is worth repeating here ( emphasis mine ) :
Now that I have explained my view point as clearly as I can , I would also like to express my sincere regret that this situation has brought bad publicity to Rails and the loss of one of the Activism team members .
I understand how people who are concerned about gender equality could have taken my presentation badly and misjudge my intentions , if they did not know me .
Kirrily Robert wrote an article about this way of apologizing and gave some pointed suggestions on how much better Matt could have handled this .
Byfield did an encore on September 9 , 2009 in an article called “ Sexism : Open Source Software ’s Dirty Little Secret “ .
The direct lead for this article was the announcement of the Free Software Foundation sponsored mini-summit on Women in Free Software .
This time Byfield brought some facts into the discussion :
in the proprietary software world 28 % of those involved are women , in the free software world it is 1.5 % ( do n’t miss the dot ) ;
in Drupal and KDE 12 % of contributors are female ;
women hardly have positions on the boards of prominent FOSS projects .
No women on the Free Software Foundation board , no women on the Linux Foundation ’s board .
GNOME and KDE each have one woman on the board .
Katherine Noyes picked up on the Byfield article and wrote the piece “ Is sexism rampant in FOSS ? “ .
She collected quotes from various discussions on this topic , from the highly emotional responses to the more eloquent ones .
In one of them the 2005 study by Yuwei Lin appears , entitled “ Inclusion , diversity and gender equality : Gender Dimensions of the Free / Libre Open Source Software Development ” ( PDF ) .
As main points from this study were mentioned :
“ Strong long - hour coding culture
A lack of ‘ mentors ’ and role models
Discriminatory language online and / or offline ( e.g. phrases in documentaries )
A gendered text - based environment
Lack of a women - centered view in FLOSS development
A male - dominated competitive worldview
No sympathy from women peers
Overall , the conclusion was that the FOSS world was too much a guy ’s world where sexist remarks , foul language and sarcastic humor is part of - what one commenter described as- the ‘ locker room ’ culture .
The Mark Shuttleworth faux pas came to the fore in an open letter to him , written by Kirrily Robert .
Robert takes offense at Shuttleworth ’s remark that Linux is ‘ hard to explain to girls ‘ .
Kirrily knows what she is talking about , having initiated the Geek Feminism Blog and presenting a well - received part on OSCON about the topic earlier this year .
Her main point ?
If Mark had kept up with events in 2009 he would have thought twice about a remark like that :
2009 is shaping up to be a watershed year for women in open source .
We have seen numerous high profile incidents where men have made remarks in conference presentations which have dismissed , marginalised , or upset women ; we ’ve seen an increase in discussion on blogs , mailing lists , and twitter / identica ; many conferences have invited speakers ( including myself ) to keynote on the subject of inclusivity and diversity ; and a number of efforts towards recruiting and supporting a more diverse open source community have been launched .
In light of the attention the subject has been getting of late , your comment at LinuxCon seems oblivious at best , and only serves to further damage the Linux community ’s reputation .
The owner of Tuxmachines , also a woman , wrote the article “ Boycott Ubuntu “ .
Her position against Ubuntu is partly based on the distribution itself , but the derogative remark by Shuttleworth triggered a for more interesting response .
She was fed up with adapting to the masculine culture in FOSS , setting it aside as ‘ boys will be boys ’ .
This attitude stayed with me throughout my life .
So , when women were being insulted and treated like sex objects in FOSS , I accepted that ’s just the way men are .
They ’ve always been that way and they always would .
But when someone of such prominence insults the intelligence of women , I think things have gone too far .
Sure , I do n’t like what he said , but I still defend his right to say it .
But if he wants to act like a misogynist perhaps it ’s time to enact a action I ’ve always wanted to do here at tuxmachines .
Sam Varghese already shot some bullets back at the open letter , realizing that he is n’t considered the geek feminists best friend .
I ’m sure I ’ll be shouted down too – but it does n’t bother me one whit simply because this whole argument is never rational , it ’s overly emotional .
In defense he refers to an article he wrote on sexism in the Debian project .
Roy Schestowitz , who has been attacking Ubuntu on the Mono issue for some time , does n’t feel the call to boycott Ubuntu is justified :
In my humble assessment , the biggest problem Free software might be facing is software patents ; womanisers , resistance to feminism and misogynists are true issues , but they exist in many aspects of computing ; they are not exclusive to Free software or specific to particular distributions of software and there is nothing about “ closed ” or “ open ” in the software sense which implies openness or closeness when it comes to other religions , sexes , races , and nationalities .
Would I dare to transliterate this ( and why should n’t I ) , it would be like : “ Sorry girls , it happens , do n’t fret about it , there are more important issues at stake ” .
Is there an issue with sexism in FOSS ?
The answer to this question should be ‘ yes , there is an issue ’ , though disagreement might arise where the issue comes from .
When going through the various articles that appeared in recent months and seeing the comments on those articles , the picture is n’t that good .
The overall impression ( and I am talking about a broad perspective here ) is that two main responses dominate .
One , the “ there is n’t an issue with sexism , it ’s only some isolated cases but nothing structural ” - argument .
And second , the “ it ’s an issue because the women make it an issue ” - argument .
This one is accompanied by the “ We ’re sorry they are so touchy about the subject , we ’ll promise to do better ” - response .
One proponent of the latter argument is Hans Bezemer .
He took position on the issue in two articles , “ Feminism ’s dirty little secret ” and “ Succesful women in FOSS and IT “ .
Well , for the record : I ’m not an anti-feminist .
I consider myself to be a FOSS proponent and there is only one thing that counts to me : great code .
I do n’t care whether you are black or white , atheist or Christian , male or female .
I do n’t check the “ About ” boxes before I give my judgment .
Great code is just great code .
It ’s what FOSS is all about : meritocracy .
Because I ’m convinced that is the real driving force of FOSS , not “ sexism ” as some are trying to make us believe .
In his second article he quotes women who disagree with the focus on the position of women in FOSS .
Hans takes a shot at Carla Schroder , managing editor of Linux Today , who -he claims - is putting sexism in FOSS on the agenda without allowing for differing opinions .
That ’s quite an accusation .
But , Carla does describe a FOSS world that is n’t fun to be in :
Where to start … for me FOSS has been the best and the worst .
Great people and great opportunities ; and some of the worst twits ever .
Being told I write great howtos for a girl , and that girls are naturally better at writing .. not being able to get any Linux sys / network admin jobs when I know I ’m way more qualified than the rude young white male twits that get hired … getting hit on , my body as a topic of conversation like I ’m not even there , seeing rage flash in a man ’s eyes when I stand up to him , and that rage is not there for men… being ignored and dismissed and having to push a hundred times as hard to get recognition … for a time I used a man ’s name online because I was so tired of the garbage , and what a difference .
Suddenly there was respect .
If Linux and FOSS were not so cool and rewarding , if I were not so stubborn , I would have moved on to something else long ago .
Because nobody should be expected to endure so much crap under any circumstances .
Is it unique for the FOSS world ?
Hardly , but does that make it acceptable ?
Schroder points to a more fundamental issue when see looks at the line - up for LinuxCon .
The presenters make for a nice diversity of men .
I ’m guessing some of my friends at the Foundation and at Linuxcon might be a bit upset with what I ’m saying .
They work hard and put a lot of themselves into the Foundation and Linux .
That makes us even because I ’m upset with them , because in this here year of 2009 , well into the new millennium , it ’s ridiculous to be this tone - deaf towards women in Linux and FOSS .
The next wave of feminism
One thing is sure , women in FOSS are making themselves heard all across the board , making use of opportunities to press forward the issue of sexism in FOSS .
Kirrily Robert , she was mentioned a few times already , used her time on the O’Reilly Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) for the Standing Out in the Crowd presentation .
Her presentation can be seen online .
She is also responsible for the Geek Feminism Blog and the Geek Feminism Wiki .
Her presentation at OSCON was well - received , I ’ll mention a few main points :
in most technical communities women are in a minority , anywhere between 10 % to 30 % , 20 % on average .
In open source communities women are an even smaller minority , 1.5 % on average ( with Perl attracting 5 % of women , Drupal achieving 10 % ) .
80 % of women had noticed sexism in the open source community , 80 % of men never noticed anything .
projects with an express diversity statement attracted a wider diversity of developers .
Robert is n’t simply banging a drum but provides quite simple guidelines to promote diversity , and thus a more women - friendly environment , in FOSS communities :
Recruit diversity , not programming skills ( “ You can teach programming ; you ca n’t teach passion of diversity ” ) ;
Say it , mean it , either through a code of conduct or diversity statement ( and stick to it ) ;
Set up tools that provide information to the newer team members ;
Transparency .
For each individual she has the following tips :
Do n’t stare ( i.e. women are normal human beings too ) ;
Value all contributions ;
Call people on their crap ( “ How do you tell if someone ’s being an asshole ?
Well , if there ’s a naked woman the project screen , that ’s a good sign . ) ;
Pay attention , to your own behavior and the behavior of others .
Especially since 80 % of the men are n’t even aware of the sexism in their communities .
Women in Free Software summit
Another key event that shaped the agenda of feminism in FOSS was the Women in Free Software summit of September 19 .
The summit was the initiative of three women : Deborah Nicholson ( FSF ) , Stormy Peters ( GNOME Foundation ) and Hilary Rettig .
As an aside , Sam Varghese - who probably was n’t invited for the summit- cautioned us not to expect to much from the summit :
I ’m not sure whether making this issue exclusively about gender will do much good .
We might then end up with women joining FOSS projects in droves – only to be promptly pissed off by male developers who ask them about things like dress sense .
Anyway , we can find the minutes of the summit online , which gives everyone ample opportunity to draw his / her own conclusions .
The opening statement is clear enough , it ’s a simple battle cry to end sexism , period !
Our objective is to increase women ’s participation in the free software movement and work to make sexism in person or online unacceptable within our community .
Women represent less than 2 % of the free software movement , yet our participation is a pre-requisite for the movements success .
Having more women in our community advocating freedom will enrich our movement .
Then we find a straightforward SWOT analysis and list of short - term and long - term goals .
There is already a mailinglist on women in free software .
And yes , men can subscribe too .
The quote on the mailing list is telling :
“ Why are n’t more women involved in the movement to maintain and secure freedom for all computer users ? ”
There is nothing particularly male about either computers or freedom — and yet women account for fewer than 2 % of our community .
One of the short - term goals is a larger summit in the spring of 2010 where free software and the role women should play in it is put in the context of a social justice movement .
There is to be a list of women willing to give presentations on the subject .
The group also wants to launch various initiatives to promote the use of free software among girls and coach them to become developers .
What I personally like is one of the long - term goals , namely to look into the under - representation of other groups in the FOSS world based on race , class , ethnicity and sexual orientation .
Stormy Peters wrote an article following the summit which basically dealt with the “ We ’re sorry they are so touchy about the subject , we ’ll promise to do better ” - response ( mentioned above ) . :
When talking about women in free software or political correctness in general , we seem to focus on saying things that “ do n’t offend ” the minority group .
But that ’s not what it ’s about .
It ’s about saying things that encourage people to join your group , that send the right message and represent our values .
While not saying things that send them away .
The focus should be on making the message welcoming , not on making the message “ not offending . ”
Peters is simply encouraging us men to think before we say or do something we consider funny :
Showing a woman in a bikini in your ad may not offend any women , but will it encourage them to join your project ?
If you are looking to bring women to your project , not showing the woman in a bikini is the first step .
The next step – and the much harder one – is figuring out what to do to show them they are welcome .
Is this a radical movement ?
The free and open source movement , especially the free software movement , always prided itself in being more than about novel technology .
FOSS has a strong moral and ideological component that attracts developers , artists , scholars , writers and such , but - as is evident - not women .
The extreme under - representation of women in FOSS should make us concerned and spur each one of us to action .
When I look at the women who carry the banner and who want to create a more women - friendly environment in FOSS , I do n’t see a group of radical feminists .
They raise an issue that needs raising .
Kirrily Robert ’s presentation throws out the ‘ society is unfair ’ argument , since it exposes the fact that where women find their way in technology , they hardly find it in free and open source software .
The opening statement of the September 19 summit is n’t something radically new , it ’s something we have come to accept as normal in the world outside of FOSS and is incorporated in key articles in constitutions all over the world .
The suggestions made to improve the situation in projects are not earth - shaking , they simply point to skills that we need in society anyway .
True , the FOSS developers ’ communities may have been masculine , aggressive and meritocratic ( i.e. I can code better than you ) in nature for most of their existence .
But we also know that the behavior shown in the on and off flame wars is totally unacceptable in any other kind of environment , short of your average cage fight .
What is disturbing is the attitude of some male proponents in this debate , as shown in the two main arguments used .
Both Varghese and Bezemer , for instance , feel it is necessary to point out they have nothing against women or feminism in particular , before continuing with the ‘ there is nothing wrong ’ argument .
It reeks too much as a ‘ I have the utmost respect for women .
Go grab me a beer ’ attitude .
If one thing should radically change it is this downplaying of a serious issue .
Strange enough , while the FOSS world is developing technology for the 21st century , based upon a moral philosophy focused on freedom , the dominant male attitude has more in common with the 19th century .
No doubt the debate will rage on for some time .
No doubt there will be highly visible mistakes by the prominent alpha males of the FOSS community .
And no doubt the geek feminists will hammer on each one of them .
As well they should .
Men of the FOSS community , this is no longer only a guy ’s thing , time to show proper respect in all we say and do .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Homebuilders ' confidence fell once again in May and their view of the state of the battered market hit a record low .
The National Association of Home Builders / Wells Fargo monthly index fell to its second lowest reading on record , ahead of only last December 's reading .
Builders were asked for their view of the current market , the amount of the buyers looking at homes and expectations for six months from now .
Only 6 % of the builders surveyed believe the current market is good while 69 % view it as poor .
Builders also reported a lower level of people looking to buy new homes .
And 51 % of the builders said they now expect conditions to remain poor six months from now , up from 47 % who were expecting a poor outlook in the previous reading .
" The message is very clear :
The single - family housing market is still deteriorating and Congress and the Administration must move immediately to enact legislation that will help reverse the trend , " said NAHB President Sandy Dunn , a homebuilder from Point Pleasant , W.Va .
The group is backing a proposed homebuyer tax credit of up to $ 7,500 for qualified buyers as a way to try to jump start the market .
The report comes a day ahead of the government 's latest report on housing starts and building permits .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com forecast that starts fell to an annual rate of 940,000 April , which would mark a 17 - year low .
Permits , also viewed as a reading on builder 's confidence in the market , are forecast to slip to 912,000 , which would also be a 17 - year low .
Earlier this week , luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers ( TOL , Fortune 500 ) reported sharp drops in both revenue and new orders when it released preliminary results , saying that even many buyers who put down a deposit are n't taking the next step of signing a contract due to lack of confidence in the market .

Richard Dawkins is perhaps our generation ’s most famous atheist ( though many of us prefer the late Bertrand Russell on many counts ) .
A behavioral biologist ( ethologist ) with roving popular interests , he has made his most recent splash with The God Delusion .
As a scientist and a theist , I am sympathetic to both faithful and scientific approaches and do not believe , in general terms , that either has exclusive access to truth .
Still , at the end of the day , I am a theist , so clearly I disagree with at least some of Dawkins ’s arguments .
One of which Dawkins appears particularly proud is his application of the so - called anthropic principle , a much - controverted attempt to get at the insight that human life is highly improbable , that the tiniest changes in a variety of physical constants would make life as we know it impossible .
Dawkins applies a fairly standard evolutionist ’s version of the anthropic principle .
“ You are absurd for thinking that something with a one in a googol chance of happening could explain life , ” says the theist to the secular scientist .
The wise scientist responds , “ We exist , so we are an existence of the googol possibilities that have likely occurred in the vastness of possible existence in which the question will be asked .
It does n’t matter that our existence is infinitely improbable , if we had n’t come to be there would be no one to notice how improbable our existence is . ”
In simpler terms , if something has a less than a one - in - a - billion chance of happening , all it takes is billions of billions of attempts to get billions of such improbable events .
Dawkins seems to believe that his application of anthropism is heavy artillery in the fight against religion , apparently because many theists reject strictly naturalistic accounts of our origin on the grounds that it is highly improbable .
While I will confess that formal philosophical argument pulls my eyelids toward my cheekbones , I would interrogate Dawkins ’s anthropic principle some .
The anthropic principle is primarily a statistical short circuit for cosmology , a way to say that matters of incredible improbability need not be rejected on face because we as humans only encounter the one that succeeded sufficiently to lead to our creation .
Unfortunately , the principle is not as well - behaved as the atheists would have us believe .
Because it is a short circuit , the principle levels the playing field for improbable events .
Atheistic cosmologies have an embarrassingly low probability of having occurred .
So do theistic cosmologies , according to most standard definitions of probability .
So , frankly , does a cosmology in which kryptonite - filled plastic chickens named Bezoar and Barney initiated the Big Bang by igniting giant bottle rockets .
Losing the skepticism of probability may leave us strangely credulous .
The anthropic principle assumes that it is evaluating only a single hypothesis , but in fact , when theists invoke improbability , they generally mean that their explanation seems to them more probable than the atheistic one .
The atheistic anthropic principle cannot be productively applied to decide between two hypotheses .
To invoke the anthropic principle in evaluating relative improbabilities is methodologically dangerous and runs counter to almost all of current empirical science .
Pons and Fleischman only needed this anthropic principle to save their Cold Fusion wonderland .
“ While it is highly improbable that the energy our system is generating represents cold fusion , we just happen to be the universe of all possible universes in which cold fusion is the best way to account for these findings . ”
The atheist would likely respond that the probability of a God - based model ca n’t be compared to the probability of a naturalistic model .
The former requires unquantifiable assumptions about attributes of the universe unknown to science , while the latter has the benefit of objectively measured probabilities .
Because God does not arise from known physical constants and has never been measured , we cannot calculate the probability of his existence except to say that we do not see a way to him from current understandings of physics .
There are two problems with this response .
First , why would we believe it astoundingly improbable that scientists have critical gaps in their understanding ?
We as scientists tend to accept as improbable associations in the range of one in a hundred or at most one in a thousand or ten thousand .
If we ’re that easy with our credulity , who ’s to say there is n’t something we ’ve missed so far ?
Every prior generation of scientists has had lacunae in their understanding , and though we ’re all a little tired of postmodern history of science , we have undergone dramatic changes in our understanding of physical existence .
Second , this is a claim with false pretenses to accuracy .
How do we quantify the probability of certain physical constants having certain values ?
There is no verifiable or reliable way .
We can make estimates on the basis of genetic changes over time , but that ’s just one small link in the vast chain from cosmogony to humanity .
For many other crucial factors we have no idea what the probability of their assuming certain values is .
Dawkins will need much heavier artillery than his anthropic principle to get me onto his black leather couch , confessing my God Delusion .
He might have better luck with Bezoar , who I understand is free these days .
Just as the literature - inspired shooters of the 70s and 80s were probably crazy long before they picked up a copy of Catcher on the Rye , the psychos who claim a movie drove them to kill were probably psycho long before screening Psycho .
( But hey , you never know . )
These are six films that supposedly pushed people over the edge .
1. William Friedkin's BUG
This creepy but not entirely successful 2006 psycho- thriller about paranoia and insect infestations was directed by William Friedkin , most famous for The Exorcist .
Despite dealing with a few murders and plenty of craziness in its own plot , the crime it inspired was considerably more horrific and strange .
In January , blaring headlines like " Millionaire executive unhinged by horror film killed daughter " announced the tragedy , apparently trigged as stressed - out insurance executive Alberto Izaga watched Bug in a theater with his wife .
( It was the only movie playing that had available seats ; perhaps this tragedy could 've been avoided , ironically , if the film were more popular ? )
Soon after , his wife would find him babbling incoherently in the middle of the night , shouting about the film , the Devil and death .
Experiencing what his wife would call an " extreme and sudden " breakdown , he bludgeoned his two - year - old daughter to death while yelling " God does n't exist !
The universe does n't exist !
Humanity does n't exist ! "
Judged not guilty by reason of insanity , the judge passed sentence thusly : " This is a truly agonizing case .
No sentence I pass can ever match the sentence you will pass on yourself . "
2. The Matrix and the Landlady Effect
The Matrix and its many sequels are deadly films .
Deadly not only in terms of pacing , plot development and believability ( the sequels especially ) , but also , strangely , to landladies .
Claiming they had been " sucked into the Matrix , " a Swedish exchange student , Vadim Mieseges , and an Ohio woman , Tonda Lynn Ansley , attacked their landladies in an attempt to free themselves from mind control .
Both plead ( and were granted ) insanity , and thus liberated from the Matrix ( and , one would assume , their leases ) , they 're " free " to spend the rest of their lives in mental hospitals .
3. Scream
Yes , even parodies of horror movies can inspire people to kill .
In fact , the list of murders attributed to this film is shockingly long and the crimes especially grotesque ; this truncated version is from Crimelibrary :
A boy and his cousin in Los Angeles obsessed with the film murdered his mother by stabbing her 45 times ; a man wearing the mask shot and killed a woman in Florida ; a boy in France killed his parents while acting as Ghostface ; and in England , a pair of boys repeatedly stabbed a third one , claiming the film had prompted them to do it .
4. The Ten Commandments
Admittedly , this is n't a film you 'd expect to find on this list , nor associated with such brutal crimes .
It was a more innocent time , perhaps : in 1959 , a serial rapist and killer dubbed the " the Beast of the Black Forest " was striking fear into West German hearts .
Caught when he carelessly took a bloodstained suit to a tailor for mending ( and left behind a briefcase containing a sawed - off shotgun ) , under interrogation 23 - year - old Heinrich Pommerencke would blame his lust crimes on Cecil B. DeMille 's The Ten Commandments , especially noting a scene in which scantily - clad women dance around a golden calf .
( That 's when he " knew he had to kill , " he said . )
5. Taxi Driver
John Hinckley , Jr. , President Reagan 's would - be assassin in 1981 , has the rare distinction of claiming he was influenced not only by a book ( Catcher in the Rye , naturally ) but a film : Taxi Driver .
The latter certainly has more parallels to Hinckley 's crime : Robert DeNiro stars as a lonely , obsessive taxi driver who hatches a plot to kill a prominent politician , but ends up unleashing his rage on a warren of local pimps , thus saving the waifish , gold - hearted prostitute played by Jodie Foster from a life of iniquity .
Hinckley got the story a little backwards , claiming that he needed to shoot Ronald Reagan in order to " impress " real - life Foster ( not a prostitute ) , with whom he was obsessed .
( Nobody said psychos were logical . )
6. Natural Born Killers
This film has the dubious distinction of having " inspired " more killings than perhaps any other ; the real - life body count is likely higher than that of Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis ' nihilistic killers in the film .
They include a copycat Bonnie - and - Clyde style rampage which left one man dead and another woman paralyzed , a teenager 's decapitation , a gang killing and two infamous school shootings -- Michael Carneal 's Paducah , Kentucky rampage and Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold 's massacre at Columbine High School ; the latter used the term " going NBK " in reference to their murderous plans .
Do women remember better than men do ?
Research shows that females may have an advantage when it comes to episodic memory , a type of long - term memory based on personal experiences .
A Swedish team of psychologists showed , for example , that women are better on average than men at remembering faces , particularly female faces .
These findings may have an evolutionary explanation that is rooted in female - female competition , says David C. Geary , a psychologist at the University of Missouri–Columbia who was not involved with the study .
“ Women certainly fought and continue to fight over the best guys ... those with good genes and resources to invest in kids , ” Geary says .
Remembering details of personal experiences is important for monitoring and maneuvering relationships , including disrupting the social and romantic ties of other women who are competitors , he says .
Previous studies have shown that women also have a superior memory for verbal information , which they may use to dissect a person ’s underlying motives or intentions — a skill that , according to Geary , “ seems to elude many men . ”

The largest collection of solar air heated buildings in the world can now be found at the military base of Fort Drum , in upstate New York .
50 SolarWall systems ( totaling over 110,000 ft2 ) have been installed on 27 military buildings and will collectively generate over 4MW of peak thermal energy .
The project is extremely significant in terms of the sheer magnitude of energy and CO2 savings , and shows the tremendous potential for solar thermal when it is deployed on a large scale .
By using the free energy of the sun – instead of burning fossil fuels for heating purposes - the base will displace over 2,000 tons of carbon dioxide each and every year at one of the coldest locations in the United States .
The base is also projected to realize fuel savings of 44 billion BTU/h ( 46,000 GJ ) per year .
The SolarWall air heating system heats the ventilation air that is required in commercial and industrial buildings using a patented transpired solar collector developed by Conserval Engineering .
Ventilation heating is typically one of the largest single energy requirements for these types of buildings , which is why solar air heating can generate such significant overall energy reductions .
In late 2005 , the Army Corp of Engineers at the base commissioned a multi-million dollar retrofit program to upgrade 27 of their buildings to include solar air heating systems .
The technology heats the ventilation and makeup air required in vehicle maintenance garages , warehouses , hangars , etc. , displacing the traditional heating load ( and resulting energy costs and CO2 emissions ) .
In 2006 , the United States Corp of Engineers identified the transpired solar collector ( branded as SolarWall ) as one of two cost - effective technologies that are ideally suited to military buildings , such as vehicle maintenance garages .
A nuclear plant built at a cost of £ 470 m to provide atomic fuel to be used in foreign power stations has produced almost nothing since it was opened six years ago , the government has admitted .
The mixed oxide ( Mox ) facility at Sellafield in Cumbria - which was opposed by green groups as uneconomic - was originally predicted to have an annual throughput of 120 tonnes of fuel .
The energy minister , Malcolm Wicks , has admitted in response to a parliamentary question that it had managed only 2.6 tonnes in any one 12 - month period between 2002 and 2006 - 07 .
In the four years before 2002 , the plant had produced annual figures respectively of 2.3 tonnes , 0.3 tonnes , 0 tonnes and 0 tonnes .
The technical difficulties at the facility and the failure to get anywhere close to its financial targets will add to concerns about the economics of nuclear power , following the government 's decision to give the green light to a new generation of atomic reactors .
Wicks described the Sellafield Mox plant ( SMP ) as being based on " largely unproven technology " and pointed out that its estimated annual output had been reduced by 2001 to 72 m tonnes .
British Nuclear Group ( BNG ) , which operates the Sellafield site , said a range of improvements were being made to the facility but it admitted that the 2007 - 08 period had again seen production disrupted by various problems .
The SMP was designed to make new fuel from the recycled uranium and plutonium recovered from used nuclear fuel , which had been reprocessed by the nearby thermal oxide reprocessing plant ( Thorp ) at Sellafield .
A
Mox demonstration complex was opened in 1998 but was hit by a scandal involving quality control and the falsification of documents , which led to the resignation of John Taylor , chief executive of BNFL .
Attempts to open the main SMP facility led to high court challenges by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth , which argued that the government 's decision to allow BNG 's parent group , BNFL , to proceed with opening the facility was unlawful under European law .
The Irish government also took unsuccessful legal action to stop the SMP opening over concerns about radioactive effluent from the plant polluting the Irish Sea .
Jean McSorley , a nuclear campaigner at Greenpeace , said the Mox plant was - along with Thorp - " another great failure of British nuclear engineering " and pointed to the dangers of accepting the industry 's economic models and promises .
She pointed out that Thorp had been shut for the past three years because of an accident and continual attempts to reopen it had been thwarted by further problems .
A spokeswoman for BNG , the operating division of BNFL , said production was still being " ramped up " and the performance of the plant was the subject of a detailed improvement plan .
She said the problems at the SMP were not related to the difficulties at Thorp .
" We had to overcome a number of technical issues and make engineering improvements to the [ SMP ] plant as part of the normal commissioning process .
We made improvements to plant maintenance , equipment reliability and have installed upgraded equipment as required , " she said .
" We are awaiting suitable plant availability to demonstrate the benefits of these capacity enhancements .
Throughput in 2007 - 08 was adversely affected by the extended outage for the fuel campaign change .
We remain committed to meeting our customers ' Mox fuel requirements . "
BNG has been forced to meet the needs of Swiss and other contracted customers for Mox fuel through buying alternative supplies from France and Belgium .
With the £ 470 m construction costs written off , the plant was assessed by government - appointed consultants in 2001 to have a net positive value of only £ 216 m - a value that was partly based on winning back Japanese business , which proved hard after the falsification of quality - assurance data in 1999 .

He is followed by Ernesto and Kirsty Bertarelli : the former Miss UK winner and her husband have a £ 5.6 bn fortune based on pharmaceuticals .
Sunday Times Rich List editor Ian Coxon said it was the British - born billionaires , like Sir Richard Branson , who were being hardest hit by the credit crunch .
Monaco - based Sir Philip Green , 56 , who with his wife Tina , 58 , owns Bhs and Topshop , has seen the value of his retail fortune drop by more than 10 % in a year to £ 4.3bn , according to the list .
Ineos chemicals billionaire Jim Ratcliffe , 55 , owner of the strike - torn Grangemouth refinery , has seen an ever bigger downturn which is attributed to higher energy costs and more competition from the Middle East .
Ratcliffe , 10th in the list last year with an estimated fortune of £ 3.3bn , now sits at 25th , worth £ 2.3 bn .
A fortune of £ 80 m is needed to be one of Britain 's richest 1,000 people - up from £ 70 m in 2007 .

The top 1,000 richest included 762 self - made millionaires .
Philip Beresford , who has compiled the list since it was first published in 1989 , said : " Until now , the 11 years of Labour government have proved a boon for the super - rich , rarely seen before in modern British history .
" However , much of the rise in this year 's wealth can be attributed to one factor : the number of foreign rich who have made London or its environs the main home and base of operation . "
The Queen 's wealth has stayed fairly static at £ 320 m , Mr Coxon said - although she has been sliding slowly down the list in recent years and is this year at 264 .
Meanwhile the Independent on Sunday has published its antidote to the rich list , which it calls the Happy List of 100 people who make Britain a better and a happier place to live .
These include Tim Berners - Lee , the inventor of the worldwide web , cricketer and fundraiser Ian Botham , and author and philanthropist JK Rowling .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp MSFT .O started testing a new way of selling its
Office software suite on a subscription basis , packaging it with security software and free online services .
Microsoft on Friday launched a new test program code - named “ Albany ” that will allow consumers to download and install Office 2007 , which includes Word processing and Excel spreadsheet , and then receive updates for a subscription instead of a more traditional one - time license fee .
Consumers will also receive Windows Live OneCare , a Web - based security software , and online applications including Windows Live Mail and Office Live Workspace .
Microsoft did not disclose how it plans to set the pricing for “ Albany ” or when it would be widely available .
The company faces competition from Google Inc GOOG.O and a slew of start - ups including privately - held Zoho , which are offering applications comparable to Office but delivered through a Web browser for free or a monthly subscription .
Microsoft said this is not a complete overhaul of how it sells software .
“ We are definitely not straying from our traditional software sales model , ” said Bryson Gordon , product manager for the project .
“ There will always be a significant number of users for whom purchasing a perpetual license to the latest version of Office is still the best choice .
“ Albany ” just gives customers more choice . ”

New York State health officials have released statistics indicating that 360 9/11 rescue workers have since died , but have also admitted that there is an overall undercount .
The New York Daily News reports that of those deaths 154 have been explained and 80 have died of various forms of cancer , mostly impacting the lungs and digestive system while others were related to blood cancers and heart and circulatory diseases .
" It ’s the tip of the iceberg , " said David Worby , who is representing 10,000 workers – 600 with cancer – who say they got sick after working on rescue and recovery efforts .
" These statistics bear out how toxic that site was , " Worby said .
The Statistics were released by the World Trade Center Responder Fatality Investigation Program .
While insisting the state is " not making judgment " on whether all the deaths were related to the toxic air around ground zero , which was filled with asbestos , mercury , lead and other contaminants , official Kitty Gelberg did say that she believes there to be an overall undercount of rescuers and workers who have died since 9/11 .
In spite of the state ’s refusal to be drawn on whether there has been an elevation in deaths due to 9/11 , it was revealed back
In 2006 , almost five years on from the disaster , that there has been a startling increase in cases of a particular lung scarring disease , known as sarcoidosis , among firefighters , which rose to five times the expected rate in the two years after the attacks .
At the time the New York Times reported :
" The most worrisome to medical experts are granulomatous pulmonary diseases , which show a particular type of swirling marks left on the lungs by foreign matter like dust .
Doctors say the severity of the disease is often dictated by a patient ’s genetic makeup .
The diseases include pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis , a sometimes fatal disorder that can be set off when exposure to dust causes the body ’s immune system to attack itself . "
Medical experts have stated that it still may be at least another decade before the full effects of the attacks are witnessed as diseases may take longer to develop in some people than others .
It is estimated that around 40,000 people were involved in rescue work around the World Trade Center site and the Fresh Kills landfill where debris was taken immediately following the attacks .
The number effected may be significantly more than that however given that a recent study by Mount Sinai Medical Center revealed that out of 70,000 participants , 85 percent are suffering some kind of respiratory problem .
A previous study in 2006 by the medical center also found that of of 9,442 workers , 70 % suffer breathing problems .
This was also the figure gleened from a further study in 2007 .
Though the center ’s figures have been criticized and questioned by some , they are the only real source to go on given that the city , state and federal governments did not engage in any form of research into or treatment of 9/11 related illnesses for some time after the attacks , and still have not set about a truly committed program to do so .
Dr. Robin Herbert , Co-director of the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program at Mount Sinai has indicated that there may be three " waves " of illnesses experienced by ground zero workers .
The first wave refers to coughing and respiratory problems , the second wave includes severe chronic lung diseases and the third wave could be fatal cancers .
Dr. Michael Baden , chief forensic pathologist for the New York State Police and the former chief medical examiner of New York City , has reviewed several ground zero- related autopsies , and has commented " Three thousand people may have died , but 100,000 others may have been exposed " .
We have extensively reported on the fact that the EPA knowingly gave misleading information to residents and workers regarding the air quality in the aftermath of the attacks and how a cover up , which leads to officials at the very top , has ensued .
The heroes of 9/11 have been shunned by a government that still refuses cover the costs of healthcare for the vast majority of the stricken because to do so would be an admission of culpability .
Last month it was reported that some of the heroes who have since succumbed to dust - related illnesses will be memorialized on the NYPD ’s " Wall of Heroes " for officers killed in the line of duty .
Sadly , more space will be needed on that wall in the months and years to come as the officials ultimately responsible for this continuing tragedy remain unpunished .

Hi Folks ,
Just in case you did n’t see today ’s Meet the Press , I wanted to let you know about yet another example of mainstream media being lazy and perpetuating the often unwarranted image of McCain as a maverick .
Here ’s the note I sent to NBC which will likely be ignored : Hello ,
On your 6/29 Meet the Press broadcast , Mr. Brokaw and Mr. Todd were rightfully commenting on Sen. Obama 's ' flip - flop ' regarding campaign finance and his choice to opt - out of public funds for his campaign .
My question is why did n't we hear a more balanced view of Sen.
McCain 's positions on the flip - flop topic ?
Mr. Todd was right on point stating that McCain should exploit the Obama flip - flop , but then he went on to highlight McCain 's reputation as a candidate who stands up for his beliefs and bucks his party .
How can a quality news show miss the follow up on the big issues McCain has clearly flip - flopped on such as the Bush tax cuts ( he had opposed them since 2003 and now is a strong supporter of them ) , torture ( he spoke out firmly and often about our need to clearly define our policy to conform with the Geneva commitments we signed and then voted with the Republicans months ago to support the CIA torture loophole ) , and just a few days ago , McCain pledged his support for offshore US drilling in direct contrast to his previously stated positions .
Sen .
Obama deserved to be called out for his finance flip - flop , and Sen. McCain has displayed some maverick , party bucking behavior during his career , though he has voted along party lines about 90 % of the time during the Bush presidency and these flip - flops truly should not have gone without comment in your discussion today .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 April 4
Explanation :
At first glance these undulating shapes in shades of blue might look like waves on an ocean .
Seen here in a false - color image from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter 's HiRISE camera , they are actually layered rock outcrops found in Aureum Chaos .
The larger Aureum Chaos region is a chaotic jumble of eroded terrain in the eastern part of Mars ' immense canyon Valles Marineris .
Distinct layers composing these outcrops could have been laid down by dust or volcanic ash settling from the atmosphere , sand carried by martian winds , or sediments deposited on the floor of an ancient lake .
This close - up view of the otherwise red planet spans about 4 kilometers , a distance you might walk over flat ground in less than an hour .
Scientists have discovered their first icequake , if you will — a movement of a huge stream of ice in Antarctica that creates seismic waves , just like an earthquake , and can be felt hundreds of miles away .
Starting in 2001 , Douglas Wiens of Washington University in St. Louis deployed seismographs around Antarctica , which detected seismic signals between that year and 2003 .
" At first we did n't know where the waves were coming from , but eventually we were able to narrow down the source to the ice stream , " Wiens said .
These ice - driven seismic waves had the force of a magnitude 7 earthquake , he said .
That 's equivalent to the strength of the 2005 Fukuoka earthquake , which killed only one , but displaced more than 3,000 people .
Glacial earthquakes Prior to Wiens ' discovery , detailed in the June 5 online issue of the journal Nature , scientists were unaware that ice streams radiated seismic waves ( though they had detected them from glaciers , mainly near Greenland ) .
Ice streams are pieces of a bigger ice sheet that can move faster than the surrounding ice , periodically sliding over the underlying bedrock and eventually working their way to the coastline , where the ice can calve off to create icebergs .
The particular ice stream that created the seismic signals Wiens detected was 500 miles away from the seismographs that detected it .
It is about 60 miles wide and half a mile thick .
Each time it moves , it gives off seismic waves that are recorded at seismographs all around Antarctica , and even as far away as Australia .
The seismic waves Wiens measured came in two bursts every day ; each one was equivalent to a magnitude 7 earthquake .
" By some measures , the seismic impact is equivalent to a very large earthquake , but it does n't feel like it because the movement is much slower than a real earthquake , " Wiens said .
Wiens ' data show that the river of ice moved about 18 inches ( 46 centimeters ) in 10 minutes , then remained still for 12 hours , and then moved another 18 inches .
An earthquake of a similar size would be over in just 10 seconds , Wiens noted .
" I guess you could call [ this ] an earthquake at glacial speed , " Wiens said .
Sticking and slipping GPS instruments placed directly onto the ice stream can detect where the ice sheet begins to slip and where it stops ( similar to the classic " stick - slip " motion of an earthquake fault where the plates on either side of the fault are " stuck " by friction until the stress builds up and the fault suddenly slips ) , Wiens said .
" The slip starts in a certain part of the ice stream and then it moves out , rather like a landslide might start at a certain point and then move out to envelope an entire mountainside , " Wiens explained .
" The GPS tells us which part moves first and what other parts moved next and so forth . "
The GPS data show that the slip always starts form the same spot on the bed of the ice stream , which glaciologists call a " sticky " spot because it creates more friction than the surrounding part of the bed .
Glaciologists had previously thought that glacier and ice streams moved in a continuous creep , " but now this indicates that they move with a fast slip , almost like an earthquake , " Wiens said .
Wiens says that understanding this stick - slip movement of ice could provide a clue as to why ice sheets and glaciers can speed up or slow down over many years .
" This particular ice stream has been slowing down over the last few decades , and no one knows why , " said Wiens , whose work was funded by the National Science Foundation .
" We need to understand what controls the speed of the ice streams , because that will affect how fast the ice in Antarctica will go away and sea level will rise as global warming melts the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , " he added .
Mr Carter was speaking at the UK's Hay - on - Wye literature festival Ex - US President Jimmy Carter has said Israel has at least 150 atomic weapons in its arsenal .
The Israelis have never confirmed they have nuclear weapons , but this has been widely assumed since a scientist leaked details in the 1980s .
Mr Carter made his comments on Israel 's weapons at a press conference at the annual literary Hay Festival in Wales .
He also described Israeli treatment of Palestinians as " one of the greatest human rights crimes on earth " .
Mr Carter gave the figure for the Israeli nuclear arsenal in response to a question on US policy on a possible nuclear - armed Iran , arguing that any country newly armed with atomic weapons faced overwhelming odds .
" The US has more than 12,000 nuclear weapons ; the Soviet Union ( sic ) has about the same ; Great Britain and France have several hundred , and Israel has 150 or more , " he said .
Israel 's Dimona reactor is understood to provide plutonium for the country 's nuclear weapons
Nuclear power in the Middle East Israeli PM dismisses nuclear row Israel 's nuclear programme " We have a phalanx of enormous capabilities , not only of weaponry but also of rockets to deliver every one of those missiles on a pinpoint accuracy target . "
Most experts estimate that Israel has between 100 and 200 nuclear warheads , largely based on information leaked to the Sunday Times newspaper in the 1980s by Mordechai Vanunu , a former worker at the country 's Dimona nuclear reactor .
The US , a key ally of Israel , has in general followed the country 's policy of " nuclear ambiguity " , neither confirming or denying the existence of its assumed arsenal .
However , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert included Israel among a list of nuclear states in comments in December 2006 , a week after US Defence Secretary Robert Gates used a similar form of words during a Senate hearing .
Former Israeli military intelligence chief Aharon Zeevi-Farkash told Reuters news agency he considered Mr Carter 's comments " irresponsible " .
" The problem is that there are those who can use these statements when it comes to discussing the international effort to prevent Iran getting nuclear weapons , " he said .
' Imprisonment '
During the press briefing , Mr Carter expressed his support for Israel as a country , but criticised its domestic and foreign policy .
" One of the greatest human rights crimes on earth is the starvation and imprisonment of 1.6 m Palestinians , " he said .
The former US president cited statistics which he said showed the nutritional intake of some Palestinian children was below that of children in Sub - Saharan Africa , as well as saying the European position on Israel could be best described as " supine " .
Mr Carter , awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 , brokered the 1979 Egypt - Israel peace treaty , the first between Israel and an Arab state .
In April he controversially held talks in the Syrian capital Damascus with Khaled Meshaal , leader of the militant Palestinian movement Hamas .
The former US president 's Carter Center was unavailable for further comment .

Fox asks viewers for ' voter fraud ' stories David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday May 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Update : Blogger suggests that Fox probe Ann Coulter " Could illegal immigrants sway an election ? '
Eric Shawn of Fox News asked on Wednesday , raising the terrifying specter of " people who are not even citizens voting for whomever they want . "
Since 2005 , the Bush administration has been pushing the idea that " voter fraud " is a widespread problem , even firing US Attorneys who did not make the investigation of claims of fraud a priority .
However , investigations have never found more than a handful of votes being cast illegally , while requiring proof of citizenship seems likely to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters , mostly the poor and elderly who may not be able to secure required documentation .
Fox News has now set out to find the evidence of fraud that the Bush Department of Justice could not , whipping up their audience with the threat of non-citizens " getting a fake ID , a driver 's license , or a social security card and voting in this year 's election . "
" If you think there 's voter fraud where you live , or there are other election problems , we at Fox News want to know about it , " Shawn told viewers .
" You can email us .
... [ email protected ] "
Shawn 's proposed remedy is " legislation that would prevent illegals and other ineligible voters from going into the voting booth , " although he acknowledged sadly that " even if states do act , it may be too late for the upcoming presidential election . "
Update :
In a comment on this RAW STORY article , Brad Friedman of BradBlog suggested , " You heard 'em , kids .
Fox is looking for voter fraud !
Feel free to email them this link documenting the no-uncertain - terms case of Ann Coulter having committed voter fraud in Palm Beach County , Florida ! ...
Let 'em know I sent you , in case they have any further questions .
I 'll be happy to speak to them , and help 'em root out those voter fraud criminals ! "
At his blog , Friedman has charged that Coulter " knowingly lied about her address on her voter registration form in Palm Beach County , Florida ; proceeded to break the law again by knowingly voting at the wrong precinct ; then lied about it repeatedly ; hired a former Bush attorney to protect her ass ; and even called in her FBI ex-boyfriend to save her bacon when it looked like the Palm Beach County Sheriff might actually have the balls to bring charges . "
Coulter appears frequently on Fox News Channel to expound upon campaign politics .

A US court has ruled that users have a " reasonable expectation of privacy " in their internet surfing records and that police must obtain warrants from higher than usual courts in order to force ISPs to hand over records .
The Supreme Court of the state of New Jersey said that information about a person 's use of the internet was so private that police there cannot order ISPs to release surfing details of suspects with a municipal court subpoena .
They must receive a grand jury subpoena , it said .
" The court holds that citizens have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the subscriber information they provide to internet service providers , " said the court 's ruling .
" Law enforcement officials can obtain subscriber information by serving a grand jury subpoena on an Internet service provider without notice to the subscriber . "
Chief Justice Rabner said : " Individuals need an ISP address in order to access the internet .
However , when users surf the web from the privacy of their homes , they have reason to expect that their actions are confidential .
Many are unaware that a numerical IP address can be captured by the websites they visit .
More sophisticated users understand that that unique string of numbers , standing alone , reveals little if anything to the outside world .
Only an internet service provider can translate an IP address into a user ’s name . "
The case involved Shirley Reid , who was accused of hacking into her employer 's computer system .
After Reid 's ISP , Comcast , handed over details of her account , including the IP address from which she accessed the internet , she was found guilty of computer theft in connection with the hacking incident .
Reid overturned that decision on appeal and at the Supreme Court of New Jersey stage , arguing that the evidence should be suppressed .
Reid 's lawyers had argued that a person should be informed when a subpoena is issued permitting the release of their telecommunications subscription details so that they can oppose the move .
The Supreme Court of New Jersey , though , said that as long as the subpoena is from a grand jury the information can be released without the knowledge or consent of the user .
" Modern technology has raised a number of questions that are intertwined in this case : to what extent can private individuals ' surf ' the ' web ' anonymously ?
Do internet subscribers have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their identity while accessing internet websites ?
And under what circumstances may the State learn the actual identity of internet users ? " said Chief Justice Rabner in his ruling .
" We decline to adopt a requirement that notice be provided to account holders whose information is subpoenaed , " he said .
" For obvious reasons , notice could impede and possibly defeat the grand jury ’s investigation .
Particularly in the case of computers , unscrupulous individuals aware of a subpoena could delete or damage files on their home computer and thereby effectively shield them from a legitimate investigation . "
The court said that although Reid was successful in having the municipal warrant - obtained evidence suppressed , the police were not barred from approaching Comcast again and obtaining the records using an appropriate warrant .

Sweden 's New Anti-Terrorism Eavesdropping Law
For immediate release : Code of Silence
( ACPA - Stockholm ) Sweden 's new Right Wing Parliament has narrowly passed a law that gives the government sweeping powers to force citizens to talk to each other .
The " Safer Sweden Communications Act " establishes minimum annual conversation quotas and mandates Swedes to talk to each other at least once every day in summer and twice a day in winter .
The new rules allow the government to eavesdrop in homes and offices to ensure compliance .
The new legislation closely mirrors the post 9 - 11 efforts of the Bush administration to monitor communications with the " Protect America Act " .
That Law was primarily driven by concerns that free speech rules in America were allowing terrorists to easily communicate with each other .
However , Swedish authorities are more concerned that terrorists are hiding their devious plots behind the treasured Scandinavian tradition of not speaking to anyone for days on end .
It 's hoped that with the new mandatory conversations , terrorists will inadvertently reveal their devious plans .
Forced exile to Gothenburg ( applies only to Stockholm residents ) and torture techniques such as svenska - boarding , the barbaric practice of being forced to drink Swedish beer , are also sanctioned in the new legislation .
Finns , who make Swedes seem like outrageous extroverts , proposed a similar law but the attempt quietly fizzled out .
The Parliamentary debate on the subject ended when the MP who sponsored the proposal finished her opening remarks .
Elected representatives then sat quietly looking at the floor for two hours before politely excusing themselves for a schnapps - break .

As fuel prices rise , gas is rapidly becoming an extremely valuable commodity .
And after sharing the five best ways to steal gas last week , we figure it 's prudent to do the right thing by providing six of the best ways to protect your gas investment from the shady characters out there wishing to make it their own .
Advertisement
6. Fit A Locking Gas Cap
Advertisement
Instructions : Drive an older vehicle with a gas cap and fuel door that do n't lock ?
Aftermarket replacements that do lock are available from most car part stores .
Make sure you select one that 's designed for your vehicle ; this is crucial for safety , security and emissions .
Ca n't find one ?
Rivet a hasp and padlock onto the fuel door .
Pros : Cheap , simple and effective at making lazy gas thieves think twice about choosing your vehicle for fuel pilfering .
Cons : Does n't protect you from a thief who is n't lazy and happens to be handy with a lock pick .
5. Swap Diesel And Gas Badges
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Instructions : Drive a gasoline - powered car ?
Swap out all the exterior clues for diesel badges , and do n't forget the sticker inside the fuel door .
Some vehicles may require a different colored fuel filler .
Own a diesel ?
Do the opposite .
Pros : Cost efficient .
Could permanently disable thief 's vehicle , encouraging them to go straight .
Cons : Bad for forgetful people .
Lending your car to friends could prove expensive .
You lose all the cache the original stickers brought .
Getting the goo off can be a bitch when it comes time to sell .
4. Do n't Use Gas At All ; Buy An Alternative Energy Vehicle
Advertisement
Instructions : Segway , Tesla , bicycle : pick your poison .
By choosing a means of transportation that does n't use gas , not only do you become immune to fuel theft , but rising prices too .
Pros :
Not having gas that can be stolen eliminates risk of fuel theft .
Hippie chicks will dig you .
Cons :
Thieves may just steal your vehicle instead .
May lower street cred .
Hippies do n't shave .
3. Remove Your Gas At Night , Store Inside
Advertisement
Instructions : Simply siphon or drain your fuel into jerry cans every time you park .
An empty tank means thieves will have no fuel to steal .
Store in a safe — and preferably — well ventilated area .
Pros :
Sleep safe in the knowledge that your gas is where it 's safest : underneath your mattress .
Cons : Sleep may last a very long time due to fumes .
Siphoning or draining each and every night can be time intensive .
Thieves attempting to drill an empty tank may encounter an explosive surprise .
2. Booby Trap Your Car
Advertisement
Instructions : Mad Max got a lot of things right :
First and foremost is a man 's right to protect what 's his by any means necessary .
Wire dynamite to explode should your vehicle be tampered with , but do n't forget to include a secret switch to disarm the explosives .
Keeping a machete strapped near the switch can provide a way out should you be forced to disarm the booby trap at gunpoint .
A " This vehicle is booby - trapped " sticker may be a good idea .
Pros : Really sticks it to the thieves .
Street cred .
Cons : Total vehicle loss is an expensive theft deterrent .
Risk of accidental detonation is high .
Possible legal and liability concerns .
1. Up - Armor Your Vehicle
Advertisement
Instructions : Gather large amounts of thick metal plate ( 3/4 " should do ) and liberally weld it all over your vehicle .
Do n't forget to cover the underside , and leave slits for vision and / or chainsaws .
Pros :
In addition to protecting your gas tank , you 'll be protecting yourself from IEDs .
Deters tailgaters .
Cons :
The extra fuel needed to haul around all the armor plate may negate any savings .
Negative impact on resale value .
There you have it .
We 've showed you how to take someone else 's gas and how to protect it once you pour it into your tank .
You 'll probably be okay as long as you practice the basics :
Park in a well - lit area at night .
Do n't drive around with the fuel door open and gas cap missing .
And remember that no system , however ill - conceived , can stop a determined thief .
He said : " It was so appropriate that the swarm had formed a cross .
They were very calm and lady sitting on a nearby bench did not even know they were there .
Graphic artist Jon-Paul Bail wields an X - Acto knife to cut a stencil from Rubylith gelatin -- a decades - old technique .

When Windows 7 launches sometime after the start of 2010 , the desktop OS will be Microsoft 's most " modular " yet .
Having never really been comfortable with the idea of a single , monolithic desktop OS offering , Microsoft has offered multiple desktop OSes in the marketplace ever since the days of Windows NT 3.1 , with completely different code bases until they were unified in Windows 2000 .
Unification is n't necessarily a good thing , however ; Windows Vista is a sprawling , complex OS .
A singular yet highly modular OS could give Microsoft the best of all possible worlds : OSes that can be highly customized for deployment but developed monolithically .
One modular OS to rule them all , let 's say .
Mary Jo Foley is wagering that one of the big changes coming with Windows 7 is that it might be " available in pieces . "
That is to say , Windows 7 could be a modular OS .
I 'll go further .
Windows 7 will be a modular OS , and we can already see the clues in Windows Vista , because it , too , is a fledgling modular OS .
What we 're talking about and why it matters ( = software subscriptions ) , follows ...
A modular Windows 7 is a lock
The first reason Foley gives is that Windows Server 2008 has " server roles " which can automagically determine which packages are installed and how the system in configured ( more here ) .
Foley suggests that this approach on the server side would translate well to the client , but the process of modularization has already begun on the client side .
Windows Vista was designed so that all three consumer editions — Basic , Premium , and Ultimate — can be installed off of one DVD and can be upgraded in place from one version to another .
The changes can be " deep , " since ( for instance ) Home to Premium can enable Aero Glass , and Premium to Ultimate can add BitLocker drive encryption , etc .
My point is that Microsoft is already selling a " modular " OS , and the modules currently map to Windows Vista SKUs .
Microsoft is also developing other modules around its Live efforts .
Unsurprisingly , Microsoft already has a patent on a " modular operating system " concept .
A " core function " module , which includes the kernel , features a " license validation module " that authorizes the use of all additional modules , and uses DRM - like technology to prevent the use of unauthorized modules .
Windows Vista uses part of its anti-piracy arsenal to validate and monitor changes to the OS for this reason .
So , Windows 7 will be modular , but to an unknown degree .
I personally expect the modularization to focus on value - adds , as did Anytime Upgrade on Vista .
It allows Microsoft to draw lines between what is and is n't " in " the OS for DoJ compliance issues .
Whether it be Live Services , Windows Media Player , or even Internet Explorer , Microsoft could roll those into modules and then say , " Hey , look , that 's not part of Windows , we 're charging extra for that ! "
Foley says that she 's heard from sources that Microsoft is working on a Photo +
Mail +
Video module that would exist apart from the OS , for instance .
I 've heard less specific groupings myself .
A brave , modular world ( might not be so great )
Is a modular world a better one ?
For those of us having to manage software rollouts to scores of desktops , this would be yet another tool in the toolbox .
Microsoft could create " desktop roles " like " information kiosk " that includes a stripped - down feature set , for instance .
Microsoft can also add / remove functionality module by module .
New modules could be sold post - launch , keeping revenue streams strong .
In fact , modules could be maintained independent of OS versions .
Microsoft could create a " Live Services " module that is maintained by a dedicated team , designed to work across multiple OSes , yet provide a completely consistent experience .
A modular approach could also allow the company to make functionality available on a time - limited basis , potentially allowing users to " rent " a feature if it 's needed on a one - off basis .
Note that Microsoft is already testing " pay as you go " consumer subscriptions in developing countries .
The software + services side of modularization is what is surely driving this change at Microsoft .
As I argued last summer , this is all a critical piece of Microsoft 's software subscription dreams .
In " 2010 , a ' Windows 7 ' software subscription odyssey , " I noted that Microsoft has been reinventing its approach to Windows in order to facilitate the continued sales of multiple levels of the Windows " experience . "
Microsoft has confirmed that there will be multiple SKUs for Windows 7 and that there will be different subscription services built around the OS .
Whether or not this is a good thing is difficult to predict .
Generally , we 're very much in favor of package - based setup routines , much like you find with popular Linux distributions .
Why run a web server when you do n't need it ?
Why start device drivers that are n't going to be used ?
Why install a library on a system that does n't need it ?
But just imagine a Windows 7 install that allowed you to install only what you wanted .
Do n't like Internet Explorer , Windows Media Player , Windows Mail , Windows Firewall , etc. , ?
Do n't install them or their supporting code .
You 've got to like that , if you 're a Windows user .
Does this mean that Microsoft will ask you to subscribe to the next version of Windows , as opposed to buying it ?
That 's unlikely , unless you 're in business .
The next consumer release will likely be a standalone OS stocked with an array of built - in and subscription - only modules .
For all of you who missed it , which is pretty much everyone , FIBA , the international basketball body modified many of their rules to parallel those of the NBA .
Here is an overview :
“ BEIJING – International basketball is going to look more like the NBA after two major rule changes take effect .
The three - point line will move back and the three - second area will change shape starting in 2010 , the sport ’s world governing body announced Saturday .
After Oct. 1 , 2010 , FIBA will begin using the new rules for major events such as the Olympics and world and continental championships .
The three - point line will move from 20 feet , 6.1 inches to 22 feet , 1.7 inches .
The NBA line is 23 - 9 .
FIBA general secretary Patrick Baumann said it was likely FIBA would move toward the NBA distance in the next 10 years .
FIBA also will reconfigure the three - second area to match the NBA shape , going from a trapezoid to a rectangle . “
The only major disparity that wo n’t change is that there will be no “ cylinder ” above the rim as there is in the NBA .
The current FIBA rules will stay in place .
This is important news for several reasons :
1. Maybe with American kids growing up playing and practicing by rules that closely mirror NBA and college rules , we can use younger , amateur players rather than having NBA owners pay for the salaries of players so that GE can make millions of dollars and show a couple games on CNBC at midnight .
Do I sound bitter here ?
I of course am .
Nothing dumber .
The Olympics is not about national pride , its about billions of dollars .
Ok , off that soap box .
2 . If the rules are close enough , it creates the remote , but still possible opportunity for international officials to become NBA officials .
That would expand the talent pool by thousands , which is a good thing .
3 . What I am guessing is the real reason behind the change is that it makes it easier to franchise the NBA brand of basketball internationally and for American basketball fans to get understand it and get behind it .
That is a good idea .
( I ’m all for international use of NBA players when we get paid for our players to participate .
It ’s that old American capitalistic concept of I Pay , You Pay )
4 . It creates an additional development league for the NBA .
If players who are too young for the NBA want to earn a living playing basketball , they can go to Europe , prove themselves , get paid and learn the game in an environment comparable to the NBA .
That again is a good thing .

" Salads have become increasingly popular in recent years , and with heightened popularity has come a greatly widened consideration of what makes a salad . "
...500 Delicious Salads
These flowers that bloom in the spring , tra la , are the loveliest luncheon salads .
Spellbound .
The brilliant color of the cranberry ring filled with shrimp and garnished with pineapple slices and cream cheese makes a real picture .
This molded chicory crown will add new laurels to your reputation as a hostess .
Mold jellied salads in perky shapes for individual service instead of using large molds .
When arranged on a bed of chicory with mayonnaise piled in the center , they 'll keep the family coming back for more .
Turkey gobbler , sea lion or pussy cat will be the result of your skill and imagination
Horrors of Home Cooking : Recipes of Yesteryear - What can you do with Worchestershire sauce ?
Entirely too much for good sense , apparently .
Click here .
You can say THAT again , Sister !
The salads we 're going to be seeing today ain't your mamma's cole slaw , no -how .
These dishes are the Elton Johns of salads ...
The Liberace of Salads ... The Cher of Salads .
Bizarre !
Outrageous !
Time - consuming !
And often shaped like barnyard animals !
These are ....
Brought to us , it appears , by the Culinary Arts Institute 's Marlene Dietrich look - alike ... Because nothing says " Home Cooking " like the presence of a severe , booze - swilling Austrian actress .
And setting the stage for Overly - Detailed Salad Extravagance is this first item in the book , " Spring Flowerpot Salads " ...
You get the sense right away , that you 're stepping into an alternate universe when decorative salads like these are set up as the standard for everyday eating .
And then you read the caption : " Tra la " ?
See it 's the " tra la " that frightens .
The " tra la " that does n't so much convey lighthearted joy over salad - making as it does that the little wife has spent too much time inside the house forcing unnatural cheer during the Depression , and now some strange breezes are starting to blow through the windmills of her mind .
And as she becomes increasingly paranoid , why , even the SALADS HAVE EYES ... This salad reminds me of that Salvador Dali dream sequence in Hitchcock 's The caption reads : A picture ?
You mean one of those portraits where the subject 's eyes look back and follow you all over the room ?
Do you not SEE the eyes , O Culinary Arts Institute People ?
Are you turning a blind eye to the EYES ?
This is creeping me out .
Let 's move on to something a little more soothing .
Like to a miniaturized version of the set from " Lost . "
Once the passengers on flight 815 crash landed , they stayed for a healthy lunch of cream cheese , mayonnaise , unflavored gelatin and egg yolks .
The caption tells us : Possibly so -- folks really are hooked on " Lost , " are n't they ?
And next week you can serve a " Desparate Housewives " themed hotdog ring .
Speaking of desparate housewives , how about this salad ?.. The caption reads :
Oh , they 're perky all right !
If you put some Mardi Gras beads on the plate , it could be New Orleans during the parade .
Am I the only one who thinks Sigmund Freud would have had a field day with this dish ?
But now we move onto the holidays .
And what says Easter better than ... " Bunny Salads " ?
And no , they are NOT mice .
Or hamsters , or guinea pigs ...
They 're bunnies .
You can tell by the carrot on the plate next to them .
What -- guinea pigs and hamsters like carrots , too ?
Well , nevermind .
This is art .
And just what is this art that " will delight every youngster at the Easter party " ?
Lime gelatin , cottage cheese , pear halves , pimiento cheese and paprika .
Yes , indeed , what kid wants a cheeseburger and fries when he could have pimientos , curdled milk products and lime Jell - o ?
I notice -- and there 's no picture of it , I 'm sorry -- the book also suggests a " Duck Salad " where ducks heads are made from peach halves , cottage cheese and mayo .
Not a duck to be found in it !
So our friend Daffy can breathe a little easier .
And lastly , I give you ...
Turkey Salad !
The first official turkey salad I 've seen that 's 100 % turkey free !
It 's made with pears , pecans , watercress , apple , pineapple , candied cherries , cream cheese French dressing and , of course , pimiento .
And the caption confides :
And psychiatric evaluation will be the result of your salad ideas , dear Culinary Arts Insititute People .
I mean , first of all , this does n't really even LOOK very much like a turkey , does it ?
And then when you start trying to trot out things like kittens and SEA LIONS ... They 're going to be packing your bags for the Institute for the Very , Very Nervous in two shakes of that pussycat 's tail .
Well , that ends our journey into the wide world of 1940s salads .

Walt Disney would have been proud of John McCain ’s presentation on Thursday of what the world might look like at the end of a first McCain term as president .
Listening to the speech was like walking through the gates of Fantasyland , which Disney always said was the happiest kingdom of them all .
The war in Iraq will have been won .
Crack intelligence work will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden .
Taxes will be lower and the U.S. economy will be swell .
And maybe best of all ( I ’m not sure for whom ) , work will have begun on 20 brand - new nuclear reactors .
Senator McCain never bothered to mention how we were to reach this wondrous state , and he bristled when a reporter suggested he was offering a “ magic carpet ride . ”
Elisabeth Bumiller of The Times had the best line when she wrote in Friday ’s paper that “ there were no real checkable facts in Mr. McCain ’s divination . ”
Girls like writing and reading ; boys like math and science .
At least that 's the stereotype .
But a new survey shows that girls in elementary school actually like math and science better than language arts .
Researchers at the Miami University in Ohio surveyed nearly 2,000 girls in grades 4 through 8 at public and parochial schools and had them rate their enjoyment of four subjects , science , math , language arts and social studies , on a scale of 1 ( strongly dislike ) to 5 ( really like ) .
Fourth - grade girls clearly liked science the best ; their average enjoyment levels were :
4.11 for science
3.85 for math
3.5 for language arts
3.49 for social studies
As girls get older though , they seem to like science and math less , with science 's average likeability score falling to 3.29 for girls in 8th grade .
But these subjects are n't alone , as girls seemed to lose a little interest in every subject .
Likeability for social studies fell to 2.91 for 8th graders .
" It does n't seem like girls are losing interest in science and mathematics any more than they lose interest in other subjects , " said study team member Jennifer Blue , a physics professor at Miami .
Just why girls lose interest in all these subjects is something researchers have n't worked out .
But the good news , they say , is that girls regain some of their interest in science in college — Miami , for example , has more female botany , microbiology and zoology majors than male majors .
Up until recently it ’s been nearly impossible to know for certain where your online photos might end up on the Internet .
As we ’ve heard over the years a growing vocal minority will be the first to jump on photographers complaining about online image theft stating “ Get used to it .
You put it online .
That ’s how it is . ”
This argument is anything but true and frustrates the hell out of photographers who know better .
It ’s become clear there is a growing interest in new technologies to address the current “ wild west ” nature of image theft on the Internet by stock agencies and individual photographers alike .
Google recently released a research paper on VisualRank that like text search assigns a weighting and ranking to images while also leveraging image - recognition software methods .
Although Google is the 800 pound gorilla of search they ’ve been beat to the punch by IdÃ©e Inc. who recently released a private beta of TinEye .
As you ’ll see in TinEye ’s demonstration video they ’ve created an image search that is as simple as a Google search .
All an end user has to do is reference an image online or upload a low resolution image and TinEye returns results of where that image is currently found online .
What is most impressive is their image matching technology that will match similar images even if they ’ve been cropped , resized or Photoshop’d .
I am a born cynic , but after putting TinEye to the test with some of my photos I ’ve quickly become a believer and can’t wait for them to expand their search index and hopefully implement a Google Alert like service .
At the moment they ’ve indexed a relatively small portion of the Internet ( roughly 500,000,000 images ) , but they ’re asking beta testers to recommend sites to index .
The service at the moment is rather narrow , but I can see where this has legs to quickly expand .
Just to show an example I decided to search one of my more commonly referenced photos of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in New York City .
The blog post containing this image has been accessed nearly 50,000 times and it is one of my most popular photos .
With out a doubt I knew this would end up somewhere it was not supposed to .
In the past by monitoring my web site log I ’ve caught a few people using the image with out my knowledge , so I figured this would be a perfect example to test on TinEye .
Click to Enlarge
Sure enough I referenced the image on my blog and found a few more sites ( see above ) that had slipped by me who have been using my photo without my knowledge or permission .
Granted the jury is still out with TinEye , but my initial experience has been a good one .
The simplicity of the interface , the image - recognition capabilities and speed at which it finds images has caught my eye .
I ’ll definitely be watching TinEye as it develops and provide feedback through its beta stage .
If you ’re curious to try TinEye let me know in your comment to this post .
I have 50 invites that I can share .

KBR itself told the Pentagon in early 2007 about unsafe electrical wiring at a base near the Baghdad airport , but no repairs were made .
Less than a year later , a soldier was electrocuted in a shower there .
“ I do n’t feel like they did their job , ” Carmen Nolasco Duran of La Puente , Calif . , said of Pentagon officials .
Her brother , Specialist Marcos O. Nolasco , was electrocuted at a base in Baiji in May 2004 while showering .
“ They hired these contractors and yet they did n’t go and double - check that the work was fine . ”
The Defense Contract Management Agency , which is responsible for supervising maintenance work by contractors at American bases in Iraq , defended its performance .
In a written statement , the agency said it had no information that staff members “ were aware ” of the Army alert or “ failed to take appropriate action in response to unsafe conditions brought to our attention . ”
Keith Ernst , who stepped down Wednesday as the agency ’s director , said , though , that the agency was “ stretched too thin ” in Iraq and that the small number of contract officers did not have expertise in dealing with so - called life support contracts , like that awarded to KBR to provide food , shelter and building maintenance .
“ We do n’t have the technical capability for overseeing life support systems , ” he said .
For its part , KBR , which until last year was known as Kellogg , Brown and Root and was a subsidiary of Halliburton , denied that any lapses by the company had led to the electrocutions of American soldiers .
“ KBR ’s commitment to employee safety and the safety of those the company serves is unwavering , ” said a spokeswoman , Heather Browne .
“ KBR has found no evidence of a link between the work it has been tasked to perform and the reported electrocutions . ”
Image Jeffrey Bliss , an electrician who worked for KBR , the military contractor .
Ms. Browne declined to respond to the specific accounts of former KBR electricians .
Those electricians have a ready response to anyone who suggests that poor electrical work might be considered an unavoidable cost of war .
“ The excuse KBR always used was , ‘ This is a war zone  what do you expect ? ’ ” recalled Jeffrey Bliss , an Ohio electrician who worked for the company in Afghanistan in 2005 and 2006 .
“ But if you are going to do the work , you have got to do it safe . ”
State of the Union Sentence Bars
By : Jeff Clark Date : Thu , 01 May 2008
As I pointed out in my last post , Directed Sentence Drawings generated from a text make it extremely difficult to see in what order the various topics were discussed and that a simple bar for each sentence in the order they occurred in the text and coloured by topic would be much better in most respects .
I 've built a graphic to show what I mean .
I have also added the most frequent topic words for each set of 10 consecutive sentences .

It was 1976 .
Gerald Ford , the sitting president , had won 16 of 27 Republican primaries and led in the party 's delegate count .
But Ronald Reagan carried the nomination battle into the convention anyway .
Why wo n't some candidates concede ?
Hillary Clinton 's chances of winning the Democratic nomination are increasingly remote , with even a blow - out victory in Tuesday 's West Virginia primary unlikely to make much difference .
Still , the New York senator has vowed to continue campaigning until the nominating process ends June 3 in Montana , South Dakota and Puerto Rico .
Political analysts say office seekers who hang on , even long after the race seems futile , may be hoping to position themselves for a later run or to reshape the party more to their liking .
They may be bargaining for the vice presidency , feel pressure from supporters or believe there is an off - chance they will get lucky .
But what is clear from 1976 and two more - recent races is that the party took a drubbing when challengers refused to concede and instead pursued the nomination into the convention .
" The lesson is that you can make matters much worse for your party and yourself if you push this too far , " says American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm Ornstein .

McClellan testifies to House Judiciary Committee
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan is testifying to the House Judiciary Committee about his new revelations on the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame and the Bush administration ’s “ propaganda campaign ” that led the country into war .
McClellan was invited to testify after publication of his tell all memoir , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception .
Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said the revelations McClellan wrote about “ may or may not constitute an impeachable offense . ”
The revelation of a pre-war propaganda campaign was “ a confirmation that the White House played fast and loose with the truth in a time of war , ” Conyers said to open the hearing .
“ Depending on how one reads the Constitution , that may or may not be an impeachable offense . ”
Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , said Plame ’s outing was a direct component of that propaganda effort because it was aimed at discrediting her husband Joe Wilson , a former ambassador who undercut the administration ’s argument that Saddam Hussein was attempting to buy nuclear weapons materials from Africa .
Friday ’s hearing , he said , was aimed at uncovering possible evidence of obstruction of justice and painting a fuller picture of administration officials involvement “ not only in the leak but also in the coverup . ”
Rep. Lamar Smith , the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee , gave a prebuttal of McClellan ’s testimony , reciting accusations that McClellan was simply trying to make a buck with a critical book and that he was perhaps trying to get back at his former bosses .
He even name - checked controversial right - wing author Ann Coulter ’s book How to Talk to a Liberal and tried to tie McClellan to liberal financier George Soros , a favorite bogeyman of conservatives .
McClellan was sworn in before delivering his opening statement , which has been posted at the committee ’s Web site .
The former administration official , who began working for George W. Bush during his time as governor of Texas , criticized the campaign - style of governing Bush brought to the White House .
And he said the dirty politics that have become standard in the GOP were exemplified in the reaction to his memoir from conservatives and Bush allies .
“ I received plenty of criticism for daring to tell the story as I knew it , ” he said .
“ Yet few of my critics tried to refute the larger themes and perspectives in the book .
Instead of engaging in a reasoned , rational , and honest discussion of the issues raised , some sought to turn it into a game of ‘ gotcha , ’ misrepresenting what I wrote and seeking to discredit me through inaccurate personal attacks on me and my motives . ”
McClellan said he had no “ direct knowledge ” of whether President Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney were directly involved in outing Plame , but he criticized the White House for continuing to hide from a full accounting of the scandal , implying a cover - up could be ongoing .
“ This White House promised or assured the American people that at some point when this was behind us they would talk publicly about it , ” he said .
“ And they have refused to .
“ And that ’s why I think more than any other reason we are here today and the suspicion still remains , ” McClellan told the panel .
On the case for invading Iraq , McClellan said the president and his aides did not properly present the intelligence on the country and ignored doubts laid out by the intelligence community .
But he was wary to say the administration deliberately misled the nation into war .
“ I do n’t think there was a group sitting around saying let ’s mislead the American people , ” he said .
After less than an hour of testimony , the Judiciary Committee went on recess for debate and an expected vote on an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the U.S. Treasury Department is violating the law by failing to design and issue currency that is readily distinguishable to blind and visually impaired people .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a 2006 district court ruling that could force the United States to redesign its money so blind people can distinguish between values .
Suggested solutions include making bills different sizes , including raised markings or using foil printing which is a method of hot stamping that is tactically discernable .
Judge Judith Rogers , in a ruling on a suit by the American Council of the Blind , wrote that the Treasury Department 's failure to design and issue paper currency that is readily distinguishable to the visually impaired violates the Rehabilitation
Act 's guarantee of " meaningful access . "
The Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 was originally designed to extend civil rights to disabled individuals and provide them a full opportunity to participate in American society .
Rogers also wrote that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has not met his burden to show why changing the money would impose an undue burden .
" A large majority of other currency systems have accommodated the visually impaired , and the Secretary does not explain why U.S. currency should be any different , " Rogers wrote in her ruling .
The euro , for example , is one currency designed to be more readily identifiable .
Each banknote has a predominant color and large numbers to make them easier to see .
Also , the larger the denomination of the euro , the larger the banknote .
" We are very pleased with the ruling , " said a spokeswoman for the American Council of the Blind .
" We are hopeful that the Treasury Department will now get busy and come up with a plan to make paper money more readily identifiable for the visually impaired people all over the world . "
The Treasury Department has been working to improve the nation 's paper currency , according to Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for the Treasury .
" Most recently the Bureau of Engraving and Printing contracted with a research firm to conduct a comprehensive study to gather additional data , research and analysis for development of methods to help the blind and visually impaired , " Zuccarelli said in an e-mail to CNNMoney.com .
" The results of this study will be available by early 2009 , and the Bureau will take that information under consideration when they transition in new production equipment in both printing facilities in the following years . "
However , Paul Schroeder , vice president for programs and policy for American Foundation for the Blind , a nonprofit group based in New York , said he " would not be surprised " if the Treasury Department appealed the court 's decision .
While Schroeder said it would be feasible to address this challenge , whatever solution is ultimately found must " work within a very substantial infrastructure " of U.S. currency .
The suit was originally filed in 2002 by the American Council of the Blind and two individuals with visual impairments , Patrick Sheehan and Otis Stephens .
The appeals court ruled 2 - 1 , with Judge A. Raymond Randolph dissenting .
Judge Thomas Griffith joined Rogers in voting to uphold the lower court ruling .
I had the pleasure of being in scientist - philosopher - mystic Nassim Haramein 's session at the Institute of Noetic Sciences conference a while back .
His was one of the most interesting presentations .
A multi-dimensional pioneer , he is working on a unified field theory he calls the “ Holofractographic Universe . ”
I deeply resonated with what he was saying - not through the lens of a scientist , but through my lens of the living , fertile , fractaled , integrative , shape - forming , creative universe .
He has mathematically and scientifically discovered what creators and mystics have always known - that we create by feedback and change and that we are all beings of infinite creative potential - in a very literal sense : the vacuum is not empty - it is not nothing .
It is actually highly organizing and always communicating - an " unknown " that is actually fertile with creative potential .
He founded The Resonance Project Foundation .
You can see him speak on the Crossing the Event Horizon video on YouTube .
I found this write - up of him at The Laughing Coach Newsletter :
Nassim Haramein , a world traveler , was born in Geneva , Switzerland .
As early as 9 years old , Nassim was already developing the basis for a holographic hyper - dimensional theory of everything he calls the “ Holofractographic Universe . ”
The Holofractographic Universe theory is a unified field theory resulting from over two decades of investigation into the geometry of hyper - dimensional systems and their relation to the creation of three - dimensional reality and all of its forces — including consciousness .
The premise of The Holofractographic Unified Field
Theory research is that space is not empty , it is full .
It is full of an energy that , through a specific set of fractal geometry , creates atomic structures that are themselves made of 99.999 % space .
It is a sea of electromagnetic flux we call the zero point energy , which has been demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt , since its mechanical effects have now been measured in laboratories .
This is nothing new , most ancient civilizations believed in a primordial soup of energy embedded within the fabric of space and in a primary geometric pattern coordinating creation .
Later many of the world 's great thinkers , including such scientists as Albert Einstein , Nicolas Tesla , Buckminster Fuller , and Walter Russell , believed in an all prevailing energy at the base of the fabric of space .
Haramein 's findings have resulted in theoretical and practical developments based on a specific geometric array fundamental to creation .
This theory has now been presented to the standard scientific community with great success , and his papers on the Holofractographic Universe will soon be followed by a book for the layman entitled " Crossing the Event Horizon . "
Nassim 's investigation of the geometry of hyperspace has combined quantum physics and cosmological understandings of universal forces with other sciences such as biology and philosophy , resulting in advanced unification computations that , astonishingly , relates to ancient codes left in monuments and documents around the world — including the Bible , the I Ching , the Mayan Sacred Calendar , Pyramids , and Egyptian temples .
The results of his research may bring our planet to a new dimension of understanding and existence , one which was predicted by the ancients to arrive at this time in history .
Nassim is fluent in both French and English .
He conducts workshops and seminars on his theories to help bring an awareness that is greatly needed in these times .
His lectures are designed around his life experiences beginning with childhood illuminations and culminating in the discovery of a technology and united view that seems to have been left encoded by ancient civilizations for us to rediscover .
His work may lead to some of the most important scientific , philosophic and technological discoveries in written history .

Presidential Bloodlust
The Movie - Made War World of George W. Bush
By Tom Engelhardt
Here 's a memory for you .
I was probably five or six and sitting with my father in a movie house off New York 's Times Square -- one of the slightly seedy theaters of that dawn of the 1950s moment that tended to show double or triple feature B - westerns or war movies .
We were catching some old oater which , as I recall , began with a stagecoach careening dramatically down the main street of a cow town .
A wounded man is slumped in the driver 's seat , the horses running wild .
Suddenly -- perhaps from the town 's newspaper office -- a cowboy dressed in white and in a white Stetson rushes out , leaps on the team of horses , stops the stagecoach , and says to the driver : " Sam , Sam , who dun it to ya ? " ( or the equivalent ) .
At just that moment , the camera catches a man , dressed all in black in a black hat -- and undoubtedly mustachioed -- skulking into the saloon .
My dad promptly turns to me and whispers : " He 's the one .
He did it . "
Believe me , I 'm awed .
All I can say in wonder and protest is : " Dad , how can you know ?
How can you know ? "
But , of course , he did know and , within a year or two , I certainly had the same simple code of good and evil , hero and villain , under my belt .
It was n't a mistake I was likely to make twice .
Above all , of course , you could n't mistake the bad guys of those old films .
They looked evil .
If they were " natives , " they also made no bones about what they were going to do to the white hats , or , in the case of Gunga Din ( 1939 ) , the pith helmets .
" Rise , our new - made brothers , " the evil " guru " of that film tells his followers .
" Rise and kill .
Kill , lest you be killed yourselves .
Kill for the love of killing .
Kill for the love of Kali. Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! "
" Wipe Them Out ! "
Kill ! Kill !
Kill !
That was just the sort of thing the native equivalent of the black hat was likely to say .
Such villains -- for a modern reprise , see the latest cartoon superhero blockbuster , Iron Man -- were not only fanatical , but usually at the very edge of madness as well .
And their language reflected that .
I was brought back with a start to just such evil - doers of my American screen childhood last week by a memoir from a once - upon - a- time insider of the Bush presidency .
No , not former White House press secretary Scott McClellan , who swept into the headlines by accusing the President of using " propaganda " and the " complicit enablers " of the media to take the U.S. to war in 2002 - 2003 .
I 'm thinking of another insider , former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez .
He got next to no attention for a presidential outburst he recorded in his memoir , Wiser in Battle : A Soldier 's Story , so bloodthirsty and cartoonish that it should have caught the attention of the nation -- and so eerily in character , given the last years of presidential behavior , that you know it has to be on the money .
Let me briefly set the scene , as Sanchez tells it on pages 349-350 of Wiser in Battle .
It 's April 6 , 2004 .
L. Paul Bremer III , head of the occupation 's Coalition Provisional Authority , as well as the President 's colonial viceroy in Baghdad , and Gen.
Sanchez were in Iraq in video teleconference with the President , Secretary of State Colin Powell , and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
( Assumedly , the event was recorded and so revisitable by a note - taking Sanchez . )
The first full - scale American offensive against the resistant Sunni city of Fallujah was just being launched , while , in Iraq 's Shiite south , the U.S. military was preparing for a campaign against cleric Muqtada al - Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia .
According to Sanchez , Powell was talking tough that day : " We 've got to smash somebody 's ass quickly , " the general reports him saying .
" There has to be a total victory somewhere .
We must have a brute demonstration of power . "
( And indeed , by the end of April , parts of Fallujah would be in ruins , as , by August , would expanses of the oldest parts of the holy Shiite city of Najaf .
Sadr himself would , however , escape to fight another day ; and , in order to declare Powell 's " total victory , " the U.S. military would have to return to Fallujah that November , after the U.S. presidential election , and reduce three - quarters of it to virtual rubble . )
Bush then turned to the subject of al - Sadr : " At the end of this campaign al - Sadr must be gone , " he insisted to his top advisors .
" At a minimum , he will be arrested .
It is essential he be wiped out . "
Not long after that , the President " launched " what an evidently bewildered Sanchez politely describes as " a kind of confused pep talk regarding both Fallujah and our upcoming southern campaign [ against the Mahdi Army ] . "
Here then is that " pep talk . "
While you read it , try to imagine anything like it coming out of the mouth of any other American president , or anything not like it coming out of the mouth of any evil enemy leader in the films of the President 's -- and my -- childhood :
" ' Kick ass ! ' [ Bush ] said , echoing Colin Powell 's tough talk .
' If somebody tries to stop the march to democracy , we will seek them out and kill them !
We must be tougher than hell !
This Vietnam stuff , this is not even close .
It is a mind - set .
We can't send that message .
It 's an excuse to prepare us for withdrawal .
" There is a series of moments and this is one of them .
Our will is being tested , but we are resolute .
We have a better way .
Stay strong !
Stay the course !
Kill them !
Be confident !
Prevail !
We are going to wipe them out !
We are not blinking ! ' "
Keep in mind that the bloodlusty rhetoric of this " pep talk " was n't meant to rev up Marines heading into battle .
These were the President 's well - embunkered top advisors in a strategy session on the eve of major military offensives in Iraq .
Evidently , however , the President was intent on imitating George C. Scott playing General George Patton -- or perhaps even inadvertently channeling one of the evil villains of his onscreen childhood .
American Mad Mullahs
Let 's recall a little history here :
In the nineteenth century , Third World leaders who opposed Western imperial control were often not only demonized but imagined to be , in some sense , mad simply for taking on Western might .
Throughout the latter part of that century , for instance , the British faced down various " mad mullahs " in North Africa .
Later , such imagery migrated easily enough to imperial Hollywood and thence into American movie houses .
But here was the strange thing :
In the Vietnam years , that era of reversals , a president of the United States privately expressed , for the first time , a desire to take on the mantle of madness previous reserved for the enemy in American culture ( and undoubtedly many other cultures as well ) .
It was not just that President Richard Nixon 's domestic critics were ready to label him a madman , but that , in his desire to end the Vietnam War in a satisfyingly victorious fashion , he was ready to label himself one .
" I call it the madman theory , Bob , " Nixon aide H.R. Haldeman reported the President saying .
" I want the North Vietnamese to believe I 've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war .
We 'll just slip the word to them that , ' for God 's sake , you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism .
We can't restrain him when he 's angry -- and he has his hand on the nuclear button ' -- and [ North Vietnamese leader ]
Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace . "
Henry Kissinger , Nixon 's national security adviser , was equally fascinated with the possible bargaining advantage of having the enemy imagine the President as an evil , potentially world - obliterating madman .
" Henry talked about it so much , " according to Lawrence Lynn , a Kissinger aide , " that the Russians and North Vietnamese would n't run risks because of Nixon 's character . "
What made this fascination with the idea of a mad president more curious was that it fused with fears held by White House aides and advisers that Nixon , finger on the nuclear button , might indeed be impaired or nearing the edge of derangement .
" My drunken friend , " " that drunken lunatic , " " the meatball mind , " or " the basket case , " was the way Kissinger referred to him after receiving his share of slurred late night phone calls .
So , in a historic moment almost four decades ago , a desperate president suddenly found it strategically advisable to present himself to his enemies as a potential nation slaughterer , a world incinerator ( and his aides were privately ready to think of him as such ) ; the leader of what was then commonly termed " the Free World , " that is , was considering revealing himself as a mad emperor , a veritable Ming the Merciless .
Skip ahead these several decades and , presidentially , things have only gotten stranger .
After all , we now have a president who has openly , even eagerly , faced the world as the Commander - in - Chief of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques , Extraordinary Rendition , and Offshore Imprisonment ; a Vice President who appeared openly on Capitol Hill to lobby against a bill banning torture ; and key cabinet members who , from a White House conference room , micromanaged torture , down to specific techniques in specific cases .
Talk about Ming the Merciless .
Back in the 1960s and 1970s , you had one president whose critics would call him a " baby killer " -- " that horrible song " was the way President Lyndon Baines Johnson referred to the antiwar chant , " Hey , hey , LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? " -- and another ready to take on the mantle of madness for purposes of private diplomacy ; and each was reportedly brought to the edge of private madness while in office .
But both were also uncomfortable with imagery of themselves and exceedingly awkward in the televisual world of politics that was already starting to surround them ; neither imagined himself " in the movies . "
Last Screen Appearance ?
Usually Ronald Reagan , an actual actor , is seen as the president who spent his time in office playing the role of a lifetime , but , as it happens , he had nothing on George W. Bush .
From the moment the attacks of September 11 , 2001 gave him his " calling " as a " wartime " president , he has been deeply embroiled in acting out his cartoonish version of the role of the century .
In fact , he has often seemed like little more than an overgrown boy plunged into his own war movie and war - play memories .
Let 's remember that , soon after 9/11 , this President launched his " crusade , this war on terrorism " with an image of a poster from some generic Western of his childhood .
( " Bush offered some of his most blunt language to date when he was asked if he wanted bin Laden dead .
' I want justice , ' Bush said .
' And there 's an old poster out West I recall , that said , Wanted , Dead or Alive . ' " )
For years , he visibly glowed when publicly dressing up in a way that was redolent of the boy version of war ( that is , doll ... er , action figure ) play .
While Abraham Lincoln never put on a uniform and an actual general , Dwight D. Eisenhower , put his in the closet in his years as president , Bush uniquely and repeatedly appeared in public togged out in military wear , looking for all the world like a life - sized version of the original 12 - inch G.I .
Joe action figure -- whether " landing " a jet on the aircraft carrier , the USS Abraham Lincoln , and stepping out in a nifty flight suit , or appearing before massed hooah - ing troops in specially tailored jackets with " George W. Bush , Commander In Chief " carefully stitched across the breast .
( In fact , more than one toy company did indeed produce G.I. Joe-style Bush action figures . )
Evident above all , from September 14 , 2001 -- when he climbed that pile of rubble at " Ground Zero " in New York City and , bullhorn in hand , to " USA ! USA ! " cheers , wiped out the ignominy of his actions on the actual day of the attacks -- was just how much he enjoyed his role as resolute leader of a wartime America .
While his Vice President and top advisors were grimly , if eagerly , preparing to whack Saddam Hussein and taking the opportunity to create a permanent commander - in - chief presidency , the President was visibly having the time of his life , perhaps for the first time since he gave up those " wild parties " of his youth .
A rivulet of telling details about his behavior has flowed by us in these years .
We know from Bob Woodward of the Washington Post , for instance , that , after 9/11 , Bush kept " his own personal scorecard for the war " in a desk drawer in the Oval Office -- photos with brief biographies and personality sketches of leading al - Qaeda figures , whose faces could be satisfyingly crossed out when killed or captured .
In July 2003 , frustrated by signs that the Sunni insurgency in Iraq was n't going away , he impulsively offered this bit of bluster to reporters ( as if he were the one who would take the brunt of future attacks ) :
" There are some who feel like the conditions are such that they can attack us there .
My answer is , bring 'em on . "
In those moments when he spoke or acted spontaneously , there are plentiful clues that Bush took deep pleasure in finding himself in the role of commander - in - chief , and that he has been genuinely thrilled to do commander - in - chief - like things , at least as once pictured in the on - screen fantasy world of his youth .
He was thrilled , for example , to receive from some of the troops who captured Saddam Hussein the pistol that the dictator had with him in his " spiderhole . "
Back in 2004 , TIME Magazine 's Matthew Cooper reported : " ' He really liked showing it off , ' says a recent visitor to the White House who has seen the gun .
' He was really proud of it . '
The pistol 's new place of residence is in the small study next to the Oval Office where Bush takes select visitors . "
Similarly , he returned from one of his brief trips to Iraq " inspired " by a meeting with the pilot who shot off the missile that incinerated Bin Laden wannabe Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
On and off throughout these years , you could glimpse just what a cartoon - like white - hat / black - hat persona he imagined himself to be playing .
This was true whether he was in his blustery tough - guy mode , as when , in September 2007 , he arrived in Australia publicly proclaiming that the U.S. was " kicking ass " in Iraq ; or when , as commander - in - chief , he regularly teared up with genuine ( movie ) emotion as he handed out medals , some posthumous , for bravery ; or even when he discussed his own wartime version of " sacrifice " -- he claimed to have given up golf for his war .
As he told Mike Allen of Politico.com : " I do n't want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander - in - chief playing golf .
I feel I owe it to the families to be as -- to be in solidarity as best as I can with them .
And I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal . "
The Washington Post 's Dan Froomkin has pointed out that even Bush 's callow sacrifice of golf was n't real -- he kept on playing -- but that hardly matters .
What 's crucial is that all this real life play - acting still moves , even thrills , him .
Recently , for instance , he gave a graduation speech at the U.S. Air Force Academy , where he once again compared Iraq to World War II ( and so , implicitly , himself to President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , a bust of whom he has kept in the Oval Office all these years ) .
As Associated Press reporter Ben Feller commented : " Bush noted it was his last military academy commencement speech , and he seemed to savor it .
He personally congratulated each cadet as cheers bounded across the stadium . "
Note that word " savor , " when linked to the military and his commander - in - chief role .
It 's been a quality evident in the President 's ongoing performance these last seven years .
The photos of him goofing around with Air Force Academy graduates after his speech tell the story well .
In all this , you can sense a man in his own bubble world , engrossed in , and satisfied with , his own performance -- both as actor and , as in childhood , audience .
What Gen. Ricardo Sanchez has added to this is the picture of a man who , even in 2004 , was already dreaming Vietnam disaster ( " This Vietnam stuff We can't send that message . " ) ; who , perhaps sensing that his blockbuster was busting , like Richard Nixon before him , proved willing to mix the white - hat and black - hat codes of his movie childhood in remarkable ways .
Under the strain of a failing war , in private and among his top officials , he did n't hesitate to take on that " guru " role and rally his closest followers with a call to kill , kill , kill !
A confused pep talk indeed .
Even if Bush is still exhorting his top officials not to " blink , " Americans should .
After all , there are almost eight months left to his presidency , and a man of such stunning immaturity , who confuses fantasy with real life , and is given to outbursts of challenge , bluster , and bloodlust should be taken seriously .
Nixon's " mad mullah " stayed private until transcripts of the Watergate tapes and memoirs started coming out .
For us , the question remains , will this President be able to take a final turn on - screen before his term ends , playing the " mad mullah " in relation to Iran ?

[ Note for Readers :
As far as I know , the key passage in Sanchez 's memoirs quoted in this piece was first noticed and commented upon by that indefatigable Iraq reporter , Patrick Cockburn .
Unlike the key passages in Scott McClellan 's memoir , this one from Sanchez 's book has been little attended to .
However , Dan Froomkin ( cited in this piece ) , who does the Washington Post 's online column , White House Watch , also noted its existence .
That 's not surprising .
He seems never to miss any important development when it comes to the Bush administration .
I link to his invaluable column often .
As far as I 'm concerned , it may be the most striking example of the sort of service a sharp columnist for a major paper can offer in the online world .
I find it a daily must - read and recommend it strongly .

Wizards of the Coast plans to supplement ?
Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition , the masterful revamp of the venerable game system that was released Friday , with a new online component .
Called D&D
Insider , the service will mark the first time anything of this scope has been integrated with a pen-and - paper title .
D&D publisher Wizards of the Coast has not yet provided Wired.com with an expected launch date for the online offering .
Unfortunately , D&D Insider , or D&DI , may be banished to an existence on the fringes of the hobby , all due to bad timing and a bad business decision made by Wizards of the Coast .
That 's an incredible shame , because at its core D&DI is incredibly ambitious .
First and foremost , it will be a storehouse of knowledge for players and dungeon masters , or DMs .
The two magazines ( imaginatively named Dragon and Dungeon )
that have long served the Dungeons & Dragons player base will be incorporated into the D&DI site .
Regular articles will appear there , offering new options for players looking to improve their characters and new adventures for DMs to run .
D&DI will serve as an information storehouse , with players having the option of unlocking online versions of the D&D books for a very small fee .
Subscribers will have access to the D&D Compendium , which is a searchable rules - mechanics database , for use as reference .
The most ambitious component of D&D
Insider is a " virtual tabletop " called the D&D Game Table .
It 's a client that will allow a DM and players to participate together in fights , conversations and role - playing experiences online .
A character model creator called the Character Visualizer will have players customizing their appearances in ways simply not possible with the traditional metal or plastic miniature figurines .
A tile - set manipulator will allow a DM to create a dungeon to explore in a short amount of time , and tools will be available for the DM to reference monster descriptions at a glance .
All of this will be tied together by a voice - chat service with special " voice fonts . "
Participants can actually use masks to disguise their voices , so a young man can sound like an older one , a high - voiced woman like an orc , or even a gruff - voiced male like a female .
The D&D Game Table will utilize VOIP , which will be powered by Vivox .?
The virtual tabletop is a product that has been offered before by various third - party companies , but never with this level of sophistication .
It 's also never been tied into the core game the way D&DI is , nor coupled with the Dungeon and Dragon magazines – respected publications with a long history of serving the D&D community .
In short , D&DI should be a tremendous service .
The only problem , aside from the fact that the service was not available when the D&D 4th Edition books went on sale , is D&DI 's price tag .
Details uncorked at D&D Experience earlier this year revealed that Wizards of the Coast is rolling out a subscription model used by many massively multiplayer games .
In order to gain access to the service , players will be asked to pay $ 15 a month .
Buying in bulk months ahead of time can reduce that price somewhat – to $ 13 a month if buying a six - month block or $ 10 a month for a 12 - month block .
For a hobby that has ( despite the high prices of the actual D&D books ) mostly been a fairly cheap pastime , D&DI 's pricing is tantamount to highway robbery .
It may sound reasonable – until you consider that in order to participate in an online event , each player will need to be paying this fee .
For an average group of four players and a dungeon master , that 's a monthly outlay of about $ 75 .
Even at the lowest price of $ 10 a month , that 's roughly $ 50 a month just for that one group .
To be sure , it 's a great value for the money – when Dungeon and Dragon were print magazines , they each cost about this much .
D&DI offers both magazines in electronic format , plus the convenience of the virtual tabletop .
In my eyes , though , this is a huge missed opportunity .
Wizards of the Coast is mimicking the pricing schemes of massively multiplayer games like EverQuest and Ultima * Online * from 10 years ago , without considering the advances in player behavior ( and business models ) that have come since then .
What Wizards of the Coast has a chance to do here is nothing short of inspirational : Reintroduce an entire generation of online - gaming kids to D&D .
Get them playing in that online mind - set , but with a whole layer of socialization and personal interaction that just is n't possible in a game like Counter - Strike or even most Massive titles .
That monthly fee may look great to the accountants , but for a 12 - year - old , that fee might as well be a giant Keep Out sign .
Instead of aping EverQuest , Wizards should be looking to the recent successes of Korean import Nexon , which runs the highly successful ( and free to play ) titles MapleStory , Audition and Kart Rider .
In Korea , these games have millions and millions of players .
Here in the United States , they 've taken off as well , with MapleStory alone gaining 5 million users since it launched last year .
Those users , though they pay no regular monthly fee , make Nexon piles and piles of money every month .
Nexon makes its money through microtransactions , selling in - game items to its players .
Instead of selling items , Wizards of the Coast should be thinking about selling time on a small scale .
Offer the virtual tabletop service to everyone – for an hourly fee .
Most gaming groups meet once a week , and game sessions can go anywhere from an hour to ( in the case of marathon gamers ) 10 hours or more .
Most groups I 've played with fell toward the more reasonable number of five or six hours – an enjoyable afternoon / evening with friends .
If Wizards of the Coast were serious about breaking open the online tabletop market , it would offer players the opportunity to buy hours at varying rates .
For folks who only want to play once a week , a handful of hours would buy them all the time they needed .
That 's the typical user , and Wizards would still get a decent amount of money from that transaction .
The key is that this type of model includes the other two extremes much better .
Say a kid hears about D&D from his friends and decides to hop online to play with them one night .
All he needs to buy are the few hours he 'll use to try out the game .
He needs no more , no less .
With a flat monthly fee , he 's given no opportunity to experience the tabletop for himself , to decide if that steep cost is worth it .
UPDATE : D&DI subscribers will be given guest passes to use with members of their gaming group , allowing friends to try to online experience before making a purchase decision , according to a Wizards of the Coast representative .
Marathon gamers , who meet multiple times a week or for longer sessions , fall at the other end of the spectrum .
Hourly rates would allow Wizards to make even more money off these players than a flat fee would allow .
This is just an example , an alternative to the subscription model .
There are several other ways Wizards could offer this service , including event - based tickets or Nexon 's microtransactions .
The point here is that a flat fee is a disservice to the potential of Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition and the virtual tabletop concept .
Wizards has the opportunity to turn this niche hobby into a mainstream success story – but the company is locking that greatness behind a lock and key .
Just this week , the company announced that D&D Insider will see a few months of free - to - play shakeout before the service enters subscription mode .
UPDATE : Wizards will let players test D&DI free for an as - yet - undetermined length of time once the service becomes available .
The testing period is dependent on many factors , including the readiness of the D&DI applications , according to the Wizards rep .
My hope is that in that time , Wizards will realize its error .
The gate between D&D Insider and the D&D player does more harm than good .
The more people rooting through dungeons and slaying monsters , the better .

There is a very specific NBA rule that says that team personnel can not talk to High School players unless it is at an approved event or function .
No one associated with an NBA team can shill , sell , preach , promise , promote or praise to , with or around High School players .
This is a good thing .
A very good thing .
However , the lack of open communication between anyone at the NBA and High School players and coaches creates an obvious information gap .
As with any business , when there are millions of dollars available each and every year , there will be those that insert themselves into the gap with promises that they can provide the link between the have and have nots .
Politicians can find every loophole available when it comes to fund raising and agents can find every loophole when it comes to enticing kids with stories of sugarplum fairies , first round picks and unspeakable riches .
Why compare politicians and agents ?
Well if you have met either , you have met both .
One size does not fit all , but it certainly fits many , in both worlds .
Both professions thrive on plausible deniability .
Neither seem to have any more than a superficial understanding of how money they direct will finally be used .
Which to them is a good thing .
It allows them to deny that the money they gave one of their employees to give one of their associates to give to an affiliate of a local group that truly sounded like a very worthy charitable organization was used for anything other than what they thought it would be used for : to help those far less fortunate than themselves .
In this entire OJ Mayo story , the only thing I find highly implausible is that only 30 k dollars was identified as changing hands .
There are far too many agents competing in the market for projected 1st round draft picks for a high school senior who some consider a lottery pick to settle for 30 k .
Even High School kids learn quickly to play one agent off against the other .
How do you think they picked the shoe company that put shoes on their family ’s feet ?
So what should be done ?
I can tell you that an NBA study , as well as an NBA / NCAA joint effort would be meaningless .
Why ?
Because the root of the problem is that there will always be those that try to profit from other people ’s dreams .
It may be a dream of playing in the Olympics .
It may be a dream of playing in the NBA .
It may be a dream of being rich .
It may be a dream of going to college .
Unless there is an efficient market of information going between those who can make the dreams come true and the dreamers , which I do n’t think is possible given the way the NCAA and High School organizations interact with student athletes , then there will always be room for the scammers to capitalize on those dreams .
Fortunately there is a simple solution .
Bring in the IRS .
I think I can say with certainty that there were not any contracts signed between the parties giving and receiving money on the behalf of High School students .
Agree ?
I think I can also say with certainty that those who gave more than 10 k dollars in gifts did not pay any gift taxes on amounts given to individuals .
If the amounts were given to charities , I ’m guessing some , if not most of those charities were either not qualified or did not live up to their certification requirements .
Get the IRS involved , and I bet not only would the investigation pay for itself with untold millions coming back to the US Treasury in taxes and penalties , but the agents would clean up their acts very , very quickly .
It would also clean up much of what ails “ amateur ” basketball .
Its a world that has become dependent on a thriving underground economy .
its a cash business .
Just the kind the IRS should and could step in to clean up .
Hey , it worked on Al Capone , and the reality is , some of the agents in the game today , are not much more legit .

Episode 14
So the Boss had sensed a touch of animosity between us and one of our main software vendors after a recent bill and decided to grab the bull by the horns and invite them in to press - the - flesh and explain the new charging model they applied to us - without notice .
Apparently , their reasoning ends up being that the new licensing model is one that 's both fair to us and fair to other lower - use sites by applying a model which truly reflects the use their application 's being put to , number of concurrent users , CPUs it 's running on , the potential benefits to an organisation our size , blah , blah , blah .
" Cup of coffee ? " the PFY asks , stepping over to the espresso machine once the presentation is over .
" I... do n't know , " the Rep # 1 chuckles .
" Are you going to charge me for it ? "
" Of course not , " the PFY says .
" It 's on the house ! "
" Well in that case , sure . "
" Me too , " Rep # 2 says .
" How would you like it ? "
" I... can you make a Café Latte ? "
" Sure - I can even make a Mocha if you want . "
" A Mocha would be great ! "
" Yes , I 'll have one as well , " Rep # 2 says again .
...
" Thanks , " # 1 says , taking his steaming mug of chocolate infused caffeine and sipping vigorously .
" Ta , " # 2 adds , following # 1 's lead and sucking down several steaming mouthfuls .
" Okay , so all up that 'll be £ 47 , uhh ... 83 p " the PFY says , thinking hard .
" Sorry ? "
" £ 47.83 "
" What for ? "
" Your drinks . "
" You said they were free ! "
" No , I said the coffee was free , but there 's the chocolate to consider , cup licensing , cup hardware maintenance , cup support line subscription . "
" What do you mean cup licensing ? "
" It 's our cup and you 're making use of it .
Obviously , it will be returned to us , at which time it'll probably need some preventative hardware maintenance . "
" You mean you have to wash it ? "
" We prefer to think of it as a total maintenance solution aimed at providing the best possible cup experience for the user . "
" So what 's the support line subscription about then ?
I hardly think we'd want to be paying that ! "
" Cup support line subscription is a compulsory product - you can't elect not to take it . "
" So what do we get for the support line subscription ? "
" You get the ability to call our support line 24 hours a day . "
" And what , you 'll give us help if the drink has ... made us ill ? "
" Possibly - if you ring us during work hours . "
" You said it was a 24 hour line ! "
" The phone will ring any time of the day or night . "
" So we 'd have to leave a message then ? "
" Leaving messages would require an update to our Gold plan . "
" So say I got ill tonight , if I 'm on your Gold plan you 'd sort me out with a medical attention ? "
" We 'd sort you out with a doctor 's phone number .
From the Yellow Pages .
On Monday morning . "
" So we 're not really getting much for Gold support then are we ? "
" No , you 're right , Platinum is the best option " the PFY responds .
" With Gold support we can probably help you with phone numbers , but Platinum support would get you my cellphone number and my firsthand knowledge of the way the coffee was made and what potential problems might arise - determined from our extensive logs of previous coffee drinkers .
We also have an in depth knowledge of the various mocha ingredients - which may have contained traces of nut , I 'm not sure . "
" Neither of us has a nut allergy , " # 2 blurts .
" And we welcome coffee clients with a proactive attitude to their own maintenance programs !
As I 've said , neither the Gold nor Platinum support models are compulsory by any means - because we like to be fair to all our coffee clients , big and small , and try to tailor our coffee support model to truly reflect the use the coffee 's being put to , the number of cups the user has a day , the size of the cup and the individual blend choices which each client may desire . "
" So what if we choose not to buy your coffee in the first place ? "
" As you 've already had about a third of the coffee you 've pretty much already committed to the coffee experience - what with the restocking fee of £ 50 and all - and to be brutally frank the cups you 're drinking from were washed in a porcelain device not normally associated with food hygiene so I doubt that finishing the cup would have much difference at this stage .
I would , however , stress that we would strongly recommend your upgrade to the Platinum support model so that we can aid in the ' debugging ' exercise should you become violently ill in say ... six or seven hours time ... "
" You ... "
" I know what you 're going to say - you like the cut of our licensing gib ? "
" No , " # 1 responds .
" I was just wondering what your manager will think about this extortion ? "
" Not a lot I should n't think " , I respond .
" Given that the muffins he had at the beginning of your presentation was made in a certain porcelain mixing bowl . "

Travis Frantti knocks on the front door , ready to make his pitch for Hillary Rodham Clinton .
It 's the final weekend before Tuesday 's presidential primary in Pennsylvania , and he and his mother are out canvassing in suburban Pittsburgh , a printout of persuadable Democrats and a stack of campaign literature in hand .
Joe Machi , their first " customer , " is still undecided .
" I 'll just toss a coin , " jokes the real estate investor , as Ann Frantti hands a Hillary pin to his young son .
Then he gets serious : " I still want to hear more about the issues , rather than this peripheral stuff . "
In a way , Mr. Machi represents the holy grail of the final push for votes in Pennsylvania : white male Democrats .
As a group , they are nearly evenly divided between Senator Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama .
And individually , white male Democrats express the most ambivalence about the two candidates .
A recent poll from Temple University in Philadelphia asked likely Democratic voters to rate the favorability of Clinton and Obama on a scale of 1 to 10 , with 10 being most favorable .
The contest was closest among white men who gave Clinton an average of 6.4 and Obama 6.9 .
When only voters over 30 are considered , the numbers get even tighter : 6.5 for Clinton and 6.7 for Obama .
Pennsylvania 's white women , in contrast , clearly are more enthusiastic about Clinton .
They give her an average favorability of 7.8 , versus 5.9 for Obama .
So what 's up with the white guys ?
" I 'm more and more impressed as time goes on that this election is about which candidate you think is more like you , " says Michael Hagen , director of Temple 's Institute for Public Affairs .
That 's why , he adds , the candidates have spent so much time in the past six weeks aiming their messages at white men – not always successfully .
Obama 's adventure in ten - pin bowling , scoring a 37 in seven frames , did not exactly impress , while images of Clinton knocking back liquor , and talking about how her dad taught her how to shoot at their Pennsylvania cottage , struck some voters as pandering .
In a state where many counties give schoolchildren a day off for the opening of deer - hunting season , gun rights are considered a nearly sacred matter .
But Clinton 's record as a supporter of gun control did n't exactly square with her attempts to come across as gun friendly .
It is Obama , though , who seriously risked alienating gun owners in the run up to Pennsylvania with his private comments at a San Francisco fundraiser , where he talked about " bitter " small - town voters who " cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them . "
But for now , what has been dubbed " Bittergate " does not seem to have hurt Obama in Pennsylvania , at least in the Democratic primary .
The average of the latest polls shows him trailing Clinton by about five percentage points , which is roughly where he has been since he began advertising heavily in the state .
In conversations with voters at a front - porch rally featuring Bill Clinton in Brookville , Pa. , a town of 5,000 , none of the Democrats expressed concern over Obama 's remark .
Many present were Republicans , out on a sunny day to see an ex-president in the flesh , but with no intention of considering either his wife or Obama in November .
Bill French , a longtime Brookville resident , counts himself among Pennsylvania 's ambivalent white male Democrats .
He was disappointed by last Wednesday 's Clinton - Obama debate which was dominated by a discussion of both candidates ' gaffes of the past month , and still has not made a final decision between the two .
" I want to hear them debate , and stop the name - calling , " says Mr. French , a retired high school history teacher who is now an Episcopal priest .
" Which of these two will bring jobs back to northwestern Pennsylvania ? "
When asked about " Bittergate , " French leans in and whispers : " In some ways [ Obama ] is right .
Some of these guys would die before they 'd give up their guns . "
Jeannie Harriger Petardi , a local real estate agent and gun owner , is leaning toward Clinton in the primary , but would be fine with Obama as the nominee .
" A lot of Obama supporters would rather have a man , which makes me annoyed , " she says .
Then there are the Clinton supporters who say they would never vote for Obama .
" If he can't wear an American flag pin , I ca n't vote for him , " says John Delaney , a Vietnam War vet who is sporting a " Dumb and Dumber " T - shirt showing President Bush and his father ( which he says former President Clinton refused to sign ) .
" I 'm hoping Hillary beats him , " he adds .
" If it 's Obama versus [ John ] McCain , I 'll vote for Ralph Nader . "
Over five billion songs have been purchased and downloaded from iTunes Store , making it the number one music retailer in the U.S.
Apple also announced that that its customers are now renting and buying over 50,000 movies every day .
I , for one , rented a movie the other night .
iTunes now carries a music catalog of eight million songs and movies movies from all of the major movie studios including 20th Century Fox , The Walt Disney Studios , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Universal Studios Home Entertainment , Sony Pictures Entertainment , Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer ( MGM ) , Lionsgate and New Line Cinema .
The iTunes Store is the world ’s most popular online music , TV and movie store with a catalog of over eight million songs , over 20,000 TV episodes and over 2,000 films .
Unfortunately , I did not read the fine print that movies rented on the iTunes Store will play only on the current - generation iPod classic , iPod nano , and iPod touch .
The Times of India has accused Chinese hackers , allegedly backed by the Chinese government , of systematically attacking Indian online assets over the past 18 months .
The goal of these assaults , at least according to the paper , is to map and discover weak points within India 's IT infrastructure .
Such information could give China an advantage in any potential conflict , and the article implies that India has been slow to develop a retalitory system in the event of a Chinese attack .
The degree to which the Chinese government is actually involved in these attacks is still an open question , The Times ' rhetoric notwithstanding .
A continuing series of sophisticated and methodical assaults is no longer proof of another nation 's malevolent intent , even if such attacks appear to be originating in the country in question .
The same market forces responsible for the commercialization of the malware industry across the globe promote sophisticated attack vectors and a methodical approach to security probes .
So the hackers behind the intrusion attempts that Indian IT workers are detecting are essentially cyber - casing the country 's digital joint , and while they may be working for the Chinese government they could also just be out to make a buck .
The problem with accusing other countries of attacking one 's own cybersecurity systems is that , at least to date , such accusations have n't proven particularly accurate .
As we covered in January , a series of cyber attacks that the Estonian government initially blamed on the Russian government actually turned out to be the work of a disgruntled student hacker .
The incident did no permanent damage to Russian - Estonian relations , but it did cause a temporary diplomatic cooling between the two countries over a set of allegations that the Russians vehemently — and apparently truthfully — denied .
Sino - Indian relations are probably better , on the whole , than Estonian - Russian relations , but the two burgeoning powers have had their share of conflicts , including a brief war in 1962 .
Since the 1980s , however , the relationship between China and India has generally grown stronger .
China recognized Indian sovereignty over the disputed state of Sikkim in 2003 , and the two country 's jointly reopened the Nathula Pass in 2006 , which had been closed since the aforementioned Sino - Indian War of 1962 .
India 's relatively friendly relationship with China may have grown a bit more tense of late thanks to the recent Chinese crackdown in Tibet .
India is home to the largest group of Tibetan refugees in the world , including the Dalai Lama 's government - in - exile .
The cybersecurity attacks India detected are n't directly related to the Tibetan riots — evidence indicates that they 've been occurring for at least a year — but the government 's decision to release such information at a time when China is under enormous scrutiny is hardly accidental .
The Times notes that " cyber warfare is yet to become a big component of India ’s security doctrine . "
Even in the US the military 's role in cybersecurity is still in its relative infancy ; India is but one of many countries in the process of evaluating how cybersecurity ( and cyber warfare ) impact its safety .

Now is the time when the US media starts to lie Now is the time in the US primary cycle when the US media starts to lie .
It happens every time - just when it 's becoming clear who 's going to get the nomination , the media completely manufactures the story of a competitive race , because it sells newspapers .
The truth is , it 's basically over .
The chances of Clinton winning the Democratic nomination have become remote .
Now that that 's the case , I feel it 's time to talk about how completely surreal her campaign has been .
The Clinton campaign rested on three core talking points .
First , that she was the inevitable candidate , which now looks so ridiculous as to not be worth debunking ( and should have at the beginning , to ) .
The second talking point was that Clinton has the most experience .
This is an example of ' the big lie ' - if you make a claim which has no basis in reality whatsoever , it 's more likely than a claim which closely resembles reality but is slightly wrong .
The Clinton everybody knows the only reason Hillary has any national presence is because she 's married to Bill , and he used to be the president .
Any claims to the contrary should rightfully be greeting with raised eyebrows .
Clinton 's third talking point was that she was the most ' electable ' candidate .
While it 's true that she 's widely liked , she 's also widely disliked , with a large section of the population already being familiar with and hating her .
She also has a tendency to do flagrant political maneuverings with no apparent awareness that people might see through them .
For example , all the candidates agreed to basically cancel the Michigan primaries , including her , and everybody else removed their names from the ballot , except her , and then after the primaries were held she
Politics is politics I understand , but for the central themes of a presidential campaign to be claims which are obviously untrue to the general population is just plain bizarre .

The Clinton senate biography page does n't even mention any past history before being in the senate , and as first lady her main real involvement was in the Clinton health care plan , which was a disaster .
The way she 's run her campaign is n't a so great either .
Basically , there 's no record of experience , not even a made up one .
Specific debunking aside , knows the only reason Hillary has any national presence is because she 's married to Bill , and he used to be the president .

She also outright lied about doing ' dangerous ' diplomatic work .
Add to those and similar incidents questions as to where exactly all the of the Clintons 's money has come from since Bill left the white house , and it's very clear that Hillary is n't exactly a compelling candidate .
The polls ( which , granted , have to be taken with a grain of salt ) have backed that up as well - early polls indicated she would win the general election against leading republicans by the most narrow margin of any leading Democratic candidate , and polls now indicate the same thing .

jonathankorman Senator Clinton is not my favoured candidate , but in fairness to her I think her claim of experience is not so bogus as you suggest .
Yes , she has made some unreasonable and politically maladroit claims about depth of her foreign policy experience , but she was n't just married to Bill Clinton , she was undeniably a top- ranking Presidential advisor , integral to the administration and deeply engaged in policy and process .
In that respect , no other primary candidate in either party could claim comparable Executive experience .
I believe there is unique and significant value in being part of a working White House .

The truth is , it 's basically over .
The chances of Clinton winning the Democratic nomination have become remote .
The primary / caucus system is obtuse enough that I do n't know that this is truly the case , given a 130 - ish spread today , and 400 - ish to go for Obama .
Looking at CNN 's delegate tools , most scenarios going forward involve the decision being made by the superdelegates .
Do you figure that there will be a moral obligation felt to vote with the popular vote ?
I agree that the biggest risk with Clinton is that she is so intensely disliked by Republicans that she would GOTV for them .

There several categories of lies and misinformation propagated by various groups -- and some of us see right through it .
The scary thing is that Hillary knows this but understands we represent perhaps 1 / 2 of 1 % of the voters -- the rest are like sheep -- they either are n't resourceful or intelligent enough to read up on what 's going on ( did you see Susan Jacoby and Steven Colbert 's little gig where we learn 50 % of Americans do n't even know that Genesis is the first book of the Bible or that they can't find Iraq on a globe where all the countrys ' names are clearly labeled or that 50 % of Americans did not read a single book last year ) .
So , you should understand that she does n't care about these lies being exposed by and to 1 / 2 of 1 % of the public .
I think what is more relevant here is how unbright and uneducated the masses are , rather than the lies .
Even the highly educated or very bright person has blind spots whose darkness is directly proportional to the ability of that person to detect lies in areas they are not as knowledgeable in .
Overcoming this requires much experience and being very well learned .
A good example is Reverend Jeremy Wright .
While it 's true that the " G.D. America " quote was very inappropriate in terms of insulting so many people , and while it is true that much of what he said was done by using sound bites where context of the entire sermon was not provided , the real question noone will ask and J.
Wright will not answer until * after *
Barack becomes ( assuming he does )
President is this : * what was he really thinking ?*.
What was Underground Weatherman William Ayers really thinking in the 1960s and what is he thinking in the last 20 years with his highly criticized social - based education system ?
It 's highly - criticized because it deserves to be as it is a non-establishment way of making change happen -- but at the expense of setting so many people back who can make a difference by becoming educated in the traditional establishment way being able to open their eyes to the much - needed activism such as that needed to reverse the historically unparalleled wealth divide ( as measured by the Gini coefficient ) in the USA .
Why are n't some of us bright enough to understand this very nuanced way of thinking ?
More in the future .
Another good example is how the media treats Hugo Chavez of Venezuela -- of course , if I were famous and this email were quoted , the first reaction would be that I am a communist or socialist or I am pro-Iran or pro-Fidel - Castro -- all of which could n't be further from the truth .
But I do know that what Chavez is really like and what is * really * going on is too nuanced for even the brightest and Internet - savvy folks out there .
I see it all the time by randomly asking people what they think of him and getting the Pat Robertson response that he is a nut - job .
Ironically , when I ask them about Pat Robertson , they are not aware how ruthless he is in the financial / globalist world ... just more mind control -- people focus on his rather bizarre statements which is exactly what he wants you to do -- anything to take away the focus of his past and present financial dealings .
See ya !
They wanted their crops to be organic , a commitment they shared with many other farmers in this grimy landscape .
They planted some marigolds to deter squirrels ; they have not had rat problems , which can plague urban gardens ; and they abandoned crops , like corn , that could attract rodents .
They put up fences to thwart other pests  thieves and vandals  and posted signs to let people know that this was a garden and no longer a dump .
There were also benefits to farming in the city .
The Wilkses took advantage of city composting programs , trucking home decomposed leaves from the Starrett City development in Brooklyn and ZooDoo from the Bronx Zoo ’s manure composting program .
They got free seedlings from GreenThumb and took courses on growing and selling food from the City Farms project at the local nonprofit Just Food .
“ The city really has been good to us , ” Mrs . Wilks said .
“ All of the property we work on , it ’s city property . ”
Image Karen Washington , in the Garden of Happiness in the Bronx , always wanted to farm .
Credit ... G. Paul Burnett / The New York Times
The Wilkses now cultivate plots at four sites in East New York , paying as little as $ 2 a bed ( usually 4 feet by 8 feet ) in addition to modest membership fees .
Last year the couple sold $ 3,116 in produce at a market run by the community group East New York Farms , more than any of their neighbors .
Florence Russell is looking forward to this year ’s offerings .
On a recent Saturday she watched from the end of Alabama Avenue as gardeners worked compost into beds at Hands and Hearts Garden , one of the sites where the Wilkses keep beds , along with 24 other growers .
Fresh greens , she said , would be a welcome alternative to tough collards from the local grocery .
“ This is something good happening here , ” Ms. Russell said .
The city ’s cultivators are a varied lot .
The high school students at the Added Value community farm in Red Hook , Brooklyn , last year supplied Italian arugula , Asian greens and heirloom tomatoes to three restaurants , a community - supported agriculture buying club and two farmers ’ markets .
All the acrimony in the primary race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has disguised the fact that on most issues they ’re not too far apart .
That ’s especially the case when it comes to free trade , which both Obama and Clinton have lambasted over the past few months .
At times , the campaign has looked like a contest over who hates free trade more : Obama has argued that free - trade agreements like NAFTA are bought and paid for by special interests , while Clinton has emphasized the need to “ stand up ” to countries like China .
Two weeks ago , both senators signed on as sponsors of a new bill that would effectively impose higher tariffs on China if it does n’t revalue its currency .
The candidates are trying to win the favor of unions and blue - collar voters in states like Ohio and West Virginia , of course , but their positions also reflect a widespread belief that free trade with developing countries , and with China in particular , is a kind of scam perpetrated by the wealthy , who reap the benefits while ordinary Americans bear the cost .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
It ’s an understandable view : how , after all , can it be a good thing for American workers to have to compete with people who get paid seventy cents an hour ?
As it happens , the negative effect of trade on American wages is n’t that easy to document .
The economist Paul Krugman , for instance , believes that the effect is significant , though in a recent academic paper he concluded that it was impossible to quantify .
But it ’s safe to say that the main burden of trade - related job losses and wage declines has fallen on middle - and lower - income Americans .
So standing up to China seems like a logical way to help ordinary Americans do better .
But there ’s a problem with this approach : the very people who suffer most from free trade are often , paradoxically , among its biggest beneficiaries .
The reason for this is simple : free trade with poorer countries has a huge positive impact on the buying power of middle - and lower - income consumers — a much bigger impact than it does on the buying power of wealthier consumers .
The less you make , the bigger the percentage of your spending that goes to manufactured goods — clothes , shoes , and the like — whose prices are often directly affected by free trade .
The wealthier you are , the more you tend to spend on services — education , leisure , and so on — that are less subject to competition from abroad .
In a recent paper on the effect of trade with China , the University of Chicago economists Christian Broda and John Romalis estimate that poor Americans devote around forty per cent more of their spending to “ non-durable goods ” than rich Americans do .
That means that lower - income Americans get a much bigger benefit from the lower prices that trade with China has brought .
Then , too , the specific products that middle - and lower - income Americans buy are much more likely to originate in places like China than the products that wealthier Americans buy .
Despite a huge increase in imports from China — they sextupled as a percentage of U.S. imports between 1990 and 2006 — Chinese products are still concentrated mostly in lower - price markets .
( By some estimates , Wal - Mart alone has accounted for nearly a tenth of all imports from China in recent years . )
By contrast , much of what wealthier Americans buy is made in the U.S. or in high - wage countries like Germany and Switzerland .
This is obvious when it comes to luxury goods — Louis Vuitton bags , Patek Philippe watches , and so on — but it ’s also true of many other goods , like electronics , kitchen appliances , and furniture , categories in which American and European manufacturers have continued to thrive by selling to the high - end market .
According to the Yale economist Peter K. Schott , machinery and electronics products made in developed countries sell in the U.S. for four times the average price of Chinese products .
And , since the late nineteen - eighties , that price gap has widened by almost forty per cent .
This may not always be the case ; as China ’s economy continues to boom , its companies will likely move up the quality ladder and , eventually , become serious competition for high - end American and European manufacturers .
But for the moment the benefits of free trade with China , at least when it comes to shopping , are concentrated overwhelmingly among average Americans .
And the result is that , in the past decade , the products that they spend more on have become a lot cheaper compared to the stuff that rich people spend more on .
Broda and Romalis , in their recent paper , calculate that between 1999 and 2005 alone the inflation rate for lower - income Americans was almost seven points lower than it was for the wealthiest Americans .
That means that free trade with China has made average Americans , at least as consumers , much better off — in the sense that it ’s made their dollars go further than they otherwise would have .
Now , there ’s a lot that ’s left out of this equation , such as the fact that free trade may help richer Americans by increasing corporate profits .
And cheap DVD players may not , on balance , make up for lost jobs .
But the reality is that if we toughen our trade relations with China the benefits will be enjoyed by a few , since only a small percentage of Americans now work for companies that compete directly with Chinese manufacturers , while average Americans will feel the pain — in the form of higher prices — far more quickly and more directly than rich Americans will .
Obama and Clinton , in their desire to help working Americans — and gain their votes — are pushing for policies that will also hurt them . ♦
( Here is a note in a bottle , thrown out onto the ocean , from someone inside the conspiracy .
I hope it is found . )
So , if the Ron Paul Movement has struck a chord , then why did he not do better in the race for the GOP nomination ?
1. ) Well , because it is a movement that has just started and it takes some a little bit longer to catch on than others .
2. ) Because some already had a favorite going into the debates and were not listening to any of the others anyway .
3. ) Because most did n’t watch the debates at all .
4. ) And finally , ah hem , because there is an establishment conspiracy to keep Ron Paul ’s campaign from embarrassing the Republican Party .
Oh yeah , I know , conspiracy theories are not allowed and conspiracies do not actually exist .
Although , if that were true the word itself would not exist and you would not know what I am talking about .
In fact we all conspire and have conspired since the first grade and some of the conspiracies become known , like the tobacco industry fudging its figures on cancer or the recent expose of the KGB planting false scientific information in the west about a so called “ nuclear winter . ”
No , I am not suggesting that a bunch of 80 year old Knights of Malta met at a secret location in Manhattan and voted to bring down Ron Paul to fulfill some 1500 year old promise to a French King .
Or even that the Masons did it .
Or even that the GOP drafted a secret memo .
What I am saying is that he has been the subject of numerous meetings of GOP establishment figures and they have exchanged ideas and techniques for keeping him and his minions at bay .
I know because I was accidentally and spontaneously in the middle of just such a conversation .
Last week I appeared on a number of television programs and ended up in “ the green room ” with a couple of GOP luminaries .
One of the party ’s most famous and powerful Senators and a former governor who came within a hair of becoming the vice president .
You can guess which television network it was .
We each had a book to promote .
Anyway , somehow they got into a discussion of Ron Paul and how his supporters had the nerve , the gall , the cheek to show up at “ their ” respective Republican State Conventions and practically take over .
Each man described to the other how through parliamentary maneuver and outright theft they had recently blocked the Paulistas from embarrassing the GOP by winning “ their ” delegates to the national convention .
They passed these stories back and forth with great gusto and laughter and genuine appreciation for the political skill of the other .
“ Well , ” I interrupted , “ Why was all that necessary in the first place ?
Who are these people ?
Why are their ideas so popular ?
And why block them ?
Should n’t the party welcome such activists into the process ?
Is the party so insecure that it has to cheat to protect itself ?
And what will the people who got cheated think about the GOP ?
Is this a lost opportunity ?
Maybe the GOP got cheated ? ”
You would have thought I was questioning the Virgin Birth .
They turned on “ the green room idiot ” and patronizingly explained to me how the nomination belonged to McCain now and good soldiers had to rally around the standard bearer .
“ Yes , yes , ” I said , “ But anyone active enough to show up at a State Convention knows that too .
So what is driving their activism ?
If they ca n’t win , why are they still fighting ?
Could they be true believers ? ”
There was an embarrassing silence in the green room .
“ Well , ” cough , cough , the Senator ventured kindly , “ They have tapped into a strain of libertarianism that has been underrepresented in recent years . ”
And then the two giants , men I both admire , ignored me , “ the green room idiot , ” and turned to each other to exchange hilarious Ron Paul stories about how he had wandered off the range voting his own way time and again , seemingly oblivious to the inherent needs of the Party .
It ’s called voting your conscience or even voting on principle instead of “ Party . ”
It is a quaint constitutional notion , quite old fashioned .
There is no question that Ron Paul is seen by the GOP as “ the crazy uncle in the attic . ”
But now that he has escaped and is out and about and is talking publicly almost anyone who hears him thinks that he is right and the rest of the GOP are the crazy ones , or at least the wrong ones .
I had one more question for my distinguished friends .
“ If Ron Paul is such a fringe figure and we are the mainstream of Republican political thought , then why is his book on the New York Times bestseller list , and ours not ? ”
Hmmm , now that was a thought for the conspirators to take home .
Ca n’t the GOP get into those bookstores and stop the sales ?
Or maybe rewrite the rules about who gets on the list and who does n’t ?
Or is this bestseller business only a Liberal Democrat - New York Times conspiracy devised to embarrass the Republican Party ?
Or maybe Victor Hugo is right about the force of an “ idea whose time is come . ”

The New Hampshire Recount
Here is more evidence of the astroturfing attacks on BradBlog .
Posted by : SocraticGadfly on January 23 , 2008 Somebody alert Brad Friedman at the Brad Blog to get off his conspiracy horse .
Maybe it's a coincidence the poster 's name is so similar to mine .
I guess some folks like to catapult the propaganda .
Olbermann had some good reports on how astroturfers { Bush et al} like to repeat things over and over again .
The Bivings Group is another one that thinks rumors can go viral .

Here 's the Plan :
1 ) McCain has already won ; the day to day operation of the conspiracy to destroy American democracy from within now consists solely of making that predetermined result believable to enough Americans that they get away with it .
2 ) The main techniques they are using are a ) stealing primaries for Hillary to keep her in the " race " , b) Keeping their presstitutes in the corporate whore media blabbering non-stop about manufactured controversies having nothing to do with how Obama would act as President , and c ) treating loony - tunes Grandpa with kid -gloves so he appears as though OTHERS might accept him as president .
3 ) The scam is not focussing on getting Americans to vote for Grandpa , per se , rather it is to make it seem like OTHERS voted for him .
Remember this point , it is crucial .
Just like very few were swayed with the beyond - absurd lying / ranting of the Swift Boat Liars for bush , very few will be swayed by the corporate media lying about Obama and shilling for McSame .
That is not the goal .
Rather the goal is to get Americans to believe that OTHERS are stupid enough to fall for the lies / spin .
Remember the British magazine cover headline after the 2004 " election " that read " How can 51,000,000 people be so stupid ? "
( Answer : they were n't .
the " election " was stolen with the electronic vote - stealing machines . )
That is what is going on here .
On the day after the " election " look for the media whores to be wailing about how " racist , " " stupid , " and " frightened of bogey men " the Americans " voters " were on " election " day , which caused them to vote for a loon rather than a statesman .
It worked last time ; it will work again .
True , they may have to buy out the integrity of more polling companies to pull off the charade this time , but they have lots of our ( tax ) money to do just that .
Face it : these vermin can NOT allow themselves to be voted out , since the chances of being arrested and convicted on myriad crimes is near 100 % once they are not in control of the executive branch ( " Justice " Dept ) .
Beware 911 # 2 if it looks like the election theft operation wo n't fly .

Patriot is correct .
The game is to make it appear that this is an evenly divided country .
So the last eight years , astroturfers have been screaming all over the internet how evil Bush and Cheney are .
That has kept people in the realm of emotions , rather than hard facts .
Our problems are institutional .
The astroturfers are going with the viral meme that McCain is not part and parcel of Shrub and Company .
Or they go with the but , but , but Clinton Democrappers are no better .
So yes , it appears that this Hillary / Obama fighting has been completely scripted with the aim of bringing the illusion that McCain can compete with Obama .
With all due respect to Godwin's Law , people who think Hitler was the primary cause of Nazi power should take a look at Wilhem Reich 's The Mass Psychology of Fascism .
He eloquently argued that it was the psychology of the masses which form the bedrock for totalitarianism .
I think that is close to an exact quote .
So then you have folks like Hertzberg , Lindeman , Kos Zuniga calling the majority of people conspiracy theorists on hobby horses , and then they run with some lame election integrity movement which calls for paper trails off the machines .
To the bunch of us who keep speaking out , the message is , sure , you figured it out , but no one is listening , no one cares .
But for them to do that , they are stuck with using PR firms , special interests , and useful idiots to keep repeating :
Nothing to see here , move along .

Brad -
If Indiana 's population is 6.5 million , is n't 4.3 million voters ( 66 % ) more likely than 5.4 million ( 83 % ) ?
Does anyone know the average percent registered voters to the population ?
If there are a large number of college students , would n't that contribute to a large number of changes ?
This does seem like a large number of voter registrations removed , but perhaps it is really within standard norms .
Need more data to evaluate .
I would think the larger problem would be the new voter id requirement .

Question , was this a state purge or a private ( choicepoint type ) purge ?
COMMENT # 7 [ Permalink ]
... Bev Harris said on 5/5/2008 @ 4:39 pm PT ...
Update : According to Steve Rosenfeld , the Chief of Staff for the Indiana Secretary of State has told him that the number of registrations " cancelled " does not mean they were cancelled , it means they were changed .
Well that 's a relief , because I 've been digging further through all kinds of arcane reports going back several years , and the number cancelled in Porter County cannot possibly be justified under any scenario using the listed number of duplicates , moved , died , disappeared etc .
Therefore Porter County just had 115 % of the registrations on its list CHANGED .
Possibilities : 100 % of the registrations were changed in some way , some more than once ; or , some of the registrations were left along but most were changed more than once ; or , most were left alone but some were changed over and over .
Feel better now ?
By the way , I was not too bothered by the rabies attacks on Kos , and the dithering about Indiana having only 6 million people .
The EAC reports as of 2004 indicated there were 4.7 million people of age to vote , and had a very high percentage of them voting , with some counties having more than 100 % of their eligible voters vote .
I think it 's pretty clear that Indiana did n't then have , and quite possibly still does n't have , accurate voter rolls .
Now let me share with you a scenario that 's been bothering me about these voter ID scenarios , and as we all know , Indiana is requiring government - issued voter IDs with a match ( but not requiring an " exact " match ) on the name and a match on the address .
So I 'm in a position to " cancel " or " change " a whole bunch of records .
I know that those IDs now have to match name and address .
Ya know what ?
I do n't NEED to purge .
All I have to do is introduce typos .
I 'm going to change Brad Friedman 's name to Brad Freeman .
People will think it is human error .
And if his county uses electronic pollbooks , they wo n't be able to find his name when they key in " Friedman " .
To make sure he can't vote anything but provisional , I 'll juxtapose a couple numbers on his address .
Suppose he lives at 5917 Oak Drive .
I 'll make that 9517 Oak. Human error .
Human error .
Human error .
And if Brad Friedman votes provisional will the canvassing board accept Brad Freeman at a slightly different address ?
Probably not , if they do n't feel like it .
And if Brad Freeman is the typo introduced while changing the record , Brad FRIEDMAN can be 100 percent certain that his vote wo n't figure into the network projections .
Not to worry .
They say they were only changing the registrations , not purging them ...

Or maybe Brad Freeman suddenly out of nowhere votes for McCain ?
Or the electronic pollbook shows that he has already voted ... Whose to know if he did n't show up to vote ?

DU Post From A Bash Bev Thread ... I take it you have also asked for --- no , make that demanded --- financial statements ahead of schedule , from VerifiedVoting.org --- with over 200,000 members , they raised far more than Black Box Voting .
And you regularly ask for DU 's financials , right ?
Or is it that you do n't hold anyone else to the same standard ?...
It 's obvious what 's going on .
People slander Bev Harris and BradBlog all the time and are protected for no clear reason by the management of Daily {CIA}Kos and the { Un}Democratic Underground .
DU and DKos have been besieged for years by astroturfers .
All sorts of slander and attacks are made with no proof .
The election integrity movement has been taken over by advocates of electronic voting posing as activists .
How come Verified Voting Foundation is n't coming under fire ?
It could n't be more obvious that they are the gatekeepers , not Brad or Bev .
I think Diebold and others deep down are supporting groups like the Verified Voting Foundation .
The goal of the astroturfers is to trumpet out some kind of paper trail for electronic machines .
The vendors would keep their contracts , while the limited hangout of noise would carry on with their froths about grifters and tinfoilers .
There 's yet another new thread at DU making claims about Ms. Harris with no proof .

From then on John McCain liked George Bush .
He never really had before .
Only prob . with the happy ending .
The next eight years were tough on John .

At worst , Bev is misguided but sincere advocate not deserving of such attacks .
But I suspect the hyper - vigilant attacks to muddy any argument , any question she brings to daylight proves she is on to something .
But I dont thing she is misguided , I am sure she is a well - guided , sincere , and of most value of all , persistant advocate .
As ancient wisdom of I - Ching says , Persistant Furthers .
Perhaps in Bevs case we can say Great Persistant , Greatly Furthers .
For all us folks that are just observers and the chattering class , Brad and Bev work , work , work .
Seldom have I seen a guestion raised by Bev prove a fruitless line of inquiry .
But even if so , what in the world could a sincere person quibble with a watchdog , watching , standing alert .
Sure , watchdogs might bark at a friendly visitor occasionally , but if they are not hyper - alert , always looking out for your safety , what kind of watch dog would they be ?
What kind of nuts reject a watchdog as discredited and worthless because of a false alarm occasionally , at the worst .
I say the kind of nut that criticizes and disses the watch dog is not sincere about the safety of the people the watchdog is guarding .
But compare track records of the watchdogs compared to their critics .
I do n't think they have sounded false alarms .
Everything Bev and Brad claim and have questioned gets reinforced with time , not disproven with time .
Those that predict right should be relied on more in the future , not questioned more .
All the electronic voting concerns have expotentially expanded with more research , more experience .
All the science such as exit polls , stats , computer science profs , etc confirm what these " lay " advocates foresaw .
Poll - tapes in garbage in Florida in response to a public records request , 16,000 votes dissappear on electronic machines that are " certified " , Ohio election staff convicted of rigging a recount ... come on , the watchdogs saw danger when it was coming and we are arguing about whether the dog barks too much .
We are too much .
Brad and Bev are hard working heros , taking time to do the tedious , hard work of documenting the travestry of our election systems , only to get dissed and attacked over and over again by supposed liberal and pro-democratic rights blogs and communities .
Brad and Bev are nuts ; not conspriracy nuts , but nuts to keep working against such odds .

A hopefully - useful Kos-Armstrong timeline December 2002 : Dean Campaign Manager Joe Trippi invites Jerome Armstrong , creator of MyDD.com , to Burlington , Vermont to assist the Dean campaign .
( Armstrong 's account ) January 2003 : Jerome Armstrong and Markos Moulitsas , creator of Daily Kos , form Armstrong Zuniga , a political consulting firm .
June 2003 : Trippi hires Moulitsas , and Armstrong , for consulting at a rate of $ 3,000 a month for four months .
Armstrong describes his duties as “ coordinat[ing ] and direct[ing ] the expenditures of all internet advertising for the campaign . ” ... January 2005 : A Dean staffer , Zephyr Teachout , claimed the two were hired “ largely in order to ensure that they said positive things about Dean . ”
Kos and Armstrong vehemently deny any wrongdoing .
Dean campaign manager Joe Trippi and Dean 's Director of Internet Communications , Mathew Gross , dispute Teachout ’s version of events .
Kos enthusiastically backs Dean 's bid for chair of the Democratic National Committee ....
April 2005 : Democratic Congressman and potential Senate candidate Sherrod Brown hires Jerome Armstrong ’s Political Technologies LLC firm for " Website Design & Hosting " .
They pay $ 12,000 on 4/21/05 , $ 12,000 on 6/16/05 , and then $ 5,000 as a recurring monthly fee ....
But that same day , Brown contractor Jerome Armstrong makes clear he prefers the Democratic candidate who , um , hired him .
Armstrong writes :
.... People should check out that whole article .
In short , Kos is a political pimp who mysteriously rose to the top of the blogosphere despite being a below average writer .
http://www.sourcewatch.o...os_Moulitsas_Z%C3%BAniga
He is a fellow at the New Politics Institute begun by Simon Rosenberg and Andy and Deborah Rappaport ....
Zúniga " served in the U.S. Army and was involved in the technology community in San Francisco before founding Daily Kos on May 26 , 2002 ( rhymes with ' prose ' ) and becoming a leader in the modern progressive movement and blogger community .
He maintains the site from Berkeley , California .
In its first year , Daily Kos attracted over 1.6 million unique visits and about 3 million page views .
Currently , it receives about 12 million unique visits per month and is the most highly trafficked political website in the country . "

The technology community in San Francisco ?
That would have included Steven Hertzberg , correct ?
Oh , would it surprise anyone that Robert Hertzberg made a donation to Joe Lieberman ?
It 's true .
Do people realise that Robert Hertzberg as a California assemblyman sponsored one of the first election technology funding bills after the 2000 election was stolen ?
It 's true .
I could write page after page of prose on everything I 've absorbed .
Sometimes it gets me into trouble .

Reply to DBran # 4 . Your argument is right on the money .
Indiana has a population of 6.3 million with 5.4 million register voters .
The problem is , of the 6.3 million , only 4.73 million are of voting age ( 2006 census records show 25 % are under age 18 ) .
The national average for those who will register to vote was 72 % in 2004 .
That means that Indiana 's voting rolls should be much closer to 3.4 million , not 5.4 million .
With current registrations at 4.9 million , Indiana 's voter rolls are no where near accurate .
Fair elections include accurate voter rolls .

From the article , " That 's a different concern , but still very much a concern .
At least , in Indiana ( I think ) , it does no good to go in and alter a Democrat registration to make it Republican , because Republicans can vote in the Democratic primary .
I 'm not sure it goes the other way though . "
Since Indiana does not register voters by party , how would someone " alter a Democrat registration to make it Republican " ?
Indiana is an open primary state .
A voter can asked for a primary ballot for either party .
" Think about this :
You do n't have to purge if you can just go in and alter a bunch of spellings , or addresses . "
This argument is not based in fact .
Indiana 's ID law does not require correct address on the ID .
The Indiana SoS website says the id must have a photo , be current , have the voter 's name , and be issued by Indiana or the Federal Government .
No where does it state that it must have the correct address .

An ID can hardly " be current " if it does not have the correct address on it Mark , and if anyone can ask for the ballot from any party , do you mean to imply that all that caterwauling about Democrats registering aliens and / or dead people is really Republicans requesting Democratic ballots for their perfidy ?

Agent 99 , comment # 35 " An ID can hardly " be current " if it does not have the correct address " .
How does a previous address change the expiration date on an ID card ??
The fact is , it does n't .
I pointed out , the Indiana SoS website does not support the argument that an ID is required to have a current address .
I voted in Indiana today , along with several members of my family .
I can tell you for a fact that the polls accepted a photo ID with a previous address .
They were concerned with the expiration date , not the address on the ID .
Whoever is trying to pass the " current address " is required as fact has not properly educated him / herself on the facts .
They are flat out wrong .
As to " crossover voting " .
Indiana does n't register voters by party .
A voter can ask for either ballot .
Having worked elections , I have seen primaries in the past where voters overwhelming decided to vote in one party 's primary over another's .
I am sure that happened today all over Indiana .

An important discovery has been made with respect to the mystery of " handedness " in biomolecules .
Researchers led by Sandra Pizzarello , a research professor at Arizona State University , found that some of the possible abiotic precursors to the origin of life on Earth have been shown to carry " handedness " in a larger number than previously thought .
Pizzarello , in ASU 's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , worked with Yongsong Huang and Marcelo Alexandre , of Brown University , in studying the organic materials of a special group of meteorites that contain among a variety of compounds , amino acids that have identical counterparts in terrestrial biomolecules .
These meteorites are fragments of asteroids that are about the same age as the solar system ( roughly 4.5 billion years . )
Scientists have long known that most compounds in living things exist in mirror - image forms .
The two forms are like hands ; one is a mirror reflection of the other .
They are different , cannot be superimposed , yet identical in their parts .
When scientists synthesize these molecules in the laboratory , half of a sample turns out to be " left - handed " and the other half " right - handed . "
But amino acids , which are the building blocks of terrestrial proteins , are all " left - handed , " while the sugars of DNA and RNA are " right - handed . "
The mystery as to why this is the case , " parallels in many of its queries those that surround the origin of life , " said Pizzarello .
Years ago Pizzarello and ASU professor emeritus John Cronin analyzed amino acids from the Murchison meteorite ( which landed in Australia in 1969 ) that were unknown on Earth , hence solving the problem of any contamination .
They discovered a preponderance of " left - handed " amino acids over their " right - handed " form .
" The findings of Cronin and Pizzarello are probably the first demonstration that there may be natural processes in the cosmos that generate a preferred amino acid handedness , " Jeffrey Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , La Jolla , Calif . , said at the time .
The new PNAS work* was made possible by the finding in Antarctica of an exceptionally pristine meteorite .
Antarctic ices are good " curators " of meteorites .
After a meteorite falls -- and meteorites have been falling throughout the history of Earth -- it is quickly covered by snow and buried in the ice .
Because these ices are in constant motion , when they come to a mountain , they will flow over the hill and bring meteorites to the surface .
" Thanks to the pristine nature of this meteorite , we were able to demonstrate that other extraterrestrial amino acids carry the left - handed excesses in meteorites and , above all , that these excesses appear to signify that their precursor molecules , the aldehydes , also carried such excesses , " Pizzarello said .
" In other words , a molecular trait that defines life seems to have broader distribution as well as a long cosmic lineage . " "
This study may provide an important clue to the origin of molecular asymmetry , " added Brown associate professor and co-author Huang .
* The work is being published in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The paper is titled , " Molecular asymmetry in extraterrestrial chemistry : Insights from a pristine meteorite , " and is co-authored by Pizzarello , Huang and Alexandre .
You are incorrect .
the WTC collapses had to be controlled demolitions for the three core reasons - 1 ) molten metal witnesses and video evidence 2 ) free fall collapse acceleration ( NOT pancaking ) 3 ) vertical collapse of WTC7 , overwhelmingly damaged on the south side , and hardly damaged on the north side at all .
Moving the goal post .
I responding to you ( or perhaps the other poster in this thread ) who said that progressive collapse of a steal structure was never documented prior to 9/11 .
I showed that as false , and how you responded was irrelevant to the categorical fact that they have occurred in the past .
I 'll address your claims too .
1 ) molten metal witnesses and video evidence .
Correct .
It does seem to be molten metal .
It is not indicative of steel , however , and fits the characteristics of melted aluminum " Visual evidence already discussed shows that significant wreckage from the aircraft passed through the building and came to rest in the northeast corner of the tower on the 81st floor , i.e. , at the location where the molten material apparently originated .
Much of the structure of the Boeing 767 is formed from two aluminum alloys that have been identified as 2024 and 7075 ( NISTSTAR 1 - 3 ) .
The melting points for these alloys vary as the material melts .
The Aluminum Association handbook ( The Aluminum Association 2003 ) lists the melting point ranges for the alloys as roughly 500C to 638C and 475C to 635C for alloys 2024 and 7075 , respectively .
These temperatures are well below those characteristic of fully developed fires ( ca. 1000C ) , and any aluminum present is likely to have been at least partially melted by the intense fires that had been in the area for nearly 48 min . "
( NISTNCSTAR 1 - 5A Chapter 9 Appendix C
p.p. 375-376 ( pdf p.p. 79-89 ) )
Coincidentally , aluminum is an ingredient in thermite .
I highly recommend reading the whole report for yourself in the link below .
2 ) free fall collapse .
Dr. Frank Greening 's paper on this is probably the most thorough investigation into this seemingly baseless claim , however it can be refuted categorically with a few basic facts .
One : in the videos and photos of the collapse one can see columns and other heavy debris far outpacing the collapse of WTC7 .
Two : one can also see dust debris falling at approximately the same speed of the building , which proves it was falling well below freefall speed .
Three : Dr. Greens paper ( which I will link below ) give physical models of WTC7's collapse , and the energy transfer which increased its momentum with each " pancake " , which is not possible if it was falling at freefall speed , and is conclusive proof of a progressive collapse .
So why does this ludicrous claim keep appearing ?
Deceptive video editing , and the memetics behind a useful rhetorical factoid .
From debunking911
" Deceptive videos stop the timer of the fall at 10:09 when only the perimeter column hits the ground and not the building itself .
If you notice , the building just finishes disappearing behind the debris cloud which is still about 40 stories high . "
Every report in existence refutes freefall including the videos themselves .
3 ) vertical collapse of WTC7 , overwhelmingly damaged on the south side , and hardly damaged on the north side at all .
You are beginning to strike me as a person who does n't read the arguments against his claims .
Multiple computer and physics models ( as previously mentioned ) show conclusively the cause of collapse at WTC7 .
Nevertheless , I 'll reiterate some important facts verbatim from the mouths of 9/11 investigators and experts :
( the following is from the PM article .
find the link below )
Videos of the fall of WTC 7 show cracks , or " kinks , " in the building 's facade just before the two penthouses disappeared into the structure , one after the other .
The entire building fell in on itself , with the slumping east side of the structure pulling down the west side in a diagonal collapse .
According to NIST , there was one primary reason for the building 's failure :
In an unusual design , the columns near the visible kinks were carrying exceptionally large loads , roughly 2000 sq. ft. of floor area for each floor .
" What our preliminary analysis has shown is that if you take out just one column on one of the lower floors , " Sunder notes , " it could cause a vertical progression of collapse so that the entire section comes down . "
There are two other possible contributing factors still under investigation :
First , trusses on the fifth and seventh floors were designed to transfer loads from one set of columns to another .
With columns on the south face apparently damaged , high stresses would likely have been communicated to columns on the building 's other faces , thereby exceeding their load - bearing capacities .
Second , a fifth - floor fire burned for up to 7 hours .
" There was no firefighting in WTC 7 , " Sunder says .
Investigators believe the fire was fed by tanks of diesel fuel that many tenants used to run emergency generators .
Most tanks throughout the building were fairly small , but a generator on the fifth floor was connected to a large tank in the basement via a pressurized line .

Earlier today , John Gruber of DaringFireball.net suggested that Me.com might be the name for Apple 's .
Mac rebranding .
There was no real evidence , however , except that Me.com was registered under MarkMonitor 's domain service .
MarkMonitor is a domain management service that Apple ( and many others ) use .
Gruber admited that this was mostly speculative at that time :
This is proof of nothing , of course , since MarkMonitor provides domain name parking for any company that pays for their services .
Me.com currently redirects users to Snappville.com - a social networking community .
Snappville used to be called Me.com but changed names in December 2007 with little fanfare .
MacRumors reader Matthew
Yohe , however , pointed us to Netcraft page which curiously lists Kenneth Eddings ( eddingsk@apple.com ) as the DNS administrator for Me.com .
This email address , however , was nowhere in the ownership ( Whois lookup ) information for Me.com .
As it turns out , Mr. Eddings ' email address is only listed in the SOA Record of the DNS record .
In this case , Markmonitor controls the SOA Record for Me.com .
Eddings is also the official technical contact for many of Apple 's domain names .
So , Apple does appear to own Me.com .
It was likely purchased sometime in December 2007 , and it ( along with MobileMe for iPhone ) could very well be the rebranding for Apple 's .
Mac service .
With Apple 's ongoing product expansion outside the Mac platform , it makes sense that they may need to rebrand their services to something more platform neutral .
In today 's domain market , the purchase of Me.com could run well into the tens of millions of dollars , so it is unlikely Apple would buy it without a specific plan .

Feminism some men may argue , has its downsides - particularly when it means they have to share the housework .
But few would protest against the latest victory for women 's rights .
Ladies in Copenhagen will now be allowed to swim and walk around topless in public pools .

Victory : Ladies in Copenhagen will now be allowed to swim and walk around topless in public pools
The decision is the result of a year - long campaign by a pressure group , the Topless Front , which says women should be treated the same as bare - chested men .
Campaign leader Astrid Vang , 20 , who took her shirt off with others to protest at a leisure centre at Christmas , said : " We women would like to decide by ourselves when our breasts should be sexual and when not .
" In swimming pools they should not and that is why the breasts should not be covered - We will bathe topless just like men . "
The Danish campaign was inspired by a Swedish group called Just Breasts , which was formed after two women were asked to cover up their breasts by a lifeguard at a public pool near Stockholm .
Swedish protesters carried out several full - frontal marches in their country but are still campaigning for bare - chested equality .
One of their leaders , 22 - year - old Ragnhild Karlsson , said : " We want our breasts to be as normal and desexualised as men's , so that we too can pull off our shirts at football matches . "
Activists expect a flurry of similar campaigns - across Europe , including in Britain .
Authorities in Vancouver , Canada - often considered to be a bastion of Victorian values - have allowed topless women in swimming pools and on beaches for several years .
The only protest against the move came from lifeguards who said they had problems knowing what to hold when rescuing swimmers in difficulties .
In Copenhagen yesterday , the city 's Culture and Leisure Committee voted overwhelmingly to allow topless bathing .
Frank Hedegaard , of the Socialist People 's Party , said : " I can not understand what some people find so offensive about women 's breasts .
" This decision is important in order to stop the idea that women 's bodies are only sex objects . "
Bush and McCain : A bitter rivalry
By Gordon Corera Senator John McCain has given his backing to his one - time bitter rival , George W Bush .
Even though there were times when their battle for the Republican presidential nomination got particularly nasty , the two men are trying to put the bitterness of their hard fought primary campaign behind them .
Meeting for the first time since Bush won the party nomination , the two men have engaged in a careful and delicate courtship .
Although both have much to gain from a rapprochement , there are also dangers .
Bush needs McCain and his support in what looks like being a very tight and tough general election campaign against Al Gore , while McCain wants Bush to adopt some of his reform agenda - particularly on the role of money in politics .
He also wants to heal some of the rifts that developed during the primary campaign between himself and the Republican party establishment .
The McCain appeal Bush would dearly love to have McCain as his vice - president , but McCain does not seem interested - he is not the type to play second fiddle and the indications are that he would rather be Secretary of Defence .
And of course , if Bush were to lose , then McCain may well take another shot at the top job in 2004 .
What Bush really wants are the voters who backed McCain .
The key to McCain 's success in the primaries - but also ultimately his weak spot - was his ability to draw support from people who would not normally take part in a Republicans primary election .
A Gallup poll during the primaries showed that McCain was remarkably successful at capturing the moderates , whether independent , Democrat or Republican .
Some 39 % of McCain voters identified themselves as independents while a nearly equal number said they were Democrats ( 38 % ) , and slightly fewer called themselves Republicans ( 22 % ) .
Treading carefully Ultimately these voters were not enough to overcome the more traditional Republicans but the so - called ' McCain voters ' now look like being this year 's key swing group in the campaign .
The campaign also generated a surprising degree of enthusiasm from young people that any candidate would love to have on board .
Since the primaries effectively ended on 7 March , Gore has been trying to claim McCain 's mantle as the ' reformer ' and has talked up the issue of campaign finance reform - Bush will be hoping to end that and use McCain to attack Gore 's credibility .
But while these votes are important , Bush does not want to look like he is chasing McCain and that he could not win without him as this could make him look weak and desperate .
But if he does not put in any effort , as seemed to be happening straight after the primaries , then he risks alienating McCain and his support .
And if McCain gets too close to Bush then he will lose the very aura of independence that makes him so attractive , undermining his credibility and the ability deliver the votes of his independent minded supporters .
It is the beginning of a difficult , but important , courtship .
AUSTIN — Forty women opted Thursday to go to a family violence shelter rather than return to the West Texas ranch where authorities allege children are unsafe because of the polygamist group 's practice of " spiritually marrying " underage girls to older men .
Seven of the women who had been staying with their children in public shelters for the past three weeks returned to the Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado .
The number of women choosing to go to an undisclosed family violence shelter was a turnaround from last week , when six sought shelter and 51 returned to the isolated compound .
" It was entirely up to them , " said Patrick Crimmins , a spokesman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services .
As the women boarded separate buses for their chosen destination , they were given a packet explaining how their children would be cared for in coming weeks .
The state will work with all of the mothers , no matter where they went , to ensure they can visit their children , Crimmins said .
The women who were allowed to stay with their children included 17 who have babies under the age of 1 .
They will be housed at Baptist Children 's Ministries in San Antonio , officials there and at Child Protective Services confirmed .
The mothers and their infants will be kept away from other residents at the facility .
Sixty - three children also left the San Angelo Coliseum on Thursday .
The department again revised its count of children in state custody upward to 462 , saying it believes that 25 females who had said they were adults are instead minors .
About 260 children remain in the coliseum and will go to foster group homes as soon as possible , Crimmins said .
Individual hearings sought
Meanwhile , an appeals court agreed to consider arguments Tuesday from a group of mothers who want the state to present evidence on a child - by - child basis to support allegations of abuse or neglect .
The Austin - based 3rd Court of Appeals said it would review state District Judge Barbara Walther 's decision to keep all children in state custody after hearing generalized evidence about the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
Robert Doggett , a legal aid attorney representing about 48 mothers , said many of the mothers were confined to the coliseum during the two - day hearing , where they were not allowed to consult with attorneys or watch the proceedings .
" Rather than having individualized hearings with actual evidence , " Doggett said , " this was a ... cattle call where everyone was presumed to have been physically harmed or to be at risk of physical harm . "
Doggett said he will ask the appeals court to order individual hearings for the children in the counties where they are placed in foster care .
He also will seek rulings that very young children be kept with their mothers , and that siblings be placed together .
Also Thursday , lawyers for the FLDS and two of its members seized on allegations that probable cause for the warrant to search the ranch may have been based on calls from a Colorado woman with a history of making false abuse reports .
Court records unsealed on Wednesday show that the calls made to a San Angelo domestic violence shelter were made with prepaid mobile phones that had previously been used by Rozita Swinton .
The Colorado Springs woman has been charged with making a false report in Colorado and is on probation there for a similar offense .
Texas authorities have characterized her as a person of interest in connection with their search for a purported 16 - year - old who called the San Angelo hot line to say she had been physically and sexually abused by her much older " spiritual " husband .
The motion alleges that authorities had spoken to the alleged abuser in Arizona by cell phone before they executed an arrest warrant for him .
The man told Schleicher County Sheriff David Doran that he did not know the girl and had not been to Texas in 20 years .
Motion to keep files secret
" Thus , before the search warrant was executed , the officers had been apprised , and even verified , that the only person these officers alleged to be suspected of criminal activity or to pose ' an immediate risk of physical or sexual abuse of a child ' was not located on the premises , or even in the state of Texas , " said the lawsuit filed by San Antonio attorney
The motion seeks to restrict the release of any information from documents and records seized at the YFZ property .
The Schleicher County Sheriff 's Department said Thursday that Doran would not be available for comment .
But in an interview with the Eldorado Success published April 17 , the sheriff said that the abuse report stemming from the hot line calls was " essential " to obtaining the search warrant .
Doran said he also provided information from a confidential informant who was a former member of the FLDS , but that person had never been to the YFZ ranch .
Bid for new trial denied
After executing the search warrant April 3 , officials said they saw what they believed to be underage pregnant girls and began removing children and women from the ranch .
An affidavit for a second , broader search warrant alleged that investigators found evidence that underage girls were " spiritually married " to older men and forced to have sex .
One young mother told investigators that she was 15 when she gave birth to her first child .
Texas law prohibits children under 16 from being married .
CPS investigators said those practices put all girls at risk of sexual abuse and all boys at risk of becoming men who abuse minor girls .
Also Thursday , the head of the FLDS , Warren Jeffs , lost a bid for a new trial .
A Utah judge rejected the request from Jeffs , who was convicted in September in southern Utah for his role in arranging the marriage of a 14 - year - old girl to an older cousin .
He is jailed in Arizona awaiting trial in another case .

Robert Redford and Meryl Streep Hate Tom Cruise
Tom Cruise was recently honored by the American Museum of the Moving Image at a big dinner .
Robert Redford and Meryl Streep did not attend .
Redford directed and co-starred , and Streep co-starred with Cruise in the newly released film " Lions for Lambs . "
According to an insider :
" Meryl and Bob ca n't stand Tom .
In London , Tom kept trying to push himself into interviews .
Bob said ' No . '
Tom would n't listen .
Meryl has done almost nothing for the movie .
She wants nothing to do with him . "
I would love to know more on that story , but I can't say I 'm too surprised .

There is no longer a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Forget the endless arguments about who offered what and who spurned whom and whether the Oslo peace process died when Yasser Arafat walked away from the bargaining table or whether it was Ariel Sharon ’s stroll through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem that did it in .
All that matters are the facts on the ground , of which the most important is that -- after four decades of intensive Jewish settlement in the Palestinian territories it occupied during the 1967 war -- Israel has irreversibly cemented its grip on the land on which a Palestinian state might have been created .
Sixty years after Israel was created and Palestine was destroyed , then , we are back to where we started :
Two populations inhabiting one piece of land .
And if the land cannot be divided , it must be shared .
Equally .
This is a position , I realize , which may take many Americans by surprise .
After years of pursuing a two - state solution , and feeling perhaps that the conflict had nearly been solved , it ’s hard to give up the idea as unworkable .
But unworkable it is .
A report published last summer by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs found that almost 40 % of the West Bank is now taken up by Israeli infrastructure -- roads , settlements , military bases and so on -- largely off - limits to Palestinians .
Israel has methodically broken the remainder of the territory into dozens of enclaves separated from each other and the outside world by zones that it alone controls ( including , at last count , 612 checkpoints and roadblocks ) .
Moreover , according to the report , the Jewish settler population in the occupied territories , already approaching half a million , not only continues to grow but is growing at a rate three times greater than the rate of Israel ’s population increase .
If the current rate continues , the settler population will double to almost 1 million people in just 12 years .
Many are heavily armed and ideologically driven , unlikely to walk away voluntarily from the land they have declared to be their God - given home .
These facts alone render the status of the peace process academic .
At no time since the negotiations began in the early 1990s has Israel significantly suspended the settlement process in the occupied Palestinian territories , in stark violation of international law .
It preceded last November ’s Annapolis summit by announcing the fresh expropriation of Palestinian property in the West Bank ; it followed the summit by announcing the expansion of its Har Homa settlement by an additional 307 housing units ; and it has announced plans for hundreds more in other settlements since then .
The Israelis are not settling the occupied territories because they lack space in Israel itself .
They are settling the land because of a long - standing belief that Jews are entitled to it simply by virtue of being Jewish .
“ The land of Israel belongs to the nation of Israel and only to the nation of Israel , ” declares Moledet , one of the parties in the National Union bloc , which has a significant presence in the Israeli parliament .
Moledet ’s position is not as far removed from that of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as some Israelis claim .
Although Olmert says he believes in theory that Israel should give up those parts of the West Bank and Gaza densely inhabited by Palestinians , he also said in 2006 that “ every hill in Samaria and every valley in Judea is part of our historic homeland ” and that “ we firmly stand by the historic right of the people of Israel to the entire land of Israel . ”
Judea and Samaria :
These ancient biblical terms are still used by Israeli officials to refer to the West Bank .
More than 10 years after the initiation of the Oslo peace process , which was supposed to lead to a two - state solution , maps in Israeli textbooks continued to show not the West Bank but Judea and Samaria -- and not as occupied territories but as integral parts of Israel .
What room is there for the Palestinians in this vision of Jewish entitlement to the land ?
None .
They are regarded , at best , as a demographic “ problem . ”
The idea of Palestinians as a “ problem ” is hardly new .
Israel was created as a Jewish state in 1948 only by the premeditated and forcible removal of as much of the indigenous Palestinian population as possible , in what Palestinians call the Nakba , or catastrophe , which they commemorate this week .
A Jewish state , says Israeli historian Benny Morris , “ would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians .
...
There was no choice but to expel that population . ”
For Morris , this was one of those “ circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing . ”
Thinking of Palestinians as a “ problem ” to be removed predates 1948 .
It was there from the moment the Zionist movement set into motion the project to make a Jewish state in a land that , in 1917 -- when the British empire officially endorsed Zionism -- had an overwhelmingly non-Jewish population .
The only Jewish member of the British government at the time , Edwin Montagu , vehemently opposed the Zionist project as unjust .
Henry King and Charles Crane , dispatched on a fact - finding mission to Palestine by President Wilson , concurred : Such a project would require enormous violence , they warned : “ Decisions , requiring armies to carry out , are sometimes necessary , but they are surely not gratuitously to be taken in the interests of a serious injustice . ”
But they were .
This is a conflict driven from its origins by Zionism ’s exclusive sense of entitlement to the land .
Has there been Palestinian violence as well ?
Yes .
Is it always justified ?
No .
But what would you do if someone told you that there was no room for you on your own land , that your very existence is a “ problem ” ?
No people in history has ever gone away just because another people wanted them to , and the sentiments of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull live on among Palestinians to this day .
The violence will end , and a just peace will come , only when each side realizes that the other is there to stay .
Many Palestinians have accepted this premise , and an increasing number are willing to give up on the idea of an independent Palestinian state and embrace instead the concept of a single democratic , secular and multicultural state , which they would share equally with Israeli Jews .
Most Israelis are not yet reconciled this position .
Some , no doubt , are reluctant to give up on the idea of a “ Jewish state , ” to acknowledge the reality that Israel has never been exclusively Jewish , and that , from the start , the idea of privileging members of one group over all other citizens has been fundamentally undemocratic and unfair .
Yet that is exactly what Israel does .
Even among its citizens , Israeli law grants rights to Jews that it denies to non-Jews .
By no stretch of the imagination is Israel a genuine democracy :
It is an ethno - religiously exclusive state that has tried to defy the multicultural history of the land on which it was founded .
To resolve the conflict with the Palestinians , Israeli Jews will have to relinquish their exclusive privileges and acknowledge the right of return of Palestinians expelled from their homes .
What they would get in return is the ability to live securely and to prosper with -- rather than continuing to battle against -- the Palestinians .
They may not have a choice .
As Olmert himself warned recently , more Palestinians are shifting their struggle from one for an independent state to a South African - style struggle that demands equal rights for all citizens , irrespective of religion , in a single state .
“ That is , of course , ” he noted , “ a much cleaner struggle , a much more popular struggle -- and ultimately a much more powerful one . ”
I could n’t agree more .

ON THE BAGRAM - KABUL HIGHWAY SHORTCUT–I am not an America - basher .
I have immense respect for U.S. troops , for all soldiers doing their government 's military bidding in distant lands .
But one day last week , I wanted to throttle a Yank - in - uniform and I think for a split - second he considered killing me too .
He , however , had a machine gun .
We were on the highway , heavily congested with vehicles heading for Kabul in the late afternoon traffic .
I found myself directly behind an ambulance .
The queue of vehicles , ineffectually blasting their horns , had come to a dead stop .
Afghans got out of their cars to see what was holding things up .
But Afghans , of course , have been repeatedly warned to stay at least 100 metres distant from military convoys , whether they 're moving or stationary .
This one had been stationary for an hour , no explanation given , and tempers were fraying .
Afghans are immensely patient people .
They can squat , as still as marble statues , for hours , just watching the world go by .
But these were Afghan drivers , many with minivans jammed full with women , children , the elderly .
I went forward to have a peek inside the ambulance .
Two men lay there , one with all manner of tubes emerging from chest and arm , clearly in a state of medical emergency .
The other sat cross-legged , stunned but conscious .
The ambulance attendant said they 'd just been in a motorcycle accident .
The more severely injured was in need of immediate hospital attention .
" They wo n't let us pass , " the attendant complained .
" I 'm afraid this man will die . "
Another motorist , at the head of the line , had already tried flagging the soldiers ahead , pointing repeatedly to the ambulance .
" Perhaps they will listen to you , " he suggested , hopefully .
Aw geez .
I know not to approach a military convoy , especially when it 's standing still .
I 've written stories about innocent civilians killed under these very circumstances .
Soldiers , leery of an environment that can explode violently at any moment , have often fired first and asked questions – if even that – later .
And only 24 hours previously , not too distant , in the outskirts of Kabul , a suicide bomber had attacked an American convoy .
The troops were unharmed but three civilians had been killed .
So I understand their wariness .
But no explanation had been given for why we had all come to a standstill in the middle of nowhere , open desert on both sides of the road , or how long we might be there .
I went back to my car and blasted Eminen on the CD - player .
I thought , perhaps stupidly , that would give them a clue that I was , more or less , one of them , not an Afghan to fear .
" You go first , '' the first driver had urged .
" I 'll walk behind you .
We must make them listen . "
Then , hands in the air , dangling my media credentials from my fingers , I forced one foot in front of the other .
Clearly the troops should be able to see I was Western , wearing jeans and a T - shirt , not hiding a weapon or a suicide vest .
Fifty metres away , the air gunner in the rear vehicle lowered his machine gun at me threateningly .
" Do n't shoot ! " I croaked .
" Just let the ambulance pass ! "
The doors opened and two soldiers got out , clearly angry .
" You ! " he hollered , pointing at me .
" Get back where you were . "
Then , stomping up to my Afghan colleague , the senior soldier got right in his face .
" We 've got a problem here , " he spat out .
" And you are creating an even bigger problem .
Now go back to your car or we will have one REALLY REALLY BIG PROBLEM . "
I felt the Afghan 's humiliation and saw red .
" Do n't you f----g talk to him like that .
And do n't you f----g talk to me like that .
This is his country .
Not yours , not mine . "
The second soldier , a younger fellow who looked intensely embarrassed , whispered to me : " I 'm sorry ma'am .
It 's just been a long day . "
And right there , my own rage melted away .
We were just two human beings , in an alien place , trying to communicate , to defuse the situation .
An open - bed truck , part of the convoy and carrying heavy munitions , had snapped its containing straps .
Whole containers of munitions had broken open on the highway .
That 's what they were loading up and trying to secure again , halting the entire convoy .
Somebody could have said so sooner ; could at least have come back to explain the situation to the motorists now idling as far back as the eye could see .
" This is why Afghans have come to hate Americans , " said my driver , who works as an interpreter for ISAF and is a strong advocate of the NATO mission in Afghanistan .
" Afghanistan is not our country any more .
They are our bosses .
They treat us sometimes as if we are trespassing on our own land . "
After more heated discussion , the ambulance at least was allowed to pass the convoy , racing off to the nearest hospital .
Back among the Afghans , someone produced a soccer ball .
Men and boys played to while away the time .
Then , in the distance and moving quickly towards us , we spotted a sand storm , roiling up a sepia miasma as it approached .
Everyone jumped back in their cars but it was suffocating inside .
I wrapped a scarf around my face and took shelter beyond the open door .
The storm , with high buffeting winds , moved on as fast as it had come , but I was still left spitting sand out of my teeth and hacking .
Finally , the convoy was moving .
It was only a minor incident , a modest confrontation between Afghan civilians – and me – and weapons - bristling foreign troops .
But I suspect some more enemies were made on this afternoon , adding incrementally to the hostility that is rapidly replacing the warm welcome that most Afghans had originally given their " liberators . "
The Americans did not have to be so aggressive .
They did not have to treat Afghan men like boys .
No one among this group of drivers and passengers meant them any harm .
But maybe some day , one of them might .
You never know when that line between courtesy and dishonour has been crossed .

FREEPORT , Texas ( Reuters ) - Armed guards , some with machine guns , watch over a patch of earth near the Texas Gulf Coast , a site unremarkable except for a few gray metal wellheads poking up through the surface .
Beneath the ground sits an ocean of crude oil representing more than a third of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- a secured stash designed to pull the U.S. economy through an energy shock as severe as the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s .
“ The primary goal ( of the reserve ) is to make sure what happened in 1973 will never happen again , ” said Peter Zeihan , vice president of analysis for Stratfor Inc , an Austin , Texas , political and economic analysis firm .
A doubling in oil prices since last year which has threatened U.S. economic growth has thrown the 700 million - barrel SPR into the national spotlight once again , with politicians and pundits debating whether to release supply to fight the current energy spike .
Under pressure from lawmakers , U.S. President George W. Bush this month signed a law suspending new buying to expand the reserve until oil prices fall to $ 75 a barrel from current levels around $ 130 a barrel -- a measure designed to keep about 70,000 barrels per day of oil , which would otherwise have gone into the vast salt domes , on the open market .
But the administration has strongly opposed proposals to withdraw crude from the stockpiles , saying the conditions for such a release have not been met .
SUPPLY SHOCK
The United States has been putting crude oil in Gulf Coast salt dome caverns since 1976 , three years after Arab OPEC members declared an embargo against the United States and its allies for support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War .
During the embargo , refiners saw the prices they paid for crude oil double and U.S. drivers were buying gasoline on odd - or even - numbered days based on the last digit of their automobile license plates .
Gasoline prices are now higher in inflation - adjusted terms , having cracked $ 4 a gallon in many parts of the country , but the spike is blamed on rising demand not a shock to supply .
Since it began , the SPR has been tapped during emergencies , such as happened in 2005 when hurricanes Katrina and Rita shut down U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production representing 25 percent of domestic output .
The largest sale was in 1991 , when the administration of President George H.W.
Bush ordered up to 21 million barrels released to assure world oil supplies when a U.S. - led coalition began a war to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait .
The SPR is made up of four sites along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana that take advantage of rare underground salt domes , which provide climate - controlled storage and greatly reduced risk of environmental damage .
The lack of salt domes is one reason why there is no SPR site in the nation ’s largest motor fuel market of California , said David Hackett of Stillwater Associates , a California - based energy consultancy .
“ We do n’t have one on the West Coast because there is no inexpensive place to put it , ” Hackett said .
The Bryan Mound site near Freeport contains 20 caverns , each 2,000 feet high , cut into salt domes .
Above the ground , wellheads poke up through ovals of fine gravel in a round piece of ground about the size of an American football field .
Each wellhead is protected by a yellow concrete barrier .
While those driving by the Bryan Mound site might mistake it for another part of nation ’s energy infrastructure , security is unique .
Visitors must provide names well in advance for security screening .
All those entering pass through metal detectors and all packages are X - rayed .
Experts said the need for the SPR has grown over the years because of increased dependence on imports .
In 1973 , domestic oil production supplied 63 percent of U.S. consumption , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .
But after years of decreasing U.S. output and increases in demand , the United States produces only about a third of the oil it uses .
If the SPR were to release oil to make up for a halt in imports , the Energy Department estimates it would take 55 days to deplete it .

May 31 , 2016
You may have heard reports recently about a security incident involving Myspace .
We would like to make sure you have the facts about what happened , what information was involved and the steps we are taking to protect your information .
What Happened ?
Shortly before the Memorial Day weekend ( late May 2016 ) , we became aware that stolen Myspace user login data was being made available in an online hacker forum .
The data stolen included user login data from a portion of accounts that were created prior to June 11 , 2013 on the old Myspace platform .
We believe the data breach is attributed to Russian Cyberhacker ‘ Peace . ’
This same individual is responsible for other recent criminal attacks such as those on LinkedIn and Tumblr , and has claimed on the paid hacker search engine LeakedSource that the data is from a past breach .
This is an ongoing investigation , and we will share more information as it becomes available .
What Information Was Involved ?
Email addresses , Myspace usernames , and Myspace passwords for the affected Myspace accounts created prior to June 11 , 2013 on the old Myspace platform are at risk .
As you know , Myspace does not collect , use or store any credit card information or user financial information of any kind .
No user financial information was therefore involved in this incident ; the only information exposed was users ’ email address and Myspace username and password .
What We Are Doing
In order to protect our users , we have invalidated all user passwords for the affected accounts created prior to June 11 , 2013 on the old Myspace platform .
These users returning to Myspace will be prompted to authenticate their account and to reset their password by following instructions at https://myspace.com/forgotpassword
Myspace is also using automated tools to attempt to identify and block any suspicious activity that might occur on Myspace accounts .
We have also reported the incident to law enforcement authorities and are cooperating to investigate and pursue this criminal act .
As part of the major site re-launch in the summer of 2013 , Myspace took significant steps to strengthen account security .
The compromised data is related to the period before those measures were implemented .
We are currently utilizing advanced protocols including double salted hashes ( random data that is used as an additional input to a one - way function that " hashes " a password or passphrase ) to store passwords .
Myspace has taken additional security steps in light of the recent report .
What You Can Do
We have several dedicated teams working diligently to ensure that the information our members entrust to Myspace remains secure .
Importantly , if you use passwords that are the same or similar to your Myspace password on other online services , we recommend you set new passwords on those accounts immediately .

California ( TGW ) – BrightSource Energy has announced that it has raised $ 115 million from a group of investors that include Google.org and oil giants Chevron and BP .
In April , Google invested $ 130 million in eSolar .
BrightSource has developed a new solar technology , dubbed distributed power tower , that focuses fields of sun-tracking mirrors called heliostats on a tower containing a water - filled boiler .
The sun ’s rays superheat the water and the resulting steam drives an electricity - generating turbine .

Jewelry Central is a really bad brand name .
So are Party Land , Computer World , Modem Village , House of Socks and Toupee Town .
It ’s a bad brand name because Central or Land or World are meaningless .
They add absolutely no value to your story , they mean nothing and they are interchangeable .
" Here honey , I bought you these cheap earrings at Diamond World ! "
Not only are they bland , but you ca n’t even remember one over the other .
This is the absolute last refuge of a marketer who has absolutely nothing to say and ca n’t even find the guts to stand for what they do .
It ’s just generic .
The second reason this is an exceedingly dangerous strategy is that if you start to succeed a little bit , you suddenly want to protect your lame name .
So you hire a lawyer and start to harass people for using the English language .
So Computer Land sued Business Land ( or maybe it was the other way around ) and lost .
Or consider the angry lawyer at Jewelry Village ( or was it Central , I ca n’t remember ) who sent a letter to Squidoo complaining about an editorial ( not a retail ) page that used the phrase .
There are more than 15,000 matches for this phrase in Google , which means he ’s got a lot of letters to send , and a lot of people to annoy .
For what ?
Even if he manages to make a lot of noise , he ’s just reminding the world how generic the phrase is in the first place .
Can you name one successful brand ( except Pizza Hut and I think they succeeded despite the name ) that managed to pull this off ?
[ Yes , there ’s Central Market and IHOP and Radio Shack … thanks for the submissions .
I ’m going to argue that in each case , the name slowed down something else that was truly powerful … ]
You can do better .
[ other naming posts I ’ve done : here , here and here . ]
The further development of biofuels could make food too costly for millions of poor in the Middle East , and destabilise the region which supplies most of the world ’s oil exports .
The use of food crops for biofuels is one of the key factors driving a dramatic increase in the global price of cereals .
As Stuart Staniford demonstrated here in the past few weeks , this trend is set to intensify .
This article will look at the potential implications of rising wheat prices for countries in the Middle East , taking Egypt and Morocco as examples .
Government food subsidies in both countries have so far protected the poor urban population from much of the global hike in cereal prices .
However , as food prices continue to spiral , subsidies will demand a growing share of national budgets .
Subsidies cuts seem inevitable , leading to riots and political instability .
Introduction
Stuart Staniford ’s article Fermenting the Food Supply exposed the dangerously rapid manner in which food crops have been diverted to biofuels in the USA , and the likelihood that this pattern will be copied elsewhere .
Staniford attempted to gauge the impact of price rises on the global poor .
Looking at the elasticity of food expenditure , he suggested a grim possibility of 60 % of the globe ’s population priced out of the food market within the next five years .
In a later article , Death Rates and Food Prices he considered the mitigating effect of subsistence farming , which could support a considerable part of the global poor .
Staniford established convincingly that the impact of biofuels on food crops will be almost immediate – that is , within the next decade or even five years .
However , within such a short time span , assessment based on universal parameters will give a very limited picture .
I believe that a more detailed attention needs to be given to specific regions and countries .
Which ones are most at risk ?
The Middle East is my home region , with which I am familiar personally and professionally .
It is natural for me to be interested in the dangers for the region ’s population .
But furthermore , a food crisis in the Middle East may have far reaching consequences , due to the importance of the region for oil and natural gas exports .
My starting assumption is that countries that import a large percentage of their cereal utilisation will be more exposed to the rising prices .
Where hard currency has to be paid for cereal , the increase in price will be most visible .
By this criterion , the Middle East is especially vulnerable .
As the chart below shows , out of 20 countries that import 10 % or more of their cereals , 7 countries are found in the Middle East : Saudi Arabia , Algeria , Morocco , Egypt , Iran , Iraq and Sudan .

Data for 2006 - 2007 is estimated ; data for 2007 - 2008 is projected .
The data is selective and probably includes only countries with substantial population .
The vulnerability of the region also lies in the fact that wheat - based bread is the main staple .
Without bread there is no life – indeed , in Egypt the same word is used for both ( ‘ aish ) .
The global commodity price of wheat has gone up most drastically , tripling between 2000 and 2007 .
Maize and rice prices have doubled during this time .
Countries in which wheat is the main cereal are likely to be more severely affected .
Outside the rich pockets of wealth in the Gulf , poverty is widespread in the Middle East .
In Egypt , 45 % of the population are estimated to live on US $ 2 per day or less ( 2007 ) .
The population in the region spends on average a third to half of its income on food .
Poor urban households are in a precarious position to begin with , and they will be affected badly by any prices increases .
However , the price of bread is not dictated directly by global cereals prices , because of generous government subsidies .
Before examining the possible implications of the crisis by looking at the specific cases of Egypt and Morocco , a few words on the economics and politics behind food subsidies in the Middle East .
Oil and Food subsidies
Government intervention in the food market is a crucial mitigating factor that has to be taken into account when trying to assess the impact of the current price hike .
In virtually all countries in the Middle East and North Africa , governments offer generous subsidies for food and , in most cases , for fuel .
There is an unwritten pact between governments and peoples in the region that guaranties that the price of bread and fuel remains affordable , and any cut in subsidies is seen as a direct attack on people ’s most basic rights .
The IMF and various other global consulting bodies have persistently preached against subsidies , arguing that they are not an effective means to alleviate poverty .
The argument has merit : the subsidies benefit poor and rich alike ; they encourage corruption and waste .
This is especially true with fuel subsidies , of which the middle classes take full advantage .
The IMF has consistently called for replacing the subsidies with other mechanisms that would support directly the population in need , such as cash transfers .
However , the population in the region has real concerns about such suggestions :
Will cash - grants be sufficient ?
Will they rise with inflation ?
Will they reach everyone in need ?
Will governments be competent enough to administer the scheme ?
The general sentiment is that the answer to all of these is ‘ no ’ ; a recent survey showed that 88 % of Egyptians are opposed to any subsidy reform , fearing that ‘ reform ’ would mean in effect elimination .
The subsidies form a considerable part of all national budgets in the region , but for some countries they are a bigger strain than others , especially as the bill is getting higher .
The rich oil and gas producing countries – Saudi Arabia , UAE , Algeria and others – are able to pay the rising price with high revenues from hydrocarbon exports .
Other countries are in a far more precarious situation : these include not only resource - poor countries like Jordan , Tunisia and Morocco , but also oil producers such as Egypt , Iraq and Iran , which , for various reasons ( resource depletion , internal strife or failing infrastructure ) are fiscally vulnerable .
Egypt , which has a substantial fiscal deficit , is expected to spend 30 % of its budget for 2007 / 08 on subsidies .
Middle Eastern governments have been wary of eliminating food subsidies or replacing them , as it is clear that the issue is politically explosive .
Subsidy cuts lead to riots .
This has been the case in Egypt ( 1977 ) , Sudan ( 1979 ) , Morocco ( 1981 , 1984 , 2007 ) Jordan ( 1989 , 1996 ) , and Tunisia ( 1984 ) .
The riots are perceived as serious challenge for the regimes .
In some cases ( Morocco 1981 ) hundreds of demonstrators were killed .
After clampdown of arrests and emergency measures , governments usually back down from the subsidy cuts .
We have seen this happen in the last bread riots in Morocco ( September 2007 ) .
This scenario will become increasingly unlikely as the subsidy bill becomes much more costly .
As prices of oil and food go up , removing subsidies will become politically impossible , but sustaining them could become economically unviable .
Whatever happens , subsidies are unlikely to be eliminated completely , and global price rises will be mitigated and not hit the population in their full toll .
Famines are therefore not to be expected in the immediate future .
Yet political unrest is unavoidable .
Even if governments succeed in repressing food riots , popular disapproval will remain and the political situation will be much more volatile .
Egypt
Egypt has the biggest population in the region – 77 million people , and a high growth rate .
The country is also one of the biggest wheat importers in the world , importing about 38 % of its cereals in 2006 - 7 .
The price of bread is very low – less than one cent in 2007 , and subsidised bread is available mainly for the urban population , which made 42 % of the total population in 2007 .
In 2007 rising wheat prices cost the Egyptian government an additional US $ 2.5 billion in subsidies .
The government could afford this because of windfall oil and gas revenues , and strong economic growth since 2004 in non-oil sectors .
In 2007 Egypt had a US$ 5 billion trade surplus .
In the recent Davos conference , Egypt was hailed as a success story for liberalisation reforms , and as one of the next emerging economies .
But in 2008 things are set to change .
Egyptian oil production peaked in the mid 1990s .
Oil consumption is growing strongly , due to economic growth .
In 2008 , Egypt is set to become a net importer of oil for the first time .
From a dwindling source of income , oil will become a substantial fiscal burden .
The government would have to import oil and sell it at a subsidised price – which would be a heavy burden , since fuel subsidies already made 20 % of the government budget in 2005 / 6 ( source : IMF ) .
Will the Egyptian government sustain bread prices at their current levels ?
After announcements of possible changes to the subsidy system , the Government recently announced that no major reform will take place .
The current system will continue and will be extended .
But can the government afford it to sustain bread prices at their current levels ?
Natural gas exports will continue to bring hard currency , but subsidies cuts seem inevitable .
In 2007 the price of fuel went up by 30 % .
Further rises are no doubt on the way .

Morocco
Morocco has a large agricultural sector and therefore is in a better position to fall back onto subsistence farming .
However , in recent decades Morocco has been plagued by recurrent droughts , in what is widely seen as the effect of climate change .
The frequency of droughts has increased from once every five years to every other year ; the length of the growing season has shortened considerably .
( Source : Karrou ) .
Yields vary considerably between years , and in 2007 they were especially low .
As a result , Morocco is forced to import a growing share of its cereals : about a third of its cereals in 2006 / 7 , and in 2007 / 8 it is expected to import about 56 % .
Both fuel and food subsidies in Morocco are much lower than in Egypt .
To give some indication , in 2004 the retail price of a litre of gasoline was US $ 1.10 , compared with 28 cent in Egypt .
Diesel was 70 cent compared with 10 cent .
( source ) .
Bread is sold at 1.20 Dirham or US 15 cents .
Yet oil and food subsidies still made up about 10 % of the government budget in 2007 ; if they were to double , this would create a considerable fiscal strain .
There are some early signs of crisis .
In September 2007 , just before the month of Ramadan ( in which bread consumption rises ) the government raised the price of bread by 30 % .
Bread riots followed , and after clashes between police and demonstrators , the government backed down and restored the lower price .
The decisions on subsidies cuts , interestingly , was taken by the Ministry of Interior , in charge of internal security .
( source : ecomaroc.blogspot.com , French ) .
Also there are indications of falling demand for oil .
The volume of crude oil imports in 2007 was about 2 % lower than in 2006 .
However , when November 2007 is compared to November 2006 , we find an alarming drop of 43 % in the volume of oil imports .

With no substantial hydrocarbon industry , a more urbanised society ( 60 % urban compared with 42 % in Egypt ) , and greater dependency on wheat imports , Morocco seems more vulnerable to the impending crisis than Egypt .
Conclusion
Cereal prices in the Middle East are mediated through state subsidies .
So far , the urban poor have not been exposed directly to the rise in prices .
It seems inevitable , however , that at some point the price rises will be passed on to the public through subsidy cuts , either in 2008 or in 2009 , in countries such as Egypt , Morocco , Tunisia , Iraq , and Jordan .
Subsidy cuts will , without doubt , result in immediate riots .
The urban poor will not wait until they reach a starving point : they will act immediately , as they have done before , against what they will see as the government betraying its fundamental duty to provide affordable food prices .
Egypt and Morocco are among the US ’s closest allies in the region .
Belonging to the so - called “ moderate Arab / Muslim countries ” , they have been the most accommodating in terms of supplying the US with intelligence and military cooperation against Islamist groups .
In return the US has supported these regimes militarily and economically , through direct support ( Egypt ) or Free Trade Agreements .
Political instability in these countries will put in serious risk the position of the US in the Middle East .
The notion that food prices have gone up because of American ( and other developed countries ’ ) use of biofuels will not make the US more popular among people in the region .
The American policy on biofuels is repeatedly presented as a means to improve US national security , by reducing dependency on imported oil from the Middle East .
Articles on Ethanol production here in the Oil Drum ( by Robert Rapier and others ) have shown this to be a fiction at best , because of ethanol ’s poor EROI .
Now it becomes clear that the subsidising of biofuels will make the world less safe for the US , by destabilising “ friendly regimes ” in the Middle East and beyond .
A few more words .
Egypt , Morocco and other Middle East countries are regularly covered by Western Media , because of their economic and geo-political importance , as well as their proximity to Europe .
Other countries – for example in sub-Saharan Africa – may be even more vulnerable , as many of them depend on cereal imports ( although perhaps not to the same extent ) .
It would seem likely that governments in sub-Saharan Africa have less power to mitigate price rises through generous subsidies .
However , many such countries are off the radar for Western media , and the developed world will learn about the problems only through news of famines or refugee crises .
To forecast the impact of cereal price rises , one should take into account food subsidies ( where they exist ) and the ability of governments to sustain them .
In the Middle East , it seems , the political consequences will be almost immediate , and will come before actual food shortages .
In other regions it may take a different course .
In Mexico , for example , subsidies have been eliminated long ago .
But as I am no expert on Mexico , I will leave this for others .
If this short article dealt with the problem in strategic terms , in grand summaries of numbers ( population , oil , food ) , it is important to remember that behind all these are people , real people , and many of them .
Poor families in Egypt and Morocco , for whom life is already very difficult , and who survive on the bare minimum , are going to be badly hit in the next two years , when even a pita bread will become too expensive .
The important issue here is not the survival of certain political regimes , but rather the survival of these families .

The era of American politics that has been dying before our eyes was born in 1966 .
That January , a twenty - seven - year - old editorial writer for the St. Louis Globe - Democrat named Patrick Buchanan went to work for Richard Nixon , who was just beginning the most improbable political comeback in American history .
Having served as Vice - President in the Eisenhower Administration , Nixon had lost the Presidency by a whisker to John F. Kennedy , in 1960 , and had been humiliated in a 1962 bid for the California governorship .
But he saw that he could propel himself back to power on the strength of a new feeling among Americans who , appalled by the chaos of the cities , the moral heedlessness of the young , and the insults to national pride in Vietnam , were ready to blame it all on the liberalism of President Lyndon B. Johnson .
Right - wing populism was bubbling up from below ; it needed to be guided by a leader who understood its resentments because he felt them , too .

“ From Day One , Nixon and I talked about creating a new majority , ” Buchanan told me recently , sitting in the library of his Greek - revival house in McLean , Virginia , on a secluded lane bordering the fenced grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency .
“ What we talked about , basically , was shearing off huge segments of F.D.R. ’s New Deal coalition , which L.B.J. had held together : Northern Catholic ethnics and Southern Protestant conservatives — what we called the Daley - Rizzo Democrats in the North and , frankly , the Wallace Democrats in the South . ”
Buchanan grew up in Washington , D.C. , among the first group — men like his father , an accountant and a father of nine , who had supported Roosevelt but also revered Joseph McCarthy .
The Southerners were the kind of men whom Nixon whipped into a frenzy one night in the fall of 1966 , at the Wade Hampton Hotel , in Columbia , South Carolina .
Nixon , who was then a partner in a New York law firm , had travelled there with Buchanan on behalf of Republican congressional candidates .
Buchanan recalls that the room was full of sweat , cigar smoke , and rage ; the rhetoric , which was about patriotism and law and order , “ burned the paint off the walls . ”
As they left the hotel , Nixon said , “ This is the future of this Party , right here in the South . ”
Nixon and Buchanan visited thirty - five states that fall , and in November the Republicans won a midterm landslide .
It was the end of Lyndon Johnson ’s Great Society , the beginning of his fall from power .
In order to seize the Presidency in 1968 , Nixon had to live down his history of nasty politicking , and he ran that year as a uniter .
But his Administration adopted an undercover strategy for building a Republican majority , working to create the impression that there were two Americas : the quiet , ordinary , patriotic , religious , law - abiding Many , and the noisy , élitist , amoral , disorderly , condescending Few .
This strategy was put into action near the end of Nixon ’s first year in office , when antiwar demonstrators were becoming a disruptive presence in Washington .
Buchanan recalls urging Nixon , “ We ’ve got to use the siege gun of the Presidency , and go right after these guys . ”
On November 3 , 1969 , Nixon went on national television to speak about the need to avoid a shameful defeat in Vietnam .
Looking benignly into the camera , he concluded , “ And so tonight — to you , the great silent majority of Americans — I ask for your support . ”
It was the most successful speech of his Presidency .
Newscasters criticized him for being divisive and for offering no new vision on Vietnam , but tens of thousands of telegrams and letters expressing approval poured into the White House .
It was Nixon ’s particular political genius to rouse simultaneously the contempt of the bien- pensants and the admiration of those who felt the sting of that contempt in their own lives .
Buchanan urged Nixon to enlist his Vice - President , Spiro Agnew , in a battle against the press .
In November , Nixon sent Agnew — despised as dull - witted by the media — on the road , where he denounced “ this small and unelected élite ” of editors , anchormen , and analysts .
Buchanan recalls watching a broadcast of one such speech — which he had written for Agnew — on a television in his White House office .
Joining him was his colleague Kevin Phillips , who had just published “ The Emerging Republican Majority , ” which marshalled electoral data to support a prophecy that Sun Belt conservatism — like Jacksonian Democracy , Republican industrialism , and New Deal liberalism — would dominate American politics for the next thirty - two or thirty - six years .
( As it turns out , Phillips was slightly too modest . )
When Agnew finished his diatribe , Phillips said two words : “ Positive polarization . ”
Polarization is the theme of Rick Perlstein ’s new narrative history “ Nixonland ” ( Scribners ) , which covers the years between two electoral landslides : Barry Goldwater ’s defeat in 1964 and George McGovern ’s in 1972 .
During that time , Nixon figured out that he could succeed politically “ by using the angers , anxieties , and resentments produced by the cultural chaos of the 1960s , ” which were also his own .
In Perlstein ’s terms , America in the sixties was divided , like the Sneetches on Dr. Seuss ’s beaches , into two social clubs : the Franklins , who were the in - crowd at Nixon ’s alma mater , Whittier College ; and the Orthogonians , a rival group founded by Nixon after the Franklins rejected him , made up of “ the strivers , those not to the manor born , the commuter students like him .
He persuaded his fellows that reveling in one ’s unpolish was a nobility of its own . ”
Orthogonians deeply resented Franklins , which , as Perlstein sees it , explains just about everything that happened between 1964 and 1972 : Nixon resented the Kennedys and clawed his way back to power ; construction workers resented John Lindsay and voted conservative ; National Guardsmen resented student protesters and opened fire on them .
Perlstein sustains these categories throughout the book , without quite noticing that his scheme breaks down under the pressure of his central historical insight —
“ America was engulfed in a pitched battle between the forces of darkness and the forces of light .
The only thing was : Americans disagreed radically over which side was which . ”
In other words , by 1972 there were hardly any Franklins left — only former Franklins who had thrown off their dinner jackets , picked up a weapon , and joined the brawl .
The sixties , which began in liberal consensus over the Cold War and civil rights , became a struggle between two apocalyptic politics that each saw the other as hellbent on the country ’s annihilation .
The result was violence like nothing the country had seen since the Civil War , and Perlstein emphasizes that bombings , assaults , and murders committed by segregationists , hardhats , and vigilantes on the right were at least as numerous as those by radical students and black militants on the left .
Nixon claimed to speak on behalf of “ the nonshouters , the nondemonstrators , ” but the cigar smokers in that South Carolina hotel were intoxicated with hate .
Nixon was coldly mixing and pouring volatile passions .
Although he was careful to renounce the extreme fringe of Birchites and racists , his means to power eventually became the end .
Buchanan gave me a copy of a seven - page confidential memorandum — “ A little raw for today , ” he warned — that he had written for Nixon in 1971 , under the heading “ Dividing the Democrats . ”
Drawn up with an acute understanding of the fragilities and fault lines in “ the Old Roosevelt Coalition , ” it recommended that the White House “ exacerbate the ideological division ” between the Old and New Left by praising Democrats who supported any of Nixon ’s policies ; highlight “ the elitism and quasi-anti- Americanism of the National Democratic Party ” ; nominate for the Supreme Court a Southern strict constructionist who would divide Democrats regionally ; use abortion and parochial - school aid to deepen the split between Catholics and social liberals ; elicit white working - class support with tax relief and denunciations of welfare .
Finally , the memo recommended exploiting racial tensions among Democrats .
“ Bumper stickers calling for black Presidential and especially Vice - Presidential candidates should be spread out in the ghettoes of the country , ” Buchanan wrote .
“ We should do what is within our power to have a black nominated for Number Two , at least at the Democratic National Convention . ”
Such gambits , he added , could “ cut the Democratic Party and country in half ; my view is that we would have far the larger half . ”
The Nixon White House did n’t enact all of these recommendations , but it would be hard to find a more succinct and unapologetic blueprint for Republican success in the conservative era .
“ Positive polarization ” helped the Republicans win one election after another — and insured that American politics would be an ugly , unredeemed business for decades to come .
Perlstein argues that the politics of “ Nixonland ” will endure for at least another generation .
On his final page , he writes , “ Do Americans not hate each other enough to fantasize about killing one another , in cold blood , over political and cultural disagreements ?
It would be hard to argue they do not . ”
Yet the polarization of America , which we now call the “ culture wars , ” has been dissipating for a long time .
Because we ca n’t anticipate what ideas and language will dominate the next cycle of American politics , the previous era ’s key words — “ élite , ” “ mainstream , ” “ real , ” “ values , ” “ patriotic , ” “ snob , ” “ liberal ” — seem as potent as ever .
Indeed , they have shown up in the current campaign : North Carolina and Mississippi Republicans have produced ads linking local Democrats to Jeremiah Wright , Barack Obama ’s controversial former pastor .
The right - wing group Citizens United has said that it will run ads portraying Obama as yet another “ limousine liberal . ”
But these are the spasms of nerve endings in an organism that ’s brain - dead .
Among Republicans , there is no energy , no fresh thinking , no ability to capture the concerns and feelings of millions of people .
In the past two months , Democratic targets of polarization attacks have won three special congressional elections , in solidly Republican districts in Illinois , Louisiana , and Mississippi .
Political tactics have a way of outliving their ability to respond to the felt needs and aspirations of the electorate : Democrats continued to accuse Republicans of being like Herbert Hoover well into the nineteen - seventies ; Republicans will no doubt accuse Democrats of being out of touch with real Americans long after George W. Bush retires to Crawford , Texas .
But the 2006 and 2008 elections are the hinge on which America is entering a new political era .
This will be true whether or not John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , wins in November .
He and his likely Democratic opponent , Barack Obama , “ both embody a post - polarized , or anti-polarized , style of politics , ” the Times columnist David Brooks told me .
“ McCain , crucially , missed the sixties , and in some ways he ’s a pre-sixties figure .
He and Obama do n’t resonate with the sixties at all . ”
The fact that the least conservative , least divisive Republican in the 2008 race is the last one standing — despite being despised by significant voices on the right — shows how little life is left in the movement that Goldwater began , Nixon brought into power , Ronald Reagan gave mass appeal , Newt Gingrich radicalized , Tom DeLay criminalized , and Bush allowed to break into pieces .
“ The fact that there was no conventional , establishment , old - style conservative candidate was not an accident , ” Brooks said .
“ Mitt Romney pretended to be one for a while , but he was n’t .
Rudy Giuliani sort of pretended , but he was n’t .
McCain is certainly not .
It ’s not only a lack of political talent — there ’s just no driving force , and it will soften up normal Republicans for change . ”
On May 6th , Newt Gingrich posted a message , “ My Plea to Republicans : It ’s Time for Real Change to Avoid Real Disaster , ” on the Web site of the conservative magazine Human Events .
The former House Speaker warned , “ The Republican brand has been so badly damaged that if Republicans try to run an anti-Obama , anti-Reverend Wright , or ( if Senator Clinton wins ) anti-Clinton campaign , they are simply going to fail . ”
Gingrich offered nine suggestions for restoring the Republican “ brand ” — among them “ Overhaul the census and cut its budget radically ” and “ Implement a space - based , G.P.S. - style air - traffic control system ” — which read like a wonkish parody of the Contract with America .
By the next morning , the post had received almost three hundred comments , almost all predicting a long Republican winter .
Yuval Levin , a former Bush White House official , who is now a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center , agrees with Gingrich ’s diagnosis .
“ There ’s an intellectual fatigue , even if it has n’t yet been made clear by defeat at the polls , ” he said .
“ The conservative idea factory is not producing as it did .
You hear it from everybody , but nobody agrees what to do about it . ”
Pat Buchanan was less polite , paraphrasing the social critic Eric Hoffer : “ Every great cause begins as a movement , becomes a business , and eventually degenerates into a racket . ”
Only a few years ago , on the night of Bush ’s victory in 2004 , the conservative movement seemed indomitable .
In fact , it was rapidly falling apart .
Conservatives knew how to win elections ; however , they turned out not to be very interested in governing .
Throughout the decades since Nixon , conservatism has retained the essentially negative character of an insurgent movement .
“ It was only a sigh , but thank you for your concern . ”

Nixon himself was more interested in global grand strategy and partisan politics than in any conservative policy agenda .
By today ’s standards , his achievements in office look like those of a moderate liberal : he eased the tensions of the Cold War , expanded the welfare state , and supported affirmative action ( albeit in ways calculated to split the Democrats ) .
“ L.B.J. built the foundation and the first floor of the Great Society , ” Buchanan said .
“ We built the skyscraper .
Nixon was not a Reaganite conservative . ”
Even Reagan , the Moses of the conservative movement , was more ideological in his rhetoric than in his governance .
Conservatives have canonized him for cutting taxes and regulation , moving the courts to the right , and helping to vanquish the Soviet empire .
But he proved less dogmatic than most of his opponents and some of his followers expected , especially on ending the Cold War .
Reagan emphasized the first word in “ positive polarization , ” turning the Nixon playbook into a kind of national celebration .
Like F.D.R. , he dominated an era by reconciling opposites through force of personality : just as Roosevelt the patrician became the tribune of the people , Reagan turned conservatism into a forward - looking , optimistic ideology .
“ We started in 1980 and played addition , ” Ed Rollins , Reagan ’s political director , recalls .
“ ‘ Let ’s go out and get Democrats . ’
We attracted a great many young people to the Party .
Reagan made them feel good about the country again .
After the ’ 84 election , we did polling — Why did you vote for Reagan ?
They said , ‘ He ’s a winner . ’ ”
The Princeton historian Sean Wilentz , in his new book , “ The Age of Reagan : A History , 1974 - 2008 ” ( Harper ) , argues that Reagan “ learned how to seize and keep control of the terms of public debate . ”
On taxes , race , government spending , national security , crime , welfare , and “ traditional values , ” he made mainstream what had been the positions of the right - wing fringe , and he kept Democrats on the defensive .
He also brought a generation of doctrinaire conservatives into the bureaucracy and the courts , making appointments based on ideological tests that only a genuine movement leader would impose .
The rightward turn of the judiciary will probably be the most lasting achievement of Reagan and his movement .
In retrospect , the Reagan Presidency was the high - water mark of conservatism .
“ In some respects , the conservative movement was a victim of success , ” Wilentz concludes .
“ With the Soviet Union dissolved , inflation reduced to virtually negligible levels , and the top tax rate cut to nearly half of what it was in 1980 , all of Ronald Reagan ’s major stated goals when he took office had been achieved , leaving perplexed and fractious conservatives to fight over where they might now lead the country . ”
Wilentz omits one important failure .
According to Buchanan , who was the White House communications director in Reagan ’s second term , the President once told his barber , Milton Pitts , “ You know , Milt , I came here to do five things , and four out of five ai n’t bad . ”
He had succeeded in lowering taxes , raising morale , increasing defense spending , and facing down the Soviet Union ; but he had failed to limit the size of government , which , besides anti-Communism , was the abiding passion of Reagan ’s political career and of the conservative movement .
He did n’t come close to achieving it and did n’t try very hard , recognizing early that the public would be happy to have its taxes cut as long as its programs were n’t touched .
And Reagan was a poor steward of the unglamorous but necessary operations of the state .
Wilentz notes that he presided over a period of corruption and favoritism , encouraging hostility toward government agencies and “ a general disregard for oversight safeguards as among the evils of ‘ big government . ’ ” In this , and in a notorious attempt to expand executive power outside the Constitution — the Iran - Contra affair — Reagan ’s Presidency presaged that of George W. Bush .
Quote from : Rosehip
So many people say they want nothing
to do with organized religion , stating that it 's all about money .
In short , the
church is just one big business .
I must admit , I 've had similar doubts , and
often do n't know how to respond to such accusations .
I know it 's just an excuse ,
but still , I see a grain of truth to it as well ...
Also that religion is bad
because it divides people .
Thoughts , anyone ?
These are things an Agnostic will most likely say .
My Dad use to say stuff like this .
And I always respond back with : 1. ) Churches have bills to pay .a ) light billsb ) building insurancec ) gas billd ) they gotta pay church staffe ) mortgagef ) retirement fundg ) building fundh ) mission fundi ) education fundj ) seminary fund2 . )
Everything divides peoplea ) TV shows divide peopleb ) politics divide peoplec ) Atheism divides peopled ) Agnosticism divides peoplee ) any idea under the sun will divide peoplebut guess what ?
3. )
Everything also unites peoplea ) TV shows will unite peopleb ) Politics will unite peoplec ) any idea under the sun will unite people
The samething that divides will also unite .
There is no such thing as 100 % uniformity , for you will always find at least one person on the planet that will disagree .
He does n't say this to me anymore , but the truth is , some people do n't like being told what to do , and what is right and what is wrong .
They feel that " religion " is trying to control their life , and stop them from being happy .
.... stop them from having fun .
This is what it comes down to for some people .
They want to do what ever they want without anyone telling them it 's wrong .

Misleading content shared by Trump and his team is often defended as humor .
But his supporters are n't always in on the joke .
( CNN ) -- A 19 - year - old girl whose hospitalization exposed a shocking Austrian incest case has woken from her coma , a development that could shed new light on what occurred in the basement were she was held captive for decades .
Fritzl initially confessed to raping his daughter and having seven children with her .

Doctors placed Kerstin Fritzl in an artificial coma in April after she emerged for the first time from the cellar where she was held captive from birth by her father Josef .
Kerstin , along with six other children , was born from Josef Fritzl 's incestuous relationship with his daughter Elisabeth , now 43 , whom he raped repeatedly during the 24 years she was imprisoned beneath his home .
Police say Fritzl , 73 , has confessed to holding his Elisabeth captive and fathering seven children , six of whom survived .
Kerstin was admitted to hospital in Amstetten , west of Vienna , in an unconscious state after Elisabeth persuaded Fritzl that she needed medical attention .
Suspicious medics alerted police , who opened an investigation .
Detectives began investigating the case after hospital officials started inquiring about the girl 's family history .
Kerstin and two of her brothers , aged 18 and 5 , had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother , never seeing daylight , a television their only contact with the outside world .
Another three children Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife , who says she had no idea that her daughter was being held captive .
A seventh child died shortly after birth .
Elisabeth and her children have been treated at a secure medical unit since their release .
Officials at hospital in Amstetten , Austria , did not release any more information about Kerstin Fritzl 's condition .
A news conference on the case is scheduled for Wednesday .

While Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have released years of personal tax returns , Republican John McCain has released two years of limited returns .
Recently , DNC Chair Howard Dean wondered what McCain is hiding ?
“ John McCain ’s lack of transparency is troubling and raises questions about what he ’s hiding .
From his willingness to skirt FEC law to releasing less information about his tax returns than any other candidate since Ronald Reagan , John McCain continues a troubling pattern of thinking the rules do n’t apply to him .
McCain should hold himself to the same standard set by past presidential candidates , both Republican and Democrat , and the example already set by both Democratic candidates , ” Dean said .
He also said that McCain should be held to the same standard that John Kerry was in 2004 .
“ In 2004 , the Republican National Committee called on the Kerry campaign to release Teresa Heinz Kerry ’s tax returns , saying ‘ Americans value disclosure and transparency in campaigns . ’
We expect the RNC will call on John McCain to release Cindy McCain ’s records just as they called on the Kerry campaign to do so in 2004 .
The connection between the McCains ’ business ventures and their political ties have been well documented and the American people deserve to know how McCain ’s role as a public official may have benefited their bottom line , ” Dean said .

What John McCain is hiding is very simple .
He does n’t want voters to know just how rich he and his wife really are .
It will be difficult to label Barack Obama a liberal elitist , once the world knows that McCain ’s wife is worth $ 100 million and that for decades McCain has been living a life replete with private jets and vacation homes .
This is the exact situation that the Republicans used to paint John Kerry as a rich elitist in 2004 , so why would n’t the same standard apply to McCain in 2008 ?
Much like George W. Bush , McCain has a blind spot towards his own wealth .
Republicans will do their best to define the Democrats as the elite this year , but as usual the real elitist will be the candidate who is trying his hardest to act like a regular guy .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The average price U.S. drivers paid for gasoline soared to a new high of $ 3.51 a gallon , rising 11.9 cents over the last week , the government said on Monday .
The national average price for regular , self - service gasoline is up 64 cents from a year ago , the federal Energy Information Administration ’s said in its latest survey of service stations .
Pump prices are rising because of high crude oil costs , which on Monday climbed to a record $ 117.83 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The price of crude oil accounts for about 70 percent of the cost for making gasoline .
The EIA ’s weekly survey showed gasoline was again the most expensive on the West Coast at $ 3.73 a gallon , up 7.2 cents .
San Francisco had the highest city price at $ 3.86 , up 4.5 cents .
The Gulf Coast states had the cheapest regional price at $ 3.41 a gallon , up 12.6 cents .
Cleveland had the lowest city price , up 7 cents to $ 3.36 .
As fuel prices roar to successive record highs , more Americans are planning to cut back on driving and buy fewer gas - guzzling vehicles , according to a consumer group survey released on Monday .
U.S. households spent more than $ 100 billion on gasoline during the first quarter of this year , more than double the $ 40 billion spent in the same period just six years ago , said the Consumer Federation of America .
“ That ’s a huge bite out of the household budget , ” said Mark Cooper , CFA ’s research director .
“ People will use less gasoline . ”
Meanwhile , two U.S. lawmakers on Monday asked the White House to create a special Justice Department task force to examine possible fraud and manipulation of oil and natural gas markets .
The lawmakers said supply and demand conditions can’t explain current record oil prices , and suggested investments in the energy markets by speculators were at fault .
Separately , the weekly price for diesel fuel jumped 8.4 cents to a record $ 4.14 a gallon , up $ 1.29 from a year ago , the EIA said .
Average diesel fuel prices remained above $ 4 a gallon in every region of the country .
The central Atlantic states had the most expensive diesel at $ 4.37 a gallon , up 10.4 cents .
The Gulf Coast region had the cheapest fuel at $ 4.08 , up 8.5 cents , the EIA said .
The survey conducted for the CFA found that 60 percent of respondents said rising gasoline prices caused them much or some hardship , with 27 percent reporting much hardship .
As a result , 45 percent of those surveyed said they were driving less compared with a year earlier , while only 10 percent said they were driving more .
Higher gasoline costs will dramatically change the types of vehicles consumers buy in the future , according to the CFA .
Forty - two percent said they intended to purchase vehicles with average fuel economy of more than 30 miles per gallon , compared with the median for current vehicles of 24 mpg .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq would make it difficult to mount any attack on Iran , the Pentagon ’s top officer said in remarks broadcast on Monday , adding that he would prefer to avoid a new regional war .
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff US Navy Admiral Michael Mullen testifies before the House Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington , April 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
“ I actually am very hopeful that we do n’t get into a position where we have to get into a conflict , ” Adm .
Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told Israel ’s Channel Ten television when asked if he might recommend that U.S. forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities preemptively .
“ It would be a very significant challenge for the United States right now to get into a third conflict in that part of the world , ” Mullen added , referring to the Bush administration ’s long - running military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Washington is leading efforts to curb Iran ’s nuclear plans through U.N. Security Council sanctions , but has also hinted that war could be a last resort for denying Tehran -- which insists it seeks atomic energy only -- the means to make a bomb .
Jittery since Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s 2005 call for the Jewish state to be “ wiped off the map ” , Israeli officials have been lobbying for a tougher global stand against their arch - foe .
“ I certainly share the concern about Iran and about the leadership , and I think it is very important that we increase as much as possible the financial pressure , the diplomatic pressure , the political pressure , and at the same time keep all the military options on the table , ” Mullen said .
Believed to have the Middle East ’s only atomic arsenal , Israel bombed Iraq ’s nuclear reactor in 1981 .
Israeli war planes also destroyed a site in Syria last September which U.S. officials said was that of a secret nuclear program , though Damascus denied having any such facility .
“ Certainly the situation with Syria is a troubling one and the development of this nuclear reactor was a troubling one indeed , and it is also indicative of what can be done out of the sight of people , ” Mullen said .
“ You just ca n’t be sure whether someone is n’t developing one somewhere else . ”
Speculation that Israel could attack Iranian nuclear sites alone has been offset by assessments that its armed forces are too limited for the task .
Iran is widely expected to retaliate for any such strike by targeting Israel and U.S. assets in the Gulf .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKgdSsnZn7wCities and corporations are stringing up thousands and thousands of surveillance cameras , armed with advanced video intelligence algorithms , to watch out for terrorists and crooks .
Too bad the rest of us get caught on tape , while the electronic eyes make their spy sweeps .
And no one knows what the spycams are recording .
A strain of new software may have the potential to change that , however , by blurring or encrypting faces in the footage , until there 's an alarm or an investigation .
Ironically , some of the same firms that made video surveillance extra Orwellian are now working to make the spy networks a bit more privacy - friendly .
Take video - analysis company 3VR .
Its software builds up databases of every vehicle , license plate and face a surveillance network sees – yikes – and triggers an alarm when a suspect person or car crosses a camera 's lens .
Now , 3VR 's engineers are tweaking the algorithms to blur out all the faces and vehicles that do n't fall under the software 's suspicions so the rest of us are n't filmed just because we happen to be walking by the wrong place at the wrong time .
A pair of University of Toronto professors have put together a similar system , a " secure visual object coding application " that " uses cryptography techniques to encrypt ' objects of interest ' within video frames – faces or other features that may be used to identify a person – and store them separately . "
Of course , a security guard or investigator could later unecrypt the faces , with the proper key ( or a subpoena ) .
So a person would n't know for sure he was hidden from the cameras forvever .
But at least the decrypting would be an auditable event – something a supervisor ( or a judge ) could track .
The boss or magistrate could tell whether the monitor jockey wanted to see a robber 's getaway , or a woman 's legs .
3VR chief Stephen Russell writes on his blog , it 's " a way to ' watch the watchers , ' if you will . "

Squeak now running on Nokia N810 18 January , 2008
Derek O’Connell reports that he has Squeak up and running on the new Nokia N810 .
Having compiled a Unix VM for the platform , he was then able to run a standard Squeak image without tweaking !
Performance is acceptable , and it works well with the new keyboard on the N810 , but it does n’t pick up on some of the system events , so a little work is needed for Squeak to work seamlessly .
Derek received his N810 as one of the 500 lucky developers given access to the device through the maemo.org “ Nokia N810 maemo device program ” , based on his proposal to port Squeak to the device .

As we ’re sure you ’re aware , this week sees the release of Grand Theft Auto IV , the highly anticipated latest iteration of the popular violence - based , sandbox - style video game series .
This time , the action is set in Liberty City , a living , breathing replica of New York .
Dan Houser , Vice President of Rockstar Games and co-writer of GTA IV , spoke to Vulture about building a nuttier , dirtier Gotham .
So the gaming industry has changed a lot since the last GTA …
Yeah , fuck all this stuff about casual gaming .
I think people still want games that are groundbreaking .
The Wii is doing something totally different , which is fantastic .
We ’re hopefully going to prove that there ’s also a very big audience for people who want entertainment in another form , who think of games as being a narrative device that can challenge movies .
We always said :
We ’re not going release a large number of games .
They ’re going to have the production values of movies .
They ’re gonna be about themes that interest us whatever the medium , instead of the weird , special video game–only themes that too many people make — orcs and elves , or monsters , or space .
We felt you could make a good game and have it be about something we could actually relate to .
Or aspire to .
When it comes to designing New York , where do you even start ?
With the map ?
It ’s not just getting the roads laid out sensibly , which we do , or picking all the landmarks — it ’s also the more subtle details of dirt , or lighting .
We had people out photographing on rooftops on time - lapse cameras so we could get the lighting as close as we can .
We had guys looking at Census data ; this part of Queens should be more Chinese .
The [ pedestrians ] can go up and speak to each other now , so we got them speaking Russian , Spanish , Chinese .
It seemed we ’d set a high bar in the past and wanted to take it to a new place , where you feel less like a video game and more like this weird digital fantasy world .
How do you do that ?
We ’re doing things in this that other people would think is insane .
Here ’s a simple example : pedestrians , the guys that walk around , it ’s a massive - scale production to do that .
We ended up with 660 speaking parts .
80,000 lines of dialogue , it ’s ridiculous .
Can you give us an example of something in the game we would n’t notice right away ?
I think one of the things we try to capture in the game is that New York is the world leader in walking around meeting insane people .
[ Rockstar Games president ]
Sam [ Houser ] and I were walking home and we just met this absolutely crazy homeless guy , who was telling us how he recently killed someone , and drifted into insanity .
After 30 seconds of this guy ’s life , we both thought — he ’s brilliant !
[ In the game ] you meet freaky characters , and then you can do little random interactive things with them .
Who are a few of your favorites ?
We go for that full range of classic New York archetypes .
You ’ve got the angry sleeping - pill - popping sort of Sex and the City type woman , you know , whose looks are just beginning to fade — a career woman who works in fashion .
The guy who ’s like , “ Yo , buy my record . ”
There ’s the kid who ’s like the overconfident cokehead , and then you see him later and he becomes a crackhead , and he ’s a real mess .
And then you see him a while later and he ’s fresh out of rehab .
So all the pedestrians fit the neighborhoods ?
The people in Soho are expensively dressed and into shopping and vacuous in their own way .
People in Noho are slightly different , people in Harlem are different .
We give them a little character , maybe a two - sentence description — usually a cynical take on a classic New York persona : an English guy living over here , who thinks he ’s a real hot shot , but he ’s a complete phony , which is why he ’s come to New York .
If he gets pushed when he ’s on his cell phone , he runs away from you .
We ’re trying to pick up personalities that are worth of spoofing .
We ’re not trying to go after every single black person , or every 25 - year - old Hispanic kid .
We ’re saying , this is the neurotic guy who wants to be hard .
This is the hard guy who wants to be a poet .
And this is the angry guy who ’s trying to go to anger management class .
We ’re just trying to get male personas and fix them to any race .
On the fashion side , we ’re literally doing fashion shoots and taking the photographs and turning them into the models .
We have street stylists to help us dress them .
It ’s got to look right .
How realistic did you want to go with this ?
We try to get the essence of the place , not a photo - realistic , digital tourist guide .
We wanted a kind of spiritual tourist guide that feels like New York , but a blown - out , larger - than - life version .
We want it to feel you ’re the star of your own movie or TV show .
We wanted an element of the classic New York of the seventies and eighties too .
It ’s got a bit of that bad , good old days feel .
We ’re not at all aspiring to virtual reality — what we are aspiring to is what feels like you ’re living in your own world , halfway between 3 - D cartoon and action movies .
Aaron [ Gorbut ] in Scotland , the art director , the thing that he ’s a genius at , and his main guys are brilliant at pulling off , is making the worlds look lived - in in a way no one else can .
They do n’t just think , “ How do I make a beautiful model for this house and the sidewalk ? ”
They worry about , “ How do I seam them together and put a nice dirt between them ? ”
You never notice that as a consumer , but you do notice that it looks really believable .
Other games look so rigid .
How did you pick which areas of New York to feature ?
We went from maybe doing the whole of New York State .
And then it was just Manhattan , then it expanded out again and was going to be a bunch of suburbs , maybe like Westchester or out to Long Island with woods so you could go bury people .
We made lists of what must we keep , what can we drop , what ’s got to be there , what can we smash in together .
Like how we do n’t do Staten Island and do New Jersey : we would all vote on it .
We did n’t want to offend anyone in Staten Island , but you get the same suburban neighborhoods in Jersey , plus some factories and stuff .
What kind of research did you do ?
We started videoing a lot of neighborhoods , and then the videos were sent off to North [ Rockstar ’s studio in Scotland , where most programming is done ] and put on plasma TVs around their office , so while they worked they could look up and there was New York .
Did the guys from Scotland come over here ?
In March or April of 2005 we had 60 or 70 of the guys here for a week and a half , driving around in SUVs in the rough parts of town .
We ’d have cops who used to work the beat driving us around Washington Heights , and saying it used to be great because it was really different then and you could shoot people all the time .
How have the radio stations in the game improved ?
We went basically from about eight or nine stations in Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas to eighteen different radio stations this time .
We wanted [ the news station ] to feel like 1010 WINS , so we got one of the main voices [ John Montone ] to be our news reader .
Problem is , in New York now , you ca n’t find seventeen radio stations you want to listen to .
We tried to get stuff that would feel like what you would want to hear if you came to New York .
Not necessarily what you do find here , but what you ought to hear if it was like the way you ’d imagined it .
It seems like the video game–violence issue might finally be dying down .
Do you foresee any problems with GTA IV ?
If you do n’t like any violent content in your entertainment , then I apologize because I do .
And I ’ve unfortunately been exposed to it my entire life .
I agree that the world would be a greater place if all of the guns and all of the bombs disappeared , but that certainly is not in the agenda .
If we equally got rid of a lot of books that talk about violence , okay .
But if we do n’t like these games because they ’ve got content that we ’re happy to see in movies and TV shows , then what you ’re saying is you do n’t like the medium because we do n’t have a George Clooney type sticking his face in front of the camera .
There is nothing in the game you would not see in a TV show , or a movie a hundred times over , so I do n’t understand what the conversation is about .
We set out to make games that felt like they could culturally exist alongside the movies we were watching and the books we were reading , and hopefully we ’re getting close to those goals .
I thought you might back away from the sex , but you can still pick up girls , right ?
We wanted it to feel like a gangster film .
And you ca n’t do that if you ca n’t use bad language , or have a hooker on the corner , or a strip club , or all the other things that are part of that world .

Three - dimensional processors took a baby step towards commercial reality today , thanks to IBM 's water - cooling research .
Big Blue and the Fraunhofer Institute have successfully tested a multistack CPU prototype that 's cooled by pumping water directly through the separate layers of the processor .
If you are n't used to thinking of processors in terms of layers , you may need to check Jon Stokes ' " Dagwood Sandwich " analogy before continuing on .
3 - D chip stacking uses a technology referred to as " through silicon via " ( TSV ) to build processors vertically , rather than just horizontally .
By using both dimensions , CPU engineers can reduce wire delay , improve CPU efficiency , and significantly reduce total power consumption .
We 've previously covered both Intel and IBM 's efforts in this area ; readers should consult those articles for a more comprehensive treatment of the subject .
Thermal dissipation , however , is the Achilles ' heel of any three dimensional processor .
The more layers in a processor , the more difficult it is to effectively remove heat emanating from the lower levels .
CPU architects can compensate for this by placing the hotter parts of a core on upper layers and by avoiding designs that stack core hotspots vertically , but the complexity of the problem increases with every additional layer .
Simply leaving more space between the individual layers is not a solution , as this would quickly recreate the wire delay problems three - dimensional processors are meant to alleviate .
IBM 's water - cooled solution .
Water radiates through the core in an enclosed structure .
According to the IBM project lead , conventional processor cooling systems simply are n't up to the task .
" As we package chips on top of each other to significantly speed a processor ’s capability to process data , we have found that conventional coolers attached to the back of a chip do n’t scale .
In order to exploit the potential of high - performance 3 - D chip stacking , we need interlayer cooling . "
IBM 's water - cooled prototype has 100 micron high cooling layers between the die layers of the hermetically sealed processor .
These layers are n't just filled with water , they 're also packed with the vertical interconnects between the two dies , at a density of 10,000 interconnects per cm2 .
According to IBM , standard fabrication technology was used to build the chip , although specialized equipment was needed to connect the wires between the two die packages .
The final results of IBM 's test were impressive ; the die - stacked processor 's interlayer cooling solution was capable of removing 180W / cm2 for a stack with a footprint of 4cm2 .
We 're still a long way off from three - dimensional processors ( three - dimensional RAM is imminent ) but IBM 's prototyped water - cooling solution proves that designs could one day see the light of day .

Open dissent at the Fed continues .
I first talked about this a week ago in Infighting At The Fed.
Today Lacker Says Fed Loans to Wall Street Risk More Crises .
Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said the lending to securities firms that the central bank introduced in March may lay the seeds of further financial crises .
" The danger is that the effect of the recent credit extension on the incentives of financial - market participants might induce greater risk taking , " Lacker said in a speech to the European Economics and Financial Centre in London .
That " in turn could give rise to more frequent crises , " he said .
Lacker urged that the central bank now " clearly " set boundaries for its help to financial markets .
In an interview yesterday on the themes of his speech , Lacker said even those new boundaries may not be believed by investors unless a financial firm fails " in a costly way . "
The remarks are the strongest warning by an official about the consequences of the Fed 's aid to securities dealers , the first lending to nonbanks since the Great Depression .
While other regulators have focused on tightening investment - bank oversight in exchange for the lending , Lacker said there 's a case for " scaling back " the new programs .
Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser urged in a separate speech today that officials specify the conditions " under which the central bank will lend " to firms .
He told reporters in New York afterwards that " we run the risk of sowing the seeds of the next crisis . "
Thomas Hoenig of Kansas City said last month the Fed 's actions were " likely to weaken market discipline , " while Minneapolis 's Gary Stern in April worried about " adequate incentives to contain " an expansion in the Fed 's safety net .
The central bank has introduced three programs since December to help counter the credit crisis .
Along with the Primary Dealer Credit Facility , the Fed lends Treasuries to dealers in exchange for mortgage and asset - backed debt through the Term Securities Lending Facility .
The Term Auction Facility offers cash loans to banks .
Lacker indicated skepticism about the value of the programs .
" It is n't clear what kind of market failure is being addressed " with the TAF , he said .
Central bankers should be wary " that they can substitute their own judgment about the fundamental value of financial instruments , " he said .

In the first instance , that took the form of the Disney Vault , whereby films would be re-released every ten years , either in cinemas or later on VHS and DVD , before going “ back into the vault ” in order to create a rolling cycle of nostalgia that has proven lucrative over the years .
More recently , they ’ve been able to continue that by remaking their animated features in live action , an extremely lucrative strategy that will give us Tim Burton ’s Dumbo , Guy Ritchie ’s Aladdin , and Jon Favreau ’s The Lion King , all in the next 12 months or so .
Aside from being a legacy brand , franchises are doing as much heavy lifting at the House of Mouse as they are at any other studio .
In fact , their success has actually come out of making fewer smaller films , when you compare their output to what they were doing in the 1990s via Touchstone and other divisions , and reaping the rewards of betting big on Marvel and Lucasfilm .
Looking at what ’s to come , they mean to continue monopolising the blockbuster business .
The Disney brand means that , for better or worse , “ Disney movie ” was essentially its own genre .
Even ten years ago , that would largely be synonymous with fairy tales , princesses , and movies primarily aimed at women and children .
But from making more four - quadrant films for a PG - 13 audience , to stock - piling franchises , their record - smashing success in the last decade has all come out of them figuring out how to make movies that everyone else wants to see as well .
The last ten years
Going back a decade to Disney ’s acquisition of Pixar for the sum of $ 7.4 billion , you can already see the start of the company getting to where it is now .
The story of Disney ’s last ten years started with them using their heft to buy companies and properties that were already hitting the bases they were n’t , but has gradually led to the diversification of their film output overall .
What started as a financial strategy has done some creative good as well , keeping their shareholders happy , but also entertaining us geeks in the process .
Back in 2008 , Disney ’s big franchise releases were sequels to National Treasure , The Chronicles Of Narnia , and High School Musical .
At that point the first Pirates Of The Caribbean trilogy had just wrapped up with expensive back - to - back sequels , and a few years later , the fourth one would somehow prove to be even more expensive .

Advertisement More than 10,000 people were killed in a devastating cyclone that hit western Burma on Saturday , Foreign Minister Nyan Win has said on state TV .
He said his government was ready to accept international assistance .
Aid shipments are now being prepared .
Thousands of survivors of Cyclone Nargis are lacking shelter , drinking water , power and communications .
The United States offered to increase aid offered if Burma agreed to allow a US team access to assess the situation .
First Lady Laura Bush , who takes a special interest in Burma , urged Burma to accept $ 250,000 ( £ 126,000 ) already allocated for emergency aid , and said more would be available if the team was allowed into the country .
She also accused the Burmese authorities of failing to give a " timely warning " about the approaching storm , after which five regions - home to 24 million people - have been declared disaster zones .
Sea surge Expressing his sadness at the scale of the disaster , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon confirmed that UN officials were meeting Burmese government representatives to discuss how to help .
If the toll is confirmed , Nargis is now the world 's deadliest storm since a 1999 cyclone in India killed 10,000 people .
Nargis hit the south - east Asian country on Saturday with wind speeds reaching 190 km/h ( 120 m ph ) .
It brought with it a sea surge that smashed through towns and villages .
Crucial test for junta

Your pictures : Rangoon damage Earlier on Monday , the death toll was being put at 351 but the foreign minister later went on TV to announce the figure of at least 10,000 .
With information still coming in , he warned the toll could yet rise .
The towns of Bogalay and Laputta , in the region of Irrawaddy , are among those locations particularly badly hit , state media have reported .
None of the casualty figures have been independently confirmed .
The BBC is not permitted to report from Burma , also known as Myanmar .
Houses ' skeletal '
Thousands of buildings have been flattened , power lines downed , trees uprooted , roads blocked and water supplies disrupted .
Many people have been left without drinking water and shelter A Rangoon resident who spoke to relatives in Laputta told BBC Burmese that 75 % to 80 % of the town had been destroyed .
Houses along the coast had been reduced to skeletal structures , 16 villages had been virtually wiped out and no help had reached Laputta , he said .
Pictures on state TV show security services working to clear roads but in Rangoon and elsewhere there are complaints that the response to the disaster has been weak .

" Where are the soldiers and police ?
They were very quick and aggressive when there were protests in the streets last year , " a retired government worker complained to Reuters news agency .
He was referring to protests led by Buddhist monks last year that were quickly put down .
Earlier , a BBC journalist monitoring the situation in Burma from Bangkok , Soe Win , said the shortages of power and water were particularly critical .
Local people were saying that if the situation continued for another two or three days , it would be really difficult for them , he reported .
Aid assessment Several hundred thousand people are in need of shelter and clean drinking water , UN disaster response official Richard Horsey said .
DEADLIEST RECENT STORMS
Hurricane Katrina , US , 2005 - at least 1,836 dead Orissa Cyclone , 1999 , Northern India - at least 10,000 dead Hurricane Mitch , 1998 , Central America - at least 11,000 dead Typhoon Thelma , 1991 , Philippines - 6,000 dead Bangladesh cyclone , 1991 - about 138,000 dead Bhola cyclone , 1970 - at least 300,000 dead
Timeline : Major tropical cyclones
But damage to roads and communications mean it is impossible to tell the true extent of the situation , he added .
Prices of food , fuel and basic necessities have also risen dramatically .
The UN and international aid agencies are sending assessment teams to the worst - hit areas and shipments are being prepared .
Thailand has announced it is flying in a transport plane loaded with nine tonnes of food and medicines and India is sending two naval ships carrying food , tents , blankets , clothing and medicines .
The US , which released an immediate funding package of $ 250,000 ( £ 127,000 ) to be channelled through the UN , said that Burmese authorities had refused permission for an American disaster assistance response team to enter .
Meanwhile , Burma 's military junta has said a referendum on a new national constitution will go ahead on Saturday .
People were " eagerly looking forward to voting " , it said .
But some people are now wondering if this natural disaster could have serious political repercussions , reports the BBC's Andrew Harding in the Thai capital Bangkok .

What are these ?
Satellites are a lynchpin of our modern life , even if they do their work behind ( above ? ) the scenes .
But no ...
Only because everybody asks .
Some people have toilet set ups of varying comlicatedness ( bucket , anti-stink bag , sawdust , kitty litter , grey tanks , black tanks , who knows what else ) , and when I lived in a bus I had a sawdust composting toilet that I loved .
But I live in a van now , and really people , it ’s just a van .
There is no room for such complications .
So .
How to pee :
The ideal situation is to be out in the woods and you just squat and pee .
My dad always said you should never live someplace where you ca n’t pee off your porch every morning , and I totally agree .
If you ’re not out in the woods , you might be in a 24 hour WalMart parking lot , in which case , just go in and pee .
Do n’t worry about buying things , they ’re used to people coming in and peeing and the people who work there really do n’t care .
Now , if you ’re not out in the woods or near a bathroom , hopefully you ’ve arranged your van along the side of the road or in a parking lot so that the sliding door is facing nothing .
You can open this door an still have total privacy , because it ’s late / dark / secluded enough that that ’s the way it is .
So , open the door .
Step down to the very edge of the step , squat , and pee .
You may need to adjust your labia to prevent drippage , but you ’ll catch on quick .
But if all of that fails , do n’t worry , there are other ways !
You might be in a residential neighborhood or a parking lot of a building that ’s closed but there are still some people around .
Or you might just think that toilets are freaky and wierd because they steal your pee and do something other than give it back to the dirt .
Whatever the reason , there you are , and you gotta pee .
So wear a nice long spacious skirt .
Take your dog out , and squat down like you are playing with your dog .
It ’s best if you do it at the edge of a cement - around - the - grass thingy , so that the back of your skirt hangs down and is protected by the cement edging .
Pull the front of your skirt up just a tad so that it ’s not on the ground but still brushes the grass .
It takes a little practice to keep your skirt dry , but once you ’ve got it down it works like a charm .
I ’ve even had people come over to pet my dog and have no idea that moments before I was talking to them I was peeing .
So there ya have it , folks : how I pee .
KABUL , Afghanistan 
A well - coordinated assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai by suspected Taliban insurgents at the Afghan national day military parade in central Kabul has turned into a moment of national embarrassment for the government , which has been pressing to take over responsibility for Kabul ’s security from foreign troops .
Three people were killed Sunday in the brazen assault , ruining what was supposed to have been a proud moment for Afghan security forces .
The ability of the attackers to get so close to Mr. Karzai , who escaped unhurt , suggested they had inside help .
The dead included a tribal chief and a member of Parliament who were in the reviewing stands near Mr. Karzai , and a 10 - year - old boy caught in the cross - fire as militants and security forces aimed at each other , officials said .
Eleven people were wounded , among them army officers , police officers and civilians , hospital officials said .
Several suspects were arrested later .
The attack sent officials and foreign diplomats scrambling for cover in the stands and hundreds of soldiers running off the parade ground in disarray .
Mr. Karzai was whisked out the back exit , and the ceremony was abandoned after Afghan security forces had spent weeks preparing and rehearsing .
Researchers claimed attempts to curb youth offending has been ineffective A decade - long government drive to cut youth offending has had " no measurable impact " , an independent study suggests .
Criminologists at King 's College London said success in targeting youth crime was far more mixed and ambiguous than ministers liked to claim .
The team said youth crime spending was up a massive 45 % on 2000 - but every reoffending target had been missed .
The Youth Justice Board said an official independent audit showed the reforms had delivered big improvements .
One of Labour 's first major acts after coming to power was to reform the system for tackling youth crime , with former prime minister Tony Blair pledging to be tough on the causes of crime .
' Demanding task '
At the heart of the ambitious reforms was the Youth Justice Board ( YJB ) and associated local Youth Offending Teams which began working in 2000 .
But in a review of the £ 650 m system , the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies ( CCJS ) at King 's College said the government 's claims of success had been over - stated .
The report said youth offending had barely changed - but more children had been criminalised or imprisoned .
Attempts to prevent children getting to the stage where they could only be dealt with by youth justice sanctions were proving " a demanding task " , said the CCJS .

There had been some success in accelerating the time from arrest to sentencing , but the new bodies had " struggled " to tackle underlying , complex social problems in the lives of young offenders .
Nearly all the targets relating to youth education , training , employment , drug abuse , mental health and accommodation had been missed , concluded the authors .
The YJB 's latest figures show youth crime is broadly stable but with a recent rise in recorded offences involving girls .
Reoffending rates remained highest among those who had a custodial sentence - but lower for those dealt with before reaching court .
Enver Solomon , co-author of the CCJS report , said the findings suggested the multi-agency youth offending teams were not necessarily working .
" The government 's record on youth crime and tackling the multiple needs of children caught up in the youth justice system is less impressive than many would have expected , " he said .
" This raises questions about the success of the reforms in making an impact on the number of children and young people who offend , and demonstrates that the youth justice agencies can do little more than regulate youth crime .
" The government has placed too high expectations on the youth justice system and should be clearer about its limitations . "
The YJB dismissed the report , saying it had failed to acknowledge significant improvements such as a cut in reoffending over five years .
I 'm afraid the government have run out of road .
We used to hear about their respect agenda .
That 's gone now
Nick Herbert
Shadow Justice Minister
Doing time did n't put me off crime
The board said it was on course to meet a 2008 target to reduce the number of young people being brought before the youth justice system for the first time .
" The Audit Commission review in 2004 reported the system was a considerable improvement to the old one and that improvements have continued , " said Frances Done , chair of the board .
" We deal with some of the most troubled and troublesome children in the country - there is no simple or easy solution - but great strides have been made in the community and in custody to hold young people to account for their actions and to protect the public . "
Shadow Justice Minister Nick Herbert said the report showed the government 's policy had failed .
He said : " I 'm afraid the government have run out of road .
We used to hear about their respect agenda .
That 's gone now .

" We have a prime minister who has n't made a speech on crime since he took office , which I find simply extraordinary , given public concern about this issue . "
Barnardo's chief executive , Martin Narey , said the biggest concern was the increase in the use of custody on young criminals .
He said : " The fundamental issue remains the over use of custody for children who have not committed violent offences .
Until this is addressed both the youth justice and welfare systems will continue to fail some of our most damaged and vulnerable children . "
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the government was committed to intervening early with young people to prevent crime .
He said : " Much has been achieved in tackling youth crime .
Reoffending among juveniles fell by more than 17 % between 2000 and 2005 and overall youth offending levels remain stable .
" However , there is clearly more work to do and we are pushing forward our efforts to reduce reoffending further , including by launching a Youth Crime Action Plan this summer . "

What are these ?
This article was inspired by a post from Steve Foskett on Dell 's The Future of Storage site .
In his post , Foskett tries to make the case for the " Home SAN . "
While I 'm not convinced that the answer to all my home storage problems is a " SAN , " like Foskett proposes , I do agree that something has to be done .
Check out my proposed solution , and sound off in The Server Room .
I have a lot of networked storage in my house .
Various iPhones and iPods , a Mac Mini , three laptops , an AppleTV , a NAS device , multiple Firewire drives attached to the laptops , and the list goes on .
I have n't done the math to total it all up , but by the time I upgrade my NAS this summer I 'll have at least 5TB total of storage scattered throughout my home , tucked away in pockets , purses , briefcases , entertainment centers , closets , and other nooks and crannies .
Living amidst this much hardware might sound great , but parts of the experience get old .
In particular , I 'm really , really tired of managing all these " disks . "
I 'm tired of manually syncing and copying and things between one disk or partition and another , and I wish every gadget in my house was part of one big virtual filesystem — a " storage cloud , " if you will — that would liberate me from the curse of constantly syncing .
Why I hate syncing
I spend way too much time and effort trying to keep different file collections in sync among different devices , so that I can make sure that I have the right version of the right file in the right place when I need it .
In short , file syncing is the bane of my existence , and managing multiple versions of individual files and databases ( both structured and unstructured ) is a constant battle .
For instance , I recently spent an entire day developing an elaborate method for keeping the iTunes libraries on two different Macs totally in sync , so that adding a file to one would propagate the changes to the other without my having to manually add any files via iTunes ' interface .
( For the curious , the solution involved putting my entire iTunes directory on one of Leopard 's new sparse bundle images , placing that image on each machine , and then using rsync to sync that image between my MacBook Pro and my Mini , so that an update to one library would appear in the other library simply by relaunching iTunes . )
My solution worked , but then I decided to scrap it all when it occurred to me that I may want to sync the AppleTV to the Mini and my iPhone to the MacBook , which would mean a separate library for each file ... but then what happens if I buy a new song from the iTunes Music Store on my AppleTV ?
How does it get to the iPhone ?
Or what if I buy a new song on the iPhone ?
In short , adding music to an iTunes - based digital music collection is a mess , if you 're trying to keep multiple iTunes libraries on multiple machines in sync .
Then there are the problems that I have syncing my MacBook Air with my MacBook Pro .
Some applications that I use , like Together , now have .
Mac sync services built in .
But others , like Journler , do not .
And that still does n't change the fact that if I move to the living room to work on a set of files on the Air , I have to manually sync those files back to the MacBook that 's wired to my desktop setup before switching computers again .
( I use Chronosync for this . )
Then there 's the NAS , which I formerly used for backup before I started using Time Machine .
Also , I 'm currently looking into a replacement for Strongspace for offsite backup ...
The syncing never ends .
I 'm not sure what the answer is , but I know that some kind of more automated or " invisible " set of sync services is n't it .
Because with all the syncing that I 've done , I 've found the following axiom to be true : the only thing worse than a sync that requires manual intervention is an automated sync that has unwanted results that you do n't learn about until it 's too late .
Bring on the cloud
So I 'm ready for some cloud storage .
But I do n't want all my gadgets to connect to some distant cloud .
Rather , I want them to be the cloud , so that my data surrounds me like some mist with a life of its own , instead of sitting in these little isolated balls that I have to juggle .
It 's not that I do n't ever want to sync again .
No , syncing should be like rebooting — something you do once in a blue moon , when you absolutely have to .
In fact , the most I should ever have to sync a laptop is when I walk back into my house after having been away working on something .
When I come home from a trip , I want my network to say , " hey , it 's the MacBook Air .
Let 's see what 's new on its hard disk , and what changes has Jon saved to different files . "
And then I want my network to start copying the new and altered files off my Air , but not onto a specific machine or server on my network — I want it copied into the cloud .
And when I 'm sitting in my chair and I change a file on the Air , I want that change propagated back out to the cloud instantaneously , the way that a change to an e-mail draft in Gmail is saved back to Google 's servers , so that when I switch machines the changes are there automatically .
And I do n't want to sync my iPhone to my laptop .
Rather , I want my iPhone to move files to and from my iTunes library — but the one that lives in the cloud that encompasses my entire house , and not some version of a file collection plus metadata that lives on a particular machine .
And when I add songs to my AppleTV , those songs are in the cloud and any ( authorized ) machine in my house can instantly see them and play them by either caching local copies or streaming ...
I do n't care which , and I do n't want to know .
Above all , I do n't want to really manage disk space , and file versions , and timestamps , and sync scheduling , and all that other stuff that my computers should be managing for me with minimal intervention .
I just want to be able to live and work and play , all without the hassle of manually shuffling files and preferences and other types of information around from one machine to the next .
Is that too much to ask ?
Syncing vs. " saving "
I can hear at least one objection already : " Is n't this ' cloud ' that you 're describing just a fancy way of talking about a lot of automated , invisible sync , which you 've said you do n't like ? "
The answer is , " no ... and yes . "
A " disk " is already a storage abstraction that hides all sorts of sync activity from you , the user .
So as you use a computer , the different levels of the storage hierarchy ( registers , cache , main memory , hard disk ) are all " syncing " different copies of the data on which you 're working , but your exposure to the nuts and bolts of that sync is largely limited to the " Save " command in whatever application you 're using .
When you " save a file , " what you 're really doing is syncing different storage pools , all of which are hidden from you by the abstraction that is the " disk drive . "
So what I 'm proposing is that we hide all of the separate " disk drives " in an average home behind an even larger abstraction : " the cloud . "
And then we let software do what it 's good at , i.e. , managing the read and write operations among the various storage pools so that instead of " syncing files " you merely " save changes , " and those changes that you 've saved appear everywhere on your network .
Steve , Bill , Linus ... any takers ?
The world is waiting for someone to build this mousetrap .
Or , at least , I am .

A pilot showing off to a young boy in his cockpit ended up almost crashing the airliner , it was claimed yesterday
Passengers said the pilot deliberately rocked the jet from side to side as he showed the child how the controls worked .
Moments later , however , he was forced to throw the Air France plane into a steep climb to get out of the way of another aircraft .
Scroll down for more ...
Terrifying : Air France has launched an investigation after passengers claim their pilot was ' showing off ' in front of a child and then had to dodge another jet
Witnesses said terrified passengers blessed themselves and said prayers aloud as the plane soared 10,000ft .
Air France has launched an investigation into both the boy 's cabin visit and the apparent near miss which followed .
The drama happened on an Airbus A320 which was carrying 143 passengers to Paris from Manchester on Saturday morning .
Passenger Shaun Robinson , 40 , boss of travel website www.holidayinsider.com, from Rossendale , Lancashire , said the pilot had ' clearly been showing off ' to the boy , who was about 13 .
" I was horrified by what I saw , " he said .
" The pilot made a sharp turn to the left , without warning , and then back again , obviously showing the young French boy how he flew his plane .
" I could see the boy .
He shook hands with the pilots .
" He gave us the impression he knew the cabin crew and the people on the flight deck .
We assumed he was something to do with the pilot .
He had a big smile on his face when he came out and the steward ruffled his hair and took him back to his seat . "
Horrified : Passenger Shaun Robinson
Moments later , however , there was an emergency as passengers said they heard alarm noises coming from the cockpit .
Mr Robinson said : " The pilot threw his plane into a steep climb .
The two crew members sitting in front of me had terror written across their faces and were gripping their chairs .
" When it was all over , the pilot said we had climbed 10,000ft .
" He said air traffic control had come on the radio and said ' climb , climb , climb 10,000 ft , you are going to hit a plane ' .
It was terrifying .
People were blessing themselves .
Clearly something happened .
Perhaps the pilot lost concentration and took his eye off the ball . "
The plane landed safely at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport about 20 minutes late .
Mr Robinson , who has made a complaint to Air France , added : " The young boy should n't have been allowed into the cockpit in the first place .
It was reckless . "
Another passenger , from Manchester , who declined to be named , said : " They took the kid in there and they 're not supposed to since 9/11 .
It was a shock to see that first of all .
" Within a minute there was the first swerve .
It swerved to the left and then it corrected .
" Within a couple of minutes of the kid leaving the cockpit , the pilot said he was coming in to land .
" Suddenly the engines started revving and we shot back up into the air .
" The pilot was putting people 's lives at risk . "
A spokesman for Air France said it was taking the allegations ' extremely seriously ' and was investigating .
Visits to the cockpit are banned in the UK .
" I can't imagine it would be any different in France , " said a Transport Department official .
The CEOs of the country 's largest oil companies , testifying before Congress , reject claims that they 're responsible for sky - high oil prices .
Big oil companies are pushing prices up to boost their profits , which have soared to record levels in recent years .
Top industry executives recently got hauled before Congress , where legislators pressed them for an explanation for rising gasoline prices - and outsize executive pay at companies like Exxon , which earlier this year posted a $ 40 billion profit for 2007 .
Executives acknowledge that company profits are high , but argue that their share of the global oil market is small .
Exxon , the biggest U.S. oil company , ranks 14th in the world in terms of oil reserves .
The companies also note that refining margins - reflecting the business of turning crude into gasoline - have dropped sharply over the past year .
Exxon said that even with the price of gas hovering around $ 4 recently , the tight margins mean the company 's refining profit is only a dime a gallon .
Perhaps that 's why Exxon shares , after doubling between 2005 and 2007 , have actually lost ground this year .

Our party was winding down , most had left , and the birthday girl was getting tired .
You all burst in , full of energy and liquor and noise .
For reasons I still do n't totally understand , you were tearing up a porn magazine , and sticking bits of it onto the walls while your drinks were ordered .
You sat at the table next to us , giggling and shrieking and generally being obnoxious , which was fine for a Friday night at Dr Bombay 's ( a night like any other Friday night at Dr. Bombay 's ) .
Until I saw it .
A tube , made up of a page or two of the remains of the porn mag , the only whole pages left , as best I can tell , besides the close - up - shaved - beaver montage that the cute blonde girl had pinned to her chest ; a tube , with tiny animal feet sticking out of one end .
I leaned over to your table , " What 's that ?
" One of you unrolled the tube , revealing the remains of the poor creature , a small , dead gopher , wrapped in porn , and somehow turned into the mascot of your Friday night at Dr. Bombay 's ( you know the drill ) .
What was the meaning ?
Why had you decided to bring your cat 's fresh kill out drinking ?
Was there something deeper going on that I simply did n't understand in my end - of - evening haze ?
Did I miss that it was ' Bring Your Own Dead Rodent ' night ?
All of these questions were churning around in my head in a kind of inchoate muddle , when the rest of my party , mumbling things about how late it was getting , and whether we could all fit in a cab , and should n't someone call the health department , bundled me up and we all wandered out the door .
My last glance back at your table left me with two impressions -- the really drunk girl with the crotch photos pinned to her chest was , in fact , pretty cute , and the guy across the table from her was , in fact , swinging by the tail , a dead gopher , wrapped in porn .
The type of man who makes a woman ’s heart flutter has a lot to do with whether she was a daddy ’s girl , according to a new study .
Women who got along well with their dads as kids are attracted to men who resemble their fathers , whereas women who had a bad father - daughter relationship do not .
Lynda Boothroyd , a psychologist at Durham University in England , and her colleagues at the University of Wroclaw and the Institute of Anthropology in Poland asked a trained anthropologist to perform facial measurements on the photographs of 15 random men as well as the photographs of the fathers of 49 Polish women participating in the study .
The anthropologist calculated 15 key proportions based on how various features — such as the lips , nose , cheekbones and brows — related to each face ’s height and width .
The researchers also compared the 15 random faces to each of the father ’s faces to determine how closely they resembled one another .
The women then rated their childhood relationships with their fathers based on how emotionally invested they felt their dads had been in raising them and how much time their fathers had spent with them .
The women were split into two groups based on how positively or negatively they rated their relationships .
Then the researchers asked the women to rate how attractive they found each of the 15 random male faces .
The women who had reported positive relationships with their fathers were much more likely to be attracted to men resembling their fathers , the researchers found .
On the other hand , women with bad dad relationships did not find men who looked like their fathers appealing .
“ While previous research has suggested this to be the case , these controlled results show for certain that the quality of a daughter ’s relationship with her father has an impact on whom she finds attractive , ” Boothroyd said in a prepared statement .
“ It shows our human brains do n't simply build prototypes of the ideal face based on those we see around us , rather they build them based on those to whom we have a strongly positive relationship . ”
Although no one yet knows for sure why females show these preferences , a woman with a great dad may choose a similar - looking mate in the hopes that he will also be a good father , the researchers wrote .

In other words , if you thought equities were a scam before , you have n’t seen anything yet .
Via : New York Times :
The Treasury Department will propose on Monday that Congress give the Federal Reserve broad authority to oversee financial market stability , in effect allowing it to send SWAT teams into any corner of the industry or any institution that might pose a risk to the overall system .
The proposal is part of a sweeping blueprint to overhaul the country ’s hodge - podge of regulatory agencies , which many specialists say failed to recognize rampant excesses in mortgage lending until after they triggered what is now the worst financial calamity in decades .
According to a summary provided by the administration , the plan would consolidate what is now an alphabet soup of banking and securities regulators into a trio of overseers responsible for everything from banks and brokerage firms to hedge funds and private equity firms .
While the plan could expose Wall Street investment banks and hedge funds to greater scrutiny , it avoids a call for tighter regulation .
The plan would not rein in practices that have been implicated in the housing and mortgage meltdown , like packaging risky subprime loans into securities carrying AAA ratings .
The Fed would also be given some authority over Wall Street firms but only when an investment bank ’s practices posed a threat to the financial system over all .
The plan does not recommend tighter rules over the vast and largely unregulated markets for risk - sharing and hedging , like credit - default swaps , which are supposed to insure lenders against loss but became a speculative instrument and gave many institutions a false sense of security .
Some changes could actually reduce the power of the Securities and Exchange Commission , which is charged with maintaining orderly stock and bond markets and protecting investors .
The blueprint suggests several areas where the S.E.C. should take a lighter approach to its oversight , such as allowing stock exchanges greater leeway to regulate themselves and streamlining the approval of new products , even allowing automatic approval of securities products that are being traded in foreign markets .
Under the proposal , the S.E.C. would merge with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which regulates exchange - traded futures for oil , grains , currencies and the like .
…
Under the Treasury proposal , the Federal Reserve would become the government ’s “ market stability regulator ” and would be allowed to gather information from virtually any financial institution .
Fed officials would be allowed to examine the practices and even the bookkeeping of brokerage firms , hedge funds , commodity - trading exchanges and any other institution that might pose a risk to the financial system .
“ The Fed would have the authority to go wherever in the system it thinks it needs to go for a deeper look to preserve stability , ” Mr. Paulson said in the advance text of Monday ’s speech .
“ To do this effectively , it will collect information from commercial banks , investment banks , insurance companies , hedge funds , commodity pool operators . ”
That would be a significant expansion of the central bank ’s regulatory mission , which has been limited primarily to supervising commercial banks .
When Fed officials agreed earlier this month to rescue Bear Stearns , once the nation ’s fifth - largest investment bank , they pointedly noted that the Fed never had the authority to monitor its financial condition or order it to beef up its protections .
In an unprecedented pair of moves , the Fed engineered a shotgun marriage between Bear Stearns and a rival , JPMorgan Chase , and then lent $ 29 billion to JP Morgan in order to prevent a bankruptcy filing by Bear and a chain of defaults that might have brought down much of the financial system .
For the first time since the 1930s , the Fed also agreed to let investment banks borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from its discount window , an emergency program reserved for commercial banks and other depository institutions .
Looking at new computational methods for tomography — a technique used by medical scanners to create 3D images — University of Antwerp researchers have built a budget supercomputer using four Nvidia 9800 GX2 graphics cards ( a total of eight GPUs with 1,024 stream processors ) as its super - calculating soul , which " perform as fast as 350 modern CPU cores .

This kind of setup works really well for tomography because the number - crunching can be done in parallel and is highly vectorized — the same kind of stuff the medical community and Air Force were eye - balling the PS3 for , since the Cell uses a similar kind of architecture .

On the other hand , it would n't be so great for more general computing stuffs that can't be crunched in parallel ( multiple processors working at once ) .
Either way , watch the video , gigaflops to terabytes , it 's the nerdiest thing you 'll see this week .

A woman ’s voice becomes more attractive when she is most fertile .
That ’s according to Nathan Pipitone and Gordon Gallup of the State University of New York at Albany .
The pair recorded women counting from 1 to 10 at four occasions during their menstrual cycle .
They then replayed the recordings at random to male and female students and asked them to rate the attractiveness of the voices .
Both males and females judged the women ’s voices to be most attractive if they were recorded during the peak fertility period of the menstrual cycle , and less attractive if they were recorded during non-fertile …
Dutch ecologist Roxina Soler and her colleagues have discovered that subterranean and aboveground herbivorous insects can communicate with each other by using plants as telephones .
Subterranean insects issue chemical warning signals via the leaves of the plant .
This way , aboveground insects are alerted that the plant is already ‘ occupied ’ .
Aboveground , leaf - eating insects prefer plants that have not yet been occupied by subterranean root - eating insects .
Subterranean insects emit chemical signals via the leaves of the plant , which warn the aboveground insects about their presence .
This messaging enables spatially - separated insects to avoid each other , so that they do not unintentionally compete for the same plant .
In recent years it has been discovered that different types of aboveground insects develop slowly if they feed on plants that also have subterranean residents and vice versa .
It seems that a mechanism has developed via natural selection , which enables the subterranean and aboveground insects to detect each other .
This avoids unnecessary competition .
Green telephone lines
Via the ' green telephone lines ' , subterranean insects can also communicate with a third party , namely the natural enemy of caterpillars .
Parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside aboveground insects .
The wasps also benefit from the volatile signals emitted by the leaves , as these reveal where they can find a good host for their eggs .
The communication between subterranean and aboveground insects has only been studied in a few systems .
It is still not clear how widespread this phenomenon is .
This research was carried out at the Netherlands Institute for Ecology ( NIOO - KNAW ) by Roxina Soler , Jeffrey Harvey , Martijn Bezemer , Wim van der Putten and Louise Vet .
The PhD project , in which this study was carried out , was funded by the Free Competition of NWO Earth and Life Sciences .
Hydroxyl is made up of a hydrogen and oxygen atom each .
It has been found on another planet for the first time - in the upper reaches of the atmosphere of Venus , some 100 km above the surface - by Venus Express ’s Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer , VIRTIS .
It is thought to be important for any planet ’s atmosphere because it is highly reactive .
On Earth it has a key role in purging pollutants from the atmosphere .
The OH “ radical ” is a very special and reactive molecule , which is unusual in conventional chemistry because of its reactivity .
This detection gives scientists an important new tool to unlock the workings of Venus ’s dense atmosphere .
The elusive molecule was detected by turning the spacecraft away from the planet and looking along the faintly visible layer of atmosphere surrounding the planet ’s disc .
The instrument detected the hydroxyl molecules by measuring the amount of infrared light that they give off .

Just like the Earth , the atmosphere of Venus emits a very weak light caused by various processes occurring in the upper atmosphere .
On Earth , this weak emission of light , known as airglow , was discovered in 1868 .
It is also referred to as nightglow because it can only be seen during the night .
In the daytime , it is hidden by the much stronger light because of sunlight scattering .
Observing atmospheric airglow is a major tool for inferring the composition and chemistry of the upper atmospheres of planets .
For example , in Earth 's atmosphere , the airglow from the OH radical , which was detected in 1948 , was later found to play an important role in purging the atmosphere of pollutants harmful to the biosphere .
Theoretical studies show that the hydroxyl airglow also plays an important role in the chemistry of Mars ' atmosphere , but it has not yet been detected .
On Venus , airglow emissions have already been observed coming from nitrogen monoxide ( NO ) and oxygen dioxide ( O2 ) .
The VIRTIS team now reports measurements of four airglow emission lines : two from OH at 1.44 and 2.80 microns and two from O2 at 1.27 and 1.58 microns .
The band of atmosphere in which the glowing hydroxyl molecules are located is very narrow ; it is only about 10 km wide .
By looking at the limb of the planet , Venus Express looked along this faint atmospheric layer , increasing the signal strength by about 50 .
The reactive molecule has been seen around comets , but the method of production there is thought to be completely different from the way it forms in planetary atmospheres .
“ Because the venusian atmosphere had not been studied extensively before Venus Express arrived on the scene , we have not been able to confirm much of what our models tell us by observing what is actually happening .
This detection will help us refine our models and learn much more , ” says one of the Principal Investigators of the VIRTIS experiment , Giuseppe Piccioni , from the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica in Rome , Italy .
On Earth , the glow of hydroxyl in the atmosphere has been shown to be closely linked to the abundance of ozone .
From this study , the same is thought to be true at Venus .
Now , scientists can set about estimating the amount of ozone in the planet ’s atmosphere .
Venus Express has shown that the amount of hydroxyl at Venus is highly variable .
It can change by 50 % from one orbit to the next and this may be caused by differing amounts of ozone in the atmosphere .
“ Ozone is an important molecule for any atmosphere , because it is a strong absorber of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun , ” says Piccioni .
The amount of the radiation absorbed is a key parameter driving the heating and dynamics of a planet ’s atmosphere .
On Earth , it heats the stratosphere ( layer of the atmosphere ) making it stable and protecting the biosphere from harmful ultraviolet rays .
Computer models will now be able to tell how this jump and drop in ozone levels over short intervals affects the restless atmosphere of that world .
“ Venus Express has already shown us that Venus is much more Earth - like than once thought .
The detection of hydroxyl brings it a step closer , ” says Piccioni .
He and his colleagues are only reporting the initial detection from a few orbits in their latest paper .
They are working on the analysis of data from about 50 other orbits and more observations will follow .
THE cheques are in the post .
Last month , the US government began mailing tax rebates to over 130 million households .
The payments , many worth hundreds of dollars , are designed to get consumers spending and breathe new life into the country ’s stagnating economy .
But the plan is unlikely to have much impact , according to two economists .
Their research suggests that people are much more likely to spend such rebates if they are divided into monthly payments rather than given as a lump sum .
To test the effectiveness of the government ’s “ economic stimulus payments ” , Valrie Chambers and Marilyn Spencer at Texas A&M …

( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain Thursday admitted his idea of a gas tax " holiday " would not solve the problem of rising oil prices but said it would give low - income Americans " just a little break this summer . "
Sen .
John McCain appears at a town hall meeting in Allentown , Pennsylvania , Wednesday .
" That 's all this is about , " the presumptive GOP nominee told CNN .
" This is not the end of western civilization .
This does not solve our dependence on foreign oil .
It gives low - income Americans -- who drive further with older automobiles and are bearing the brunt of this -- a little bit of a break for the summer . "
McCain , as well as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton , has called for a hiatus in the 18.4 cent - a - gallon federal gas tax between Memorial Day and Labor Day -- a period when vacationing Americans spend the most time on the road .
However , critics of the idea -- including Clinton 's rival for the Democratic nomination , Sen. Barack Obama -- argue that a gas tax holiday would have limited impact on drivers ' pocketbooks .
Assuming the average gas tank holds 13 gallons , removing the gas tax would save drivers about $ 2.35 every time they filled their tanks , or , as Obama estimates , about $ 30 over the summer .

A summer suspension of the gas tax would leave a funding gap of about $ 10 billion in the fund used to pay for federal highway construction , critics note .
But McCain argues the holiday would mean that drivers would " have a little money left over , maybe to buy a better meal , maybe to buy something for their kids . "
" Maybe that is what this is all about , " he said .

In an interview with CNN , McCain also defended his proposal to offer families $ 5,000 in tax credits to help buy health insurance , saying it would not undermine the current system of employee - based health insurance , as Clinton has charged .
" I want to give the people a choice as to who they want to keep : their employer plan or go out with their $ 5,000 tax credit and go across state lines and around this country and get the insurance policy of their choice , " McCain said .
" Which ever they want to , it is based on choice . "

Experts have questioned whether the tax credit would help the roughly 47 million who are currently uninsured because the $ 5,000 is unlikely to cover the entire costs of a policy .
The Kaiser Family Foundation says averages about $ 12,000 a year for a family of four .
But McCain said allowing more individuals to buy their own insurance would increase competition and lower costs and the tax credit is better than what is currently available .
" The $ 5,000 tax credit you are talking about will go to families right now who do n't have any [ insurance ] , " McCain said .

A bill under consideration in Congress to bail out homeowners affected by the mortgage crisis enjoys strong bipartisan support , despite a recent White House veto threat .
But the free - market advocacy group FreedomWorks is drawing attention to a provision introduced on the Senate side that has little to do with housing loans : a measure that would require credit card companies and electronic payment processors , such as PayPal , to file aggregate transaction reports with the IRS listing their total annual payments to individual merchants who receive more than $ 10,000 and conduct more than 200 transactions each year .
The reporting provision was introduced without debate as a revenue offset measure , meant to defray the costs of the housing bailout .
According to the Senate 's summary , the measure is projected to raise some $ 9.8 billion in revenue over 10 years by increasing tax compliance and encouraging merchants to accurately report their income .
During hearings earlier this year before the House Small Business Committee , however , Committee Chair Nydia Velásquez complained that such reporting requirements create " significant technical and financial challenges for banks and entrepreneurs alike . "
Projections of tax compliance gains , she said , were " built on the incorrect premise that electronic payments foreshadow profits .
The reality is quite different for most small businesses : Electronic transactions bear little relationship to actual income , especially when chargebacks , merchant discounts , and other fees are accounted for .
The result is that even careful compliance by entrepreneurs could lead to costly IRS audits . "
Representatives for small business associations opposed to the requirements observed , for instance , that many businesses took deposits via credit card that did not constitute true income .
Some also worried that the IRS would use the data to target to audit businesses that accepted an unusual number of electronic or credit card transfers for their industry .
Privacy groups harbor their own objections .
David Sohn of the Center for Democracy and Technology testified that the reporting requirements would force transaction middlemen to retain information like tax ID numbers — which in the case of many small businesses will simply be the owner 's Social Security Number — that the firms otherwise would discard .
He also warned that an aggregate reporting requirement could easily transform into a demand for more detailed data .
The bill is expected to be kicked back to the House for a straight up - or - down vote sometime next week .
That , according to CDT 's Ari Schwartz , is " bad process , " as it means the reporting measure is unlikely to be subject to much close consideration .
The popular housing relief bill is expected to pass by a wide margin , despite the president 's veto threat .
" If you 're going to add something like this ,
says Schwartz , " at least have some independent discussion on the floor . "
PALO ALTO , Calif . 
Like a good gambler , Daphne Koller , a researcher at Stanford whose work has led to advances in artificial intelligence , sees the world as a web of probabilities .
There is , however , nothing uncertain about her impact .
A mathematical theoretician , she has made contributions in areas like robotics and biology .
Her biggest accomplishment  and at age 39 , she is expected to make more  is creating a set of computational tools for artificial intelligence that can be used by scientists and engineers to do things like predict traffic jams , improve machine vision and understand the way cancer spreads .
Ms. Koller ’s work , building on an 18th - century theorem about probability , has already had an important commercial impact , and her colleagues say that will grow in the coming decade .
Her techniques have been used to improve computer vision systems and in understanding natural language , and in the future they are expected to lead to an improved generation of Web search .
“ She ’s on the bleeding edge of the leading edge , ” said Gary Bradski , a machine vision researcher at Willow Garage , a robotics start - up firm in Menlo Park , Calif .
The southern half of this swath of grasslands and chiseled pink spires looks untouched from a distance .
Closer up , the scars of history are easy to see .
Unexploded bombs lie in ravines , a reminder of when the military confiscated the land from the Oglala Sioux tribe during World War II and turned it into an artillery range .
Poachers who have stolen thousands of fossils over the years have left gouges in the landscape .
On a plateau , a solitary makeshift hut sits ringed by empty Coke cans and shaving cream canisters .
It is the only remnant of a three - year occupation by militant tribal activists who had demanded that the land be returned .
Now the National Park Service is contemplating doing just that : giving the 133,000 - acre southern half of Badlands National Park back to the tribe .
The northern half , which has a paved road and a visitor center , would remain with the park system .
The park service has dissolved 23 parks and historic sites since 1930 , but none has been returned to tribes .
“ It ’s really exciting for us to think about walking down this road , ” said Sandra J. Washington , head of planning for the service ’s Omaha office , which oversees Badlands .
“ The intention is to be as honorable as possible . ”

The change would require congressional approval and the process is in its earliest stages , with officials still to decide whether the south section should be handed over solely to the tribal government , become a separate park run by the tribe with help from the park service , or left as is .
Tribal members seem torn .
Some say they should be able to build homes there .
Others push for a pristine nature preserve .
Still others want more development to draw tourists to the massive fossils that remain .
The park service recently held several forums on the reservation and elsewhere in the region to gauge public support for these options .
At a forum at Crazy Horse School in Wanblee , S.D. , William La Mont , 44 , was one of several who argued that the tribe would still need the service ’s help .
“ The tribe ’s not ready , ” he said .
“ The tribe ’s in the red . ”
Keith Janis , 48 , one of the activists who staged the 2000 occupation , believes the land should be returned to its original owners or their descendants to do with as they please .

“ That ’s not respecting the rights of the people who have nothing , ” Janis said of the proposal that the land remain a park .
“ The whole national park system is environmental racism against the Indian people of this country . ”
Many of the most renowned national parks -- Yellowstone , Glacier , Grand Canyon -- were formed after the federal government forced tribes from the land .
“ The national park is a sort of wonderful ideal , but it ’s an ideal that was created , ” said Karl Jacoby , a professor at Brown University who studies Western history .
“ There were n’t empty wilderness areas in the United States .
They had to be created by the removal of Indians . ”
The confiscation of the land that is now the south end of Badlands National Park is fresher in locals ’ memories .
In 1942 , the military gave more than 800 people a week to move out .

Anita Ecoffey , 65 , remembers her father describing what it was like to flee from his home taking only what he could carry , leaving the land where he had buried his parents .
“ To me this is worse than what happened at Wounded Knee , ” said Ecoffey , recalling the infamous 1890 massacre of Sioux by the U.S. Army .
“ These were people ’s homes . ”
Legally , the land remained tribal property .
But the government continued to oversee it after the war .
Control of it was handed to the National Park Service and the area was incorporated into Badlands National Monument , which became a national park in 1978 .

Under an agreement signed in 1976 , the park service operates the south unit jointly with Oglala Sioux park officials .
But the tribe has complained that the service has never lived up to many of its promises .
The government said it would build a cultural / visitor center to draw tourists to the southern half of the park , about 40 miles southeast of Rapid City .
Instead , the only visitor center in the south is a converted trailer along an isolated stretch of blacktop .
Until recently , Oglala Sioux rangers complained that the park service barely gave them any support , making it impossible to patrol the area and giving fossil poachers free rein .
“ Everybody just takes advantage of it , ” said Birgil Kills Straight , executive director of the Oglala Sioux Parks and Recreation Authority .

Relations have improved since Paige Baker , a Mandan / Hidatsa Indian raised in North Dakota , became superintendent of Badlands National Park in 2006 .
Baker stocked the park gift shop with books on Indian history and argued for a change in the southern section ’s status .
Top Interior Department officials in Washington have agreed to abide by his recommendations , he said .
The park service “ has got to listen to tribes , ” Baker said .
“ We have not done that as well as we should . ”
On the 30,000 - member Pine Ridge Reservation , a patchwork of tiny towns and ranches centered in the nation ’s second - poorest county , tribal members are n’t accustomed to trusting the federal government .
But they say they believe the talk of the park ’s return is legitimate .
At the Wanblee forum , Marie Randall , 88 , pointed proudly at the photos of the south unit on a bilingual flier the park service was handing out .
“ This is our foundation , this is our life , ” she said .
“ As long as we have this , the Indian will never end . ”

Washington , of the park service ’s Omaha office , said that the south section of Badlands is one of two national parks where the land is owned by a tribe and operated jointly with that tribe .
The other is Canyon de Chelly National Park in Arizona , on Navajo land .
Other parklands were taken from tribes long ago and their acreage is not currently owned by tribes .
It ’s unlikely the park service would take similar steps with those parks .
Park service officials say they were already contemplating the hand - over before the 2000 occupation .
A handful of tribal members took over a high tableland known as the Stronghold , believed to be the spot where the Sioux made their last stand against the U.S. military after fleeing from Wounded Knee .
Janis said he believed it was the aggressive stance during the occupation that pushed the park service to propose giving back the land .
He said the terrain would be more protected that way .
“ The people took better care of it when it was theirs , ” he said .
“ Even the fossils were respected . ”
Some environmental groups are enthusiastic about the proposal .
Jonathan Proctor , Southern Rockies / Great Plains representative for Defenders of Wildlife , said the Oglala Sioux had been better environmental stewards than many states .
Pine Ridge has already helped restore declining populations of long - tailed fox and black - footed ferrets .

“ The tribes do n’t get enough respect for what they do for wildlife , ” Proctor said .
“ It ’s not our land ; it belongs to the Oglala Sioux .
Who are we to tell them what to do with their land ? ”

Bartlett jackpot winner arrested trying to collect prize at Elgin casino
A Bartlett woman hit the jackpot Sunday night at the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin , only to be sent to jail when she tried to collect her winnings .
Christina K. Franquia , 51 , of 907 Shorewood Drive was charged in court Monday with two counts of unlawful possession of fraudulent identification cards , according to a report .
Police said when they arrived at the Elgin casino Sunday evening , an 83 - year - old Bartlett man was trying to collect the winnings , but from her actions it was apparent that Franquia was the winner .
When police asked her for her identification , Franquia gave them a resident alien card and a Social Security card , police said .
A check by police showed both cards were fake .
Franquia told police that a man named " Amigo " approached her several years ago in a Hanover Park supermarket , took her photo and made the two cards for her for free .
Neither police nor officials at the casino would release the amount Franquia won , but police said that even if the two identification cards were legal , she would n't have been able to collect the money from the casino because she placed herself on the casino 's " banned " list .
If you place yourself on the banned list and win at the casino , your winnings will go to a charity , according to gaming officials .
Franquia spoke through a Tagalog interpreter in court Monday and was informed that if she pleads guilty or is found guilty of the charges , she could be deported to the Philippines , since she is not a U.S. citizen .
Franquia posted a $ 1,500 bond Monday and was released from custody with a June 26 court date at the Kane County Judicial Center .
Clinton aide compares Obama to Ken Starr
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson , taking the campaign a bit meta on a conference call today , attacked Obama for attacking Clinton , and compared him to a notorious Clinton foe .
" When Sen . Obama was confronted with questions over whether he was ready to be commander in chief and steward of the economy , he chose not to address those questions , but to attack Sen. Clinton , " Wolfson said .
" I for one do not believe that imitating Ken Starr is the way to win a Democratic primary election for president . "
Wolfson was attacking Obama 's explicit strategy , in the wake of his March 4 losses , to attack elements of Clinton 's record on the grounds of secrecy , and to revisit the questions raised by Clinton foes in the 1990s and earlier .
Obama has demanded Clinton 's tax returns , cited delays in releasing her White House schedules , and even made reference to trades in cattle futures in the late 1970s that became a subject of allegations during the White House years .
Wolfson also responded to the substance of Obama 's complaint , that Clinton has n't released her recent tax returns , and to the reminder today that Clinton ( via Wolfson ) attacked her 2000 Senate rival , Rick Lazio , for failing to release his tax returns .
" Over 20 years of the Clintons ' tax returns are part of the public record , " he said , referring to their White House years and also to her more recent Senate disclosure forms .
" Everyone knows we have made clear that all of the post - White House tax returns will be put out by the campaign on or about tax time — April 15 , " he said , though he did n't explain why they would n't be out sooner .
" As somebody who led the effort to ensure that Mr. Lazio provided his tax returns , certainly at that point he had not provided 20 years of his tax returns to the people of New York , " he said .
He also promised the tax returns would be out before the April 22 Pennsylvania primary .
UPDATE : Obama spokesman Bill Burton responds :
It is absurd that after weeks of badgering the media to " vet " Sen .
Obama , the Clinton campaign believes that they should be held to an entirely different standard .
We do n’t believe that expecting candidates for the presidency to disclose their tax returns somehow constitutes Ken Starr tactics , but the kind of transparency and accountability that Americans are looking for and that ’s been missing in Washington for far too long .
And if Sen.
Clinton does n’t think that the Republicans will ask these very same questions , then she ’s not as ready to go toe to toe with John McCain as she claims .
The May 8 letter from U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr. , D - Mich. , chair of the House Judiciary Committee , to George W. Bush received virtually no media coverage , in spite of the fact that it warned the president that an attack on Iran without Congressional approval would be grounds for impeachment .
Rumor has it several senators have been briefed about the possibility of war with Iran .
Something is afoot .
Just what is not clear , but over the past several months , several moves by the White House strongly suggest that the Bush administration will attack Iran sometime in the near future .
According to the Asia Times , " a former assistant secretary of state still active in the foreign affairs community " said an air attack will target the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Quds Force garrisons .
Not even the White House is bonkers enough to put troops on the ground amid 65 million Iranians .
There is a certain disconnect to all this , particularly given December 's National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) concluding that Iran had abandoned its program to build a nuclear weapon .
The NIE is the consensus view of all 16 U.S. intelligence services .
At the time , the report seemed to shelve any possibility of war with Iran .
However , shortly after the intelligence estimate on Iran was released , the old " into Iraq gang " went to work undermining it .
According to Newsweek , during his Middle East tour in January , Bush " all but disowned the document " to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
A " senior administration official " told the magazine , " He [ Bush ] told the Israelis that he can't control what the intelligence community says but that [ the NIE 's ] conclusions do n't reflect his own views . "
Neither do they reflect the views of Vice President Dick Cheney or Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
In an interview with ABC during his recent 10 - day visit to the region , Cheney downplayed the NIE : " We do n't know whether or not they 've [ the Iranians have ] restarted . "
Cheney also said Iran was seeking to build missiles capable of reaching the United States sometime in the next decade .
On April 21 , Gates said that Iran was " hell - bent " on acquiring nuclear weapons , and that , while he was not advocating war with Iran , the military option should be kept on the table .
A month before Gates ' comment , the White House quietly extended an executive order stating that Iran represented an " ongoing threat " to U.S. national security .
The Bush administration claims that the 2002 resolution that led to the war in Iraq gives it the right to strike at " terrorists " wherever they are .
Last September , the Kyl - Lieberman Sense of the Senate resolution designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a " terrorist organization . "
The administration has sharply increased its rhetorical attacks on Iran in a way that is disquietingly similar to the campaign that led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Take the current charge that the Quds Force is arming anti-American groups in Iraq and providing them with high - tech roadside bombs and sophisticated rockets .
Gen. David Petraeus , the new head of U.S. Central Command , told the Senate Committee on Armed Services that " special groups " are " funded , trained , armed and directed by Iran 's Quds Force . …
It was these groups that launched Iranian rockets and mortar rounds at Iraq 's seat of government " in the Green Zone .
Patraeus replaced Adm. William " Fox " Fallon , who had openly opposed a military confrontation with Iran .
But the United States has never presented any evidence to back up those charges .
U.S. officials say the rockets pounding the Green Zone have Iranian markings on them , but they have yet to show any evidence to that effect .
And , as for the special roadside bombs , or the explosively formed penetrators ( EFP ) , the evidence is entirely deductive .
The United States argues that the copper cores used in these bombs requires using a heavy machine press and that Iraq has no such presses .
But before the invasion , Iraq was the most industrialized Arab country , with a sophisticated machine tool industry , and a study by Time magazine says the cities of Basra , Karbala and Najaf " may indeed have such presses . "
The Time article , " Doubting the Evidence Against Iran , " concludes , " No concrete evidence has emerged in public that Iran was behind the weapons [ EFPs ] .
U.S. officials have revealed no captured shipments of such devices and offered no other proof . "
The lack of evidence has hardly cooled down the rhetoric .
Bush said in a speech at the White House that " two of the greatest threats to America " were Iran and al - Qaeda .
U.S. preparations for war , however , have been more than rhetorical .
According to the Israeli website DEBKAfile , Cheney 's trip to the Middle East in March was seen in the region as a possible harbinger of war .
" The vice president 's choice of capitals for his tour is a pointer to the fact that the military option , off since December , may be on again , " DEBKA concluded .
" America will need the cooperation of all four [ countries he visited ] -- Oman , Saudi Arabia , Israel and Turkey . "
There has also been a steady buildup of naval and air power in the region .
A new aircraft carrier battle group has been assigned to the area , Patriot anti-missile missiles have been deployed , and U.S. Naval forces in the Eastern Mediterranean have been beefed up .
What would likely happen if the United States did elect to attack ?
Militarily , there is little Tehran could do in response .
Iran 's army is smaller than it was during the Iran - Iraq war , and in a recent " show of force , " its air force mustered a total of 140 out - of - date fighters .
It navy is mostly small craft , and while it has anti-ship missiles , Tehran would probably think twice about trying to shut down the Gulf .
The current regime depends on the sale of oil and gas to shore up its fragile economy .
While the White House portrays the militias in Iraq and Hezbollah as Tehran 's cat 's - paw , that is nonsense .
The militias in both countries will act on the basis of what is in their own interests , not Iran's .
There is talk that Iran might target Israel , but the Israelis have made it clear that any such attack would be met with a massive retaliation , probably nuclear .
" An Iranian attack will prompt a severe reaction from Israel , " National Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer warned , " which would destroy the Iranian nation . "
In any case , it is far more likely that Israel would attack Iran than vice versa .
Any U.S. attack would further isolate the United States in the Middle East .
Ethan Chorin , of the conservative Center for Strategic and International Studies , says U.S. threats against Iran are running cross-current to efforts by other nations in the Gulf region to establish a détente with Tehran .
" The U.S. seeks to defend the Arabs from Iran , but they are increasingly trying to defend themselves from the U.S. efforts to defend them against Iran , " he wrote in a recent commentary in the Financial Times .
All the war talk , says Chorin , " is translating into increasing open sympathy on the part of many Gulf Arabs for Iran and increasing skepticism about U.S. efforts to isolate the country . "
A U.S. war would deeply divide Europe as well , and might lead to a German withdrawal from Afghanistan .
What Russia's , China 's and India 's responses would be is not clear .
China and India are major clients for Iranian natural gas .
Domestically , the Bush administration may see this as its only opportunity to hold on to the White House .
The Republicans know they are going to lose seats in the House and the Senate , but at this point the race for the presidency is still tight .
Might a new war against the demonized Iranians make voters stick with " war hero " John McCain ?
It 's a long shot , but this administration has always had a major streak of riverboat gambler about it .
All this talk of war , of course , could be sound and fury signifying nothing .
But it might also be the run-up to a limited conflict , maybe one set off by a manufactured incident .
Once unleashed , however , no one controls the dogs of war .
As hard as it is to imagine , war with Iran might top the Iraq War as a foreign policy disaster .
Advertising blogs churn out some of the Web ’s more scathing , and personal , vitriol .
Last week , the bloggers absorbed some body blows of their own .
Visitors to AgencySpy and AdScam , two sharp - tongued blogs written by advertising industry insiders , posted comments blaming the sites for contributing to the suicide late last month of Paul Tilley , 40 , the creative director of DDB Chicago .
In so doing , bloggers and their readers added another chapter in a long debate about how , or whether , to manage anonymous posts that seem aimed at shredding a person ’s reputation .
“ We ’re certainly used to criticism in the agency business , ” said Nina DiSesa , chairwoman of McCann Erickson Worldwide ’s New York division , who posted comments on AgencySpy.com in defense of Mr. Tilley , whom she called a friend .
“ But when blogs attack someone personally , without justification , and they do it anonymously , it ’s just wrong . ”

Economics is not rocket science .
Neither is power .
Depressions are monetary phenomena caused by central bank issuance of excessive credit .
In 1913 , the newly created US central bank , the Federal Reserve , began issuing credit - based money in the US .
Within ten years , the central bank flow of credit ignited the 1920s US stock market bubble ; and shortly thereafter , following the collapse of the bubble in 1929 , the world entered its first Great Depression in 1933 .
Investment banks are the undoing of central banking .
While all banks , central , commercial and investment , view credit as the opportunity to exploit society�s growth and productivity , investment bank exploitation of growth and productivity exposes society to extreme risks �for investment banks use society�s savings to make their volatile and speculative bets .
The speculative risks undertaken by investment banks is done by leveraging the savings of society ; and , when investment bank bets are sufficiently large enough and the bets go bad �as they inevitably do as the luck of investment bankers is due more to their proximity to credit than to their ability to foresee the future �it is society that will bear the brunt of the pain in the loss of its savings .
Inevitably , investment bankers cannot resist the temptations of excessive credit and , like the buyers of teaser - rate home mortgages , they will always overreach themselves �an overreaching that will have disastrous consequences for the society whose savings they bet .
The leveraged overreaching by investment banks in the 1920s caused the Great Depression of the 1930s and their more recent overreaching in this decade , the 2000s , is about to cause another Great Depression in the next , the 2010s .
It is the proximity of investment banks to the pools of savings that allows investment banks to profit .
By their access to society�s savings , investment banks use society�s wealth as the foundation of their highly leveraged bets in financial markets ; and in so doing , they have now placed all of us in harms way .
GOVERNMENT THE DEVICE BY WHICH THE FEW CONTROL THE MANY
The collapse of financial markets in the first Great Depression led to the US Congress to enact laws that would hopefully insure that such a collapse would never again happen .
To that end , in 1933 the Glass - Steagall Act was passed by Congress and signed into law .
Acknowledging the role that investment banks had played in the Great Depression , the passage of the Glass - Steagall Act in 1933 separated investment banking and commercial banking to insure that investment bank speculation would not again destabilize commercial banks as it did during the Great Depression leading to the loss of America �s savings .
What bankers hath joined together let no man put asunder However , in 1999 , the US Congress repealed the Glass - Steagall Act and America was once again vulnerable to the highly leveraged shenanigans of Wall Street .
This time , however , it was not only the US but the entire world whose futures were to be bet and lost by Wall Street gamblers .
The globalization of financial markets had spread the dangers of US investment banking to banks , insurance companies , and pension funds around the world .
Now , the savings of Europe and Asia as well as the US were to be impacted by the wagers of Wall Street who in the 2000s literally bet the house on the possibility that subprime CDOs were actually worth their AAA ratings .
Glass - Steagall , the law enacted in1933 to prevent another Great Depression was repealed at the behest of bankers .
While it is true that at certain times the US government will act in the best interest of society , usually ( and usually in the guise of so doing ) the US government is the pawn of the special interests that benefit from the trough of government largesse and regulation .
The repealing of the Glass - Steagall Act in 1999 was therefore a reversion to the mean .
We are today in the initial stages of another collapse that will lead to another Great Depression .
The safeguards put in place to prevent such from happening were not only disassembled in 1999 ; but , now in 2008 , the US government has moved even closer to exposing its citizenry and indeed the world to the speculative carnage and folly of investment banking excess .
THE RULE OF LAW IS A WONDROUS THING �ESPECIALLY IF YOU WRITE THEM .
Bloomberg.com April 8 , 2008
As credit markets seized up , the Fed gave the 20 primary dealers in U.S. government bonds the same access to discount - window loans that had previously been reserved for banks .
The central bank now auctions as much as $ 100 billion to lenders a month , and has cut the cost on direct loans to just a quarter - point above the overnight rate on loans between banks .
The US Federal Reserve is now underwriting , i.e. subsidizing , the commercial activities of global private investment banks .
The 20 primary dealers in US government bonds include the world�s largest investment banks �BNP Paribas Securities Corp. ( French ) , Barclays Capital Inc ( British ) , Banc of America Securities LLC ( USA ) , UBS Securities LLC ( Swiss ) , Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Securities LLC ( German ) , Daiwa Securities US Inc. ( Japan ) etc .
In truth , these investment banks are global entities and have no actual nationality no matter what jurisdiction in which they are legally domiciled .
As such , they also have no allegiance except to their own self - interests .
QUESTION : Why is the US government allocating public resources for the benefit of private international investment banks ?
ANSWER : US resources are subsidizing international investment banks through the Federal Reserve Bank , a quasi private entity which was given governmental powers in 1913 ( some allege in violation of the US Constitution ) .
That a quasi private bank is bailing out private banks with public monies does make sense .
What doesn�t make sense is why the public allows it .
There is much discussion as to the justification and reasons for US , UK , European , and Japanese central banks bailing out private banks with public money .
Issues such as moral hazard are now being raised in questioning the right and consequence of so doing .
In truth , such issues are irrelevant .
Not that they are in themselves not important , but issues such as moral hazard will have no effect whatsoever on what is going to happen .
Intent is the underlying motive that explains what is about to occur .
The intent of private bankers is not public stability , nor growth , nor productivity �it is the pursuit of private profit via the use of public credit and debt .
Today , most governments , especially the US and UK , are controlled by private bankers �which is why government policy continues and will continue to favor the interests of private bankers over the public good .
THE MELTDOWN OF MAMMON
I am sure that in some quarters of the Catholic Church objections were raised ( perhaps even on theological grounds ) about the torture used by the Church during the Spanish Inquisition ; just as today , there have been objections raised by some in the US in regards to the use of torture in its �war on terror� .
Objections are always tolerated by those in power as long as the objections do not rise to the level of action .
The objection to central bank credit and influence in our monetary affairs is therefore rhetorical .
The influence of private bankers and central banking in our monetary affairs will not change until their influence has run its course �which is now about to happen .
The present epoch of central banking will perhaps be known as the period when bankers roamed the earth .
Just as during the Jurassic
Age , when dinosaurs roamed freely eating whatever and whomever they encountered , bankers did much the same in the present epoch that is now about to end �profiting by the productivity of society and the public and private debts incurred as a result of bankers � induced credit - based spending .
Bankers achieved their immense power during this era by exploiting flaws in human nature and systemic flaws in the economic system they constructed for their own benefit .
But as with all flaws , human or economic , the consequences of so doing are exposed over time .
That time has now arrived .
Money is not credit , nor is money created de jure by circulating paper coupons imprinted with a government stamp stating the coupons are now legal tender to be used in the settlement of debts .
The idea that central bank coupons / paper money , sic debt , can be used to settle another debt is astounding .
That we have been led to accept it is so is even more astounding .
Throughout history , every experiment with paper �money � as a settlement of debt has failed .
Our experiment with paper money towards that end will be no different .
The recent correction in the price of gold and silver is just that , a correction in an otherwise direct repudiation of the on - going attempt by governments and bankers to substitute paper coupons for real money .
A paper yen , a paper euro , a paper dollar , when no longer backed and convertible to gold or silver is but a paper coupon masquerading as money �a coupon with an expiration date in invisible ink .
In truth , the bankers � real gambit is not their bet that paper money can be substituted for gold and silver or that subprime mortgages can be passed off as AAA securities .
Their real gambit is that central bank issuance of debt as money and their control of governments will never be discovered by the public .
HUBRIS FOLLY AND DISASTER
The world of credit and debt and all it has created has been made possible by bankers and their debt based system of money and central banking .
Its cost , however , will be born by future generations who were not present when the debts were incurred .
Those who utter in pious simplicity those wonderful words , �our children are our future� , have no idea what they have done to those very children and their future by spending today what future generations will have to earn tomorrow .
Here , in the US , an entire generation has grown up on the suspect promises of easy credit and paper money .
That generation is now beginning to suspect that something is wrong , that the price of their gas , food and healthcare is rapidly rising and their dream of home ownership is a trap from which bankruptcy is increasingly their only escape .
Still , this generation has no idea of how terribly wrong it actually is and why it has happened ; and their ignorance of such will give them little comfort during the Great Depression that lies directly ahead .
The chickens are coming home to roost ; and they closer they come , the more they are looking like vultures .
Note : I will be speaking at Professor Antal E. Fekete�s Session IV of Gold Standard University Live ( GSUL ) July 3 - 6 , 2008 in Szombathely , Hungary .
If you are interested in monetary matters and gold , the opportunity to hear Professor Fekete should not be missed .
A perusal of Professor Fekete�s topics may convince you to attend ( see http://www.professorfekete.com/gsul.asp).
Professor Fekete , in my opinion , is a giant in a time of small men .

LINCOLN , England ( CNN ) -- Author Iain M. Banks , whose " Culture " novels have made him one of science fiction 's leading lights , has created a utopian universe where altruistic robot spaceships care for genetically - enhanced humanoids , where no one wants for anything and where people are freed from the chores of daily life to express themselves as they choose .
Author Iain M. Banks
Banks , who also writes non-science - fiction as Iain Banks , found inspiration as a boy in science fiction and the space race .
He spoke to CNN 's Linnie Rawlinson in an exclusive interview at the Lincoln Book Festival about the moon landings , his inspiration and the potential for humanity to reach the stars .
Read the edited interview below .
CNN : As someone who writes both science fiction and , for want of a better phrase , mainstream fiction , what 's the appeal of science fiction as a genre ?
Iain M. Banks : I guess it 's the freedom that you get in science fiction , that you can basically go anywhere .
I think it 's closely linked to the pleasure that I got when I started reading science fiction in my early teens : when you open a book of science fiction , especially short stories , you simply do n't know where you 're going to be taken .
It could be the past , it could be in the far future , you could be out in space , it could even be maybe told from the point of view of an alien .
I love that freedom : it 's freedom for the writer and it's exciting for the reader .
The other thing is that mainstream is a bit like playing the piano .
A conventional piano is a fabulously expressive instrument , one of the great instruments of the classical world .
Science fiction has this great sense of an organ filling a cathedral : you 've got three keyboards , not just one , you 've got stops you can pull out , there 's an extra keyboard under your feet , you can start playing that as well !
It 's not incredibly subtle in the way that a piano can be , but by god , it 's good for impressive , wide - screen baroque , as Brian Aldiss once described it , and I think there 's still that feeling of the epic that 's easier to get in science fiction .
Watch our exclusive interview with Iain M. Banks »
CNN : Which science fiction writers inspired you when you were younger , and which do you look up to ?
Iain M. Banks : I guess the usual suspects , in terms of when I was growing up , people like Heinlein and Asimov , but probably a bit more Arthur C. Clarke and Brian Aldiss .
I still probably regard Aldiss as the greatest influence on me as a writer .
There 's a chap called Mike Harrison , M John Harrison , I admire him , he 's still around writing great stuff .
But there 's no great secrets , it 's people you might expect .
I 'm really terrible at remembering people 's names .
Dan Simmons , I like Dan Simmons , he 's very good at the moment .
CNN : One element that stands out in your books is the way that you write about technology so convincingly .
Where do you get those ideas from ?
Iain M. Banks : I think a lot of it's just wish fulfillment , to be honest .
A great deal of science fiction , especially the sort of stuff I write , which is not near future , is not necessarily that plausible or immediate , is about thinking " Would n't it be great if life was like this . "
That 's not to denigrate it : as long as you do n't confuse it with reality , you 're all right .
So yeah , I think it 's , " Would n't it be cool if the moral responsibility was taken away from us by incredibly clever and cool wise machines and we were just free to get on with being human within a general benign moral framework , and would n't it be great if the more intelligent you were , the nicer you were ? "
That 's my private theory , anyway .
CNN : Would you like to live in the Culture [ the society he has created ] ?
Iain M. Banks :
Good grief yes , heck , yeah , oh it's my secular heaven ...
Yes , I would , absolutely .
Again it comes down to wish fulfillment .
I have n't done a study and taken lots of replies across a cross-section of humanity to find out what would be their personal utopia .
It 's mine , I thought of it , and I 'm going home with it -- absolutely , it 's great .
CNN : What 's it like , being a humanoid as part of the Culture ?
Iain M. Banks :
It 's pretty great being a human in the Culture , with the drug glands and enormously long orgasms .
You can change sex if you want to , and you have total control over pain , and blister - free callusing .
That was n't one of mine , that was Ken MacLeod , my chum and fellow SF scribbler -- " I 've just thought of a good improvement for the human body : Blister - free callusing ! " -- so I made a particular point of putting that in ...
CNN : In the Culture 's post - scarcity society , where no one needs for anything , you 're removing a lot of the struggle around everyday life .
Is that not removing the point of life itself ?
Iain M. Banks : I think a lot of the struggle is kind of pointless and is in itself boring .
The struggle for existence for most people most of the time , especially in a post - agricultural , industrial society , is a bit of a grind .
People have to work very hard and awfully long hours for not a great deal of money : if you do n't , you get virtually nothing .
Life 's not much fun , frankly , so I 'd quite happily trade in that struggle .
CNN : What effect did the moon landings have on you when you were growing up ?
Iain M. Banks :
Oh , the whole thing had a big effect .
I was born in ' 54 and so by the time it happened in '69 I was of an age to appreciate what had been done .
I was just about old enough to remember when JFK first announced that we wanted to get to the moon , so the whole lead - up to it was amazing .
I loved the Saturn V and all the technology .
It was sad that NASA managed to make the whole thing rather boring , and so people lost interest in it , and it took Apollo 13 and a near disaster to make it all exciting again .
There 's all these caveats about how we should get things fixed down here before we send people anywhere else , but I still think it 's worth doing , to put people elsewhere .
Back to the moon is the first one , then on to Mars , and then we 'll see after that .
CNN : Do you think humanity really has a future among the stars ?
Iain M. Banks :
Well , it 's there or nowhere .
I think it 's insane to have the capacity to get off the planet and not use it .
It 's still the case that we 've got no real defense against meteors or comets or anything else hitting the planet .
You 've got all your eggs in one basket , all six , seven billion of us in the one place , and all potentially vulnerable to strike by something really big that 'd wipe us all out .
It just seems really daft , so yeah , why not ?
It might take us longer than we hope : I come from that generation that feels quite put out that we do n't have square meals the size of Oxo cubes and we do n't have jet packs and free electricity and all the things we were promised -- where 's our hovering cities and starships and moon bases and Mars bases , and so on -- but I 'm still optimistic , I still think we 'll get there .
But we 're making life difficult for ourselves at the moment , what with global warming and all the shenanigans associated with that .
We 'll see ; I do think we should keep on doing it .
It would be great if we could spend less money on the military and a lot more on space exploration : divert funds to something worthwhile instead of developing new ways of killing one 's fellow human beings .
CNN : One of the most compelling aspects of the Culture 's society is that it 's post - scarcity : no one wants for anything , people are n't hungry , everyone is clothed .
Do you think it 's within humanity 's nature to build a society like that ?
Iain M. Banks : Arguably not .
This is why the Culture is n't us .
I thought long and hard about this long before the books were published and decided , that the Culture was n't going to be us in the future , it would be humanoid , they could kind of pass for us , because I 'm not sure that we are .
It 's a very pessimistic thing to say that we do seem to be wedded to war and destruction and torture and racism and sexism -- all the horrible things , all the xenophobic things -- we seem to have a xenophobic gene sequence .
I think we should genetically modify ourselves , frankly -- if we could identify the bit that causes all the horrible things we can knock it out and become nicer people .
CNN : If there was one element of the Culture that you could give to humanity , what would it be ?
Iain M. Banks :
Oh crikey .
You certainly would n't give the very slow ageing and the potential of never dying because that would be disastrous as the moment , and you can be damned sure the rich people would keep that as their own , nobody else would get it .
The drug glands maybe .
Not for the trivial reason that you'd be able to get stoned without having to pay for it all the time , but if you had really good drugs that you could just manufacture inside your body just by thinking about it , it would solve all the drug problems : you 'd have much better dope than cannabis , much more exciting stuff than crack cocaine , and much more pleasurable stuff than heroin .
Maybe that one .
But then , being as we are , we might spend our lives subsequently stoned out of our brains , lying around and watching civilization decay about us .
I would n't put that past us , frankly .
No , actually , I 'll go back to blister - free callusing .
Iain M. Banks ' latest Culture novel , " Matter , " is out now .

Vagina Ripped Apart by Water Fountain
Water fountain shows have always been a big draw for people .
Whether you are taking a moment to enjoy the world famous Bellagio fountain show or the smaller , but still amazing , Tianyi Sqaure show in Ningbo , China , you are likely to enjoy the overall experience .
Yang , a 19 year - old college student , had a very different experience .
In August of 2007 , Yang was at a local center square in the Henan Province of China .
She went with some friends to enjoy the day and see the musical water fountain show .
Yang and her friends were playing in the water fountain area and enjoying the light burst of water that would spray them .
All of a sudden , while Yang was struck by a powerful burst of water that threw her into the air .
After the fall , Yang experienced extreme stomach pains and was bleeding badly .
She was immediately taken to the hospital to undergo medical care .
The doctor said that the fountains water pressure had torn her vagina and damaged her intestines .
During the following 7 months , Yang received 3 surgeries to repair the damage , which left her some pretty bad scars .
Yang is suing the owners of the fountain for around $ 24,500 in damages .

自分が高校の時の同窓会で起こったことなのですが、
自分は高校では目立つ方じゃあなかったので、
端に座って皆の話を聞いていました。
｢今は親父の家業を継いでいる｣やら
｢会社の上司が腹立つ｣とか口々に高校以降の自分の生い立ちを話していたのですが、
1人女の子が自分に近づいてきて｢私のこと覚えてる？｣と言うのです。
高校生の時にこんな可愛い女の子いたかなと思うくらいタイプでした。
名前を思い出さないと相手にも失礼なので必死に考えていると、
自分の横に座っていた友人が｢なに必死で考えとんねん。こいつ高橋や。｣
と高校の時 、
柔道部に入っていた奴の名前が出てきたので、
自分はビックリして横の女性の顔を見ると、
舌を出して｢わかんなかったでしょ？｣
と聞くの で
自分は
｢まったく気付かなかった。なんだったらタイプかもって思った。｣
って冗談っぽく言ったら相手が本気にしたらしく、
横に座っていた友人をはねのけて横に座り、
同窓会が終わるまで自分の太ももを触ったり、
腕にしがみついたりしてきゃーきゃーと喜んでいました。
その時、自分は苦笑いしかできなかったです。(笑)
そう言えば同窓会に出席する前、
どんな服装で行こうか、結構悩んでいました。
25年ぶりの同窓会、いったいどんな服装で行く！？
このサイトとか参考にして、
できるだけ女子ウケの良い服装を研究して挑んだのですが、
（元）同性に好かれることになるとは・・・笑
結局この日は高橋にずっと横に座られていて、
女性の同級生と話すことができず、
何のためにオシャレしていったのか分からなくなってしまいました。
Still , Mr. Caro adds a caveat : “ That does n’t always translate into a great presidency . ”
So what does it look like ?
Image HE HAD IT John F. Kennedy at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in 1960 .

Charisma , as defined by the early sociologist Max Weber , was one of three “ ideal types ” of authority  the others were legal , as in a bureaucracy , and traditional , as in a tribe  and rested upon a kind of magical power and hero worship .
That definition was , of course , unsuitable for modern times , as one of Weber ’s many interpreters , Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. , wrote in “ The Politics of Hope . ”
Its use became metaphorical , as Mr. Schlesinger wrote , “ a chic synonym for heroic , or for demagogic , or even just for ‘ popular . ’ ”
But it was also a coolness that Norman Mailer captured in Kennedy  for whom Mr. Schlesinger became a kind of official hero - worshiper  writing about the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles .
Mr. Mailer described how Kennedy ’s convertible , then his suntan and his teeth , emerged before a camera - filled crowd in Pershing Square , “ the prince and the beggars of glamour staring at one another across a city street . ”
There was , Mr. Mailer wrote : “ an elusive detachment to everything he did .
One did not have the feeling of a man present in the room with all his weight and all his mind .
Johnson gave you all of himself , he was a political animal , he breathed like an animal , sweated like one , you knew his mind was entirely absorbed with the compendium of political fact and maneuver ; Kennedy seemed at times like a young professor whose manner was adequate for the classroom but whose mind was off in some intricacy of the Ph.D. thesis he was writing . ”
By any definition , the charismatic leader emerges at a time of crisis or national yearning , and perhaps a vacuum in that nation ’s institutions .
Mr. Schlesinger wrote in 1960 of a “ new mood in politics , ” with people feeling “ that the mood which has dominated the nation for a decade is beginning to seem thin and irrelevant . ”
There was , he wrote , “ a mounting dissatisfaction with the official priorities , a deepening concern with our character and objectives as a nation . ”
That might well describe the climate Obama supporters feel now .
Alan Wolfe , the director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Political Life at Boston College , says Mr. Obama is simply  understandably  making an emotional appeal to those yearnings .
“ Politics is about policy , but it ’s also about giving people some kind of sense of participating in a common venture with their fellow citizens , ” Mr. Wolfe said .
Philosophers call it “ civil religion , ” using the language of religion and elevation to talk about your country .
A classic example is Ronald Reagan ’s summoning of the “ city on a hill . ”
That , Professor Wolfe said , was the parallel Mr. Obama was hinting at when he talked about Reagan as a transformative leader .
There are quite few entries in this year 's Microsoft Next - Gen PC Design competition , but the Illusion PC is one of the standouts due to a unique magic trick .
A 3D object appears to be hovering inside of the case — giving the impression that there are no internal components .
According to the designer , this effect is fully customizable and a website could be developed for theme support .

Outside of the 3D effect , the PC can also include optional components like a built - in 6 " TFT LCD monitor , Matrix Orbital MX222 2x16 character VFD display and a TV tuner card — additions which give the user further options for visual customizations or data display .
I do n't know if it will make the cut when Microsoft announces the winners in May , but if aesthetics mean anything , it certainly has a shot .

a people !
May I make a suggestion ?
Acknowledge the Ignorant for who they are — — by ceasing to pretend their people and our people are the same kind .
Anyone in their right minds can see one group of us has evolved and moved on , while another group has chosen to remain behind .
It 's the classic metaphor .
Once upon a time , there were two groups of primates .
One group is believing they should commit to the move out of the trees , while the other group is steadfast :
We must remain in the trees .
Inevitably , a critical mass of disparity is achieved , and both groups make their decisions and stick to them .
Now , jump forward in time a few hundred thousand years .
The group that chose to leave the trees and move to the ground got medicine , internet , and space travel .
And the group that chose to remain in the trees ?
Zoos .
And that 's how the metaphor goes , and in a way also , how it went .
Yet , now suddenly after another couple thousand years another opportunity for growth has revealed itself .
Suddenly we as post - primates have been presented with another new idea .
It is the concept of evolution .
And you know what the result has been ?
The exact same as the metaphor with the trees .
Meaning , one group has embraced the evolution concept — and forward thinking — and the other is dedicated to the status quo , and subsequently obsolescent thinking .
In other words , there are now two kinds of humans living on the planet .
There are those dedicated to realizing what we can become .
They are us .
And then there are those who believe that this was as good as it gets , and do n't want much better but worryingly do n't want much worse .
These are the Ignorant people .
And we discriminate against them by giving them the credit we give to our equals / one another .
While this has been common knowledge for sometime — I mean , either getting evolution or not getting evolution is what we share or do n't share in common — recently a method of determining which of us belongs to which group has revealed itself .
It is the question of whether or not the president of the United States must be Barack Obama .
Here in the US , when someone tells me after eight years of what we and the world has been put through under the reign of George W. Bush that they will be voting for McCain , I know that I am dealing with a person who is Ignorant .
Here in the US , when I here someone say , " I am not voting for McCain , but I am not voting for Barack Obama , " I know that this is someone who is Ignorant .
There are not really two US presidential candidates .
There are presidents for two unique US peoples .
Barack Obama is our president , the president for all of us in the US who are anything but ignorant .
And John McCain is the president of the US Ignorant .
See how simple it is ?
Anyone who is anything other than Ignorant will obviously vote for Barack Obama .
Likewise , the Ignorant by their very nature must choose McCain — by voting or not .
Acknowledge the Ignorant by leaving them to their beliefs .
Stop belittling them with shows of conscious superiority .
There is not a choice of whether or not to vote John McCain or Barack Obama .
There is an evolutionary difference between the two .
It 's like neanderthals and humans living together and having choosing to vote for a homo neanderthalensis candidate or a homo sapien candidate .
The one would vote for their kind , and the other would vote for theirs .
However , as history shows , victory goes to the smarter group not the larger .
So , rather than aggravating the Ignorant with anti-McCain campaigns and pro-Obama demonstrations , just organize your immediate community to vote for Obama .
It 's really very simple and civil .
After eight years under Bush , even the Ignorant people are not very interested in voting for McCain .
But they rightly want life to be better than it is .
In the end , the Ignorant do n't really care that Obama is president ; they just want to be acknowledged .
Make getting Obama elected our goal , but let 's do it while acknowledging — and being nicer to — the Ignorant .
While bashing Microsoft has always been common in the circles I run in , I 've tried to do less of that in recent years .
I know more people working there and have a lot of respect for them .
I now understand that a lot of their problems are the result of systemic problems and sheer inertia .
But still , sometimes you see things that ought to be pointed out .
Henry Blodget 's Microsoft's MSN : Still Sucking Wind After All These Years is rather eye - opening .
Did you know that MSN is currently losing about $ 1 billion a year ( run-rate ) ?
That 's right , $ 1 billion .
On about $ 2.2 billion of advertising revenue .
( See this page for details ) .
Unless Microsoft 's disappearing access business is losing a lot of money -- which we doubt -- all of the division 's losses are attributable to the advertising and media business .
That means that MSN is losing nearly $ 0.50 for every $ 1.00 of advertising it sells .
Not good when compared with rivals , it seems .
And then there 's the employee retention problem .
Translation :
We only grew headcount 12 % , but we have to pay so much to retain and recruit people that our overall headcount expenses increased more than twice as fast .
He concludes by saying :
Do n't forget that , in round one of the Microsoft 's - going - to - rule - the - Internet wars , Microsoft accelerated dial - up subscription revenue and expenses in an attempt to catch AOL .
That effort failed , as did several that followed .
In the past 12 years , in fact , Microsoft 's online story has had any number or re-orgs , restarts , and revampings , but the reality has never changed .
Makes you wonder when Microsoft will find their way on - line ... if ever .
And then there 's former Yahoo Bill Reardon 's Microsoft Search post , which is a most excellent rant .
He 's got a talent for taking the obvious and making your realize how fucked up something is .
Reacting to the fact that Microsoft's Search finally has stemming :
WTF ?!?
They didn�t have these things before ?!
Understanding �driving � vs. �drive� ?
That �s a pretty basic problem called stemming .
How basic ?
Put it this way , there�s been open source code out there to this before there was a Microsoft Search .
Fuck , even the Wikipedia page has existed since 2007 .
All they had to do was go there .
I know Microsoft is big about �eating their own dogfood� , but damn , use Google just this once to find it .
He paints a pretty sad picture , and reading the Microsoft presss about their technology , it 's hard not to agree with him .
Read the whole thing .
It 's worth it .
Bill really cracks me up .
Do n't even get me started on their " you can look but not touch " .NET source code release .
Hint :
It 's not like Open Source .
Not at all .

He said that at least a couple times in debates .
I 'm sure somebody can find the actual quote .
" God is Great , " screamed a man seconds before he blew himself up , killing 10 people in a restaurant in Ramadi , the capital of Anbar province in western Iraq .
A series of suicide bombings have shown over the past week that al - Qa'ida in Iraq , though battered by defections over the past year , is striking back remorselessly at Sunni Arab leaders who ally themselves to the US .
In another attack in the village of Albu Mohammed , south of Kirkuk , an elderly man thought by guards to be too old to be a bomber , walked unsearched into a tent filled with mourners attending the funeral of two Sunni tribesmen who had been killed after they joined al - Sahwa , the Awakening Council , as the pro-US Sunni group is called .
The man detonated the explosives hidden under his long Arab robes , killing at least 50 people .
A vicious civil war is now being fought within Iraq 's Sunni Arab community between al - Qa'ida in Iraq and al - Sahwa while other groups continue to attack American forces .
In Baghdad on a single day the head of al - Sahwa in the southern district of Dora was killed in his car by gunmen and seven others died by bombs and bullets in al - Adhamiya district .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
US spokesmen speak of a " spike " in violence in recent weeks but in reality security in Sunni and Shia parts of Iraq has been deteriorating since January .
The official daily death toll of civilians reached a low of 20 killed a day in that month and has since more than doubled to 41 a day in March .
The US and the Iraqi government are now facing a war on two fronts .
The attack in Ramadi shows al - Qa'ida still has support in Anbar province where al - Sahwa was founded and has greater strength in Diyala , Salahudin and Nineveh provinces .
In Sunni parts of Baghdad , al - Sahwa often includes members of al - Qa'ida whose loyalties have not changed or gunmen who think it safest to work for the US and al - Qa'ida .
" No officer in al - Sahwa walks home unless he has a relationship with al - Qa'ida , " said one al - Sahwa member .
" It would be too dangerous for him otherwise . "
The American - backed government of Nouri al - Maliki is in the meantime stepping up its campaign against the Mehdi Army militia of the anti-American cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
Iraqi troops sealed off the Basra office of the Sadrists yesterday .
" Troops from the Iraqi army prevented us from holding Friday prayers and now they are cordoning off the office , " said Harith al - Idhari , the head of the office .
" They want to storm it and clear everybody out of it . "
Mr Maliki is convinced that this is the moment to assert himself against the Sadrists despite military setbacks when he launched his offensive against Basra on 25 March .
Two brigades of about 600 men , each from the army 's 14th Division whose soldiers come from the city , refused to fight the Mehdi Army as did most of Basra 's 11,000 police .
The Iraqi government says that it has purged 1,300 men from its armed forces and police since the Basra operation and is willing to try again against the militiamen .
But it has only been able to hold its own in Basra , Baghdad and other cities because of backing from the US .
The Sadrist office in Basra is housed in the building of the old Olympic committee .
" We have orders to take back all the government buildings that are occupied by parties and political movements in Basra within 48 hours , " said the Interior Ministry spokesman Major - General Abdul Karim - Khalaf .
The greatest stronghold of the Sadrists is Sadr City in Baghdad , which has a population of two million and is virtually a twin city to the capital .
US forces have now started building a concrete wall which will seal off the southern part of Sadr City .
The US and the Iraqi government are particularly keen to gain control of those parts of Sadr City used to lob rockets and mortars into the Green Zone .
Despite government purges , it is still unclear how far Iraqi army units are willing to fight Shia co-religionists .
Yesterday a company of government troops abandoned their positions in al - Nasir police station in Sadr City when they came under attack from militiamen during a sandstorm .
Another company had deserted earlier in the week .
Mr Maliki is eager to show that the Iraqi government is strong enough to overcome its domestic enemies , but the fighting against al - Qa'ida in Iraq in Sunni districts and the Mehdi Army in Shia areas over the past month has proved the opposite .
The Iraqi army has appeared as dependent on American support as it ever was in the past .
Buffeted by criticism from some of her own supporters , Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged yesterday that she had mishandled her effort to distance herself from President Clinton 's offer of clemency to members of a Puerto Rican terrorist group .
The First Lady said she should have consulted Hispanic leaders in New York before suddenly calling for the White House to withdraw the clemency offer .
' ' I have to admit that the consultation was not what it should have been , '' Mrs. Clinton , who is likely to run for the United States Senate next year , said yesterday during a conference of Hispanic , Asian and black women in Manhattan .
'' And that will never happen again . ''
The First Lady 's acknowledgment of error was narrowly drawn , suggesting she believed that the mistake was not her position on the issue itself , but rather how she handled the political preparation that often precedes such an announcement .
Even so , it is unusual for a candidate to admit such a misstep , and her comments came as she faced a third straight day of questions about an issue that has emerged as the first major challenge to her probable candidacy .

Earth 's crust wobbles like dessert
A new , long - term look at the earth 's crust suggests that the continental plates are not completely rigid after all .
Rather , when viewed on very long timescales , they can behave with surprising fluidity , report scientists .
" As usual , things are more complicated , " says earthquake researcher Professor Roland Bürgmann of the University of California at Berkeley , of the classic view of stiff plates over a more fluid mantle .
It may be that sometimes the crust behaves as if its plates are rigid and strong all the way down , with only the underlying mantle showing any jelly - like elasticity .
But on longer timescales , the same area of crust can act more like pudding , with only the top few kilometres , the rocky lithosphere , staying consistently strong and rigid .
" We 're tying to take a new look at an old problem , " says Dr Wayne Thatcher , a geologist with the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
He and his USGS colleague Dr Fred Pollitz 's provocative paper on the changing ground under our feet is the cover story of the April / May issue of GSA Today , published by the Geological Society of America .
" I think of the lithosphere as ice on a pond , " says Thatcher .
The thicker a patch of ice , the wider and gentler it will dip in response to weight , such as a truck driving over it , he says .
Of course , thinner ice will dip more dramatically under the same weight .
Replace the ice in that analogy with a lithosphere and the truck for mountain ranges and you get a basic picture of the structure underground .
" We tried to use different kinds of loads to probe different properties of the lithosphere , " Thatcher says .
Mountains , glaciers , earthquakes
Mountains are one load that the crust responds to on the scale of tens of millions of years .
Other loads are glaciers , which grow and shrink on a mid-range timescale of hundreds to tens of thousands of years .
Briefest of all loads are earthquakes , which trigger adjustments in the crust on the scale of just days , weeks and months .
On the earthquake timescale , a patch of crust behaves rigidly , as does the mantle under it .
Using the ice / truck analogy , the ice is thick and strong .
But at the glacial timescale , the mantle behaves more like jelly , effectively limiting the more rigid ' ice ' to just the crust .
Finally , on the mountain - load timescales of millions of years , only the upper crust really behaves rigidly , making for the thinnest 'ice ' , which bows the most under the weight of a truck .
" It 's a little different way of trying to put all of the pieces together than has been done before , " Thatcher says .
" It turns out that what happens on the short term and what happens on the million - year timescale is different . "

( Adds Obama campaign confirmation of meeting , details )
WASHINGTON , June 5 ( Reuters ) - Likely U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama met privately with former rival Hillary Clinton on Thursday night , an Obama campaign spokesman said .
“ They did meet tonight , ” Robert Gibbs , Obama ’s communications director , told reporters in response to media reports about the session .
Gibbs said reports they met at Clinton ’s home in Washington were incorrect .
He declined to disclose the location or details of what they discussed .
He spoke on the Obama campaign plane traveling to Chicago .
Obama had been scheduled to fly back to that city on Thursday evening after a rally in northern Virginia but stayed behind for the meeting with Clinton , shedding his campaign plane and the traveling press corps .
CNN reported the Obama - Clinton session was “ a small meeting ” with perhaps just the two senators and a few aides in attendance .
The New York Times said the meeting with Obama was initiated by Clinton after a daylong series of talks between their aides .
There is intense speculation Obama might pick Clinton as his running mate for November ’s presidential election against Republican John McCain .
Obama has said the process would take time .
Clinton , who has expressed an interest in running as vice president , sought to distance herself on Thursday from efforts by supporters to convince Obama to pick her , saying the choice was up to him .
Obama , an Illinois senator , clinched the Democratic nomination on Tuesday .
Clinton , a New York senator and former first lady , did not immediately concede but told supporters in a letter she would formally back Obama on Saturday .

FORT PIERCE - Tiffany Shepherd 's advertised 34 DD/ E breasts might be bared in the pages of Playboy magazine , an offer the bikini mate and former high school teacher is considering for her children 's future .
" There 's a lot of people coming up with a lot of different offers , " Shepherd said via cell phone from New York Wednesday following a television appearance .
" When I started all this it was for my children and it 's still about my children , making sure that they 're provided for . "
Shepherd , a single mother with three boys , became a media sensation after claiming she was released from her teaching contract because of her job on a charter boat offering trips with bikini-clad and topless women .
The St. Lucie County School District , however , cites Shepherd 's " excessive absences , " rather than the buxom and tattooed blonde 's gig with Fort Pierce - based Smokin ' Em Charters .
Shepherd , a former biology teacher , had more than 30 unexcused absences this school year and two reprimands in her personnel file .
As news of the charters and Shepherd 's bikini photos rocketed through the local media , the big - time inquiries started pouring in  Dr. Phil , Maxim , FHM .
Over the past few days , Playboy expressed interest in nude shots to the tune of $ 25,000 per photo , she said .
The pictures , according to Smokin ' Em Charters owner and Shepherd manager Kathi Coombes , would be done " very tastefully . "
" It 's not going to be spread eagle shots or anything like that , " she said .
Other charter girls also might be included .
A comment from a Playboy representative was not immediately available .
Asked whether she would pose nude , Shepherd said : " I 'm not sure yet .
I 'm , still thinking about it .
That 's a really big decision for me considering my children . "
" There 's pros and cons for not doing it and pros and cons for doing it , " she continued .
" I 'm really thinking about it because I do want to provide for my kids . "
She said she likely will decide in the next week or so .
Coombes , meanwhile , said some of her girls left following the media attention , but she 's made some new hires .
" One is a Budweiser girl , " Coombes said .
" She is on her first charter ( Wednesday ) . "
Shepherd said if she does pose for Playboy , she 'll likely set up some sort of scholarship .
Shepherd said someone also called expressing interest in putting her in a comedy film .
" We also just ran into a person from Victoria 's Secret , " she said .
" That might be an option , too , yay ! "
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama won Guam's Democratic presidential caucuses Saturday by just seven votes , according to a Guam election official .
Voters line up Saturday in Dededo , Guam 's largest village .
With all 21 precincts reporting , Obama finished with 2,264 votes , or 50.1 percent .
Sen. Hillary Clinton got 2,257 votes , or 49.9 percent .
Each candidate picked up two delegates .
The presidential candidates were battling for Guam 's four pledged delegate votes .
Eight delegates will be elected , each with half a vote at the Democratic National Convention in Denver , Colorado , this summer .
According to CNN 's latest estimate , Obama now has a total of 1,736 delegates ( 1,493 pledged delegates , 243 superdelegates ) .
Clinton has a total of 1,599 delegates ( 1,334 pledged delegates , 265 superdelegates ) .
The Democratic contest moves to North Carolina and Indiana , which hold their primaries Tuesday .
Also on the ballot Saturday was the race for chairman and vice chairman of the U.S. territory 's Democratic Party .
The winners of that race will serve as superdelegates .
According to the election official , the slate of Pilar Lujan and Jaime Paulino leads the slate of Joseph Artero Cameron and Arlen Bordallo .
Lujan remains uncommitted in the race for president , but running mate Paulino has endorsed Obama .
Both Cameron and Bordallo have endorsed Clinton .
Incumbent Chairman Tony Charfauros and running mate Mary Ann Cabrera are in third place .
Neither has endorsed a presidential candidate .
Do n't Miss Election Center 2008
Although called " caucuses , " Saturday 's event in Guam functions more like a party - run primary .
Voters cast secret ballots in polling places as opposed to publicly aligning themselves in presidential candidate preference groups , as in more traditional caucuses , such as in Iowa and Nevada .
Polls closed in Guam at 6 a.m. ET .
Guam is 14 hours ahead of Eastern time .
Cathleen Moore - Linn stood in line for more than an hour outside the old police precinct in Dededo , Guam 's most populated village .
Despite the 90 - degree tropical heat and a lack of air conditioning at the polling site , she said , " Nobody left .
A lot of manamko ' [ elderly people ] came out to vote .
And people were filling out the forms to join the Democrat Party . "
At villages in the southern end of the island , which is far less populated , election committee member Nancy Weare says the voting is running smoothly .
" There 's a constant flow of traffic and good voter turnout . "
Vying for Guam 's delegate and superdelegate votes in their tight race for the nomination , the two remaining Democratic presidential hopefuls have inundated the island with radio and TV advertisements , each promising long - awaited political gains : the ability for Guamanians to be able to vote for president , lifting the territory 's cap on Medicaid and , perhaps the most coveted prize of all , war reparations in the form of more than $ 120 million .
A war reparations bill , sponsored by Bordallo , would issue payments to the survivors of Japan 's control of the island during World War II and would create educational and research programs about the occupation .
The legislation is stalled in the U.S. Senate .
CNN Research Director Robert Yoon , CNN Political Producer Ed Hornick and special contributor Jayne Flores contributed to this report .
All About Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama • Guam
SO THE emperor really is n't wearing any clothes .
Last week PepsiCo announced that the label on its Aquafina brand of bottled water will soon carry the words “ public water source ” , instead of simply the innocent looking “ P. W.S. ” .
That 's right : Aquafina is to all intents and purposes tap water .
Coca - Cola is under pressure to follow suit with its Dasani brand , though so far it is refusing to do so .
“ We do n't believe that consumers are confused about the source of Dasani water , ” Diana Garza Ciarlante , a Coca - Cola spokeswoman , said .
“ The label clearly states that it is purified water . ”
No doubt Coca - Cola still remembers what happened in Britain in 2004 , when the press made a stink over the fact that Dasani was simply filtered tap water .
The company became a laughing stock , as readers were reminded of an episode of a popular TV comedy , “ Only Fools and Horses ” .
In it Del Boy , a decidedly dodgy businessman , decides to bottle tap water , selling it as “ Peckham Spring ” , named after the unprepossessing inner-London borough .
No sooner had the initial furore died down than Coca - Cola discovered that some of the water had been contaminated betwixt tap and bottle , and decided to admit defeat .
Dasani was axed in Britain a mere five weeks after it was launched .
Will Pepsi's new label have a similarly disastrous impact on sales of Aquafina , which is now the market leader in bottled waters in America ?
It is by no means inevitable .
The success of bottled water is in many ways one of capitalism 's greatest mysteries .
Studies show consistently that tap water is purer than many bottled waters — not including those that contain only tap water , which by some estimates is 40 % of the total by volume .
The health benefits that are claimed for some bottled waters are unproven , at best .
By volume , bottled water often costs 1,000 times the price of tap water .
Indeed , even with oil prices sky high , a litre of bottled water can cost more than a litre of petrol .
And on top of that , there are the environmental costs of transporting bottled water and of manufacturing and disposing of the bottles .
Yet sales of bottled water have been booming .
In 2006 Americans spent nearly $ 11 billion buying 8.25 billion gallons ( 31.2 billion litres ) of the stuff , an increase in volume of 9.5 % on a year earlier .
The average American drank 27.6 gallons of bottled water last year , up from 16.7 gallons in 2000 .
AFP
Quite a business model
In Britain , despite the failure of Dasani , sales of bottled water have soared from 990 m litres in 1998 to 2.28 billion litres in 2006 — worth $ 3.3 billion and accounting for 15 % of the total soft - drinks market .
Its share is forecast to rise to 21 % next year .
Moreover , drinks companies are betting heavily on the future growth of bottled water , including popular new varieties with added “ healthy ” ingredients .
In May Coca - Cola paid $ 4.1 billion for Glaceau , the company that makes vitaminwater .
To many , all this is the ultimate proof that consumers are daft and easily manipulated by retailers to buy things they do n't need .
Indeed , a campaign , “ Think Outside the Bottle ” , is now under way in America , aiming to wean the public off bottled water .
It is winning influential converts .
Having successfully popularised gay marriage , San Francisco 's charismatic young mayor , Gavin Newsom , is now trying to achieve the opposite impact on bottled water : his ban on the use of city funds to buy the stuff took effect on July 1st .
Other mayors are starting to follow his lead .
Even so , there may be good , rational reasons for the popularity of bottled water .
It is convenient , much more portable than a tap .
Also , some consumers suspect , perhaps correctly , that there is a “ last mile ” problem with tap water .
It may be pure as driven snow when it is tested at the plant , but is it still so virginal once it has passed through old pipes in homes and offices ?
Above all , consumers may be buying bottled water because they believe it is fundamentally safer , less likely than tap water to become contaminated — a growing worry nowadays , thanks to terrorists .
And , if it is contaminated , that contamination is likely to be spotted and neutralised faster and more effectively by a bottler than by government regulators or a water utility .
The contaminated Dasani water in Britain brought bad publicity , but the dirty water never reached the public .
Likewise , the impressive way that Perrier handled its benzene contamination scare in 1990 — immediately recalling its entire output of bottles — is a case study in how to manage such a problem .
Perhaps the popularity of bottled water is an indictment of the waste inherent in capitalism .
On the other hand , maybe it is testimony to the good job that capitalism , in the form of bottled - water producers , has done in developing quality controls and safety protections that are more reassuring than those put in place by our governments and regulated utilities .
The difference may be small — but big enough to get those who can afford it to pay a substantial premium for what is , after all , the stuff of life .

This year 's unusual presidential election may toss out one more assumption : the old red - blue map that shows Democrats owning the two coasts , Republicans dominating the South and interior West , and a few battleground states picking the winner .
As Sen. Barack Obama moves toward the Democratic nomination , analysts think he could be riding a wave , where a fresh face coupled with a deep desire among voters for change overwhelms traditional partisan geography , topples GOP strongholds and delivers a powerful new majority for Democrats .
Yet after being written off last summer , Sen .
John McCain emerged as the Republican best positioned to hold the White House for his party in a year when nearly everything is against him : an unpopular war , soaring gas prices , sinking home values and a Republican incumbent with poisonous approval ratings .
Analysts point to last Tuesday 's twin primaries in Oregon and Kentucky to show how McCain could beat the odds .
The same day that Obama enthralled the young , educated voters of Oregon , he was thrashed in Kentucky , losing many counties by 85 and 90 percent margins .
" I was shaking my head when I looked at the Kentucky results , " said David Paleologos , director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center .
" Single - digit numbers are something a fringe candidate gets .
You put a Joe Smith , a placebo , on the ballot and they get 7 percent .
...
The voters in Kentucky in our poll said they thought Barack Obama would be the next president , yet only 7 percent in some of these counties were voting for him . "
And these were Democrats .
Parts of pivotal Ohio and Pennsylvania mirror or include Appalachia .
General strategy
The general election will operate very differently from the Democratic primaries , where Obama held his early lead by accumulating delegates based on his share of the vote , keeping the race tight even when he lost big states like California and Ohio to Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton .
In the Electoral College , the winner of each state takes all its electoral votes .
The aim is to reach 270 out of a total of 538 .
" All things being equal , Obama is a decent bet to break 300 , just because it's a very good year for Democrats , " said Daron Shaw , a University of Texas professor who worked for Bush in 2000 and consulted for the Republican National Committee in 2004 .
Holding the blue states and winning Ohio could give him the presidency with one electoral vote to spare .
" But boy , if he loses Ohio and turns around and loses Pennsylvania , " Shaw said , " then he 's got a math problem . "
Obama then would have to recoup those 41 electoral votes someplace else .
Taking Nevada , New Mexico and Colorado would yield just 19 , leaving him short even of Kerry 's losing total .
Young voters key
Yet Obama shows the potential to change the entire map for Democrats by energizing young voters and the upscale urbanites who increasingly make up the base of the Democratic Party .
For all the current fascination with white blue - collar voters , they have been dwindling and drifting Republican for decades .
" Among Democratic voters today , professionals and managers outnumber manual workers by a better than 2 - to - 1 margin , " Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz wrote for the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics .
The GOP faces what Rep. Tom Davis , a retiring Virginia Republican and leading party strategist , called in a 28 - page memo last week a " toxic " environment .
" If we were a dog food , they 'd take us off the shelf , " the memo said .
Democrats are outstripping Republicans in voter registrations , fundraising and turnout by large margins .
Obama 's strongest appeal is among cultural liberals , what Davis called the " granola belt " of college towns and arts and recreation centers like Taos , N.M. , and the " Menlo Park / Central Park " crowd of urban sophisticates .
Obama 's weakness among the white working class could be offset , Davis said , by a soft economy and an electorate that is more diverse and urbanized than in 2004 .
And African Americans , who already vote overwhelmingly Democratic , could turn out in even higher numbers for his historic candidacy .
Democrats start with a core of 248 electoral votes , said Simon Rosenberg , president of NDN , a Democratic advocacy organization .
Adding four Southwest states , including Arizona , would give Democrats the presidency with 277 Electoral College votes .
Adding Florida and Ohio brings it to a knockout of 324 , and adding New Hampshire and Iowa would deliver what he called an " enduring Democratic majority " of 335 .
Democratic trend
Pointing to polls that now show Obama leading McCain in Ohio , Pennsylvania and Virginia as well as nationally , Rosenberg said the election " is leaning very heavily Democratic right now .
Obama has the ability to win a landslide victory both in the popular votes and the Electoral College based on early trend lines . "
The Davis memo pointed to exactly those voters to show where McCain should pounce .
" Exit polls in West Virginia showed that two - thirds of Clinton supporters were unwilling to commit to Obama in the fall - and that 's just among Democrats ! "
Davis wrote .
" With an economy perceived to be failing , these voters should be easy prey to ANY Democrat , but they 're not .
Herein lies the key for the McCain campaign . "
Despite the stunning Democratic victories in the last three special elections for Republican - held House seats - former House Speaker Denny Hastert 's Illinois district and one each in Mississippi and Louisiana - even Democratic strategists think Obama will struggle to win North Carolina and could have a battle in Virginia .
Shaw speculates that perceptions may have shifted in March when Clinton and Obama began to attack each other in an effort to engage blue - collar voters in Ohio .
Back in February , Shaw believed Clinton voters would not have considered voting for McCain , but now may pose a bigger problem as Democrats attempt to unify the party .
" My guess is McCain is going to be on them like crazy , " Shaw said .
But if a big Democratic wave gathers speed , said Samuel Popkin , a political scientist at UC San Diego , McCain could lose even his home state of Arizona , just as Democrat Al Gore lost Tennessee in 2000 .
" McCain is to Arizona as Gore became to Tennessee in a way - yesterday , " Popkin said .
" I do n't want to overstate it , but I would not be shocked if Arizona got competitive . "
Focus on Latinos
The linchpin could be Latinos , the fastest growing voter bloc that went 40 percent for Bush in the last election .
Since then , Congressional Republicans have alienated many Latinos with harsh rhetoric and crackdowns on illegal immigration .
McCain is better positioned with Latinos than any of his earlier GOP rivals , having co-authored with Democrat Ted Kennedy , D - Mass . , a big immigration bill that would have offered illegal immigrants a path to citizenship .
During the Republican primaries , he disavowed his own legislation , but in recent days has been back courting Latinos and the Republican business community with proposals to expand visas .
Independents could be decisive in all the battleground states , but they may be the hardest vote to secure , and the most prone to ride any wave .
" The lion 's share of independents are defined by their indifference toward politics and their lack of engagement , " Shaw said .
" It 's always a catch - 22 with these voters .
You have to spend an enormous amount of energy and resources reaching out to them because they 're not all that engaged .
It takes a lot to make the case to them , and you 're never really sure how they 're going to react . "
Independents tend to hear only the loudest noises and follow the prevailing wind , he said .
" And if that prevailing wind is strongly Democratic - and I think there 's a chance it could be this year - then McCain 's got some trouble irrespective of Obama 's difficulties with blue - collar voters . "
The Director of National Intelligence last week issued several new Intelligence Community Directives ( ICDs ) that implement new community - wide personnel practices , including a performance - based compensation policy that rewards superior job performance .
The new payment policy “ links performance - based pay increases and bonuses to individual accomplishments , demonstrated competencies , and contributions to organizational results . ”
“ Higher performance and greater contribution to mission should result in proportionally higher rewards for similarly - situated employees . ”
The new payment and personnel policies , part of DNI J. Michael McConnell ’s 100 - day and 500 - day plans , are intended to modernize the business practices of U.S. intelligence agencies and , implicitly , to make government service somewhat more competitive with intelligence contractors in the private sector .
The new personnel policies will also replace the standard government personnel grading system known as the General Schedule ( GS ) for all intelligence agency employees , except that senior officials at the GS - 15 or higher grade are exempted .
The new IC Directives , all dated April 28 , 2008 , were released under the Freedom of Information Act .
They include :
ICD 650 , National Intelligence Civilian Compensation Program : Guiding Principles and Framework ( pdf )
ICD 652 , Occupational Structure for the Intelligence Community Civilian Workforce ( pdf )
ICD 654 , Performance - Based Pay for the Intelligence Community Civilian Workforce ( pdf )
ICD 656 , Performance Management System Requirements for Intelligence Community Senior Civilian Officers ( pdf )
Copies of these and other IC Directives are available here .

Some of the nerdiest - looking cars in recent automotive history are making a comeback , at least in resale value , as a growing number of value - driven drivers put gas thriftiness ahead of image .
Early - 1990s econoboxes such as Ford Festiva , Hyundai Excel and Geo Metro — once the punch line of jokes — have seen their used car prices climb from giveaway levels as low as $ 1,100 a few months ago to upward of $ 6,000 today , Kelley Blue Book says .
" Remember that nerds will rule the world someday , " says Phil Skinner , collector car market editor for KBB , the popular used car price - tracking service .
He says prices have risen up to 30 % for the low - end 15 - year - old jalopies .
As AAA pegged gas prices Wednesday at a record $ 3.758 a gallon nationwide , some of those old tin cans get gas mileage equal to today 's best and pricey hybrids .
A 1993 Geo Metro XFI , a subcompact imported by General Motors , is EPA - rated at a 46 miles per gallon average .
That 's the same as a 2008 Toyota Prius gas - electric hybrid , which starts at $ 21,500 .
Festiva , Excel and the others get mid-30s mpg or better on the highway .
Enviable gas mileage was made possible by smaller engines : The Metro had three cylinders .
The cars were also lighter than today 's models , sometimes lacking air bags and other safety features that add weight .
Experts advise taking the safety trade - off into consideration .
" What is your life worth for that extra 10 miles per gallon ? " asks Jon Linkov , managing editor for autos for Consumer Reports .
At the bottom rung of the auto industry , the little cars were usually hawked to college students and seniors .
Hyundai Excel 's reliability was so spotty , for instance , that the South Korean automaker — though widely lauded by reviewers for quality in recent models — is still trying to live down its past reputation .
" They were made as disposable cars , " Skinner says .
" The vast majority have been sent away to the crusher . "
Nick Skouteris , an Atlanta auto restorer , says he has fixed up and sold about 10 Geo Metros but is having trouble finding more at reasonable prices .
He says he had his sights set on a Metro convertible on eBay a couple of weeks ago with rust holes and 175,000 miles on the odometer that went for $ 3,000 .
" They are hot cars right now , " Skouteris says .
" You can't find one cheap enough . "
In Los Angeles , John Chris is selling his salvaged 1988 Hyundai Excel with 115,000 miles — a great car , he insists , except for that little mishap on the 101 freeway — for $ 750 .
" I would n't know about the nerdiness , " Chris says .
" It looks good . "
Enlarge By Tim Post , AP Resale values have risen for the three - cylinder Geo Metro , which gets the same mpg as a Toyota Prius .

First , watch this :
Barack Obama has said we need a national conversation on race .
One of the reasons I ’m so eager about a potential Obama presidency is that I think it ’s time we stood up , went nose to nose with racism , and made clear that while we ’re open to a good - faith conversation on race , we ’re done tolerating racism .
Make no mistake , in the coming months you ’re going to see the ugliest artillery that our nation ’s drooling , inbred hatemongers have at their disposal .
The looming prospect of a nigra in the White House is going to bring the vermin out of the woodwork , out from under their rocks and out into the light .
It ’s going to incite the well - heeled country club elite to crank up the meme machine with every sort of subtle , codemongering dogwhistle it can manufacture .
The truly ignorant and hateful are going to be liquored up on rhetorical bile of the lowest sort and those who live further up the social ladder are going to be provided with a variety of messages that let them vote white without having to admit to themselves that they ’re fundamentally just like the snuff - suckers in the trailer park across the tracks .
This is a good thing .
Let me say that again : this is a good thing .
Ignorance breeds in the dark recesses of a culture .
It thrives when it ’s allowed to grow and fester free of scrutiny .
But when you throw harsh light on it , when you force it to stand and face the reality that educated , enlightened , progressive people are n’t afraid of it , that they relish the opportunity to face off , to take a stand on their principles , well , that ’s a little different story .
No , you ca n’t intimidate ignorance into some kind of magical , After School Special transformation just by standing up to it , because you do n’t stamp racism out overnight .
But that ’s precisely the approach that ensures eventual victory .
We will not tolerate your ignorance .
We will not be intimidated by your threats .
We will not fear the hood .
Because what we believe in does n’t need to hide .
In this election campaign , let ’s invite the Klan and its fellow hate groups out into the light .
Let ’s get their hoods off of them .
Let ’s show all their videos .
Let ’s make sure that everybody gets to read their brochures and visit their Web sites .
Let ’s hand the microphone to their most eloquent speakers and stand aside .
Let ’s get them front and center and make sure America sees , in all its slack - jawed , toothless glory , precisely what racism looks like .
Let ’s understand that the polls are probably going to lie to us – there will be a 5 % closet racist error , so a reported 10 % Obama lead is really a 5 % lead – and let ’s all work 5 % harder .
And above all , when we hear racist code masquerading as legitimate , issues - based messaging , let ’s not be afraid to say “ excuse me , but will you take off your hood ? ”
It ’s decision time , and I ’m ready for a referendum on hate .
How about you ?
Flexing Muscles in Moscow Russia Displays its Military Pomp on Red Square
For the first time since the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union , Moscow has put on an arms parade to celebrate the defeat of Nazi Germany .
Russians are impressed with the military show of strength , but in Eastern Europe the parade has reawakened old fears .
All eyes were on Darrell as he swaggered past the rows of cubicles .
Darrell was different than the other developers -- sharply dressed in an expensive suit with designer sunglasses dangling from his breast pocket .
He left shortly after arriving with a huge smile on his face .
The interview had gone well .
The company -- a midsize logistics software provider out of New England -- had been falling behind schedule and delivering their custom reporting tools with more and more bugs .
Darrell had successfully sold himself as the company 's savior who could improve code quality and deliver faster than the others .
Darrell was a C# guru who would work for no less than almost double what the other contractors were paid .
Even better for Darrell , he'd get to work from home , remoting in to an on - site workstation -- a perk which none of the other contractors received .
Code Freeze
When Darrell returned home , he got right to work .
He spent a few hours familiarizing himself with the app he'd be maintaining -- a custom - built system that tracked inventory , scheduling and members for several libraries in the area .
After paging through a few files , he knew he had to make changes to several core modules .
He returned to the office the same day to berate the other developers for their unacceptably lousy code .
" I 'll fix this awful code , but then I need you all to follow my standards , " he told them .
Darrell took it up with management , who immediately enacted a code freeze -- for everyone except Darrell .
That 'd give him the opportunity to fix all of the modules that no one had even realized were broken .
So for three days , Darrell coded furiously while the rest of the staff watched YouTube videos and honed their solitaire skills .
On a Friday afternoon , he showed up to the office in his characteristic suit and sunglasses , announcing to the staff that he 'd finished .
" You guys use your weekend to examine all the changes I made .
This is the way experts code !
I want all future code to look like mine . "
Breaking Changes
Job , a longtime developer at the company , had been wondering the whole time what was so bad about the old code .
He was eager to see Darrell 's updates .
Breaking out his trusty diff tool , Job found that the only changes were tests for equality .
The old code looked like this :
if ( customer == null ) { throw CustomerNotFoundExcepetion ( ) ; }
And the new code was :
if ( customer . Equals ( null ) ) { throw CustomerNotFoundExcepetion ( ) ; }
The irony being that System .
Object 's . Equals ( ) is an instance method , and would throw a NullReferenceException if " customer " was , in fact , null .
Darrell 's changes did nothing but break existing functionality and cause the wrong exception to be thrown .

Darrell made other so - called improvements to the code .
His next change was to re-tab every file in the solution with a code - formatting utility .
The merge tool struggled with all of the whitespace changes , so it was up to the rest of the team to merge the changes : change by change , line by line , file by file .
In an eight - day programming blitz , Darrell checked dozens of files out of the main branch in their source control , and was apparently so busy improving the code that he never got a chance to check them back in .
Other developers on the team were getting miffed , because they needed to edit the modules and had no way to access them .
Worse still , Darrell had vanished -- he was n't answering his phone or responding to e-mail .
The team was skeptical that he was doing anything .
Complaints eventually bubbled up to management , who summoned Job to join in a conference call with Darrell .
And finally , Darrell answered the phone .
" Darrell , we 've been noticing some delays in your check - ins , " Job 's supervisor began .
" Delays ?
What delays ?!
Everything 's done ! " exclaimed Darrell .
" I 've even done next month 's work for no extra charge .
It 's just a lousy connection on your end -- you really need to update your connection .
Right now I can't connect or even ping it ! "
" Why did n't you let us know about this sooner ?
I 'll restart it now . "
" No , do n't touch it ! "
It was too late , though .
Job and his supervisor were sitting near Darrell 's on - site computer , so Job had reached over to turn the monitor on .
To their surprise , it was in the middle of downloading a torrent .
And the cursor was moving .
While Job watched Darrell 's session , Darrell kept complaining : " I can't believe you have such old network equipment .
I 've been trying to connect for hours !
Why have n't you bought newer network equipment ? "
Darrell opened up an IE window and went to eTrade .
He sold a few shares of one of his stocks .
" We have n't been able to get the budget approved , " said Job 's supervisor .
" But maybe you'd be willing to help with the $ 7,000 in stock you just sold on eTrade . "
" ... "
Darrell 's contract was cancelled that day , and management began requiring more rigorous technical assessments as part of the interview process .
For the first time ever , scientists have been able to measure the regional concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , a research team from Germany 's Bremen University announced on Tuesday , March 18 .
The highest concentration of human - generated CO2 can be found in western Germany , said the scientists in a report published in the technical magazine " Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussion . "
The region has traditionally been an industrial center and is considered the heart of Germany 's coal and steel sectors .
" We 're certain that the raised CO2 concentrations can be attributed to human activities because the patterns in this European urban area are very stabile , " said researcher Michael Buchwitz from the Institute for Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen .
Carbon dioxide is one of the biggest culprits behind climate change , experts say .
The main source of CO2 emissions is burning fossil fuels like oil , coal and gas .
Unique measuring instrument
It can be difficult to determine whether atmospheric CO2 was created locally or was blown in from elsewhere , Buchwitz said .
Since there are already large amounts of CO2 in the air -- 3,000 billions tons globally -- even a relatively large source of emissions would n't raise the regional density of the harmful gas .
Furthermore , CO2 levels are also affected by seasonal changes .
In the spring and summer , the blooming plants absorb much of the gas , which is released again in the fall and winter .
The research term used a unique tool to help circumvent these challenges .
The measuring device , Sciamachy ( Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography ) , was built by the German Aerospace Center and has orbited the earth onboard a satellite since 2002 .
It is currently the only instrument in existence that is able to detect CO2 levels close to the Earth 's surface .
Sciamachy measures the amount of sunlight reflected from the earth and the atmosphere .
Since each type of gas reflects light differently , they can be identified by evaluating the corresponding levels of reflection .
The study was based on data collected from Sciamachy over a three - year period .
Ex -Prosecutor Tells of Push by Pentagon on Detainees
By WILLIAM GLABERSON

GUANTÃ NAMO BAY , Cuba –
The former chief prosecutor here took the witness stand on Monday on behalf of a detainee and testified that top Pentagon officials had pressured him in deciding which cases to prosecute and what evidence to use .
The prosecutor , Col. Morris D. Davis of the Air Force , testified that Pentagon officials had interfered with his work for political reasons and told him that charges against well - known detainees “ could have real strategic political value ”  and that there could be no acquittals .
His testimony completed one of the more unusual transformations in the contentious history of GuantÃ¡namo .
Colonel Davis , who is on active duty as a senior Air Force official and was one of the Pentagon ’s most vocal advocates of the GuantÃ¡namo military commissions , has become one of the most visible critics of the system .
Testifying about his assertions for the first time , Colonel Davis said a senior Pentagon official who oversaw the military commissions , Brig .
Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann of the Air Force Reserve , reversed a decision he had made and insisted that prosecutors proceed with evidence derived through waterboarding of detainees and other aggressive interrogation methods that critics call torture .
Called to the stand by a Navy defense lawyer and testifying before a military judge , Colonel Davis said General Hartmann directed him last year to push war crimes cases here quickly .
He said the general was trying to give the system legitimacy before a new president took office .
He testified that General Hartmann referred to the long difficulties the Pentagon had had in operating the military commissions and said , “ If we do n’t get some cases going before the election , this thing ’s going to implode . ” 
Spokesmen for the Pentagon and General Hartmann declined to comment on Monday , saying that the questioning was continuing before the military judge .
In the past , they have said that they disagreed with some of Colonel Davis ’s assertions .
The extraordinary testimony featured Colonel Davis , in uniform and perspiring slightly in an air - conditioned courtroom , being cross-examined by his successor , Col. Lawrence J. Morris of the Army .
The two uniformed officers faced each other with natural military politeness , giving way occasionally to a brisk question or stiff response .
The awkward moment of one military officer ’s taking on another occurred because lawyers for a detainee facing war crimes charges called Colonel Davis to the stand after he had given news interviews criticizing General Hartmann and the running of the military commissions .
The defense lawyers for the detainee , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , once a driver for Osama bin Laden , said Colonel Davis ’s contentions amounted to unlawful influence over the prosecution .
In his cross-examination , Colonel Morris did not attack Colonel Davis wholesale .
But he had Colonel Davis acknowledge that he had filed the charges against Mr. Hamdan himself and that he never had concerns about any of the charges or the way the evidence was obtained .
In his time as chief prosecutor , Colonel Morris asked , had not Colonel Davis endorsed every specification of every charge against the man prosecutors say helped Mr. bin Laden elude capture after the Sept. 11 attacks ?
“ I never had any doubts , ”  Colonel Davis said , “ about Mr. Hamdan ’s guilt . ” .
Although Colonel Davis completed his testimony , the hearing is to continue on Tuesday .
Mr. Hamdan sat quietly as the small drama unfolded Monday afternoon , listening to a Yemeni translation through earphones .
But in the morning , he briefly brought the proceedings to a halt .
He appeared in court looking disheveled and obtained permission to address the judge .
His lawyers have said that he is suffering depression and is so warped by years in what they call solitary confinement here that he cannot focus on his case .
“ My question is , ”  Mr. Hamdan said , “ the animal has rights or not ?
But the human being does n’t have rights ? ” 
For a moment , Mr. Hamdan said he was dismissing his lawyers and rose to leave the courtroom .
The Navy military judge , Keith Allred , said he knew Mr. Hamdan was upset about the conditions of his confinement and reminded him that his lawyers had scheduled a legal challenge on that question that might be heard before the trial is scheduled to begin in late May .

Why I Dislike C++ For Large Projects
By Mark Roulo
12 -June -2001
In a large program with raw pointers , the quality of the program will largely be driven by the least talented members of the team .
This makes it highly dangerous to select a language that requires all the programmers to be in , say , the top 25 % of the talent pool .
Given a team with 10 developers ( and my projects typically have more like 40 - 50 ) , this seems to be asking for lots of long term trouble .
Things become even more unstable when one considers that the average turnover of software developers in Silicon Valley ( where I live and work ) is something like 20 - 25 % and that many large projects also use contractors .
The total number of programmers on a project will be much higher than the average ( or even the peak ) number of developers on the project .
I have worked on a project with both C++ and Java components ( roughly 50 % each ) that communicate via CORBA .
Part of my job has been to interview candidates for both halves of the project over a period of several years .
This has given me a fair amount of exposure to the C++ developer pool .
As part of my standard interview for C++ candidates I ask them to write me a small class with the intention of evaluating their command of the language .
This also gives us a reasonable coding sample to discuss during the interview .
I can ask about potential improvements , extensions and testing strategies .
Most of the candidates I interview have already made it to the top of the resume pool -- usually by claiming at least 3 years professional experience with C++.
Since many resumes have this , the candidates tend to have some other plus : large systems experience , degree from a good school , personal recommendation , etc .
The candidates then must survive a phone screen interview whose job is to weed out candidates that can't , for example , describe any of their projects coherently .
My request is to :
Write a Named Point class with three members : two floating point values for the coordinates on an X - Y plane , and a name represented as a ' char *'.
Assume that this class will be used for some sort of wargame or simulation program that treats the world as flat and that these named points will be used to represent things like cities , battlefields , etc .
A typical first try looks something like this :
class NamedPoint { private : float x ; float y ; char * name ; public : NamedPoint ( float x , float y , char * name ) { this ->x = x ; this ->y = y ; this -> name = name ; } float getX ( ) { return x;} float getY ( ) {return y;} char * getName ( ) { return name ;} void setX ( float x ) { this ->x = x;} void set Y ( float y ) { this ->y = y;} void setName ( char * name ) { this -> name = name ;} } ;
name has its encapsulation violated with the getName ( ) method .
has its encapsulation violated with the method .
The code calling the constructor is responsible for managing the scope of the member variable ' name ' .
This code fragment shows the problem :
// Ignore for now a lot of awfulness in this function ... // this should probably be a constructor in a sub-class // of NamedPoint , ' cityName ' and ' countryName ' should be // checked for NULL _and_ for length so that sprintf ( ) // does n't overrun temp ... // //
The point is that if NamedPoint does n't * own * its own // ' name ' value , the clients are at risk of memory corruption .
// NamedPoint makeCityCoordinate ( float x , float y , char * cityName , char * countryName ) { char temp [ 80 ] ; sprintf ( temp , " City : %s , Country : %s " , cityName , countryName ) ; return NamedPoint ( x , y , temp ) ; }
class NamedPoint { private : float x ; float y ; char * name ; public : NamedPoint ( float x , float y , char * name ) { this ->x = x ; this ->y = y ; this -> name = new char[ strlen ( name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this -> name , name ) ; } float getX ( ) { return x;} float getY ( ) {return y;} const char * getName ( ) { return name ;} void setX ( float x ) { this ->x = x;} void set Y ( float y ) { this ->y = y;} void setName ( char * name ) { this -> name = new char[ strlen ( name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this -> name , name ) ; } } ;
It does n't have a destructor , so it leaks memory .
setName ( ) does n't delete name , so it leaks more memory if setName ( ) is called .
does n't delete , so it leaks more memory if is called .
strlen( NULL ) and strcpy ( NULL ) are bad .
Usually , a program will crash if this is attempted , so we really should check for NULL .
class NamedPoint { private : float x ; float y ; char * name ; public : NamedPoint ( float x , float y , char * name ) { this ->x = x ; this ->y = y ; if ( name == NULL ) this -> name = NULL ; else { this -> name = new char[ strlen ( name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this -> name , name ) ; } } ~ NamedPoint ( ) { if ( name != NULL ) delete name ; } float getX ( ) { return x;} float getY ( ) {return y;} const char * getName ( ) { return name ;} void setX ( float x ) { this ->x = x;} void set Y ( float y ) { this ->y = y;} void setName ( char * name ) { if ( this -> name != NULL ) delete this -> name ; if ( name == NULL ) this -> name = NULL ; else { this -> name = new char[ strlen ( name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this -> name , name ) ; }} } ;
NamedPoint allocates with ' new [ ] ' but deletes with ' delete ' .
This may or may not work depending on the compiler .
It seems to work fine for most current compilers , so I rarely comment on this .
Still , it is incorrect .
Testing for NULL before calling delete is unnecessary ( since ' delete 0 ' is defined to be harmless ) , but causes no damage other than slowing down the program slightly .
NamedPoint now trashes the heap if any NamedPoint objects are passed by value ( like , for example , returning a NamedPoint object from a function ) .
This is because the copy constructor that C++ gives us for free copies the ' name ' pointer , but does not copy the contents .
Now , calling the destructor on the first shared ' name ' returns the memory to the heap ( although the second copy will continue to use it , EVEN IF THE MEMORY GETS ALLOCATED TO SOME OTHER USE ) .
Calling the destructor on the second shared ' name ' probably corrupts the heap by deleting memory that was not , at that time , allocated ( the second delete is n't required to corrupt the heap , but this is how most C++ heap managers work ) .
It has similar problems with the default assignment operator .
class NamedPoint { private : float x ; float y ; char * name ; public : NamedPoint ( float x , float y , char * name ) { this ->x = x ; this ->y = y ; if ( name == NULL ) this -> name = NULL ; else { this -> name = new char[ strlen ( name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this -> name , name ) ; } } ~ NamedPoint ( ) { if ( name != NULL ) delete name ; } // NOTE : Most interviewees start with a signature // like this : // NamedPoint ( NamedPoint copy ) // NamedPoint ( const NamedPoint & copy ) { this ->x = copy.x ; this ->y = copy.y ; if ( copy.name != NULL ) { this -> name = new char [ strlen ( copy.name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this -> name , copy.name ) ; } } NamedPoint & operator= ( const NamedPoint & copy ) { this ->x = copy.x ; this ->y = copy.y ; if ( this -> name != NULL ) delete this -> name ; if ( copy.name != NULL ) { this -> name = new char [ strlen ( copy.name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this ->name , copy.name ) ; } //
Note that we have n't nulled out this -> name , so // we can get a double - delete problem ... } float getX ( ) { return x;} float getY ( ) {return y;} const char * getName ( ) { return name ;} void setX ( float x ) { this ->x = x;} void set Y ( float y ) { this ->y = y;} void setName ( char * name ) { if ( this -> name != NULL ) delete this -> name ; if ( name == NULL ) this -> name = NULL ; else { this -> name = new char[ strlen ( name ) + 1 ] ; strcpy ( this -> name , name ) ; }} } ;
I usually stop here ( assuming we get this far ) .
Conclusion
Pointer assignment ( a C legacy ) makes it too easy to corrupt the stack and heap .
The initial solution allows the stack to be accessed after it has gone out of scope .
Corrected versions often allow for double deletes of heap allocated storage or accessing already deleted heap storage or both .
The default copy constructor and assignment operator are too often wrong .
But you get them unless you explicitly take action .
The language default being fatally wrong is a big problem .
delete and delete [ ] are similar , but possibly different .
NULL is legal for many pointer values , but the behavior tends to be undefined ( delete being one nice exception ) .
Since the NULL case is frequently overlooked , memory corruption again seems to be designed in to large systems .
Larger programs encounter even more tricky problems .
Scott Meyers has written two book on the subject of not getting killed by the C++ language .
My point , though , is that most experienced C++ programmers I have interviewed can't get a simple class correct , even after multiple tries .
Enough said .
It makes me unwilling to risk a large project with the language .
Publication was delayed six months so that Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , the current Army chief of staff and former top commander in Iraq , could be interviewed and senior Army leaders could review a draft .
The study ’s authors were instructed not to shy away from controversy while withholding a final verdict on whether senior officials had made mistakes that decisively altered the course of the war , said Col.
Timothy R. Reese , the director of the Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , who , along with Donald Wright , a civilian historian at the institute , oversaw the volume ’s preparation .
Even so , the study documents a number of problems that hampered the Army ’s ability to stabilize the country during Phase IV , as the postwar stage was called .
“ The Army , as the service primarily responsible for ground operations , should have insisted on better Phase IV planning and preparations through its voice on the Joint Chiefs of Staff , ” the study noted .
“ The military means employed were sufficient to destroy the Saddam regime ; they were not sufficient to replace it with the type of nation - state the United States wished to see in its place . ”
For his part , General Franks said through an aide that he had covered Iraq decisions in his book and had not seen the forthcoming report .
The report focuses on the 18 months after President Bush ’s May 2003 announcement that major combat operations in Iraq were over .
It was a period when the Army took on unanticipated occupation duties and was forced to develop new intelligence - gathering techniques , armor its Humvees , revise its tactics and , after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal , review its detention practices .
A big problem , the study says , was the lack of detailed plans before the war for the postwar phase , a deficiency that reflected the general optimism in the White House and in the Pentagon , led by then - Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld , about Iraq ’s future , and an assumption that civilian agencies would assume much of the burden .
Affidavit : Girl says she was beaten , raped at polygamist ranch Affidavit : Girl reports beatings , rape at polygamist ranch
SAN ANGELO —
The 16 - year - old girl whose call prompted a raid on a West Texas polygamist compound said she had been repeatedly beaten and sexually assaulted by her husband , according to documents released today by the state .
The girl first called a local family violence shelter on March 29 , saying she had been spiritually married to a 49 - year - old man when she was 15 , that she had an 8 - month - old baby fathered by him and that she was pregnant again .
She said she was being held against her will at the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ' Yearning For Zion Ranch in nearby Schleicher County
According to the documents , the girl said the man had last beaten her on Easter , and that on one occasion , he had beaten her so severely that several of her ribs were broken and she was taken to the hospital .
She said he would force himself on her sexually .
A day later , on March 30 , the girl called with similar comments , but then , the document said , " She began crying and then stated that she was happy and fine and does not want to get into trouble and everything she previously said should be forgotten . "
As they have previously , child welfare officials today said they do n't know if the 16 - year - old is among children they have removed from the ranch , who now total 416 .
Her statement is part of an affidavit that child welfare officials plan to file in court Wednesday alleging a " pervasive pattern " of activity resulted in sexual abuse of minor girls at the polygamist compound .
The affidavit will be filed in support of the state 's decision to take temporary custody of the children , an action it took earlier with oral agreement from state District Judge Barbara Walther .
Many of the mothers of the children chose to stay with them , resulting in 139 adults also leaving the compound .
" There is a pervasive pattern and practice of indoctrinating and grooming minor female children to accept spiritual marriages to adult male members of the YFZ Ranch resulting in them being sexually abused , " said the affidavit .
" Similarly , minor boys residing on the YFZ Ranch after they become adults are spiritually married to minor female children and engage in sexual relationships with them resulting in them becoming sexually perpetrators .
This pattern and practice places all of the children located at the YFZ Ranch , both male and female , to risks of emotional , physical and / or sexual abuse , " said the affidavit .
Since authorities began their raid of the Schleicher County compound in Texas last Thursday , two men have been arrested .
Leroy Johnson Steed , 41 , was charged Monday night with tampering with physical evidence , a third - degree felony , according to the Texas Department of Public Safety .
Levi Barlow Jeffs , 19 , was charged with interfering with the duties of a public servant , a class B misdemeanor .
Authorities , who on Monday revealed one arrest had occurred , would n't say whether the teenager is related to Warren Jeffs , the now - imprisoned leader of the polygamist sect .
" In my opinion , this is the largest endeavor we 've ever been involved with in the state of Texas , " Marleigh Meisner , spokeswoman for Child Protective Services , said as the number of children in temporary custody grew Monday from an initial 18 .
Walther gave authority to CPS to take temporary custody of the children .
The agency is preparing affidavits on each child detailing abuse allegations .
Authorities continued to search for more children at the Yearn For Zion Ranch , although the effort was winding down .
Any additional children found will be removed , and the state will seek temporary custody , Meisner said .
Meisner said the women who left with the children are free to return to the compound , but none has chosen to do so .
Their quiet demeanor has made it difficult for the more than 200 child welfare workers who have come from across the state to obtain information from them .
However , an unknown number of men living at the ranch are not free to leave until police end their search , which began late Thursday .
Law officers have been moving slowly to search dozens of buildings out of sensitivity to the sect members , Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Tela Mange said .
" We 're just trying to make sure that we get done what we need to do while at the same time make sure everybody is safe and things do n't escalate , " Mange said .
She declined to comment on whether weapons have been found at the compound .
Teen mom still missing
Still missing is the 16 - year - old whose phone call complaining of having an 8 - month - old baby fathered by a 50 - year - old man sparked the massive raid .
The alleged father , identified by a search warrant as Dale Barlow , has been interviewed by deputies with the Mohave County Sheriff 's Office at his northwest Arizona home , department spokeswoman Trish Carter confirmed on Monday .
Carter would not elaborate on the encounter , but , according to the Salt Lake Tribune , deputies collected a sample of Barlow 's DNA and a list of people living at his house .
" ' At this time , our contact with Mr. Barlow is complete , " Carter said .
" We have not been informed of a warrant or any more information being sought . "
Barlow was one of several men that Mohave County prosecutors accused of committing sex crimes with underage girls in 2005 .
Last year , he pleaded guilty to conspiring to have sexual contact with a minor in one of those cases , according to court records .
Prosecutors dropped a second charge of sexual conduct with a minor .
Meisner declined to give details about the abuse or conditions at the compound founded by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
She said court papers would soon be filed detailing the allegations .
The FLDS went to court over the weekend in an effort to stop police from entering their temple .
Walther set a hearing Wednesday afternoon on the motions , even though the lawsuits said once a temple is desecrated by a nonmember , it would be irreparable .
Officers entered the massive white temple late Saturday after a tense hours - long standoff .
The removal of the children from the isolated compound threatens to overwhelm the local court and foster care system .
" We had a critical shortage ( of foster homes ) before last week .
So certainly that 's a little bit overwhelming , " Meisner said .
Already the children and mothers are living in crowded buildings at Fort Concho , the historic military site where they have been sleeping on cots since Sunday .
Meisner said the children could soon be taken to other facilities around the state while awaiting foster homes .
Within the next two weeks , each child will be appointed a guardian ad litem and an attorney ad litem to represent their interests .
A " full adversarial hearing " on the state custody has been set for April 17 .
The raid came more than four years after members of the FLDS , long based on the Arizona - Utah border , began arriving at this rural agricultural community .
The sect was led by Jeffs and believes in plural , arranged marriages that often involved teenage girls and older men .
Although there was widespread belief that underage girls were involved in sexual activity at the ranch , Meisner said authorities were unable to take action until there was a complaint or report of abuse .
Mainstream Mormons disavowed polygamy more than a century ago .
In September , Jeffs was convicted in Utah of being an accomplice in the rape of a 14 - year - old girl .
He faces additional charges of sexual conduct with a minor , incest and conspiracy in Arizona .
In 2005 , the sect 's relocation to his district prompted Rep. Harvey Hilderbran , R- Kerrville , to push for changes in the marriage law , including increasing the minimum age at which teenagers can marry to 16 , if they get parental consent or a court order .
Previous law allowed someone as young as 14 to get married with parental consent .
" Had this bill not passed , there would have been quite a few of them that were married and were pregnant for instance or married with kids that were under 16 that they could not have done much about , " Hilderbran said .
" I 've got some pride in it .
It 's one of those things I knew it was the right thing to do . "

There ’s a project I ’ve been interested in doing for some time , and I finally was able to complete it this weekend .
( I actually did it a number of years ago and wanted to see if anything had changed since then . )
Before you read further , try to guess the number of Christian groups at any one large college campus .
Also , try to guess the number of atheist groups , Muslim groups , Jewish groups , etc .
I wanted to get some hard numbers on this , so here ’s what I did :
I used the Wikipedia list of the Top 10 largest universities in the country as a starting point .
Each school on the list has over 40,000 students .
Some have over 50,000 .
All the major universities have pages on their websites specifically for student organizations .
It ’s easy to search for just the religious groups or just the special interest groups .
At many of the sites , it ’s also easy to see which groups are active and which groups are not .
I was only interested in the active groups — the ones that meet regularly and are recognized by the school .
To the best of my ability , I organized the clubs by faith and ( if necessary ) sect .
There may be mistakes along the way , so I provided the raw data .
Feel free to rip it apart .
I ’ll post an updated version when I make changes .
I can anticipate people saying I lumped too many different versions of Christianity together .
I separated larger sects out , but ultimately , some groups simply revolved around having faith in God whether they were athletes , accountants , or Asian .
Those are all “ Christian ” groups to me and there ’s no need to dissect them further .
The results look something like this :
Here ’s the PDF of the spreadsheet .
And here ’s the PDF of the raw data for the spreadsheet .
Amazingly , in the four years since I last did this , one thing is very clear :
There are a hell of a lot of Christian groups and only one atheist group ( if that ) on all these campuses .
I suspect this ratio does n’t change much at smaller schools .
Of course everyone has a right to start an organization .
I ’m not saying Christians should stop forming them .
I question why there is such a need for so many of them on any one campus , though .
I also wonder if the atheists are more united than the Christians on these campuses .
Are the groups larger because there is just one of them ?
Why is there never more than one atheist group at a school ?
I have my own speculations about the answers to these questions , but I ’ll stop here for now .
Maybe those of you interested in this info can take this a step or two further .

Trump , Biden spar over race , ' law and order '
Posted
Democratic nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump targeted each other 's record on race in America and the issue of ' law and order ' at the first presidential debate in Cleveland , Ohio on Tuesday .
Uninsured Immigrant Patients Sent Home for Care Against Their Will Woman in coma is latest example of an uninsured immigrant facing deportation .
May 22 , 2008  --
Hundreds of legal and illegal immigrants in Arizona are being sent back to their home countries , sometimes against their will , for medical treatment because they lack insurance .
In some cases , the FBI and police , responding to allegations of kidnapping , have been called in to halt such forcible removals , according to patients ' lawyers .
In one recent case , a sick baby who is a U.S. citizen born to an illegal immigrant was being transferred by helicopter to a waiting air ambulance for a flight to a hospital in Mexico when Tucson police intervened and brought the child back to the hospital .
The forcible removals are the result of federal and state law mandating that only U.S. citizens and legal residents are eligible for Medicaid .
As a result , state hospitals are pressured to transport noncitizens , even if they 're legally in the U.S. , at the hospitals ' expense , back to their home countries , at a cost of up to $ 100,000 .
The alarming scenario has come to light in recent weeks with the dramatic case of Sonia Iscoa Del Cid , a house cleaner in the country legally under temporary protected status , who woke up from a coma last week only to realize that she was going to be forced back to her native Honduras because she lacked insurance for long - term care .
The case galvanized the immigrant community in Phoenix .
On May 9 , hours away from being flown to a small hospital in Honduras , where Del Cid no longer has any family or friends except for an elderly father , her lawyer filed a temporary restraining order preventing the move .
Family and friends raised money through car washes , and received significant financial assistance from dozens of trial lawyers in Arizona , to pay the $ 20,000 bond ordered by a local judge .
This morning , the story seems to have produced a happy ending .
Because of Del Cid's remarkable recovery -– she is talking and has been taken off dialysis -– she likely wo n't require further treatment , and the hospital will no longer need to transport her .
" We reached an accommodation with the hospital , " said attorney John Curtin .
" Sonia has improved markedly .
It 's been a week without dialysis and she 's starting to eat softer foods , and she 's talking .
So the hospital is not contemplating moving her to Honduras . "
The hospital declined to discuss Del Cid 's particular situation because of medical privacy laws but clarified its policy on transporting uninsured patients .
" About eight times a month , we make arrangements to transfer patients to their country of origin , " said Sister Margaret McBride , vice president for mission services at St. Joseph 's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix .
" We 've had transfers to Asia and Africa by air ambulance , and we pay for transportation , which starts out at about $ 25,000 up to $ 100,000 . "
She said that the hospital is an acute - care facility , and it is obligated to plan for a safe discharge to the next level of care , which may involve months and years of treatment .
Most long - term care facilities in the state want a year 's payment upfront , which is a hardship for many of the uninsured who are not U.S. citizens ..
" It 's hard on us to make that decision , " Sister McBride said , adding that the hospital would fight for changes in the law .
" We do n't feel good about this because we 're caught in the middle , and we do n't have any recourse .
...
We 've talked to legislative folks and told them that we 're stuck in the middle . "
Del Cid , who has been in the United States for 17 years and has a valid work visa , fell into a coma after an emergency Caesarean section and hysterectomy April 20 .
Her newborn daughter , Juliani Milagros Mitchel , who was delivered prematurely , remains stable in the hospital 's pediatric intensive care unit .
Soon after the hospital told Del Cid's family that she would be flown to Hospital Escuela in Tegucigalpa , Honduras , family friend Maria Adame called Curtin and his law partner , Joel Robbins , to stop the transfer .
A spokesman for Hospital Escuela told the Arizona Republic that its intensive care unit has only four beds and lacks a dialysis unit .
" She does n't want to go back , " Adame said .
" Sonia 's lived here for half her life , and she has seven kids , all born here in Phoenix .
And she works legally -– she has her license to clean houses and she worked for a furniture company . "
The scenario was not unfamiliar to Fernando Gaxiola , an attorney who said he has prevented three attempted forcible removals of uninsured clients .
" One was a baby born in Arizona and because the parents could n't pay and they were Mexican , University Medical Center in Tucson tried to fly the child to a hospital in Mexico , " he said .
" They were waiting to move the child from the helicopter to an air ambulance when the police intervened . "
In another case , Gaxiola said one of his clients visiting the country on a tourist visa was transported from Tucson to a small town on the Mexican border .
" I called the FBI and the police , " he said .
" When the ambulance got to the border , the border patrol agent asked to speak to the passenger in the vehicle , who said he did n't want to be transported .
The police responded , and he got back to Tucson . "
A spokesman for University Medical Center , Katie Riley , declined to discuss specific cases but explained that the hospital has transported hundreds of patients back to their home countries .
" There are certainly some who are not happy , " she said .
" In most cases , long - term care [ facilities ] wo n't take people if they do n't pay .
And we have no choice . "

It ’s been five years since we headed down the rabbit hole to Iraq .
Reflecting on this milestone while visiting Baghdad a couple of days ago , Dick Cheney declared that “ we ’ve come a long way ” since the days of “ Mission Accomplished , ” describing the war as “ a difficult , challenging , but nonetheless successful endeavor . ”
Which in the topsy - turvy , up - is - down world of Iraqspeak means that we are still horribly , gut - wrenchingly screwed .
To commemorate the war ’s fifth birthday , here ’s a brief collection of some of Mother Jones ’ coverage of the challenges and difficulties of the past few years .
Or , as the vice president might put it , the Iraq War ’s greatest hits :
• Before 2003 , Iraq had no ties to Al Qaeda .
Now it ’s a terrorist breeding ground and distraction from the war on terror — the one that was against the Al Qaeda that existed before we created the new one in Iraq .
• Remember how Ahmad Chalabi conned the White House into invading Iraq ?
Suckers .
Hard - nosed journalists would have never fallen for his crap .
Oh wait — they did .
• So maybe it was a bad idea to take the soldiers involved in prisoner abuse in Afghanistan and send them to run prisons in Iraq .
• But then , the highest - ranking officer to be tried for the abuses at Abu Ghraib was let off with a slap on the wrist .
Clearly , there ’s nothing more to see here .
• Hey , Senator McCain — we know that it ’s hard to keep track of that Sunni - Shia thing .
Our “ Iraq for Dummies ” handbook can help .
• The good news : More GIs are surviving their combat wounds than ever before .
The bad news :
More than 3,900 have died .
And more than 4,600 have suffered serious head or brain injuries ; more than 1,300 are amputees .
• Saddam ’s WMDs were nonexistent , but he did have real , live weapons researchers whom the U.S. let slip slip through the cracks .
Just promise you ’ll keep that nefarious know - how to yourselves , guys !
• Public service announcement : Getting out of Iraq is gonna be ugly any way you slice it .
• So many lies , so little time — lies about WMDs , lies about progress on the ground , lies about torture .
We ’ve been collecting them in our “ Lie By Lie ” timeline — years of official mendacity at your fingertips !
No doubt the hits will keep coming in the year ahead .
By next March , Cheney will have moved on , but no matter who occupies the White House , the U.S. will will have spent another year in Iraq .

A trio of prismatic drops ( left to right : water , ethylene glycol and ethanol ) balances on a new ultra-repellent surface invented by scientists at the University of Wisconsin–Madison .
The surface , made up of silicon spikes just 400 nanometers wide , physically repels a wide variety of liquids , including water , oil , solvents and detergents .
Previously , scientists relied on chemical modification to make surfaces repel liquids , a time - consuming process .
In the end , each coating worked to repel only certain liquids , and oil - repellent surfaces simply were n’t possible to manufacture .
None Shall Pass :

The new surface blocks almost all liquids .
Researchers can also turn off the physical barrier :
An electric voltage instantly draws liquids down between each spike , where they spread out along the base upon which the spikes sit .
This switchable quality makes the surface perfect for controlling liquids in “ lab on a chip ” chemical reactors , and its super - repellent properties could help keep helicopter blades free of heavy , altitude - robbing water and ice .

In response to an LRC review of a ( Distortion of ) History Channel " documentary " on Sherman ’s march to the sea by Clyde Wilson , Valerie Protopapas of Huntington Station , New York , took it upon herself to go to the library and research Sherman herself .
Sherman ’s History Channel image of a heroic and benevolent egalitarian just sounded like , well , like a lie to her .
So out of the blue she wrote Professor Wilson ( who now describes himself as a recovering academic historian ) that " the truth about Sherman and his genocidal beliefs ( and tactics ) is , like Lincoln ’s views on race and slavery , well reported but ignored . "
That is , one can find the facts of history if one looks for them .
But when it comes to the War for Southern Independence , one will also discover pages and pages of spin , excuse - making , and rhetorical cover-ups .
History may be " well reported " in academic treatises and government documents , but as Mrs. Protopapas says , it rarely makes it into the public school textbooks or television documentaries , and is therefore ignored by the general public .
In her letter to Clyde Wilson , shared with yours truly , Mrs. Protopapas said that " I find it quite unique that after almost 150 years , purveyors of the myths surrounding the [ second ]
War of Secession retain not only their desire , but their ABILITY to hide the facts . . . of the era .
The same lies and half - truths continue to be presented as hard fact with every passing generation and all attempts at bringing even a modicum of well - documented facts ( such as the actual words of the men involved ) are met with a hostility every bit as virulent as was the case shortly after the war ended .
And they say that the South wo n’t let the past die ! "
This statement suggests that Valerie is familiar with the Lincoln cult , the Straussians , and the James McPherson / Harold Holzer / Doris Kearns - Goodwin school of " Civil War scholarship , " which she accuses of presenting a " murderous myth that makes saints of monsters and monsters of decent men . "
The following is a collection of some of the information about General William Tecumseh Sherman that Valerie Protopapas , an ordinary citizen who does not claim to be a " Civil War scholar " and who does not reside in the South , dug up about one of the more monstrous characters in American history .
She labeled her collection of information " Shermaniana . "
On Indian Genocide
Drawing on Michael Fellman ’s book , Citizen Sherman , the general is quoted as saying the following about the Plains Indians shortly after the war : " It is one of those irreconcilable conflicts that will end only in one way , one or the other must be exterminated . . . .
We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux , even to the extermination , men , women and children " ( p. 26 ) .
According to Fellman , Sherman " had given [ General Phillip ]
Sheridan prior authorization to slaughter as many women and children as well as men Sheridan or his subordinates felt was necessary . . . .
Sherman would cover the political and media front " and " maintained personal deniability . "
" The more Indians we can kill this year , the less will have to be killed next year , " wrote Sherman .
" They all have to be killed or be maintained as a species of paupers . "
Valerie quotes Professor Harry Stout of Yale Divinity School as recently writing that Sherman ’s " religion " was " America , and America ’s God was a jealous God of law and order . "
All those who " resisted " were " reprobates who deserved death . "
But Sherman ’s " religion " was not " America , " which at the time was comprised of some 30 million people .
His God was the federal government or , more specifically , the Lincoln administration and Lincoln himself .
This is what motivated Sherman , not the ending of slavery or anything else .
After all , the citizens of the Southern states were Americans and included the descendants of Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , Jackson , and Patrick Henry , among other notable historical figures ( Robert E. Lee ’s wife , Mary Custis Lee , was descended from Martha Washington ’s family ) .
It was Lincoln , not " America , " who defined obeying his own dictatorial orders as " law and order . "
There was no national plebiscite that decided to pillage , plunder and burn Southern cities and towns and murder civilians by the tens of thousands , as Lincoln ’s army did .
And even if there was , it certainly would not have been approved by all of " America , " as Sherman contended .
Lincoln won only 39 % of the popular vote in 1860 and still only 55 % in 1864 despite having rigged the elections by shutting down hundreds of opposition newspapers , imprisoning tens of thousands of political dissenters without due process , and having soldiers intimidate Democratic Party voters throughout the North .
The fact that he also had to recruit and pay hundreds of thousands of European mercenaries , and invoke conscription , speaks volumes about how popular his war was among Americans of the Northern states .
Moreover , it is absurd to label the bombing , pillaging and plundering of the entire South , along with killing its people by the hundreds of thousands , as " law and order " or the protection of life , liberty and property , as called for by the U.S. Constitution .
On Genocide in the South
Quoting again from the Fellman biography , Sherman said this about Southerners : " To the petulant and persistent secessionists , why death is mercy , and the quicker he or she is disposed of the better . . . .
Until we can repopulate Georgia , it is useless to occupy it , but the utter destruction of its roads , houses , and people will cripple their military resources " ( emphasis added ) .
Here you have a clear statement that Sherman ’s goal was to commit genocide against the people of Georgia .
Remember that his famous " march " was not met by any serious military resistance other than a few cavalry skirmishes .
It was almost entirely a campaign of death and destruction of civilians and their property .
And he wanted to " repopulate " the state with fine New England stock such as himself , the son of a New England lawyer of Puritan descent .
Readers who are familiar with the U.S. Constitution may find it difficult to find the part of the document that permits the U.S. government to murder its own citizens or to completely suspend the Constitution during wartime , but Sherman apparently read between the lines better than most .
" The Government of the United States has in North Alabama , " he once declared , " any and all rights which they choose to enforce in war — to take their lives , their homes , their lands , their everything . . . . war is simply power unrestrained by constitution or compact . "
" We will . . . take every life , every acre of land , every particle of property , everything that to us seems proper , " said the maniacal murderer in the blue uniform .
Writing to his wife in 1862 , Sherman informed her that " the war will soon assume a turn to extermination not of soldiers alone , that is the least part of the trouble , but the people . . . .
There is a class of people , men women , and children , who must be killed or banished . . . "
In a January 1865 letter to General Grant , Sherman once again explained his philosophy of mass murder : " We are not fighting against enemy armies but against an enemy people ; both young and old , rich and poor must feel the iron hand of war . . . "
Europeans , meanwhile , were comparing Sherman to the Marquis de Sade and predicting that future wars outside of America would likely be waged against innocent civilians , once Sherman ’s " success " was understood .
They also considered Sherman ’s war crimes to be the mark of an unsuccessful military man .
He did not establish any particularly stellar record as a military commander under fire ; his " forte " was the mass murder of civilians and acts of terrorism reigned upon Southern cities with weapons of mass destruction .
Lincoln always knew about all of this , as Walter Brian Cisco explains in his must - read book , War Crimes Against Southern Civilians .
He gladly rewarded and praised generals such as Sherman and Sheridan for murdering and terrorizing citizens — American citizens — all in the name of defending " law and order in America . "

Stickybot : Amazing Robotic Gecko
The State Department is hoping that these lizards will help gather info one day .
Mar. 26 , 2008  -- A Stickybot is a state - of - the - art robotic lizard that can scale smooth surfaces like walls and windows with the ease of Spiderman .
The Pentagon hopes to someday use the gecko - inspired device as a " spy in the sky " to watch over enemy territory .
Today on " Good Morning America , " the robot 's creator , Sangabae Kim , joined the anchors around the watercooler to talk about his amazing new invention .
According to Kim , the gecko can climb almost any surface , fast .
For example , it can climb glass surfaces at about a meter per second using an incredible feature on the bottom of its toe covered in nano - scale hairs .
The technology is called " directional adhesive stock " and is meant to imitate real gecko hair .
Stickybot has been featured in National Geographic .
You can learn more about Stickybot 's technology by visiting Sangae Kim 's website by clicking here .
South African writer Heidi Holland is one of the last non-Zimbabwean journalists to have interviewed Robert Mugabe .
She spent two hours with him last December after pursuing the Zimbabwean president for months .
This is her description of that encounter .
Robert Mugabe speaking to Heidi Holland during the interview While I waited outside Robert Mugabe 's office in the foyer of State House , his spokesman hissed at me to get to my feet .
Jumping up , I followed the frozen gaze of a dozen officials who stood to attention suddenly .
Behind my chair , Zimbabwe 's president had appeared in a doorway , motionless and staring straight at me .
I smiled but he stared passively back .
His eyes never left my face .
I felt he was trying to get the measure of me .
I had heard from his niece how he used silence as a weapon to unnerve his enemies and ensure that nobody knew what he was thinking .
Once I faced Mr Mugabe across his big desk , he apologised for keeping me waiting in a Harare hotel for five weeks .
His face remained expressionless , which is presumably why , having neither frown nor laughter lines , he looks so much younger than his 84 years .
The British spoilt things for the whites
Robert Mugabe
As one of the world 's most reviled leaders continued to study his visitor silently , I realised Mr Mugabe was almost as wary of me as I was of him .
The six officials in attendance did not move a muscle .
The tension in the room remained suffocating until I was invited by his spokesman to describe the book I was writing .
Mr Mugabe laughed uproariously when I related an anecdote from my interview with Lady Mary Soames , widow of Britain 's last governor in Rhodesia .
She told me how her English friends had urged her to send a disapproving letter to Mr Mugabe , with whom she once socialised , and how she explained to them that , having taken Zimbabwe 's president off her Christmas card list , she could do no more .
Lonely child Earlier , I had spotted a massive banner inside the presidency on which the words ' Mugabe is right ' were emblazoned .
His staff 's obsequious laughter each time he made a sarcastic remark confirmed that their conditions of service included internalising the idea that he can do no wrong .
What is lacking now are goods on the shelves - that is all
Robert Mugabe Mr Mugabe admitted having no lifelong friends and , as a lonely , bookish child , he recalled " talking to myself , reciting little poems and reading things aloud to myself . "
Tears gleamed in his eyes when he recalled the cordial relations he once enjoyed with Britain 's Royal Family .
He talked a lot about his " sacrifice and suffering " , words reminiscent of the Christian concepts he imbibed as a child in a Catholic mission school .
He told me that his granny was regarded as a heathen , explaining that he could only visit her when the European priests allowed it .
One of them became a surrogate parent after his own father abandoned the family .
I first met Mr Mugabe in 1975 , shortly before he crossed the border from what was then Rhodesia into Mozambique to wage war against white minority rule .
He came to dinner at my house , not to meet me but to talk to a constitutional expert , who was my friend .
He was quiet and pleasant , though he became agitated when his lift did not arrive and he thought he would miss his train at 2100 .
Seeing my friend could not drive , I decided to take Mr Mugabe to the station myself , leaving my baby at home alone .
Driving fast and in a panic , I told him that I had left my son unattended .
The next day , he phoned from a public call box to thank me for dinner and to ask if my baby was okay .
In contrast to his vitriolic public speeches , underneath there is a shy , softly - spoken man .
When I met him again last year , he remained the same , albeit more severe and distilled .
Bubble of denial
When discussing his infamous land grab , he referred pointedly to the country 's dispossessed land owners as " British farmers " and made it clear that he held Britain responsible for the bloody 15 - year - long war with his predecessor Ian Smith .
Mr Mugabe is obsessed with his sense of betrayal by the British .
" It was the British who spoilt things for the whites , " he told me .
On his reasoning behind the land invasions , he said : " We had hoped that the British would take notice of it and that they would say : ' Let 's meet and discuss this ' "
It became clear that Mr Mugabe has arranged himself in a bubble of denial to avoid facing what he has done in Zimbabwe .
When I suggested that his policies had caused the economy to collapse , he sat up straight , his eyes flashing .
" Our economy is a hundred times better , than the average African economy .
Outside South Africa , what country is [ as good as ] Zimbabwe ?... What is lacking now are goods on the shelves - that is all . "
It seemed to me that Mr Mugabe was showing he was completely out of touch with reality .

A reader asked me to check into information that President Bush was pushing a massive foreign - aid package to Mexico to help them secure their southern border against the flow of illegal aliens from Central America .
“ We ca n’t even get our own border straight , and we are going to provide Mexico with funding so they can solve their problem , ” the reader fumed .
“ I doubt the Central Americans are staying very long in Mexico anyway .
We know where they are going ! ”
Too outrageously outrageous to be true ?
Well , I checked it out and it ’s even worse than the reader described .
Far worse .
The plan is called “ The Merida Initiative . ”
Seems that the White House has had this plan in the works for nearly a year with little congressional input on either side of the border .
We ca n’t finish our own border fence , properly supply our immigration agents and border patrol with all the equipment and resources they need , or get our house in order .
Yet , the Bush administration wants to fork over $ 1.4 billion to Mexico and Central America–with much of it going into the hands of corrupt law enforcement officials and government bureaucrats who have worked tirelessly to undermine our immigration laws .
The funding is tucked into the 2008 supplemental budget .
Naturally , the State Department has taken a lead role .
They ’ve held meetings in secret and cut out members of Congress from discussion .
You ’ll love the explanation for the secrecy : Mexico is “ sensitive , ” you see .
Also , according to one expert , “ Mexico is very protective of its sovereignty and very worried about any incursion of U.S. security forces or private contractors — like Blackwater — coming in to train Mexicans . ”
Yeah , they ’re worried about incursions and sovereignty .
The State Dept. disclosed the first phase of the Merida Initiative last October , involving some $ 550 million in aid for inspection scanners , helicopters , surveillance tools , and case management software :
This partnership would support coordinated strategies to : * Produce a safer and more secure hemisphere where criminal organizations no longer threaten governments and regional security ; and * Prevent the entry and spread of illicit drugs and transnational threats throughout the region and to the United States .
To achieve these goals , President Bush has requested $ 550 million as part of a multi- year program to provide : * Non-intrusive inspection equipment , ion scanners , canine units for Mexican customs , for the new federal police and for the military to interdict trafficked drugs , arms , cash and persons .
* Technologies to improve and secure communications systems to support collecting information as well as ensuring that vital information is accessible for criminal law enforcement .
* Technical advice and training to strengthen the institutions of justice – vetting for the new police force , case management software to track investigations through the system to trial , new offices of citizen complaints and professional responsibility , and establishing witness protection programs .
* Helicopters and surveillance aircraft to support interdiction activities and rapid operational response of law enforcement agencies in Mexico .
* Initial funding for security cooperation with Central America that responds directly to Central American leaders ’ concerns over gangs , drugs , and arms articulated during July SICA meetings and the SICA Security Strategy .
* Includes equipment and assets to support counterpart security agencies inspecting and interdicting drugs , trafficked goods , people and other contraband as well as equipment , training and community action programs in Central American countries to implement anti-gang measures and expand the reach of these measures in the region .
The Brookings Institute issued more details and analysis in November :
For the past six months , without input from respective legislatures , government officials have quietly planned this joint endeavor .
The newly elected president of Mexico , Felipe Calderon , campaigned on a platform of citizen ’s security , committed $ 3 billion of federal funds to this priority and persuaded the Mexican army and navy to lead the fight against the drug cartels and the criminal networks .
The cartels and the networks are distinct , but drug money is the juice that feeds both enterprises : together , they have become an international threat to Mexican national security .
In this campaign , President Calderon found a strong ally in President Bush .
In March this year , they met in the colonial town of Merida to strategize on combating transnational crime .
In the interim , and out of public scrutiny , government officials drew up the technical elements of a plan , known as the Merida Initiative , to avoid any confusion with Plan Colombia .
Under the terms of this Initiative , the United States will commit 41 % of the $ 500 million grant to military equipment , which will include six brand new Bell 412 helicopters and two Casa 245 twin -engine aircraft .
Accompanying both is a two year agreement to provide maintenance and spare parts .
This represents a significant improvement over the gift of Hueys in the 1990s under the Excess Defense Articles program .
Those helicopters soon became inoperable and were cannibalized for spare parts , leaving a bitter taste by the recipients of “ hand me downs . ”
Now , the grant of new equipment , plus the maintenance and spare parts , assures the Mexican armed forces that we take collaboration seriously .
However , the planned use of the Casa aircraft needs to be discussed publicly , given its multiple and potential capabilities from medevac to cargo , to intelligence gathering , even to use as a gunship equipped with light cannons .
ORDER IT NOW
There is encouraging news in the Initiative that 59 % of the grant will be earmarked for civilian agencies responsible for law enforcement .
This is much needed , but the number and complexity of Mexico ’s security agencies will need more than cash to reform .
Multiple Federal agencies have earned a reputation for ineffectiveness and corruption ; among them , the Attorney General ’s Federal Investigative Agency , the Ministry of Public Security ’s Federal Preventive Police Force , the Ministry of Government ’s Center for Investigation and National Security and the Ministry of Finance ’s Customs Administration .
Furthermore , the 32 states within the Mexican Federation hold responsibility for crime control .
State security agencies and the courts have not protected the citizenry effectively .
According to surveys carried out by Transparencia Mexicana , the police and justice system are perceived as having worse problems of corruption and inefficiency than other public agencies .
If you subsidize it , you ’ll get more of it .
Which is exactly what Bush - Calderon Mexican stimulus package will do .
Add this to Dick Lamm ’s plan to destroy America .
At a little - noticed hearing ( finally ) on the plan last week , seems there was some opposition .
Rep. Gabrielle Gifford , D - Ariz. , questioned whether it was wise to assist Mexico at a time when the U.S. economy appears to be headed toward a recession .
“ Unless we have our house in order , putting millions into Central America and Mexico is not the solution , ” she said .
But I have n’t read about any opposition from Republicans .
Yoo - hoo .
Anybody home ?
Meantime , Mexico refuses to extradite criminal suspects who ’ve fled from the U.S. down to Mexico unless our prosecutors drop death penalty charges against them .
Oh , and just in time to mobilize pro-illegal immigration activists during this heated campaign season , Calderon landed in the U.S. yesterday for a five - day visit :
Officially , the five - day trip is billed as an “ encounter ” with Mr. Calderón ’s compatriots abroad , according to a statement from the president ’s office to the Mexican Congress .
But the visit could backfire , experts say , by putting the focus back on the hot - potato issue of Mexican migration … .
The trip allows him to “ reach out to Mexican communities in the United States , which he has n’t been able to do in his first year in office , and support them , and tell them they ’re not alone , ” said one official speaking on the condition of anonymity .
And it will help him to “ strengthen the relationship with the U.S. private sector ” as he tries to bring more investment to Mexico , the official added .
Mr. Calderón , other officials say , is also trying to reshape the immigration debate in the United States by showcasing the “ hard work ” and “ economic benefits ” that his compatriots represent to the U.S. economy and economic integration of the two countries .
“ Timing is everything , and the timing of President Calderón ’s trip speaks volumes – following Super Tuesday and on the eve of the remaining primaries , ” said Armand Peschard - Sverdrup , president of Peschard & Associates , an independent consulting firm .
“ He clearly will capitalize on the timing , plus some of his politically oriented meetings , to make sure he puts Mexico on the next president ’s desk and even try to shape the bilateral agenda . ”
Among the U.S. politicians Calderon will meet with : New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer , Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
He will also meet with Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , a prominent Hispanic leader who endorsed New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
No word on whether John McCain is on the schedule .
Perhaps Juan Hernandez will stand in .
I ask :
Whose sovereignty is in jeopardy ?

BONUS : The Awareness Test
Life Lesson :
It ’s quite easy to overlook the obvious .
Young people , in tenure track positions , feel they to have to collect as many authorships as possible .
Questions like “ Will I be a coauthor ? ” and demands as “ I have to be a coauthor ” are part of daily conversations in science institutes .
But not only junior scientists are eager to boost their cv’s with authored papers .
Seniors use their social status to fight themselves into the list of authors .
In a number of groups the list of authors is not discussed but imposed upon .
The boss decides .
Him being the last author is an axiom .
The issue of free riders imposed by the boss , gives rise to a lot of frustration on the side of the first author .
Tip
The question of coauthors only arises when the text is mature enough to be a concept for a paper .
Or when there is agreement on what material should be in the paper .
Discussing authorship earlier is a guarantee for friction .
A common mistake made by Ph.D’s and postdocs is to circulate concepts of papers with an incomplete list of authors .
If you are the first author and not yet sure about the complete list of coauthors put a placeholder in the list of authors : “ Your Name and Rest of Authors ” .
Somebody that spots a misled copy cannot ( yet ) complain as he might think he will be part of “ Rest of Authors ” .

Genetic mutation linked to walking on all 4s
Barcelona , Spain :
What are the genes implicated in upright walking of humans ?
The discovery of four families in which some members only walk on all fours ( quadrupedality ) may help us understand how humans , unlike other primates , are able to walk for long periods on only two legs , a scientist will tell the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics tomorrow ( Monday 2 June ) .
The quadrupedal families in Turkey previously attracted attention in 2005 , when they were discovered .
Now the Turkish team reports that they have found the first gene implicated in quadrupedal locomotion in these families .
Professor Tayfun Ozcelik , of Bilkent University , Ankara , Turkey , and colleagues , studied four unrelated families where some members were affected by the rare quadrupedic condition , Unertan syndrome , which is also associated with imperfect articulation of speech , mental retardation , and defects in the cerebellum , a part of the brain involved in motor control .
They found that the affected individuals in two families had mutations in the gene responsible for the expression of very low density lipoprotein receptor ( VLDLR ) , a protein which is known to be critical to the proper functioning of the cerebellum during development .
Although the families lived in isolated villages 200-300 km apart and reported no ancestral relationships , the scientists expected to find a single genetic mutation implicated in the condition .
They were surprised to find that this was not the case .
" We carried out genome - wide screening on these families " , said Professor Ozcelik , " and found regions of DNA that were shared by all those family members who walk on all fours .
However , we were surprised to find that genes on three different chromosomes are responsible for the condition in four different families .
" In families A and D there were mutations in VLDLR on chromosome 9 , and in family B the phenotype maps to chromosome 17 to a region that contains at least 157 genes , and we are still looking for the precise mutation .
Neither region appears to be implicated for family C. "
In all cases , the affected individuals were the offspring of consanguineous marriages , which suggests that if they had married outside the family they would not have had the condition .
All of them had significant developmental delay in infancy .
" Whereas normal infants make the transition to walking on two legs in a relatively short period " , said Professor Ozcelik , " these individuals continued to move on their palms and feet and never walked upright .
Although they can stand from a sitting position and maintain this upright position with flexed hips and knees , they virtually never initiate bipedal walking on their own . "
It has been suggested in the past that lack of access to medical care exacerbated the effects of an under - developed cerebellum , and that this led to quadrupedality .
" Although it may be true that family B lacked proper medical care , families A and D had consistent access to good medical attention , and both families sought a correction of quadrupedality in their affected children " , said Professor Ozcelik .
" Indeed , an unaffected member of family A is a physician , who has been actively involved in the medical interventions .
In addition , the parents in family A also discouraged their affected children from walking on all fours , to no avail .
We think that social factors are unlikely to be involved in the development of quadrupedal locomotion . "
Mutations causing VLDLR deficiency are also found in Hutterites , a group of Anabaptists who live in colonies of North America .
There , however , most of the affected individuals cannot walk at all .
The neurological characteristics of the affected members of the Turkish families and the Hutterites seem similar , with the most striking difference being that the Turkish individuals are able to walk on all fours , said the scientists .
They hypothesize that the Hutterites may be more profoundly affected due to the deficiency in VLDLR and a neighbouring gene , and therefore lack the motor skills even for quadrupedal locomotion .
Along with brain enlargement , speech , and the ability to make tools , upright walking has long been regarded as one of the key traits that have led to modern humans .
Professor Ozcelik 's team have opened a window on how mutations in VLDLR affect brain development and influence gait in humans .
" It will be interesting to see if the VLDLR gene is involved in other types of cerebellar ataxias .
In addition , we hope to identify the defective genes associated with quadrupedal locomotion in families B and C " , he says .

This is one of the many reasons why I rarely set foot in Marietta and I feel sorry for those of you who have to live there .??
Mulligan ’s Bar & Tavern in Cobb county ?has printed up ? racist t- shirts featuring cartoon chimp Curious George peeling a banana , with “ Obama in ’ 08 ” printed underneath and are selling them in ?
the bar .?
The owner , Mike Norman thinks there ’s nothing wrong with the T - shirts ? and calls them ? ” cute . ” ? 😯
Norman said those offended are “ hunting for a reason to be mad ” and insisted he is “ not a racist . ”
Why picture Obama as Curious George ?
“ Look at him . . . the hairline , the ears , he looks just like Curious George , ” Norman said .
He said it ’s just a coincidence that the character he chose for the T - shirt is a monkey .
Norman said proceeds raised from sales of the T - shirts will be donated to the Muscular Dystrophy Association .

Y’all can keep walking around like racism does n’t exist if you want to !?

Disgusting .
You know that magazine ad that says '' We get closer ' ' ?
If only they had known Weegee .
Weegee ( 1899 - 1968 ) got close to crooks , corpses and kids .
He climbed into paddy wagons to photograph the passengers , and crouched on the sidewalk where blood had been spilled .
He popped a flash in the stunned faces of accident survivors .
He photographed lovers and sleepers on the sly .
He crowded the mike when the fat lady sang .
Weegee was the ultimate news photographer in a newspaper career that ran roughly from 1935 to 1946 .
At home on the seamy side , he photographed New York with the sure instinct of a tabloid maven .
His city was a string of frightening events punctuating the necessary and sometimes boisterous rounds of courtship , socializing , rest and entertainment .
He despised the rich and was comfortable with the poor , having been , and usually being , poor himself , but he apparently loved those short of cash mainly when they were eccentrically photographic .
He was always happy to snap someone down at the heel , drunk , fat or foolish -- anyone a little exaggerated .
He came across as exaggerated himself without half trying , and he tried hard , trading on his unwashed , unshaven , brash persona to build up a reputation as Weegee the Famous .
'' Weegee 's World : Life , Death and the Human Drama , '' an enormous show of 329 photographs , opens today at the International Center of Photography Midtown .
Weegee 's archives of approximately 16,000 photographs and 7,000 negatives were given to the center in 1993 ; the exhibition material comes entirely from this collection .
The largest show ever devoted to this photographer , it includes many images never seen before or unseen for half a century , as well as some films by and about Weegee .
The exhibition coincides with the publication of '' Weegee 's World ' ' ( Bulfinch ) by Miles Barth , curator of the archives and collections at the center and of the show .
A Short History of " Choose Your Own Adventure "
Elementary school had a weekly trip to the library built into it .
At my school , there was a rotation : one day you did gym , one day you did music , one day you did computers , one day you did art , and then one day you did library .
A budding stylite even in youth , I mainly ignored the reading habits of the other children , because they had terrible taste , and we diverged so wildly that there was not even a question about making " book friends .
" I would be picking up another John Bellairs book , or maybe something involving the elusive Waldo ( for the art ; I knew where he was and still do ) , and they would be making a beeline for the " Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark " volumes , or fighting like cultists over the battered " Choose Your Own Adventure " books that had been checked out so many times they each had glossy plastic covers that had been manufactured with packing tape by the provident and virginal librarian .
Everybody read those damn books .
Even Gatlin
White , the scraggly , toenail - biting hulk who tendered and maintained his illiteracy like a prize bonsai tree read " Choose Your Own Adventure " books when his signature was not entered into the " caution book " in red , thereby banning him from checking out a selection .
I took them as a matter of course , like Sesame Street and Sunday mass , but I did leaf through them every now and then , and I remember being annoyed at the seeming arbitrariness of the blind choice - and - consequences protocol ( I preferred " Lone Wolf , " you see , but that is a story for another time ) .
You remember those books , just as well as I do .
According to studies , girls read them more than boys did , but then again , girls read everything more than boys did .
But where the hell did those books come from , and WHY did they happen ?
Were they inevitable ?
Are they still inevitable ?
Evidently , the idea came from a guy named Edward Packard , who stole it from a haunted Frenchman named Raymond Queneau who was a fucking surrealist mathematician and friend of Robert Desnos and Georges Bataille .
Packard took Queneau 's ideas for shapeless second - person story - dynamics - as - Hegelian - dialectic and instead wrote a book for kids called " Sugarcane Island " with the same basic mechanics .
Raymond Queneau : A reprint of Edward Packard 's " Sugarcane Island " : Packard tried to sell his idea all over town , like a man with a suitcase full of wacky dildos : everyone laughed and held them up to gawk , but no one was laying down cash .
Finally , this guy Ray Montgomery from Vermont said : " sure kid , sounds fun . "
And they started putting out books called " Adventures of You , " which sounds like a bad play that YOU would not go SEE .
From Wikipedia , which is probably true , because why would anybody lie about this crap : " R.A. Montgomery continued the original ' Adventures of You ' at Crossroads , writing and publishing Journey Under the Sea in 1977 .
Upon selling his interest in the press in 1978 , Montgomery brought the series to Bantam Books who was interested in starting a children 's book division .
Montgomery signed a contract with Bantam for six books in 1978 , and invited Ed Packard and another writer , Doug Terman , to collaborate by contributing books to the series .
" And shazaam , the second - person narrative craze targeted at the children of the 1980s and 90s was born .
Bantam struck motherfucking gold .
I suspect Bantam delivered these books to the nation 's elementary school libraries by the crate , probably as a result of some government subsisidizing - kickback deal we will never know about .
Between 1979 and 1998 when the series flat - lined , Bantam put out 180 titles , putting out more than 250 million flimsy , dinky books with big print in over 38 languages .
How many whores did those adventures buy for Packard and Montgomery ?
How much coke , how many non-disclosure agreements ?
How many trips by balloon to the Sahara , and how many tickets to see death duels by magical Tibetan monks ?
I guess the books were n't all awful .
There are actually some devoted fans out there , and the books evidently did allow some play with their aesthetic restrictions .
According to lore : " One book , " Inside UFO 54 - 40 , " revolved around the search for a paradise that no one can actively reach ; one of the pages in the book describes the player finding the paradise and living happily ever after , although none of the choices in the book led to that page .
The ending could only be found by disregarding the rules and going through the book at random .
Upon finding the ending , the reader is congratulated for realizing how to find paradise .
" I guess there 's something to that .
Teaching kids to uh , cheat , and that paradise can only be found by reading at random and paying no attention to plot or consequences .
Paradise .
See you there , everybody .
Is the series dead ?
It is not .
It is now in the hands of a company called " Chooseco . "
I hope that they donate handsomely to Planned Parenthood every quarter .
That is a name that must be earned , in my opinion .
According to an article for Publisher 's Weekly , Montgomery and his wife have revived the series and given it a hip , fresh international focus .
They have cherry - picked best - selling titles and updated them :
" The stories are set all over the world , " says Montgomery .
" And some take place in countries where the political situation has changed through revolutions or civil wars .
We 've changed the novels to depict that new reality .
" Really ?
So I guess " Darfur Rodeo Days " wo n't be the same book it was when I was a kid .
That 's a shame .
Additionally , Montgomery has put out " Choose Your Own Adventure : The Golden Path , " which is " an illustrated , interactive seven - book fantasy epic starring eight continuing characters . "
AND ( get your credit card ready ) , these books are packaged with a COLLECTIBLE CARD GAME , which I guess you can use to hack into the adventures of other yous who are also choosing their own adventure , in order to become the most you of all yous .
I hang my head .
I do not understand , and I never did .
I guess for me the fun thing about literature is getting to know other people besides myself , and the horror of the CYOA phenomenon is that it keeps kids in a suspended state of egocentric puling and obsession , giving them total control over the imagination of someone else -- a writer -- in a way that is graphically , deeply upsetting .
Is it an adventure if you can restart from the beginning and " fix " it ?
Or is it a game you can win ?
Literature is not a game you can win .
You always lose !
This site is all about easy cooking and what ’s more easy than putting some cereal in a bowl and adding milk ?
Nothing , I tell you .
Madison and I recently tried out the new EnviroKidz cereals , and I have to say I am impressed .
Being lactose intolerant , it takes a lot to impress me with cereal too , since I am pretty much am stuck eating it dry ( yes , I know there is soy milk , but I really do n’t like it and the Lactaid pills are super expensive ) .
The two cereals we tried were the Leapin ’ Lemurs and the Penguin Puffs .
I ’ve got one word for you : Yummy .
The Leapin ’ Lemurs are peanut butter and chocolate balls and the Penguin Puffs are a crunchy blend of kamut , quinoa and corn .
They both are low fat , gluten free , whole grain , and low sodium .
Did I mention organic too ?
This means no synthetic pesticides , no synthetic herbicides , no artificial preservatives or additives , and no irradiation .
I love that not only is the front cover of this box just awesome to look at , there is a lesson on the back of the box .
I learned that Lemur ’s mostly live in Madagascar and they have lost over 80 % of their living area to deforestation .
They also are being hunted for food and to be people ’s pets .
You have to love a good learning lesson at breakfast .
Another reason to get this cereal is that 1 % of their sales is donated to endangered species , habitat conservation , and environmental education for children .
It is amazing how together we can all make a difference .
Madison finished off the box of Penguin Puffs in two days .
She ate it for breakfast and as a snack .
The only reason we even have any of the Leapin ’ Lemurs left is because I hide the box from her after breakfast .
I even have to admit , I walked around snacking on this too , because it is really that good ( I ’m eating some as I write this review ) .
Now , I am not a mom who “ has ” to buy organic for her kids .
However , after eating this cereal , I might start doing so .
Its good to know that it can taste good and be good for you also .
Now , I ca n’t keep all this yummy goodness to myself , so I have arranged so two lucky winners can also try this awesome organic cereal !
Each winner will receive a box of Leapin ’ Lemurs and and Penguin Puffs too !
This is only available to the US .
Now , here ’s all you have to do :
1. Leave a comment on this post .

March 6 , 2008  --
For almost two decades , press coverage of actress Tori Spelling has told that classic Hollywood tale of the poor little rich girl .
Spelling had an almost make - believe childhood , one in which anything and everything was possible , including snow , in California , on Christmas Day .
" It was , you know , probably 80 degrees out in L.A. , and my dad took me outside and there was snow , " Spelling recalled .
" At the time , I thought , ' Every kid does n't have snow in their backyard on Christmas ? ' "
Best known for her role as Donna Martin on the hit '90s television show " Beverly Hills 90210 , " Spelling 's personal life has always seemed like it was also scripted for the small screen .
Her million - dollar 2005 wedding to Charlie Shanian was featured on the covers of glossy magazines , and her marriage - ending affair was exposed in tabloids around the world .
The actress has now embraced new roles as reality TV star and mother , and she has written a very candid and often funny memoir , " sTori Telling , " where she reveals a new version of growing up Spelling — her own .
Spelling 's father Aaron Spelling was one of Hollywood 's richest and most powerful television producers .
Her mother , Candy Spelling , is a beautiful former model whom Spelling felt never gave her the unconditional support she so desperately craved .
" Even when I was young , I just knew , " Spelling said .
" I knew from the beginning … it was complicated . "
In her book , Spelling describes a relationship so difficult and contentious that mother and daughter never even spoke on the day Aaron Spelling died .
Spelling says she learned of her father 's death from a friend , on e-mail .
Asked about the state of her relationship with her mom now , Spelling said , " I love my mom .
My mom loves me .
We do n't have an easy relationship .
I do n't think we ever will , but I 'd rather have a complicated , misunderstood relationship than have no relationship at all . "
Riches to Rags ?
Spelling had a hugely successful television career , but it always came with criticism that her father had gotten her the roles .
Spelling admits she got the " 90210 " role " from my dad , " but says she worked hard to turn what started out as a supporting character into a leading one .
Spelling says she was always her daddy 's little girl , and as most " 90210 " fans may recall , the Donna Martin character remained a virgin until almost the last season .
In her memoir , the actress says her father was the one who insisted the character remain a virgin .
She adds that what Aaron Spelling did n't know was that everyone in the " 90210 " cast pretty much slept with everyone else .
" It was pretty intense , " she said .
Growing up in the spotlight , Spelling says people have always made assumptions " that I 'm filthy rich , that I had all this money from my dad , that I live this extravagant lifestyle . "
But she says that soon after she got cast on " 90210 " she was on her own financially .
" I had a hit TV series , so I did n't really need [ my parents ] for anything , " she said .
All that changed when " 90210 " went off the air .
Spelling says that at one point she owed hundreds of thousands of dollars on her credit card and that she came close to bankruptcy , all because of her " bad shopping habits . "
" Bad shopping habits die hard , " she explained .
" In all honesty , I grew up a certain way .
I never had to worry about money … that was my reality . "
She says she was too proud to go to her father for help .
" That means , in my mind , [ that ] I was what everyone thought I was , taking money from my dad , the rich little girl that he paid for everything .
And I just refused to be that .
[ I would ] rather be bankrupt . "
To get herself out of debt , Spelling went back to work .
" I turned into my dad 's daughter and I started thinking of things to do , ways to make money , " she said .
In the next few years , Spelling took just about any television job that would help her pay the bills .
She also launched her own jewelry line , and in 2007 , along with husband Dean McDermott , she launched a reality show called " Tori and Dean Inn Love " that also features the couple 's son , Liam .
The third season of their show premieres in June on Oxygen .
' You 're Gonna Be OK '
Spelling also inherited money from her father , who passed away in 2007 .
But despite the enormity of the Spelling estate , Tori inherited just under $ 1 million .
Her brother Randy got the same .
Many were shocked by the relatively small size of her inheritance — except for Tori Spelling herself .
She had talked to her father about it before he died .
" It was a hard conversation to have with him .
I did n't want him to think that I was asking him for the money , or even talking about something so morbid as when he would pass .
But I thought it was a conversation I needed to have … for myself and for my brother , " she said . "
We had lunch and he said , ' You 're gonna be OK .
I made sure .
You 're getting just under a million . ' "
" I think part of me , in the back of my head , maybe hoped it would be different ?
But I hated myself for hoping it would be different , because I did n't want to take advantage , I did n't want to be that girl who needed , or wanted , my dad 's money . "
The bulk of the estimated half - billion dollar estate went to Candy Spelling .
Some of the rift between mother and daughter was mended when Spelling 's son Liam was born , but Spelling says she does not believe her mother will support her children financially .
At the end of her book , Spelling writes she always wanted to be normal , and have a family , love and safety .
She says she has that now , and with a baby on the way she 's looking forward to seeing that family grow .
" We 'd both love a girl , " she said .
" But I have mixed emotions about it because part of me desperately wants a little girl so that I can have the relationship that maybe I felt my mother and I did n't quite have .
And then on the other hand , I 'm scared that I 'll just kind of repeat the past and make similar mistakes that my mother made with me , maybe .
But I 'd like to give it a try . "

Google have announced their latest project – Google Health – which is a service where you can have your entire medical history uploaded into your Google account .
But before you start hyper- ventilating , Google has promised that everything in your medical records will be password - protected and therefore will not be publicly indexed in Google Search ( I certainly hope not ! ) .
The whole theory behind Google Health is that wherever you go in the world , your medical history will follow you .
I mean , how many times have you relocated to another part of the country or another country altogether and your medical records have been lost ?
Mine have been more times than I care to remember , so Google Health wants to help people like me keep their records in the one place , fully organized and fully digitized .
Never again will they go missing .
A fine ideal indeed but rife with potential start - up problems .
For a start , Google has to get people to trust them with sensitive medical records .
If you have an awkward / embarrassing medical condition , would you reveal it to Google and hope that they keep it to themselves ?
Many people may prefer just to keep the records with their doctors and rely on the good old fashioned doctor / patient confidentiality .
You may decide that you do n’t want to reveal your itchy you - know - what to your favorite search engine on the off - chance that it might one day get indexed after all .
Or what if the Health part of Google is hacked into and the records compromised ?
So Google has to really convince people that they have built an extremely secure site that cannot be breached by hackers and that all the records contained in the site are safe with them .
If Google does manage to convince people or if you decide you just want to give Google the benefit of the doubt , then just click here and log in with your Google account to begin .
I decided to risk it in the interests of experimentation !
Upon successfully logging in , you ’ll see this screen :
I have epilepsy and depression ( what the hell , I do n’t mind revealing it ) and so my medical history is quite extensive .
Not only do I have to tell Google Health about those conditions , I also need to tell them about the medications I am taking .
But I can start by clicking on those links on the left and adding my age , sex , height , weight , allergies ….. all the easy stuff .
When you start entering conditions , Google will offer you multiple choices for other conditions that have similar names , so make sure you choose the right ones !
I have n’t fully explored all the options yet but it looks as if you can scan and upload all your medical notes from doctors , if you can get a hold of copies .
Would I use Google Health ?
I probably would actually .
I am in the slow process of moving a lot of my life online and I like the idea of my medical history following me around wherever I go .
If I happen to be on holiday in another country and I am in an accident , a doctor there can go into my Google account and access my medical records right away to give me the treatment I need .
What about you ?
Would you use a service like this ?
Or do you not trust Google to keep your information safe ?
Authorities in Ciudad Juarez said Friday that they had uncovered the remains of 33 people buried in the yard of an abandoned property , a mass grave believed to be linked to the city ’s violent drug trade .
The grisly discovery surfaced as part of a recent government crackdown on narcotics traffickers in this city across the border from El Paso that has been gripped by a spasm of drug - related killing unseen in years .
Authorities said the Juarez drug cartel might be involved in the deaths .
The same area attracted worldwide attention for the violent deaths of hundreds of women and girls beginning in the early 1990s .
Many of the cases remain unsolved .
Acting on an anonymous tip , federal police on March 1 began excavating a weedy lot hidden behind a cinder - block wall in a low - income neighborhood on the city ’s west side .
Day one yielded six corpses .
It took law enforcement nearly two weeks to uncover the other remains , working with sniffer dogs , shovels and a backhoe .
Advertisement
All but three of the victims were men .
Some were dismembered .
Forensics experts said some of the corpses may have been buried for as long as five years .
Police confirmed the body count Friday .
The discovery stunned neighbors in the normally tranquil La Cuesta neighborhood .
“ We never imagined we were living across from a tomb , ” said one neighbor , who like others interviewed declined to be named for fear of reprisal .
It ’s the second such find in less than a month .
Federal authorities unearthed nine bodies buried in the yard of a Ciudad Juarez home in late February after a drug bust .

Security experts say the discovery of old graves is a result of recent government efforts to strike hard at Mexico ’s drug cartels .
Military and federal police have been deployed to Ciudad Juarez , Tijuana and other trafficking hot spots across the country , a strategy that has resulted in some major drug and weapons seizures as well as some high - profile arrests .
This week , Gustavo Rivera Martinez , an alleged leader of the Arellano Felix cartel , was nabbed in Cabo San Lucas by federal agents .
Mario Montemayor Covarrubias , identified by Mexican news media as a key leader of a kidnapping cell of the cartel , was arrested in Tijuana earlier this month after a seven - hour shootout with authorities .
Organized crime has resorted to unprecedented violence to intimidate informants and police .
Dozens of people have been killed in drug - related slayings this year in Ciudad Juarez , authorities have said .
Drug violence has claimed at least 70 victims in Tijuana .
Some have been mutilated and left with gruesome messages warning informants not to cooperate with law enforcement .
Police officers have been gunned down in their homes in front of their families .
In January , gunmen stormed the home of Tijuana Deputy Police Chief Margarito Saldana Rivera , 43 , killing him , his wife and his two daughters , ages 12 and 20 .
Hours earlier another high - ranking officer and his deputy were shot as they sat in their car at a busy intersection .
The attacks were believed to be in retaliation for the officers ’ helping foil the robbery of an armored car .

This week , gunmen also killed an immigrant safety officer as he patrolled a dangerous migrant - smuggling neighborhood near the border in Tijuana .
Organized crime ’s violent reaction shows that the latest crackdown is working , experts say .
“ I ’m inclined to believe that they are sticking with a confrontational policy that leads to these kinds of gun battles and high - profile shootouts , ” said Robert Donnelly , the coordinator of the Justice in Mexico Project at the University of San Diego ’s Trans - Border Institute .
In contrast , experts said the 42 bodies unearthed at the two locations recently in Ciudad Juarez did n’t appear to be part of the recent campaign of retribution , but a clandestine , almost routine , effort on the part of drug traffickers to reprimand members in their ranks .
“ If you have a problem with a distributor or someone who ’s selling the drugs , you do n’t file a lawsuit against him .
You just kill him , ” said Jorge Chabat , a security expert at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Mexico City .
“ It ’s a way of establishing discipline . ”

Seasoned observers of Ciudad Juarez ’s drug wars said the latest discovery had a decidedly old - school flavor , if only because the killers took the trouble to bury the bodies .
Since the 1990s , drug enforcers have evolved from dumping bodies in shallow graves to hiding them in car trunks to wrapping them in blankets to simply leaving them where they drop , said Louie Gilot , who writes about border affairs for the El Paso Times .
“ In the past they ’d be somewhat discreet , but they ’re getting bolder and bolder , ” Gilot said .
“ Now they just kill them in front of people in broad daylight . ”
Residents of Pedregal Street , where the 33 corpses were unearthed , said there was very little coming - and - going at the abandoned property .
It consisted of little more than a small garage - type structure and a weed - choked lot surrounded by a cinder - block wall and a solid , locked metal gate that blocked their view .
One neighbor recalled strangers entering occasionally on weekends , and smelling the smoke of their barbecue .

“ A lot of guys went in , but it was very quiet , ” the neighbor said .
“ We never saw luxury cars or anything suspicious . ”
Another remembered heavy vehicles entering with what neighbors thought might be loads of produce .
“ We saw trucks and trailers entering with fruit .
At least that ’s what we thought it was . ”

Today superdelegate Crystal Strait who is board member for the Young Democrats of America endorsed Barack Obama .
“ Barack Obama has shown a real commitment to young voters in his campaign and in response young people have overwhelmingly voted and caucused for Obama in these primary contests . ”
She continued , “ We know that if a young person votes three times in a row for a Party , they become a Party voter for life .
We know that because of high youth turnout in 2004 and 2006 , 2008 is the third and critical election for young voters .
And that ’s why I know I want to pledge my delegate vote to Barack Obama . ”
Strait is Obama ’s 276th superdelegate .
He is now only 155 delegates short of wrapping up the nomination .
I think an interesting thing to watch will be when Obama wraps up the nomination .
Will the flood of superdelegates continue and grow ?

Theoretically , the supers along with however many pledged delegates he earns in West Virginia and Kentucky could put him over the top before May 20 .
The sooner Obama wraps up the nomination , the more time the Party can spend on John McCain .

Okay , okay – that ’ll be enough of that .
Sure , Sen. McCain has a few miles on him , and yes , if he were elected he’d be the oldest person to ever hold the office of president .
There ’s even a Web site dedicated to making fun of his age by pointing out all the things that are younger than McCain .
For instance :
the margarita
the peanut butter and jelly sandwich
automatic transmission
the US Flag Code
Ron Paul
Woman ’s Day Magazine
nachos
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
the Zip Code
the Area Code
duct tape
the 12 steps of AA
penicillin
minimum wage
nylon
the Golden Gate Bridge
chocolate chip cookies
Alaska
Hawaii
plutonium
Mt. Rushmore
Israel
Keith Richards
DNA ( well , the discovery of DNA , anyway )
Ronald Reagan during his presidential years
the AARP
I think this meme is catching on , too , because everywhere I turn I hear people joking about it .
Complete strangers come up to me in the street and say things like “ John McCain is so old that his first job was helping build the pyramids . ”
A waitress at my coffee shop the other day informed me that McCain is so old he has an autographed Bible .
The bartender over at the Chop House says McCain is so old his first Christmas was the first Christmas .
It goes on and on .
According to the wiseasses McCain is so old :
he learned to write using hieroglyphics .
his prom date ’s dad was a Roman centurion .
his first driver ’s license photo was a cave painting .
he took driver ’s ed in a chariot .
he was one of the beta - testers when they invented dirt .
his memory is in black and white .
he learned to tell time on a sundial .
his first - grade spelling book was a stone tablet .
when he was a kid he had a pet dinosaur .
his prom date was Cleopatra .
he has all the apostles in his Rolodex .
Jurassic Park brought back memories .
his birth - certificate expired .
he has a picture of Moses in his high school yearbook .
when he was in school they did n’t have a history class .
he planted the first tree at Central Park .
I really ca n’t endorse all this , even in cases where the accusations are potentially accurate .
After all , I ’m hardly one to complain about someone ’s age .
Besides , age is n’t really the issue .
I can think of people older than McCain who ’d make fine presidents and America has millions in the prime of life who really should n’t be allowed outdoors off - leash .
No , the issue is n’t that Sen. McCain is so old his Social Security number is 1 .
Instead , it has to do with the plausibility of his me - too rhetoric of “ change ” in light of a well established record of … not change .
Hardly a day passes without further evidence that McCain ’s presidency would be little more than a continuation ( or expansion ) of Bush ’s imperial executive reign of error .
Just this morning , for instance , the NY Times reported this :
A top adviser to Senator John McCain says Mr. McCain believes that President Bushâ€™s program of wiretapping without warrants was lawful , a position that appears to bring him into closer alignment with the sweeping theories of executive authority pushed by the Bush administration legal team .
That does n’t sound like change .
( And change notwithstanding , it also does n’t sound like a very good idea for a nation that [ cue Lee Greenwood ] prattles endlessly about its dedication to liberty . )
Bush certainly sounds convinced that no change is forthcoming .
McCain Source catalogues the litany of continuity by noting the president ’s assertion “ that McCain would be the best to carry forth his agenda . ”
On “ 100 More Years ” McCain ’s foreign policy : “ he ’s not going to change when it comes to taking on the enemy . ”
And this bit is priceless :
During an appearance on MSNBC ’s “ Harball , ” Chris Matthews asked McCain , “ Does the president notice the pattern of your extreme loyalty to him ? ” McCain said , “ I call him every day and try to remind him . ”
[ MSNBC , Hardball , 3/13/06 ]
We find even less evidence of McCain ’s fervor for change when we examine his record of support for Bush ’s judicial nominees .
According to People for the American Way , McCain has voted to confirm every one of Bush ’s appointments .
All of them .
So if you like Bush ’s judges and “ Justices ” Alito and Roberts , you ’re probably going to be okay with four more years of the same .
And so long as we ’re looking at voting records and how closely McCain aligns with his mentor , what percentage of the time do you think Sen.
John McCain voted to support Bush ’s positions on issues facing the Senate in 2008 ?
Go ahead , take a shot .
You ready ?
That ’s right : 100 % .
Granted , he was a bit more maverick - like in 2007 , when the number was only 95 % .
But over the course of a year – 100 % .
And not just any year , but an election year in which he ’s trying to brand himself as a straight - talking , straight - shooting , express - driving maverick sonuvagun who kowtows to nobody , you lily - livered sodbuster .
I do n’t know about you , but I do n’t agree with myself 100 % of the time .
So call me cynical .
I suppose it ’s possible that , upon inauguration , McCain could morph into the second coming of FDR .
Anything ’s possible in politics , which is , after all , the art of the possible .
But only a moron walks into the voting booth more fixated on possibility than plausibility .
Fortunately for McCain , America is just packed to the rafters with morons , and their votes count as much as everybody else’s .
Yes , we should be cautious of the change rhetoric offered by Sen.
Obama , as well , because his record to date has n’t been exactly revolutionary .
But where his promises of change should be met with critical questioning , McCain ’s ought to be met with thunderous laughter .
Not because he ’s old .
Because he ’s lying .
Report : Right - wing operative outed Clinton aide 's trade talks Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 8 , 2008

Print This Email This Legendary right - wing hit man Roger Stone may have another Democratic pelt to hang on his wall , according to a new report indicating he was the catalyst behind reports last week that Hillary Clinton 's top strategist was working with the Colombian government on a trade deal the Democratic candidate opposes .
Stone got his start as part of Richard Nixon 's dirty tricks squad and his hand was seen in last month 's prostitution ring bust of former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer .
Now he 's being credited with helping bring about Clinton strategist Mark Penn 's demotion , according to Ron Gunzburger at Politics1 .
Infamous Republican hit man Roger Stone was directly involved in the downfall of Clinton campaign chief strategist Mark Penn .
Information printed by conservative columnist Robert Novak last Saturday that Penn 's company -- Burson Marsteller -- was kiting $ 3 million worth of polling bills in possible violation of the federal campaign finance laws , was supplied by Stone .
...
Stone was also the person who leaked word of Penn 's contract last week with the Colombian government to help strategize for a free trade agreement ( note : which Hillary Clinton opposes ) .
Novak 's column reported a $ 600,000 discrepancy between Clinton 's campaign debt to Penn 's firm ( $ 2.5 million ) and the firm 's expenses listed on behalf of the Clinton campaign ( $ 3.1 million ) .
The conservative columnist said the difference " has raised question of whether it constitutes an illegal corporate contribution or an illegal foreign contribution " because Penn 's firm is a subsidiary of a British advertising firm .
A few weeks earlier , Novak had noted Stone 's prediction of Spitzer 's downfall .
Attempts to reach Stone for comment Tuesday morning were unsuccessful .
Although the Colombian flap , which was first reported last week by the Wall Street Journal , apparently cost Penn his title as chief strategist , observers are speculating that little else has changed within Clinton 's inner circle .
Penn told colleagues Monday that he still would be a direct Clinton adviser , according to the Huffington Post .
His polling firm will continue to run numbers for Team Clinton .
The Washington Post reports that Penn was on a top - level Clinton campaign call Monday morning and will help the candidate prepare for her April 16 debate with Barack Obama .
The long arm of American law reached out and grabbed two senior executives of the United Kingdom 's largest defense firm .
BAE Systems , which has a North American subsidiary and does extensive business in the United States , is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice , which is looking at allegations that the company paid bribes to Saudi officials in exchange for defense contracts .
As part of the investigation , U.S. authorities briefly detained two of the company 's top leaders as they arrived at a U.S. airport .
" BAE Systems confirmed Monday that chief executive Mike Turner ( right ) and non-executive director Nigel Rudd were briefly detained by U.S. officials when they landed in the United States on business last week , " the AP reports .
" The pair were spoken to when they arrived at Houston airport , before they were allowed to enter the United States .
Turner has since returned to Britain while Rudd is on vacation at an undisclosed location , the company said . "
The aerospace and defense company is accused of running a slush fund to secure lucrative defense deals with Saudi Arabia ; the U.K. government quashed the investigation after the Saudi government threatened to end a lucrative defense deal .
The U.S. Justice Department can claim jurisdiction if those funds went through the U.S. banking system .
BAE Systems denies the charges .

In a 2006 study , the economist William C. Randolph of the Congressional Budget Office estimated who wins and who loses from this tax .
He concluded that “ domestic labor bears slightly more than 70 percent of the burden . ”
Image Credit ... David G. Klein
Mr. Randolph ’s analysis stresses the role of international capital mobility .
With savings sloshing around the world in search of the highest returns , he says , “ the domestic owners of capital can escape most of the corporate income tax burden when capital is reallocated abroad in response to the tax . ”
When capital leaves a country , the workers left behind suffer .
( According to Mr. Randolph , however , some workers do benefit from the American corporate tax : those abroad who earn higher wages from the inflow of capital . )
A similar result was found in a recent Oxford University study by Wiji Arulampalam , Michael P. Devereux and Giorgia Maffini .
After examining data on more than 50,000 companies in nine European countries , they concluded that “ a substantial part of the corporation income tax is passed on to the labor force in the form of lower wages , ” adding that “ in the long - run a $ 1 increase in the tax bill tends to reduce real wages at the median by 92 cents . ”
Despite these findings , a corporate tax cut as a way to help workers may strike some people as needlessly indirect .
Why not just pass an income tax cut aimed squarely at working families , as Senator Barack Obama proposes ?
The answer is that while most taxes distort incentives and shrink the economic pie , they do not do so equally .
Compared with other ways of funding the government , the corporate tax is particularly hard on economic growth .
A C.B.O. report in 2005 concluded that the “ distortions that the corporate income tax induces are large compared with the revenues that the tax generates . ”
Reducing these distortions would lead to better - paying jobs .
Of course , a corporate tax cut would affect the federal budget .
And any change in tax policy has to be made against a background of a looming fiscal crisis , which threatens to unfold as baby boomers retire and start collecting Social Security and Medicare .
In 2007 , corporate taxes brought in $ 370 billion , representing 14 percent of federal revenue .
Cutting the rate to 25 percent would seem to cost the Treasury about $ 100 billion a year .
Part of that revenue loss , however , would be recouped through other taxes .
To the extent that shareholders would benefit , they would pay higher taxes on dividends , capital gains and withdrawals from their retirement accounts .
To the extent that workers would benefit , they would pay higher payroll and income taxes .
Increased economic growth would tend to raise tax revenue from all sources .

Watching the debacle unfolding about Governor Spitzer and the unbelievable media coverage it 's generating is amazing .
It ’s hard not to chuckle at the indignation and response of the American public ; however the public perception of this matter is belied by the greater depth of the issue that affects every major city in America .
I ’m not making light of the hypocrisy he exhibited - but more on the naïveté of the general public .
No , I ’m not a sex therapist , nor am I a PhD in human sexuality , but I did own and operate three ( 3 ) Escort and Modeling Agencies in the 1980 ’s and am well versed on the subject .
Two turned - out to be state and federal “ sting ” operations , so I ’m aware of , and was part of the behind the scenes operations that involved the DEA , FBI , US Treasury Department , ATF , and state and local agencies too numerous to mention that were involved in those operations .
Granted , Governor Spitzer is somewhat unique ; but to me , it was n’t that much of a surprise to hear “ The Sheriff of Wall Street ” was ensnared in a sting of the type that he prosecuted himself while he was “ The Enforcer ” and acting as the Attorney General for the State of New York .
Did I personally suspect Governor Spitzer of this type of behavior before he was arrested ?
No .
But , when you learn the industry and understand what happens across America every day , the only “ surprise ” is that more high - level politicians have n’t been caught and prosecuted for something that ’s actually an everyday occurrence .
Has n’t anyone thought it was odd that the customer lists of Heidi Fleiss , the “ D.C. Madam ” , my own customer list for that matter , and those of other Escort and Modeling Agencies that have been uncovered in major cities across the United States are usually kept secret and unavailable to the public ?
You already know the answer , but I ’ll repeat it anyway ;
The customer lists are almost never disclosed - at least in their entirety , because Escort and Modeling Agencies service high - profile clients in every major city in America on a regular basis - and many of those lists contain names that are “ Pillars of their Communities ” and all too often , prominent politicians in every level of government , state , local , and federal .
Police and law enforcement officers also come -up on the lists - rarely I ’ll admit , as do Preachers , CEO ’s , and generally speaking , the “ clients ” represent the activities of a wide cross-section of affluent and Middle - class America .
The family of Ashley Alexandra Dupre , Governor ’s Spitzer ’s admitted “ escort ” was shocked and dismayed , understandably to find that their daughter , to put it in their words , “ got involved in something much larger than her . ”
It would shock many American families to know that many of their daughters ( and sons ) , whom number in the thousands , ply the sex trade by working as Exotic Dancers and Escorts in almost every small to large city in the United States .
Many of them are college students who work at night and study by day - some who one day will emerge as Doctors , Lawyers , and yes , even as teachers .
We ’re not talking about hookers that walk the streets , but the ladies of the night that work for the thousands of Escort and Modeling Agencies that pepper the country , and yes , there ’s a difference between the street - walking hookers and those that work for private agencies .
There are several myths that surround Escort and Modeling Agencies and I ’ll try to dispel a few - and add some facts many of you never knew .
There are several types of customers , but the majority are businessmen who work their butts off all week , do n’t care for the bar scene , and have the money to spend on a well - educated woman who can hold an interesting conversation as well as satisfy their sexual needs without trolling the local bars and coming - up empty handed , or even worse , catching something that Ajax Cleanser wo n’t rub off !
Generally speaking , these customers are rather mundane in their sexual needs and many appear to enjoy the company almost as much as the sex - which is evidenced by multiple hour calls that often are filled with as much conversation as they are sex .
In the 1980 ’s , these ladies worked for $ 150 - $ 500 per hour , and that did n’t count the agency fee .
Almost half of the business was conducted by Credit cards , for special customers checks , and the rest in cash .
The customer I ’m describing here might be the owner of your local auto parts store , an executive in a large business , a local sales manager , or even your Doctor , Attorney , and sometimes , even the clergy !
The next category is the couple , and that might mean your next door neighbors !
There is an enormous business in sending out a single woman to a couple , often the birthday present of a wife to a husband , or visa versa , and these too sometimes become regulars - especially those that are prominent citizens who wo n’t involve themselves in the local swinger scene because of fear of being “ outed . ”
Again , average Middle - to upper - class couples that are simply looking for some excitement in their sex lives , and as common in the industry as hooks are to a fisherman !
So far , nothing abnormal or different , but there are a couple of other type of regular customers , and each of these may surprise those who have never delved into the inner workings of human sexuality .
The power - brokers , CEO ’s , Executives that supervise large numbers of employees , politicians , the “ movers and shakers ” in our country to be exact - and with that power , these are some of the kinkiest customers any agency will serve !
This is where the Dominatrix is often requested and ones that have always kept me scratching my head …
When I fist became associated with the business , this is the customer that I envisioned that because of their wealth and power , would order multiple women at a time and basically , party their butts - off , but did I have a surprise coming !
Perhaps it ’s a feeling of guilt on how they treat their employees , manage people ’s money , or serve their constituents , but invariably , these are the customers that request to be humiliated , whipped , defecated upon and a host of weird vices I wo n’t mention on an open - blog , and believe me , they have to pay big money for their dive into perversity - and they do , time and time again .
They never seem to tire of being abused , and are the one type of customer that seems to keep going deeper into the nether - land of sexual diversity and perversion .
I have always found a bit of humor in these power - brokers that are as twisted as a piece of licorice , and so can you if you ’ll try this the next time your boss is taking - out his anger and frustration on you ; while he ’s ranting and raving and chewing your butt , form an image in your mind and picture him in rubber undergarments , being led around on his hands and knees by a leash with a red - rubber ball stuck firmly in his mouth …
If that does n’t offer you a bit of solace , then nothing will !
( I ’m not implying that all of these “ power - brokers ” are sexually oriented in this manner , however , this is where the majority of these types of calls emanate from . )
The last category of customer is the one I ’ve always worried about , and these are the serious weird - o’s that make a lady stop by the grocery store on the way to the call , pick - up cucumbers and other similar vegetables - and use them on their customers when the call begins .
I do n’t believe a further explanation is necessary ; however , the calls that border on the bizarre worry me - not because they call escort agencies , but because I wonder what happens to these individuals when the source of their pleasure is shut - down by the police , or they simply run out of money .
Like anyone else that does n’t understand a particular idiosyncrasy , when it ’s especially bizarre , I have to wonder what these individuals do when they are without whatever it is that makes them tick - but ones mans pleasure is another ’s pain , so I suppose I do n’t have the right to be judgmental - but even the ladies shy away from and charge unusually high fees for these types of customers .
The grocery store scenario was only an example , and honestly , one of the tamest ones I could place in print .
This is an extremely brief look into the world of Escort and Modeling agencies , otherwise known as prostitution rings , and to properly address the issue , it would take an entire book - and even then , unless it weighed thirty pounds and was 5,000 pages I doubt if we could cover all of the aspects of the sex industry and delve into the psychology and human nature that make it one of the largest illegal money - making enterprises in America .
I do n’t believe it should be illegal ; what consenting adults do in the privacy of their homes or hotels should be their business , not that of the body politic .
We seem to have forgotten that many individuals with higher intelligence who are self - motivated - and in reality often guide the core businesses of our country and sometimes the governments itself are often those with unusually high sex drives .
Unfortunately , it ’s the nature of the beast .
Some of our best Presidents were promiscuous and before the advent of electronic surveillance and cameras on every corner - governed this country with memorable Presidencies , and some of those men were among the most admired Presidents on record .
As the religious - right attempts to press their will on the entire country , it ’s notable they too are often “ ousted ” for the same type of behavior that Governor Spitzer engaged in , and as usual , many times it ’s those who shout the loudest that have the most to hide .
The United States is a highly diverse , sexually charged nation .
Many , if not most of our high - profile commercials flaunt beautiful , scantily clad women , and it ’s also prevalent in our movies and even prime - time television shows .
What we see on a daily basis is sex , sex , sex , and at night , if you turn to Fox , you ’ll find some of the most provocative , sexually charged adult late - night programming from a network that continually harps on the “ lack of values ” in modern day America .
We are a nation that says one thing and does another , unwilling to accept that sex is the second - most powerful human instinct we possess other than the will to survive - and rather than learning to understand an issue that has been with society since the beginning of time , we still live in the dark ages of suppressing our own desires in public , and when we believe no one is looking , revert back to the instinctive human beings that actually is more representative of humanity than the morals which are placed upon us that are so archaic - even those that makes the “ rules ” are usually in the lead of breaking them !
When they are caught they tell us all “ how sorry ” they are , when in reality , they are only sorry they stood for something they could n’t live with themselves and must now suffer the consequences of attempting to live a lie which they never truly believed in themselves .

marvels
I was in Vermont over the weekend and talking to a dairy farmer about the rising price of milk .
I was surprised when she said that higher sawdust prices was one of the causes .
Sawdust ?
Sawdust , it turns out , is used for bedding the cows and the price of dust has doubled in the past year .
I surmise that the downturn in housing construction has meant a reduced demand for lumber and thus less sawdust .
at the marvelous way that markets for seemingly unrelated products interact and overlap : I found the information about sawdust surprising , as well as the fact that milk prices had gone up .
Despite my economic training , I 'm terrible at checking prices at the grocery .
Mr Tabarrok then goes a bit too far in his market evangelism :
The economics of sawdust also reminds us that the capitalist production system minimizes waste - entrepreneurs search out ways to extract the most value from every input and from every output .
Thus even sawdust , as trivial a waste product as one could imagine , is turned into an input into milk production as well as into particle board , fuel nuggets , mulch and other useful products .
The capitalist production system is excellent at minimising waste products for which it has found a profitable use .
It is the case , however , that landfills remain full to the brim with rubbish of all kinds .
And of course , markets gladly spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , despite the threat such waste poses to the world .
The solution is to place a value on waste products , such that markets have an incentive to do with carbon or rubbish what they currently do with sawdust .
But beware — while the interconnectedness of markets will ensure that pricing carbon at the source will result in efficient emission reductions , the policy could redound in surprising ways .
The carbon cost of lumber might be high , for instance , leading to new construction technologies that emphasise brick or synthetic materials .
Then sawdust might be in permanent short supply , leading to new constraints on milk producers .
But I 'm confident that the markets will sort it all out , provided that the right institutional framework is in place .
I have updated my most popular graph Average Income in the United States .
It now includes data through 2006 ( in 2006 $ ) .

Overestimating Threats Against Children
This is a great essay by a mom who let her 9 - year - old son ride the New York City subway alone :
No , I did not give him a cell phone .
Did n’t want to lose it .
And no , I did n’t trail him , like a mommy private eye .
I trusted him to figure out that he should take the Lexington Avenue subway down , and the 34th Street crosstown bus home .
If he could n’t do that , I trusted him to ask a stranger .
And then I even trusted that stranger not to think , “ Gee , I was about to catch my train home , but now I think I ’ll abduct this adorable child instead . ”
Long story short :
My son got home , ecstatic with independence .
Long story longer , and analyzed , to boot :
Half the people I ’ve told this episode to now want to turn me in for child abuse .
As if keeping kids under lock and key and helmet and cell phone and nanny and surveillance is the right way to rear kids .
It ’s not .
It ’s debilitating — for us and for them .
It ’s amazing how our fears blind us .
The mother and son appeared on The Today Show , where they both continued to explain why it was n’t an unreasonable thing to do :
And that was Skenazy ’s point in her column :
The era is long past when Times Square was a fetid sump and taking a walk in Central Park after dark was tantamount to committing suicide .
Recent federal statistics show New York to be one of the safest cities in the nation — right up there with Provo , Utah , in fact .
“ Times are back to 1963 , ” Skenzay said .
“ It ’s safe .
It ’s a great time to be a kid in the city . ”
The problem is that people read about children who are abducted and murdered and fear takes over , she said .
And she does n’t think fear should rule our lives .
Of course , The Today Show interviewer did n’t get it :
Dr. Ruth Peters , a parenting expert and TODAY
Show contributor , agreed that children should be allowed independent experiences , but felt there are better — and safer — ways to have them than the one Skenazy chose .
“ I ’m not so much concerned that he ’s going to be abducted , but there ’s a lot of people who would rough him up , ” she said .
“ There ’s some bullies and things like that .
He could have gotten the same experience in a safer manner . ”
“ It ’s safe to go on the subway , ” Skenazy replied .
“ It ’s safe to be a kid .
It ’s safe to ride your bike on the streets .
We ’re like brainwashed because of all the stories we hear that it is n’t safe .
But those are the exceptions .
That ’s why they make it to the news .
This is like , ‘ Boy boils egg . ’
He did something that any 9 - year - old could do . ”
Here ’s an audio interview with Skenazy .
I am reminded of this great graphic depicting childhood independence diminishing over four generations .

We are all feeling the prices at the pump and the ramifications of increased oil prices throughout our economy , so why are the big oil companies still making record profits ?
Not only are these big oil companies reaping in record amounts of money while consumers suffer , they are also still receiving federal subsidies .
What ’s up with that ?
Personally , I do n’t understand how the oil companies can justify passing the entire burden off on the American people of the rising cost of gasoline considering our current economic recession .
Exxon Mobil Corp. , BP America Inc. , Shell Oil Co. , Chevron Corp. , and ConocoPhillip know high fuel prices are hurting consumers , but on Tuesday they defended their profits of $ 123 billion last year as in line with other industries .
“ Our earnings , though high in absolute terms , need to be viewed in the context of the scale and cyclical , long - term nature of our industry as well as the huge investment requirements , ” said J.S. Simon , Exxon Mobil ’s senior vice president .
“ On April Fool ’s Day , the biggest joke of all is being played on American families by Big Oil , ” said Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass .
Markey wants oil companies to invest 10 percent of their profits to develop renewable energy , as well as relinquish up to $ 18 billion in tax breaks over 10 years .
This money would then be used to support renewable energy and conservation .
The oil companies ’ response to this proposal is that they have already spent $ 3.5 billion over the last five years on renewable fuels , and they reject any tax increases .
That may be , but it has n’t been enough , or all of our cars would be getting at least 50 mpg .
Without government intervention , the oil companies will continue to gouge the American consumer while making record profits .
“ These companies are defending billions of federal subsidies … while reaping over a hundred billion dollars in profits in just the last year alone , ” stated Markey , chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
The House of Representatives has already approved legislation that will end tax breaks for big oil , while using this revenue to support wind , solar and other renewable fuels .
The Senate has yet to pass this legislation .
According to AP writer H. Josef Herbert , “ Recently oil prices reached a peak of $ 111 a barrel .
While declining a bit in recent days , the price remains above $ 100 and there ’s talk of $ 4 a gallon gasoline in the coming months . ”
Oh yes , the threat of $ 4 a gallon ; I paid $ 3.99 a gallon today .
I have always felt that American gas prices were too low prior to the Bush administration — that these prices did not adequately reflect the value of this limited resource .
Now that we are experiencing high gas prices , I ca n’t help but wonder what I am paying for when oil companies are making record profits and the “ supplies of both gasoline and oil seemed to be adequate . ”
I would n’t mind paying the current price for gasoline if the oil companies ’ profits were slashed in order to bring about new developments and change in American energy use .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
All the actions the Federal Reserve has taken in recent months to fuel the economy with cash and credit have n't impressed many MarketWatch readers , who instead lament the fall of interest rates and the value of the dollar at a time when everyday household expenses are on a steady rise .
In response to our request for readers to tell the Federal Reserve what their worries were , there was a bevy of stories about how families were dipping into savings to pay bills or finding themselves with little money left for food and clothing .
" Worried about rising health insurance , higher local taxes , higher transportation costs , higher food , tuition , energy costs , " BobP863 wrote .
" I 'm worried that everything I need is going up .
Meanwhile , my savings will be going down . "
Querin was more succinct : " I am worried about three things : Inflation , inflation and inflation . "
Indeed , a common thread throughout most of the nearly 200 postings was that the Federal Reserve screwed up by again lowering interest rates , which devalues the dollar and hits Americans living on interest payments particularly hard .
See the original story with comments .
" What 's the Master Plan to prop up the economy once the interest rates are at ZERO ??
Huh , " asked NDL .
" And how are we attempting to stem the destruction of the value of the dollar ???
Huh ?
This Fed really worries me ! "
Many readers were incensed by the series of aggressive steps the Fed has taken , ranging from extending credit through the so - called discount window to commercial and investment banks to lowering short - term interest rates to 2.25 % .
They also took issue with the Fed 's bailout of Bear Stearns .
" What really worries me is that our entire economy is being held together with smoke and mirrors , " Tburcher wrote .
" Congress spends money like drunker sailors ( my apologies to any sailors ) and now they 're talking about raising more taxes so they can make us pay for their excesses . "
" The Fed uses back - door methods to bail out their rich friends through the auspices of low - interest loans and subsidized purchase , all the while using those loans to buy assets up for pennies on the dollar and then uses our money to finance the entire thing , " Tburcher added .
Discount window for you and me
Some believe that the Fed , which has the ability to print money when more is needed , should open its main lending facility , the discount window , to regular folks , too , not just to investment banks .
Rsmith1 , for example , vowed to improve the housing crisis if the Fed opened the discount window to him .
" I promise to buy up homes and help drive prices back up . "
Others offered examples of their beliefs that the Fed 's aid is helping the greedy stay , well , greedy .
" I have a friend who works in a private - equity firm on Wall Street , " Livebeneathyourmeans wrote .
" She said to me yesterday , ' No matter what happens , we wo n't lose . '
It 's about time we take a good look at the robber barons on Wall Street and their shadow banking system that only makes the rich richer .
Greed is what has essentially caused all of this mess . "
There were supporters who believed that the Fed and the government can get all of America out of this self - created mess .
" I think that to a degree , they can help , " HBBInvestmentFund said .
" They cannot , as some suggest , bail out our economy .
But , they can take steps ( like providing funds directly to investment banks ... and lowering interest rates on overnight loans ) to help banks work more efficiently . "
" The saying goes , ' banks drag the economy into recession , and banks pull the economy back up out of recession , ' " HBBInvestmentFund added .
" The more liquidity our banks have , the better they will be able to capitalize worldwide , and the stronger upper - hand they will have worldwide . "
Saving for nothing
Other readers were quick to point to what they believed was the dichotomy between the Fed 's actions and the government 's calls -- not to mention that of most financial advisors -- to put aside money at a time when the savings rates in the U.S. have dipped into negative territory .
" Your actions only hurt the hard - working savers and help the leeches in banking , " Limerock wrote .
" The bankers get lower rates to pass out toxic paper , while the savers are rewarded with lower interest . "
" This sends a clear message to the savers -- do n't , " Limerock added .
" Will there be enough newly printed debt to bail us regular folk out too ? "
And here 's what Bobcc had to say :
" Talking about a double standard , the Feds are playing a dangerous game with our money by cutting the interest rates to a level useless to all savers .
When you pay the taxes and subtract the inflation we are losing at least 4 % on our saved money as of now . "
" What good is the $ 600 stimulus check that I will receive , when I already lost at least $ 6,000 in interest from savings accounts . "
What about credit - card rates ?
Teyha1961 questioned whether the Fed " ever fixed anything " and offered up at least one suggestion to mend the credit - card mess .
" How about we pass a law stating that credit - card interest rates cap at 10 % ?
By jove , what a novel idea !!
That alone would get us out of a recession .
Does anyone realize that all this interest is going to banks , who interest - rate us to death and then scream , " Bailout ! ! ! "
Teyha1961 added that the family 's personal financial status is OK , " as long as nobody gets sick , nobody breaks a leg , nobody loses a job , and we eat at home and do n't drive our cars anywhere . "
Some readers took the opportunity to pat themselves on the back for their prescience .
Goldstandard is in a jovial mood despite all this dreariness and not worried one bit .
" Saw the handwriting on the wall five years ago and loaded up on physical gold and silver .
As the dollar continues to plunge and more worthless dollars are produced , I 'm laughing all the way to the bank . "
" Too bad all the great talking financial heads never got around to telling the investing public where they should have been investing five years ago , " Goldstandard added .
" But not to worry , the generational bull market in all commodities has many years left to make its mark as well as millionaires .
Jim Rogers was right !
The Federal Reserve should be abolished . "

The withdrawal of US troops is a key issue in the presidential campaign
There were no real surprises in the recommendations of US Gen David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker on what is next for Iraq .
It was simply a confirmation for the three presidential hopefuls , and a particularly frustrating one for the Democrats , that the Iraq war will loom large over the start of the next presidency , whoever wins the race for the White House .
The testimonies of the US's two top officials in Baghdad were essentially turned into a campaign stop for the three candidates , who tried to show off their skills as commander - in - chief and audition for the role president of the United States .
Republican Senator John McCain and Democrat Hillary Clinton , who are both on the Senate 's armed services committee , came first .
Barack Obama , who sits on the foreign relations committee , had to wait for his turn much later in the day .
Each candidate used the opportunity to repeat and highlight the key points of their strategy .
Hillary Clinton called for the start of an " orderly " withdrawal from Iraq , Mr Obama suggested a diplomatic surge that would involve talking to Iran and John McCain warned against a withdrawal that would lead to " genocide " .
There were no surprise announcements there either , but observers scrutinised the performance of the candidates as they also tried to score points against each other .
Tepid debate Mr McCain 's intervention was partly a veiled attack against his two Democratic rivals because of their call for troop withdrawals .
President Bush has an exit strategy for just one man - himself on 20 January , 2009
Harry Reid
Democratic Senate Majority leader Senator Clinton picked up on it , when her turn came , saying it was not true to say " it is irresponsible or demonstrates a lack of leadership to advocate a withdrawal in a responsible and carefully planned manner " .
By the time she spoke though , Mr McCain had already left the Senate .
Overall , though , US media coverage of the candidates appeared mostly factual , almost tepid - perhaps because the senators themselves gave very little in terms of fodder to be picked over .
But media coverage also underscored that while Iraq will be a headache for the next president , it is sinking as a priority for the American public as the US faces a possible recession .
All three candidates appeared sombre , poised and respectful of the US 's top commander in Iraq - the Democrats were particularly keen not to appear as unpatriotic or undermining US troops fighting abroad .
Senator Clinton , who looked tired , was much more reserved than during the last Iraq hearing in September 2007 , when she told Gen Petraeus that his report required the " suspension of disbelief " .
End point
In their line of questioning , the three senators tried to show they understood the problems and had a plan to fix it .
Mr Obama was , in some ways , the most pointed when his turn came in the Senate 's foreign relations committee hearing late on Tuesday afternoon .
Gen Petraeus said the situation in Iraq was still unsatisfactory
He spoke the longest of all three and tried hard to draw Gen Petraeus into defining what exactly defined success .
His argument centred around the idea that it was probably not possible to completely eliminate the influence of Iran and al - Qaeda in Iraq - so what goals was the US setting for itself in Iraq to quantify success ?
" If ... our criteria is a messy , sloppy status quo but there 's not , you know , huge outbreaks of violence , there 's still corruption , but the country is struggling along , but it 's not a threat to its neighbours and it's not an al - Qaeda base , that seems to me an achievable goal within a measurable timeframe , " he said .
He added , in what was described by the Washington Post as the quote of the day - " I 'm trying to get to an end point , that 's what all of us are trying to get to . "
The frustration about Iraq , was a recurrent theme in the Democratic camp .
" We are stuck in a twilight zone in Iraq , " said Democratic Senate Majority leader Harry Reid .
" When violence is up , the president says we can not bring our troops home .
" When violence dips , the president says we can not bring our troops home .
With 160,000 courageous American troops serving in Iraq , President Bush has an exit strategy for just one man - himself on 20 January , 2009 . "
Stable foundation
It is likely that when he speaks on Thursday , President Bush will back the recommendations of Gen Petraeus to pause the withdrawal of any more troops after the surge troops return home - that would leave around 140,000 US troops in Iraq for the next president to look after .
We 're a generous people but our patience is not unlimited
John Barrasso ,
Republican senator
The Bush administration 's Iraq position has fuelled some accusations that it is trying to tie the hands of the next administration , and there have been concerns about the long term agreement of principles and status of forces agreement that the US and Iraq are discussing at the moment .
" The agreement will not establish permanent bases in Iraq and we anticipate that it will expressly foreswear them , " said Ambassador Crocker during his testimony .
" The agreement will not specify troops levels and it will not tie the hands of the next administration .
Our aim is to ensure that the next president arrives in office with a stable foundation upon which to base policy decision and that is precisely what this agreement will do . "
Limited patience Unable to change the current policy on troop presence in Iraq , Democrats are looking for other ways to influence the course of things .
A lot of the questions during the hearing were related to the cost of the war - currently estimated at $ 10 bn ( £ 5 bn ) a month - and the burden this constitutes for the American taxpayer .
The reconstruction of Iraq also relies heavily on US money , while Iraqi oil revenues are growing , with a surplus estimated at $ 30bn in US banks according to Senator Carl Levin , a Democrat and chairman of the armed services committee .
Democrats want to try to push legislation that would force Iraq to spend those revenues on reconstruction and in that there seems to be unusual bi-partisan agreement .
Republican senators also asked why the Iraqis were not using more of their own money .
Republican Senator John Barrasso from Wyoming said : " We 're a generous people but our patience is not unlimited . "

Unfortunately , this year it looks like we ’re not going to be able to count on a nice drop in gasoline prices during the fall and winter .
With crude oil futures sitting at $ 90 a barrel and demand for both oil and gasoline going nowhere but up , it looks as if gasoline may test the $ 3 per gallon mark within the coming weeks or months .
Since the $ 3 mark is usually reserved for the summer ’s peak driving season and has n’t ever happened during the winter months , we could very easily be setting ourselves up for $ 4 gasoline by the time May comes rolling around .
No matter what you do , increased gasoline prices are going to affect you in some way .
While the price increase may hurt some more than others , the fact remains that we ’re all going to have to become accustomed to the fact that the days of cheap gas ( and energy in general ) are in the rear view mirror .
That being said , there are plenty of things you can do to help minimize the effect of higher gasoline prices and allow you to do your part to help save the environment .
Thankfully , most of these things are pretty common sense and can be integrated very easily into your regular “ driving routine , ” so much so that it should n’t take long for these habits to become second nature .
So , without further ado , here are the Top Ten Ways to Reduce Your Gasoline Consumption :
Do n’t drive if you do n’t have to ( see , I told you these were pretty common sense ) .
Think about it , how many small , wasted trips do you take each week where you drive less than a mile or two ?
If you ’re going to the grocery store to do some major shopping it ’s certainly understandable to bring your car , but if you ’re just going to pick up a couple items , why not walk or ride your bike ?
Same can be said for trips to friends ’ houses , driving the kids to school , etc. , etc .
Moral of the story : if you do n’t drive you do n’t use gas .
If you do have to drive , minimize the amount of time you sit in idle .
Here ’s a pretty easy general rule of thumb to remember : if you ’re car ’s running and you ’re not moving , your gas mileage has dropped to zero mpg .
I know for many of this , this is probably easier said than done , especially considering it ’s pretty tough to avoid the daily rush hour traffic .
However , if you find yourself stuck at a stoplight or know that it ’s going to be a minute or two before you get moving again , turn off your car ( assuming it ’s safe to do so ) .
Essentially , it takes about ten seconds worth of idling to use as much gasoline as it would to restart your car ; this means if you ’re going to be sitting at a stoplight for a minute or two , it ’s best to shut the car off and save gasoline .
When you finally get the car moving , make sure to use a nice , steady and moderate acceleration .
A heavy foot means you ’re going to get pretty bad gas mileage .
Essentially , you ’re making the car ’s engine work much harder than necessary , and in order to get the required energy to quickly get up to speed , it ’s going to need to burn more gasoline .
However , you also do n’t want to accelerate so slowly that you bog down the engine , as this will reduce your gas mileage as well .
Nice and steady wins the race .
Now that you ’re up to cruising speed , try to stay at or near the speed limit .
While the optimal speed for gas mileage is going to vary by make and model , it ’s a pretty good rule of thumb that the fast you go , especially at highway speeds , the worse gas mileage you ’re going to get .
According to FuelEconomy.gov , driving over the speed limit at highway speeds will reduce your vehicle ’s gas mileage by between seven and 23 percent .
When it ’s all said and done , that adds up to a lot of wasted gasoline and a lot of wasted money .
When driving , keep your eyes down the road and coast whenever possible .
By constantly tapping your brakes or accelerating up to stoplights or stop signs , all you ’re doing is needlessly burning fuel .
By being on and off the brakes , you ’re wasting the energy ( i.e. burned fuel ) it took to get up to speed and then you ’ll need to burn more fuel to get back up to speed .
By accelerating up to stoplights and stop signs , again , you ’re using energy that you know you really do n’t need .
If you give yourself plenty of room between the cars in front of you , you should have no problem seeing what the conditions are like ahead of you , which will allow you to do plenty of coasting and help you avoid brake tapping and needless accelerating .
Keep your car as aerodynamic as possible ; the more aerodynamic your car is ( meaning the less drag that ’s put on it ) the better your gas mileage is going to be .
This means you should drive with the windows up ( more on that in a second ) , the sunroof closed and keep any extemporaneous items ( car top carrier , sports team flags , etc. ) in the vehicle .
Obviously , there are going to be times when it ’s warm in the car , you need some air flow and the vent alone just is n’t going to cut it .
Now you ’ve got to make the choice between rolling down the windows or turning on the air conditioning .
If you ’re traveling less than 35 mph , you should probably go ahead and just roll down the windows , as there should n’t be too much drag on your car .
However , once you start traveling above 35 mpg and approach highway speeds , you should keep the windows up and turn on the AC .
Regardless of which one you chose , you ’re going to reduce your vehicle ’s gas mileage , but by following this rule of thumb you can help minimize the effects .
Before you get out on the road , make sure that your car ’s tires are properly inflated .
Think of it this way ; have you ever tried to ride a bike that had under inflated tires ?
It took a lot more work to get up to and maintain speed , did n’t it ?
Same thing goes for your car ; under inflated tires will essentially reduce your car ’s gas mileage by two to three percent .
While that may not seem like much , this might – if every driver in the United States improved their vehicle ’s gas mileage by 2 % , we would save nearly 3 billion gallons of gasoline each year .
Replace your car ’s dirty air filter .
Driving around with a dirty or clogged air filter can reduce your vehicle ’s gas mileage by up to ten percent , which at today ’s prices , is the equivalent of adding about 28 cents to each gallon of gasoline you buy .
It probably takes less than ten minutes to change the filter and will probably set you back less than 20 dollars , so there ’s really no excuse to not get this done .
Get all of the useless and needless items out of your car .
As a general rule of thumb , for every extra 100 pounds you carry around in your car , you reduce its gas mileage by one to two percent ; and if you want to get into the minutiae of it , for every extra pound you carry around in your car , you reduce its gas mileage by 1/100th to 1/50th of a percent .
So , now that it ’s fall , get the golf clubs out of the trunk of your car and maybe with the money you ’ll save on gas , you can splurge and buy the big bucket of balls at the driving range .
Now that you ’ve been armed with some pretty easy and simple ways to save gas and maximize your vehicle ’s gas mileage , I ’d like to suggest that you print out this article and leave a copy in your car as a reminder to try your best to reduce your gasoline consumption .
In the end , both your bank account and the environment will thank you for it .
LONDON --
The British government , pressed for solutions to soaring fuel prices , said it will exempt about 30 existing North Sea crude - oil and natural - gas fields from some taxes and approved the development of two new North Sea oil fields , which could begin production in early 2009 .
But the measures , announced as U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling met with U.K. oil - industry executives to explore ways to increase oil and gas production , seemed unlikely to significantly alter Britain's ...
Three Ways to Escape Confusion and Take Control
Out of Control ?
Are you in control of your life ?
Life is wonderful , and dangerous and unpredictable .
Sure , you pretend that you have everything under control .
But you know that ’s not true .
Pretending to be in control makes you feel safe .
And everyone wants to feel safe .
It ’s hard to think about personal growth , enjoying life , or anything else , when you do n’t feel safe .
The problem is that most of the world is completely beyond your control .
You ’re surrounded by possibility , and asked to make hundreds of choices on what to buy , what to do , and what media to listen to .
And most of these choices do n’t matter at all .
Seven Ways That Choice Fouls Up Your Life
In Parts 1 and 2 of this series we discussed 7 ways in which choice can become a burden and foul up our lives :
More products , more choices , more effort :
You feel that today ’s world with endless options and endless choices , so many of them about trivial things , are an unfair burden that is stealing your time and life from you Expert Choices :
In a world of overbearing choice , sometimes we ’re encouraged to make choices that we do n’t have the expertise to make , and sometimes these are life and death medical choices
You are Your Choices :
You use your choices to define who you are .
Today , you have more and more choices that seem to express who you are .
But endless trivial choices can’t really say anything about you .
It ’s easy to lose track of who you really are Negative Media Rules the World :
We naturally give more weight to sensational and negative information , and the media uses it to steal our attention .
And the more we hear something the more we think it ’s real .
We have more and more media in our lives , more and more information choices that offer no choice at all .
We ’re being buried in the negative Missed Opportunities and Regret : Every choice that you make leaves some possibility behind , and leads you to regret your choice The Curse of Comparison :
When you encounter more and more options , the urge to compare yourself with others can drive you to want more and more , and doom you to be forever unsatisfied Control and Blame :
In a world of increasing possibility , there ’s more and more that you can’t have , and ca n’t control .
If you blame yourself for this , and look at the situation as your failure , this can take you down the dark road of depression .
We ’ll look at 7 ways to lighten that burden , and focus our energy on what matters in our lives .
In this article we ’ll look at the first three .
The First Way : Decide what ’s important to you
Do some inner exploration and figure out what you want out of life – the things that make you feel alive , not the 9 to 5 maintenance stuff .
Demand the truth from yourself .
It ’s sometimes hard to tell the difference between the things that you really want , and the things that your friends and the media tell you to want .
See if you can split up your world into four buckets : maintenance ( the things you have to do to survive whether you like them or not , like eating or sleeping ) , must have ( things that you can live without , but you ’d feel like you were missing part of yourself ) , nice to have ( pleasant and fun stuff that spices up your life ) , and filler activities ( does n’t matter much whether you do them or not ) .
Be thoughtful about what tasks you really have to do for maintenance .
You want to shrink this area as much as possible .
Understanding what parts of your life fall into each bucket is a great start to taking control of your life .
The follow - up step to understanding is to set goals that focus on the things that are important to you .
Plan your days so you grow the time you spend on your must haves as much possible .
Allow a dash of time for your nice to haves , and try to eliminate the fillers .
The maintenance and must have activities should occupy the bulk of your days , with only a little time set aside for the nice to haves .
The Second Way : Live the difference between important and trivial
After understanding and planning , comes action !
It ’s not enough to think through the parts of your life and classify them into the buckets .
You have to learn to see those categories as you take action throughout your day .
Now here ’s a really crucial point .
The same activity can be found in all four buckets , depending on what the activity is focused on .
For example , you can spend time on the Internet searching for critical information , must have information , nice to have information , or filler .
And it ’s easy to start these kinds of activities doing some maintenance activity ( like online bill pay ) , and end up just surfing around ( nice to have , or filler activity ) .
Purchases ( and the time spent deciding on a purchase ) can fall into any of the four categories .
Be honest with yourself about the kind of purchase you ’re after and limit the amount of time for a purchase decision for the less important categories .
You need the same honesty about all your choices and decisions .
Are you dealing with something trivial ?
Insist on making those choices quickly and easily , without stress .
When you allocate time in your day for exploring media , remember to give the bulk of that time to information sources which are n’t biased toward negative , sensational reporting about trivia .
When you ’re running errands ( particularly where at least one of them is important , and is the reason you went out to begin with ) , be careful of how much you time you let yourself take for the more trivial activities .
The Third Way : Laugh
Do n’t take the trivial stuff too seriously .
Make quick decisions about trivial things , and get on with the more important parts of your life .
( In the next article in this series we ’ll look at four more ways to take control of your life . )
The British government might be useless at keeping our data safe , but the outgoing Italian government has gone one better - it has published the tax details of every single Italian on a website and made them available to anyone interested .
The Italian revenue deliberately published the information in an effort to increase transparency and reduce tax evasion .
But the plug was pulled on the scheme yesterday as Italian privacy and consumer groups reacted with outrage .
The Italian tax office published names , addresses , dates of birth , declared income , and tax paid .
Which sounds to us like enough information to engage in a serious bit of identity theft .
The director of the tax office , Massimo Romano , told news agency ANSA the move was " in the public interest in order to allow the free circulation of information in a framework of transparency " .
He also claimed the action was in line with privacy guidelines .
But the privacy watchdog was not so sure - it ordered the site closed immediately for breaking Italian privacy laws .
Beppe Grillo , an Italian comedian and politician , pointed out the information would be useful for kidnapping because ransom demands will be in line with people 's incomes , and burglars will target the correct homes because they will have accurate income information .
Grillo said on his blog that tax evaders have nothing to fear from the scheme .
He said : " Paying taxes like that is too dangerous .
It would be better to have a conviction for tax evasion than to be knifed or kidnapped . "
The decision was one of the last actions of the outgoing centre - left government led by Romano Prodi .
He has been replaced by Silvio Berlusconi . ®
CARACAS ( Reuters ) -
In a political take on a popular Easter ritual , hundreds of Venezuelans cheered at the burning of an “ Judas ” effigy symbolizing oil giant Exxon Mobil , which last week lost a battle with the South American nation .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
With a pink face , sculpted hair and wearing a pair of aviator - style sunglasses , the model packed with fireworks was hoisted up a pole and set ablaze with a flaming torch on Sunday while African - inspired dancers swayed to fast drum rhythms .
Pinned to the effigy ’s gasoline - soaked two piece suit a sign read “ Mister Exxon . ”
A British judge last Tuesday lifted a $ 12 billion freeze on Venezuelan assets awarded to Exxon , dealing a blow to the oil giant in its fight with the OPEC nation over President Hugo Chavez ’s nationalization crusade .
“ They under - estimated our country , ” said Jorge Loaisa , 67 , who headed a committee that organized Sunday ’s event in the Caracas neighborhood El Cementerio , which was sponsored by the mayor of Caracas , an ally of the socialist Chavez .
It was part of a widespread Venezuelan Holy Week tradition where mainly poor neighborhoods burn effigies to represent Judas Iscariot , who the Bible says betrayed Jesus Christ .
The effigies are often modeled on political figures .
In shanty - town neighborhoods across the capital , a carnival atmosphere prevailed as youths scrambled up greasy poles for cash prizes , and children ran egg - and - spoon races to loud salsa and reggaeton music .
Judas effigies are burnt in villages and towns in several Latin American countries and in parts of Greece .
Anthropologists say the practice serves a symbolic function to overcome divisions and unite communities around a common enemy .
The tradition has sometimes been described as anti-Semitic .
High above Caracas in the hilltop shantytown of San Miguel , residents burnt a bearded Judas with glass eyes that some said represented retired Cuban President Fidel Castro .
Others said the model symbolized nothing more than the Biblical figure .
“ Here we do n’t stick our nose in political matters , in bad things , this is just a beautiful party for ourselves , ” said lifetime San Miguel resident William Sulbaran , 57 .
Oh , here I am .

Mr Tsvangirai says he won the presidential poll
The party of Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe has failed to regain its parliamentary majority after a partial recount of votes from polls last month .
Zimbabwe 's Electoral Commission said results were unchanged in 18 of 23 seats where recounts had taken place .
Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF needed to win nine seats to regain its majority , lost for the first time since 1980 .
The opposition MDC says it also won presidential polls , although those results remain unreleased .
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC ) said the presidential results could be announced after the completion of the recounts , expected by Monday .
But ZEC Chairman George Chiweshe said a " verification and collation " process would take place with agents of the presidential candidates before the long - awaited results were released .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It is obvious that Mugabe has lost the presidency Brian , Kuala Lumpur MDC spokesman Nqobizitha Mlilo told the BBC the recount results " only serve to confirm what we 've always said in the past , that ... we won this election hands down " .
Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga told AFP news agency that the recount results showed the electoral system was " transparent " .
Opposition activists had feared the recount would be used to rig the results .
Opposition arrests
The BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg says the protracted recount of votes has given Zanu - PF a lot of extra time in which to decide how to deal with what the opposition says is a defeat for Robert Mugabe .
The MDC says its leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , won the presidential election outright , while independent monitors say he fell just short of the 50 % threshold to avoid a run-off .
The MDC has alleged a government campaign of intimidation Zanu - PF also says there is likely to be a run-off , as no candidate gained more than 50 % of the vote .
The government has been accused of inciting an increasing campaign of violence against opposition supporters .
Lawyers have told the BBC they have been denied access to about 185 MDC supporters still in custody after raids on the opposition party 's Harare office and the headquarters of an independent monitoring network on Friday .
Police said they had initially arrested 215 people suspected of involvement in political violence .
But the MDC said some of those detained had been taking refuge from attacks by ruling party activists in other parts of the country , and told the Associated Press news agency they included pregnant women and men with broken bones .
Reports said none of those arrested had been charged .
' Worsening violence '
The same day , the US - based group Human Rights Watch said Zanu - PF and state security forces had " sharply intensified a campaign of organised terror and torture against opposition activists and ordinary Zimbabweans " .
The MDC says at least ten of its activists have been killed around the country , although the police and Zanu - PF say no - one has died in political violence .
On Saturday , a group of churches in the second city of Bulawayo said it was opening its doors to " shelter the victims of harassment " .
US Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer , touring the region to tackle the post-election crisis , said the level of government intimidation in Zimbabwe was now so high that a fair run -off would not be possible .
She said the only solution was an inclusive government , led by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
Zimbabwe Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa called her comments " patently false , inflammatory , irresponsible and uncalled - for " .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was concerned about " worsening violence " in the country and pledged to step up diplomatic efforts at the UN Security Council in the coming days .
Four elections - presidential , House of Assembly , Senate and local councils - were held on 29 March .
In the House of Assembly , Zanu - PF won 97 seats , compared with 99 for the MDC plus another 10 for a smaller MDC faction .
It is the first time Mr Mugabe has lost control of the lower house of parliament in his 28 - year rule since independence in 1980 .
In the Senate , Zanu - PF and the combined opposition have 30 seats each .

The BBC's Kevin Connolly at the venue says there was an angry feeling among many of her supporters that Mr Obama only won because the complex rules of the Democratic Party process suited his campaign .
Mr Obama won enough delegates to effectively secure the nomination after the final primaries on Tuesday .
Intense speculation remains about who Mr Obama will choose as his running mate .
HAVE YOUR SAY I voted for Clinton and now I 'll be voting for McCain .
Obama 's campaign has been more wishy - washy than John Kerry 's ever was Marshall Craig , Dallas , Texas Mr Obama has announced a team to help him make his selection but has said he will not be rushed .
The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says that although the decision on the running mate is Mr Obama's , Mrs Clinton would also face a tough choice if offered it .
If she does not take it , our correspondent says , it may look as though she is not doing enough for Mr Obama , but if she accepts and Mr Obama loses she may be blamed for the defeat .
Meanwhile the Republicans have launched a " Clinton vs Obama " page on their party website drawing attention to her criticism of Mr Obama during the campaign .

What are these ?
McCain has missed every major environmental vote this Congress John Byrne

Print This Email This Wall Street Journal completely omits McCain voting record " Sen. McCain 's support of regulating global - warming gases like carbon dioxide -- the biggest environmental issue before Congress -- more closely resembles the stance of his Democratic rivals , Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton [ than President Bush ] , though he disagrees with them on how such regulations should be structured , " writes Monday 's Wall Street Journal .
" Besides championing legislation to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions , " the Journal adds , " Sen. McCain has opposed the administration 's call to open parts of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling , citing the refuge as a natural treasure on par with the Florida Everglades and the Grand Canyon in his home state of Arizona . "
The Journal paints McCain as a maverick among Republican rank and file on environmental issues , in an article that is best misleading .
While McCain has championed legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in his speeches , he has n't voted for it .
And while he 's opposed drilling in the Arctic , he also refused to support a ban on drilling in a 2005 defense appropriations bill .
The article also fails to mention that McCain ranks last among the 535 members of the current Congress in a rating by the League of Conservation Voters .
McCain has missed every major environmental vote this Congress , according to an analysis by the League .
His League lifetime record is just 24 percent .
This compares with 86 percent for Obama and 86 percent for Clinton .
Obama and Clinton ranked 67 and 73 percent in the League 's most recent report .
" McCain was the only member of Congress to skip every single crucial environmental vote scored by the organization , posting a score lower than Members of Congress who were out for much of the year due to serious illnesses and even lower than some who died during the term , " a release from the Sierra Club noted in February .
" He 's certainly better than Bush , and ... the average Republican senator " on environmental matters , but " dramatically worse than the average Republican governor , " Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club , told the Journal Monday .
" Pope said his organization might refrain from endorsing one presidential candidate over another this year because ' there is huge opportunity for all three of them still to grow . ' "
Strangely , the Journal used this quote to claim that the Sierra Club 's decision not to endorse anyone was instead " a sign of Sen.
McCain 's potential appeal to environmentally conscious voters . "
McCain touts himself as being out the Republican lockstep on the issue of climate change .
His record , however , is mixed -- and his current proposals and outspoken stance on climate change do n't entirely mesh with his voting record .
In December 2005 , McCain refused to block a provision to drill in Alaska 's National Wildlife refuge , saying it was n't appropriate to tack the measure onto a military spending bill in the time of war .
He 's cast votes against tightening fuel efficiency standards .
He 's resisted requiring public electric power utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources .
He 's also pushed aside Endangered Species
Act protections that conflict with other priorities of his in Arizona , such as the construction of a university observatory .
On the plus side , he 's worked to protect public lands in his home state .
In a February press release , Pope said : " We were appalled two weeks ago when John McCain was the only Senator who chose to skip a crucial vote on the future of clean energy in America - dooming the measure to fail by just a single vote .
As it turns out , this was merely the most recent example of a clear pattern of missing the most important votes on energy and the environment -- as his abysmal [ League of Conservation Voters ' ] score clearly demonstrates . "
McCain 's defenders disagree .
" Look , he always balances what are the environmental implications of these enterprises and what are the economic benefits that could come from them , " Doug Holtz - Eakin , a McCain policy advisor , told the Washington Post Monday .
" That is , in general , an approach which may be harder to read than a flat ideological X or Y , but it 's how he reads these things , it 's how he evaluates these kinds of decisions . "
" He stood up against the president of his own party , and the majority of members of his own party , " remarked Democrat - cum - Independent Senator Joe Lieberman .
" I think that makes him an environmental leader . "
All this may sound absurd , but it is the heart of a case that will be argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday .
In 1986 researchers filed a patent application for a method of testing the levels of homocysteine , an amino acid , in the blood .
They went one step further and asked for a patent on the basic biological relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency .
A patent was granted that covered both the test and the scientific fact .
Eventually , a company called Metabolite took over the license for the patent .
Although Metabolite does not have a monopoly on test methods  other companies make homocysteine tests , too  they assert licensing rights on the correlation of elevated homocysteine with vitamin deficiency .
A company called LabCorp used a different test but published an article mentioning the patented fact .
Metabolite sued on a number of grounds , and has won in court so far .
But what the Supreme Court will focus on is the nature of the claimed correlation .
On the one hand , courts have repeatedly held that basic bodily processes and " products of nature " are not patentable .
That 's why no one owns gravity , or the speed of light .
But at the same time , courts have granted so - called correlation patents for many years .
Powerful forces are arrayed on both sides of the issue .
In addition , there is the rather bizarre question of whether simply thinking about a patented fact infringes the patent .
The idea smacks of thought control , to say nothing of unenforceability .
It seems like something out of a novel by Philip K. Dick  or Kafka .
But it highlights the uncomfortable truth that the Patent Office and the courts have in recent decades ruled themselves into a corner from which they must somehow extricate themselves .
For example , the human genome exists in every one of us , and is therefore our shared heritage and an undoubted fact of nature .
Nevertheless 20 percent of the genome is now privately owned .
The gene for diabetes is owned , and its owner has something to say about any research you do , and what it will cost you .
The entire genome of the hepatitis C virus is owned by a biotech company .
Royalty costs now influence the direction of research in basic diseases , and often even the testing for diseases .
Such barriers to medical testing and research are not in the public interest .
Do you want to be told by your doctor , " Oh , nobody studies your disease any more because the owner of the gene / enzyme / correlation has made it too expensive to do research ? "
